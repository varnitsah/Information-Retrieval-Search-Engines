35740478	benitaan african romance  by h rider haggard         notes       it may interest readers of this story to know that its author      believes it to have a certain foundation in fact       it was said about fiveandtwenty or thirty years ago that an      adventurous trader hearing from some natives in the territory      that lies at the back of quilimane the legend of a great treasure      buried in or about the sixteenth century by a party of portuguese      who were afterwards massacred as a last resource attempted its      discovery by the help of a mesmerist according to this history      the child who was used as a subject in the experiment when in a      state of trance detailed the adventures and death of the unhappy      portuguese men and women two of whom leapt from the point of a      high rock into the zambesi although he knew no tongue but      english this clairvoyant child is declared to have repeated in      portuguese the prayers these unfortunates offered up and even to      have sung the very hymns they sang moreover with much other      detail he described the burial of the great treasure and its      exact situation so accurately that the white man and the mesmerist      were able to dig for and find the place where it had beenfor      the bags were gone swept out by the floods of the river       some gold coins remained however one of them a ducat of aloysius      mocenigo doge of venice afterwards the boy was again thrown into      a trance in all he was mesmerized eight times and revealed      where the sacks still lay but before the white trader could renew      his search for them the party was hunted out of the country by      natives whose superstitious fears were aroused barely escaping      with their lives       it should be added that as in the following tale the chief who      was ruling there when the tragedy happened declared the place to      be sacred and that if it were entered evil would befall his      tribe thus it came about that for generations it was never      violated until at length his descendants were driven farther from      the river by war and from one of them the white man heard the      legend     benitaan african romance     i  confidences  beautiful beautiful was that night no air that stirred the black smoke from the funnels of the mail steamer zanzibar lay low over the surface of the sea like vast floating ostrich plumes that vanished one by one in the starlight benita beatrix clifford for that was her full name who had been christened benita after her mother and beatrix after her fathers only sister leaning idly over the bulwark rail thought to herself that a child might have sailed that sea in a boat of bark and come safely into port  then a tall man of about thirty years of age who was smoking a cigar strolled up to her at his coming she moved a little as though to make room for him beside her and there was something in the motion which had anyone been there to observe it might have suggested that these two were upon terms of friendship or still greater intimacy for a moment he hesitated and while he did so an expression of doubt of distress even gathered on his face it was as though he understood that a great deal depended on whether he accepted or declined that gentle invitation and knew not which to do  indeed much did depend upon it no less than the destinies of both of them if robert seymour had gone by to finish his cigar in solitude why then this story would have had a very different ending or rather who can say how it might have ended the dread foredoomed event with which that night was big would have come to its awful birth leaving certain words unspoken violent separation must have ensued and even if both of them had survived the terror what prospect was there that their lives would again have crossed each other in that wide africa  but it was not so fated for just as he put his foot forward to continue his march benita spoke in her low and pleasant voice  are you going to the smokingroom or to the saloon to dance mr seymour one of the officers just told me that there is to be a dance she added in explanation because it is so calm that we might fancy ourselves ashore  neither he answered the smokingroom is stuffy and my dancing days are over no i proposed to take exercise after that big dinner and then to sit in a chair and fall asleep but he added and his voice grew interested how did you know that it was i you never turned your head  i have ears in my head as well as eyes she answered with a little laugh and after we have been nearly a month together on this ship i ought to know your step  i never remember that anyone ever recognized it before he said more to himself than to her then came and leaned over the rail at her side his doubts were gone fate had spoken  for a while there was silence between them then he asked her if she were not going to the dance  benita shook her head  why not you are fond of dancing and you dance very well also there are plenty of officers for partners especially captain and he checked himself  i know she said it would be pleasant butmr seymour will you think me foolish if i tell you something  i have never thought you foolish yet miss clifford so i dont know why i should begin now what is it  i am not going to the dance because i am afraid yes horribly afraid  afraid afraid of what  i dont quite know but mr seymour i feel as though we were all of us upon the edge of some dreadful catastropheas though there were about to be a mighty change and beyond it another life something new and unfamiliar it came over me at dinnerthat was why i left the table quite suddenly i looked and all the people were different yes all except a few  was i different he asked curiously  no you were not and he thought he heard her add thank god beneath her breath  and were you different  i dont know i never looked at myself i was the seer not the seen i have always been like that  indigestion he said reflectively we eat too much on board ship and the dinner was very long and heavy i told you so thats why im takingi mean why i wanted to take exercise  and to go to sleep afterwards  yes first the exercise then the sleep miss clifford that is the rule of lifeand death with sleep thought ends therefore for some of us your catastrophe is much to be desired for it would mean long sleep and no thought  i said that they were changed not that they had ceased to think perhaps they thought the more  then let us pray that your catastrophe may be averted i prescribe for you bismuth and carbonate of soda also in this weather it seems difficult to imagine such a thing look now miss clifford he added with a note of enthusiasm in his voice pointing towards the east look  her eyes followed his outstretched hand and there above the level ocean rose the great orb of the african moon lo of a sudden all that ocean turned to silver a wide path of rippling silver stretched from it to them it might have been the road of angels the sweet soft light beat upon their ship showing its tapering masts and every detail of the rigging it passed on beyond them and revealed the low foamfringed coastline rising here and there dotted with kloofs and their clinging bush even the round huts of kaffir kraals became faintly visible in that radiance other things became visible alsofor instance the features of this pair  the man was light in his colouring fairskinned with fair hair which already showed a tendency towards greyness especially in the moustache for he wore no beard his face was clean cut not particularly handsome since their fineness notwithstanding his features lacked regularity the cheekbones were too high and the chin was too small small faults redeemed to some extent by the steady and cheerful grey eyes for the rest he was broadshouldered and wellsetup sealed with the indescribable stamp of the english gentleman such was the appearance of robert seymour  in that light the girl at his side looked lovely though in fact she had no real claims to loveliness except perhaps as regards her figure which was agile rounded and peculiarly graceful her foreignlooking face was unusual darkeyed a somewhat large and very mobile mouth fair and waving hair a broad forehead a sweet and at times wistful face thoughtful for the most part but apt to be irradiated by sudden smiles not a beautiful woman at all but exceedingly attractive one possessing magnetism  she gazed first at the moon and the silver road beneath it then turning at the land beyond  we are very near to africa at last she said  too near i think he answered if i were the captain i should stand out a point or two it is a strange country full of surprises miss clifford will you think me rude if i ask you why you are going there you have never told mequite  no because the story is rather a sad one but you shall hear it if you wish do you  he nodded and drew up two deck chairs in which they settled themselves in a corner made by one of the inboard boats their faces still towards the sea  you know i was born in africa she said and lived there till i was thirteen years oldwhy i find i can still speak zulu i did so this afternoon my father was one of the early settlers in natal his father was a clergyman a younger son of the lincolnshire cliffords they are great people there still though i dont suppose that they are aware of my existence  i know them answered robert seymour indeed i was shooting at their place last novemberwhen the smash came and he sighed but go on  well my father quarrelled with his father i dont know what about and emigrated in natal he married my mother a miss ferreira whose namelike mine and her motherswas benita she was one of two sisters and her father andreas ferreira who married an english lady was half dutch and half portuguese i remember him well a fine old man with dark eyes and an irongrey beard he was wealthy as things went in those daysthat is to say he had lots of land in natal and the transvaal and great herds of stock so you see i am half english some dutch and more than a quarter portuguesequite a mixture of races my father and mother did not get on well together mr seymour i may as well tell you all the truth he drank and although he was passionately fond of her she was jealous of him also he gambled away most of her patrimony and after old andreas ferreiras death they grew poor one night there was a dreadful scene between them and in his madness he struck her  well she was a very proud woman determined too and she turned on him and saidfor i heard heri will never forgive you we have done with each other next morning when my father was sober he begged her pardon but she made no answer although he was starting somewhere on a fortnights trek when he had gone my mother ordered the cape cart packed up her clothes took some money that she had put away drove to durban and after making arrangements at the bank about a small private income of her own sailed with me for england leaving a letter for my father in which she said that she would never see him again and if he tried to interfere with me she would put me under the protection of the english court which would not allow me to be taken to the home of a drunkard  in england we went to live in london with my aunt who had married a major king but was a widow with five children my father often wrote to persuade my mother to go back to him but she never would which i think was wrong of her so things went on for twelve years or more till one day my mother suddenly died and i came into her little fortune of between £200 and £300 a year which she had tied up so that nobody can touch it that was about a year ago i wrote to tell my father of her death and received a pitiful letter indeed i have had several of them he implored me to come out to him and not to leave him to die in his loneliness as he soon would do of a broken heart if i did not he said that he had long ago given up drinking which was the cause of the ruin of his life and sent a certificate signed by a magistrate and a doctor to that effect well in the end although all my cousins and their mother advised me against it i consented and here i am he is to meet me at durban but how we shall get on together is more than i can say though i long to see him for after all he is my father  it was good of you to come under all the circumstances you must have a brave heart said robert reflectively  it is my duty she answered and for the rest i am not afraid who was born to africa indeed often and often have i wished to be back there again out on the veld far away from the london streets and fog i am young and strong and i want to see things natural thingsnot those made by man you knowthe things i remember as a child one can always go back to london  yes or at least some people can it is a curious thing miss clifford but as it happens i have met your father you always reminded me of the man but i had forgotten his name now it comes back to me it was clifford  where on earth she asked astonished  in a queer place as i told you i have visited south africa before under different circumstances four years ago i was out here biggame shooting going in from the east coast my brother and ihe is dead now poor fellowgot up somewhere in the matabele country on the banks of the zambesi as we didnt find much game there we were going to strike south when some natives told us of a wonderful ruin that stood on a hill overhanging the river a few miles farther on so leaving the waggon on the hither side of the steep nek over which it would have been difficult to drag it my brother and i took our rifles and a bag of food and started the place was farther off than we thought although from the top of the nek we could see it clearly enough and before we reached it dark had fallen  now we had observed a waggon and a tent outside the wall which we thought must belong to white men and headed for them there was a light in the tent and the flap was open the night being very hot inside two men were seated one old with a grey beard and the other a goodlooking fellowunder forty i should saywith a jewish face dark piercing eyes and a black pointed beard they were engaged in examining a heap of gold beads and bangles which lay on the table between them as i was about to speak the blackbearded man heard or caught sight of us and seizing a rifle that leaned against the table swung round and covered me  for gods sake dont shoot jacob said the old man they are english  best dead any way answered the other in a soft voice with a slight foreign accent we dont want spies or thieves here  we are neither but i can shoot as well as you friend i remarked for by this time my rifle was on him  then he thought better of it and dropped his gun and we explained that we were merely on an archæological expedition the end of it was that we became capital friends though neither of us could cotton much to mr jacobi forget his other name he struck me as too handy with his rifle and was i gathered an individual with a mysterious and rather lurid past to cut a long story short when he found out that we had no intention of poaching your father for it was he told us frankly that they were treasurehunting having got hold of some story about a vast store of gold which had been hidden away there by portuguese two or three centuries before their trouble was however that the makalanga who lived in the fortress which was called bambatse would not allow them to dig because they said the place was haunted and if they did so it would bring bad luck to their tribe  and did they ever get in asked benita  i am sure i dont know for we went next day though before we left we called on the makalanga who admitted us all readily enough so long as we brought no spades with us by the way the gold we saw your father and his friend examining was found in some ancient graves outside the walls but had nothing to do with the big and mythical treasure  what was the place like i love old ruins broke in benita again  oh wonderful a gigantic circular wall built by heaven knows who then halfway up the hill another wall and near the top a third wall which i understood surrounded a sort of holy of holies and above everything on the brink of the precipice a great cone of granite  artificial or natural  i dont know they would not let us up there but we were introduced to their chief and high priest church and state in one and a wonderful old man he was very wise and very gentle i remember he told me he believed we should meet again which seemed an odd thing for him to say i asked him about the treasure and why he would not let the other white men look for it he answered that it would never be found by any man white or black that only a woman would find it at the appointed time when it pleased the spirit of bambatse under whose guardianship it was  who was the spirit of bambatse mr seymour  i cant tell you couldnt make out anything definite about her except that she was said to be white and to appear sometimes at sunrise or in the moonlight standing upon the tall point of rock of which i told you i remember that i got up before the dawn to look for herlike an idiot for of course i saw nothingand thats all i know about the matter  did you have any talk with my father mr seymouralone i mean  yes a little the next day he walked back to our waggon with us being glad i fancy of a change from the perpetual society of his partner jacob that wasnt wonderful in a man who had been brought up at eton and oxford as i found out he had like myself and whatever his failings may have beenalthough we saw no sign of them for he would not touch a drop of spiritswas a gentleman which jacob wasnt still hejacobhad read a lot especially on outoftheway subjects and could talk every language under the suna clever and agreeable scoundrel in short  did my father say anything about himself  yes he told me that he had been an unsuccessful man all his life and had much to reproach himself with for we got quite confidential at last he added that he had a family in englandwhat family he didnt saywhom he was anxious to make wealthy by way of reparation for past misdeeds and that was why he was treasurehunting however from what you tell me i fear he never found anything  no mr seymour he never found it and never will but all the same i am glad to hear that he was thinking of us also i should like to explore that place bambatse  so should i miss clifford in your company and your fathers but not in that of jacob if ever you should go there with him i saybeware of jacob  oh i am not afraid of jacob she answered with a laugh although i believe that my father still has something to do with himat least in one of his letters he mentioned his partner who was a german  a german i think that he must have meant a german jew  after this there was silence between them for a time then he said suddenly you have told me your story would you like to hear mine  yes she answered  well it wont take you long to listen to it for miss clifford like cannings needy knifegrinder i have really none to tell you see before you one of the most useless persons in the world an undistinguished member of what is called in england the leisured class who can do absolutely nothing that is worth doing except shoot straight  indeed said benita  you do not seem impressed with that accomplishment he went on yet it is an honest fact that for the last fifteen yearsi was thirtytwo this monthpractically my whole time has been given up to it with a little fishing thrown in in the spring as i want to make the most of myself i will add that i am supposed to be among the six best shots in england and that my ambitionyes great heavens my ambitionwas to become better than the other five by that sin fell the poor man who speaks to you i was supposed to have abilities but i neglected them all to pursue this form of idleness i entered no profession i did no work with the result that at thirtytwo i am ruined and almost hopeless  why ruined and hopeless she asked anxiously for the way in which they were spoken grieved her more than the words themselves  ruined because my old uncle the honourable john seymour seymour whose heir i was committed the indiscretion of marrying a young lady who has presented him with thriving twins with the appearance of those twins my prospects disappeared as did the allowance of £1500 a year that he was good enough to make me on which to keep up a position as his nextofkin i had something of my own but also i had debts and at the present moment a draft in my pocket for £2163 14s 5d and a little loose cash represents the total of my worldly goods just about the sum i have been accustomed to spend per annum  i dont call that ruin i call that riches said benita relieved with £2000 to begin on you may make a fortune in africa but how about the hopelessness  i am hopeless because i have absolutely nothing to which to look forward really when that £2000 is gone i do not know how to earn a sixpence in this dilemma it occurred to me that the only thing i could do was to turn my shooting to practical account and become a hunter of big game therefore i propose to kill elephants until an elephant kills me at least he added in a changed voice i did so propose until half an hour ago     ii  the end of the zanzibar  until half an hour ago then why and benita stopped  have i changed my very modest scheme of life miss clifford as you are so good as to be sufficiently interested i will tell you it is because a temptation which hitherto i have been able to resist has during the last thirty minutes become too strong for me you know everything has its breaking strain he puffed nervously at his cigar threw it into the sea paused then went on miss clifford i have dared to fall in love with you no hear me out when i have done it will be quite time enough to give me the answer that i expect meanwhile for the first time in my life allow me the luxury of being in earnest to me it is a new sensation and therefore very priceless may i go on  benita made no answer he rose with a certain deliberateness which characterized all his movementsfor robert seymour never seemed to be in a hurryand stood in front of her so that the moonlight shone upon her face while his own remained in shadow  beyond that £2000 of which i have spoken and incidentally its owner i have nothing whatsoever to offer to you i am an indigent and worthless person even in my prosperous days when i could look forward to a large estate although it was often suggested to me i never considered myself justified in asking any lady to sharethe prospective estate i think now that the real reason was that i never cared sufficiently for any lady since otherwise my selfishness would probably have overcome my scruples as it does tonight benita for i will call you so if for the first and last time iilove you  listen now he went on dropping his measured manner and speaking hurriedly like a man with an earnest message and little time in which to deliver it it is an odd thing an incomprehensible thing but true truei fell in love with you the first time i saw your face you remember you stood there leaning over the bulwark when i came on board at southampton and as i walked up the gangway i looked and my eyes met yours then i stopped and that stout old lady who got off at madeira bumped into me and asked me to be good enough to make up my mind if i were going backward or forward do you remember  yes she answered in a low voice  which things are an allegory he continued i felt it so at the time yes i had half a mind to answer backward and give up my berth in this ship then i looked at you again and something inside of me said forward so i came up the rest of the gangway and took off my hat to you a salutation i had no right to make but which i recall you acknowledged  he paused then continued as it began so it has gone on it is always like that is it not the beginning is everything the end must follow and now it has come out as i was fully determined that it should not do half an hour ago when suddenly you developed eyes in the back of your head andoh dearest i love you no please be quiet i have not done i have told you what i am and really there isnt much more to say about me for i have no particular vices except the worst of them all idleness and not the slightest trace of any virtue that i can discover but i have a certain knowledge of the world acquired in a long course of shooting parties and as a man of the world i will venture to give you a bit of advice it is possible that to you my life and death affair is a mere matter of boardship amusement yet it is possible also that you might take another view of the matter in that case as a friend and a man of the world i entreat youdont have nothing to do with me send me about my business you will never regret it  are you making fun or is all this meant mr seymour asked benita still speaking beneath her breath and looking straight before her  meant of course it is meant how can you ask  because i have always understood that on such occasions people wish to make the best of themselves  quite so but i never do what i ought a fact for which i am grateful now come to think of it since otherwise i should not be here tonight i wish to make the worst of myself the very worst for whatever i am not at least i am honest now having told you that i am or was half an hour ago an idler a goodfornothing prospectless failure i ask youif you care to hear any more  she half rose and glancing at him for the first time saw his face contract itself and turn pale in the moonlight it may be that the sight of it affected her even to the extent of removing some adverse impression left by the bitter mocking of his selfblame at any rate benita seemed to change her mind and sat down again saying  go on if you wish  he bowed slightly and said  i thank you i have told you what i was half an hour ago now hoping that you will believe me i will tell you what i am i am a truly repentant man one upon whom a new light has risen i am not very old and i think that underneath it all i have some ability opportunity may still come my way if it does not for your sake i will make the opportunity i do not believe that you can ever find anyone who would love you better or care for you more tenderly i desire to live for you in the future more completely even than in the past i have lived for myself i do not wish to influence you by personal appeals but in fact i stand at the parting of the ways if you will give yourself to me i feel as though i might still become a husband of whom you could be proudif not i write finis upon the tombstone of the possibilities of robert seymour i adore you you are the one woman with whom i desire to pass my days it is you who have always been lacking to my life i ask you to be brave to take the risk of marrying me although i can see nothing but poverty ahead of us for i am an adventurer  dont speak like that she said quickly we are all of us adventurers in this world and i more than you we have just to consider ourselves not what we have or have not  so be it miss clifford then i have nothing more to say now it is for you to answer  just then the sound of the piano and the fiddle in the saloon ceased one of the waltzes was over and some of the dancers came upon deck to flirt or to cool themselves one pair engaged very obviously in the former occupation stationed themselves so near to robert and benita that further conversation between them was impossible and there proceeded to interchange the remarks common to such occasions  for a good ten minutes did they stand thus carrying on a mock quarrel as to a dance of which one of them was supposed to have been defrauded until robert seymour generally a very philosophical person could have slain those innocent lovers he felt he knew not why that his chances were slipping away from him that sensation of something bad about to happen of which benita had spoken spread from her to him the suspense grew exasperating terrible even nor could it be ended to ask her to come elsewhere was under the circumstances not feasible especially as he would also have been obliged to request the other pair to make way for them and all this time with a sinking of the heart he felt that probably benita was beating down any tenderness which she might feel towards him that when her longdelayed answer did come the chances were it would be no  the piano began to play again in the saloon and the young people still squabbling archly at length prepared to depart suddenly there was a stir upon the bridge and against the tender sky robert saw a man dash forward next instant the engineroom bell rang fiercely he knew the signalit was stop followed at once by other ringings that meant full speed astern  i wonder what is up said the young man to the young woman  before the words had left his lips they knew there was a sensation as though all the hull of the great ship had come to a complete standstill while the top part of her continued to travel forward followed by another sensation still more terrible and sickening in its naturethat of slipping over something helplessly heavily as a man slips upon ice or a polished floor spars cracked ropes flew in two with a noise as of pistol shots heavy objects rushed about the deck travelling forwards all of them benita was hurled from her chair against robert so that the two of them rolled into the scuppers he was unhurt and picked himself up but she lay still and he saw that something had struck her upon the head for blood was running down her cheek he lifted her and filled with black horror and despairfor he thought her gonepressed his hand upon her heart thank god it began to beat againshe still lived  the music in the saloon had stopped and for a little while there was silence then of an instant there arose the horrible clamour of shipwreck wildeyed people rushed to and fro aimlessly here and there women and children shrieked a clergyman fell upon his knees and began to pray  this went on for a space till presently the second officer appeared and affecting an unconcerned air called out that it was all right the captain said no one was to be afraid he added that they were not more than six miles from the shore and that the ship would be beached in half an hour indeed as he spoke the engines which had been stopped commenced to work again and her head swung round in a wide circle pointing to the land evidently they had passed over the rock and were once more in deep water through which they travelled at a good speed but with a heavy list to starboard the pumps got to work also with a monotonous clanging beat throwing out great columns of foaming water on to the oily sea men began to cut the covers off the boats and to swing some of them outboard such were the things that went on about them  with the senseless benita clasped to his breast the blood from her cut head running down his shoulder robert stood still awhile thinking then he made up his mind as it chanced she had a deck cabin and thither he forced his way carrying her tenderly and with patience through the distracted throng of passengers for there were five hundred souls on board that ship he reached the place to find that it was quite empty her cabinmate having fled laying benita upon the lower bunk he lit the swinging candle as soon as it burned up he searched for the lifebelts and by good fortune found two of them one of which not without great difficulty he succeeded in fastening round her then he took a sponge and bathed her head with water there was a great bruise upon her temple where the block or whatever it was had struck her and the blood still flowed but the wound was not very deep or extensive nor so far as he could discover did the bone appear to be broken or driven in he had good hope that she was only stunned and would revive presently unable to do more for her a thought struck him on the floor of the cabin thrown by the shock from the rack lay her writing case he opened it and taking a piece of paper wrote these words hurriedly in pencil  you gave me no answer and it is more than probable that i shall receive none in this world which one or both of us may be upon the verge of leaving in the latter case we can settle the matter elsewhereperhaps in the former should it be my lot to go and yours to stay i hope that you will think kindly of me at times as of one who loved you truly should it be yours to go then you will never read these words yet if to the dead is given knowledge be assured that as you left me so you shall find me yours and yours alone or perhaps we both may live i pray sos r s  folding up the paper he undid a button of benitas blouse and thrust it away there knowing that thus she would certainly find it should she survive then he stepped out on to the deck to see what was happening the vessel still steamed but made slow progress moreover the list to starboard was now so pronounced that it was difficult to stand upright on account of it nearly all the passengers were huddled together upon the port side having instinctively taken refuge as far as possible above the water a man with a white distraught face staggered towards him supporting himself by the bulwarks it was the captain for a moment he paused as though to think holding to a stanchion robert seymour saw his opportunity and addressed him  forgive me he said i do not like interfering with other peoples business but for reasons unconnected with myself i suggest to you that it would be wise to stop this ship and get out the boats the sea is calm if it is not left till too late there should be no difficulty in launching them  the man stared at him absently then said  they wont hold everybody mr seymour i hope to beach her  at least they will hold some he answered whereas and he pointed to the water which by now was almost level with the deck  perhaps you are right mr seymour it doesnt matter to me anyway i am a ruined man but the poor passengersthe poor passengers and he scrambled away fiercely towards the bridge like a wounded cat along the bough of a tree whence in a few seconds robert heard him shouting orders  a minute or so afterwards the steamer stopped too late the captain had decided to sacrifice his ship and save those she carried they were beginning to get out the boats now robert returned to the cabin where benita was lying senseless and wrapped her up in a cloak and some blankets then seeing the second lifebelt on the floor by an afterthought he put it on knowing that there was time to spare next he lifted benita and feeling sure that the rush would be for the starboard side on which the boats were quite near the water carried her with difficulty for the slope was steep to the portcutter which he knew would be in the charge of a good man the second officer whom he had seen in command there at sunday boatdrills  here as he had anticipated the crowd was small since most people thought that it would not be possible to get this boat down safely to the water or if their powers of reflection were gone instinct told them so that skilful seaman the second officer and his appointed crew were already at work lowering the cutter from the davits  now he said women and children first  a number rushed in and robert saw that the boat would soon be full  i am afraid he said that i must count myself a woman as i carry one and by a great effort holding benita with one arm with the other he let himself down the falls and assisted by a quartermaster gained the boat in safety  one or two other men scrambled after him  push her off said the officer she can hold no more and the ropes were let go  when they were about twelve feet from the ships side from which they thrust themselves clear with oars there came a rush of people disappointed of places in the starboard boats a few of the boldest of these swarmed down the falls others jumped and fell among them or missed and dropped into the sea or struck upon the sides of the boat and were killed still she reached the water upon an even keel though now much overladen the oars were got out and they rowed round the bow of the great ship wallowing in her deaththroes their first idea being to make for the shore which was not three miles away  this brought them to the starboard side where they saw a hideous scene hundreds of people seemed to be fighting for room with the result that some of the boats were overturned precipitating their occupants into the water others hung by the prow or the stern the ropes having jammed in the davits in the frantic haste and confusion while from them human beings dropped one by one round others not yet launched a hellish struggle was in progress the struggle of men women and children battling for their lives in which the strong mad with terror showed no mercy to the weak  from that mass of humanity most of them about to perish went up a babel of sounds which in its sum shaped itself to one prolonged scream such as might proceed from a titan in his agony all this beneath a brooding moonlit sky and on a sea as smooth as glass upon the ship which now lay upon her side the siren still sent up its yells for succour and some brave man continued to fire rockets which rushed heavenwards and burst in showers of stars  robert remembered that the last rocket he had seen was fired at an evening fête for the amusement of the audience the contrast struck him as dreadful he wondered whether there were any power or infernal population that could be amused by a tragedy such as enacted itself before his eyes how it came about also that such a tragedy was permitted by the merciful strength in which mankind put their faith  the vessel was turning over compressed air or steam burst up the decks with loud reports fragments of wreckage flew into the air there the poor captain still clung to the rail of the bridge seymour could see his white facethe moonlight seemed to paint it with a ghastly smile the officer in command of their boat shouted to the crew to give way lest they should be sucked down with the steamer  look now she wallowed like a dying whale the moonrays shone white upon her bottom showing the jagged rent made in it by the rock on which she had struck and now she was gone only a little cloud of smoke and steam remained to mark where the zanzibar had been     iii  how robert came ashore  in place of the zanzibar a great pit on the face of the ocean in which the waters boiled and black objects appeared and disappeared  sit still for your lives sake said the officer in a quiet voice the suck is coming  in another minute it came dragging them downward till the water trickled over the sides of the boat and backward towards the pit but before ever they reached it the deep had digested its prey and save for the great airbubbles which burst about them and a mixed unnatural swell was calm again for the moment they were safe  passengers said the officer i am going to put out to seaat any rate till daylight we may meet a vessel there and if we try to row ashore we shall certainly be swamped in the breakers  no one objected they seemed too stunned to speak but robert thought to himself that the man was wise they began to move but before they had gone a dozen yards something dark rose beside them it was a piece of wreckage and clinging to it a woman who clasped a bundle to her breast more she was alive for she began to cry to them to take her in  save me and my child she cried for gods sake save me  robert recognized the choking voice it was that of a young married lady with whom he had been very friendly who was going out with her baby to join her husband in natal he stretched out his hand and caught hold of her whereon the officer said heavily  the boat is already overladen i must warn you that to take more aboard is not safe  thereon the passengers awoke from their stupor  push her off cried a voice she must take her chance and there was a murmur of approval at the dreadful words  for christs sakefor christs sake wailed the drowning woman who clung desperately to roberts hand  if you try to pull her in we will throw you overboard said the voice again and a knife was lifted as though to hack at his arm then the officer spoke once more  this lady cannot come into the boat unless someone goes out of it i would myself but it is my duty to stay is there any man here who will make place for her  but all the men thereseven of them besides the crewhung their heads and were silent  give way said the officer in the same heavy voice she will drop off presently  while the words passed his lips robert seemed to live a year here was an opportunity of atonement for his idle and luxurious life an hour ago he would have taken it gladly but nownow with benita senseless on his breast and that answer still locked in her sleeping heart yet benita would approve of such a death as this and even if she loved him not in life would learn to love his memory in an instant his mind was made up and he was speaking rapidly  thompson he said to the officer if i go will you swear to take her in and her child  certainly mr seymour  then lay to i am going if any of you live tell this lady how i died and he pointed to benita and say i thought that she would wish it  she shall be told said the officer again and saved too if i can do it  hold mrs jeffreys then till i am out of this ill leave my coat to cover her  a sailor obeyed and with difficulty robert wrenched free his hand  very deliberately he pressed benita to his breast and kissed her on the forehead then let her gently slide on to the bottom of the boat next he slipped off his overcoat and slowly rolled himself over the gunwale into the sea  now he said pull mrs jeffreys in  god bless you you are a brave man said thompson i shall remember you if i live a hundred years  but no one else said anything perhaps they were all too much ashamed even then  i have only done my duty seymour answered from the water how far is it to the shore  about three miles shouted thompson but keep on that plank or you will never live through the rollers goodbye  goodbye answered robert  then the boat passed away from him and soon vanished in the misty face of the deep  resting on the plank which had saved the life of mrs jeffreys robert seymour looked about him and listened now and again he heard a faint choking scream uttered by some drowning wretch and a few hundred yards away caught sight of a black object which he thought might be a boat if so he reflected that it must be full moreover he could not overtake it no his only chance was to make for the shore he was a strong swimmer and happily the water was almost as warm as milk there seemed to be no reason why he should not reach it supported as he was by a lifebelt if the sharks would leave him alone which they might as there was plenty for them to feed on the direction he knew well enough for now in the great silence of the sea he could hear the boom of the mighty rollers breaking on the beach  ah those rollers he remembered how that very afternoon benita and he had watched them through his field glass sprouting up against the cruel walls of rock and wondered that when the ocean was so calm they had still such power now should he live to reach them he was doomed to match himself against that power well the sooner he did so the sooner it would be over one way or the other this was in his favour the tide had turned and was flowing shorewards indeed he had little to do but to rest upon his plank which he placed crosswise beneath his breast and steered himself with his feet even thus he made good progress nearly a mile an hour perhaps he could have gone faster had he swum but he was saving his strength  it was a strange journey upon that silent sea beneath those silent stars and strange thoughts came into roberts soul he wondered whether benita would live and what she would say perhaps however she was already dead and he would meet her presently he wondered if he were doomed to die and whether this sacrifice of his would be allowed to atone for his past errors he hoped so and put up a petition to that effect for himself and for benita and for all the poor people who had gone before hurled from their pleasure into the halls of death  so he floated on while the boom of the breakers grew ever nearer companioned by his wild fretful thoughts till at length what he took to be a shark appeared quite close to him and in the urgency of the moment he gave up wondering it proved to be only a piece of wood but later on a real shark did come for he saw its back fin however this cruel creature was either gorged or timid for when he splashed upon the water and shouted it went away to return no more  now at length robert entered upon the deep hill and valley swell which preceded the field of the rollers suddenly he shot down a smooth slope and without effort of his own found himself borne up an opposing steep from the crest of which he had a view of white lines of foam and beyond them of a dim and rocky shore at one spot a little to his right the foam seemed thinner and the line of cliff to be broken as though here there was a cleft for this cleft then he steered his plank taking the swell obliquely which by good fortune the set of the tide enabled him to do without any great exertion  the valleys grew deeper and the tops of the opposing ridges were crested with foam he had entered the rollers and the struggle for life began before him they rushed solemn and mighty viewed from some safe place even the sight of these combers is terrible as any who have watched them from this coast or from that of the island of ascension can bear witness what their aspect was to this shipwrecked man supported by a single plank may therefore be imagined seen as he saw them in the mysterious moonlight and in utter loneliness yet his spirit rose to meet the dread emergency if he were to die he would die fighting he had grown cold and tired but now the chill and weariness left him he felt warm and strong from the crest of one of the high rollers he thought he saw that about half a mile away from him a little river ran down the centre of the gorge and for the mouth of this river he laid his course  at first all went well he was borne up the seas he slid down the seas in a lather of white foam presently the rise and fall grew steeper and the foam began to break over his head robert could no longer guide himself he must go as he was carried then in an instant he was carried into a hell of waters where had it not been for his lifebelt and the plank he must have been beaten down and have perished as it was now he was driven into the depths and now he emerged upon their surface to hear their seething hiss around him and above it all a continuous boom as of great gunsthe boom of the breaking seas  the plank was almost twisted from his grasp but he clung to it desperately although its edges tore his arms when the rollers broke over him he held his breath and when he was tossed skywards on their curves drew it again in quick sweet gasps now he sat upon the very brow of one of them as a merman might now he dived like a dolphin and now just as his senses were leaving him his feet touched bottom another moment and robert was being rolled along that bottom with a weight on him like the weight of mountains the plank was rent from him but his cork jacket brought him up the backwash drew him with it into deeper water where he lay helpless and despairing for he no longer had any strength to struggle against his doom  then it was that there came a mighty roller bigger than any that he had seensuch a one as on that coast the kaffirs call a father of waves it caught him in the embrace of its vast green curve it bore him forward as though he were but a straw far forward over the stretch of cruel rocks it broke in thunder dashing him again upon the stones and sand of the little river bar rolling him along with its resistless might till even that might was exhausted and its foam began to return seawards sucking him with it  roberts mind was almost gone but enough of it remained to tell him that if once more he was dragged into the deep water he must be lost as the current haled him along he gripped at the bottom with his hands and by the mercy of heaven they closed on something it may have been a treestump embedded there or a rockhe never knew at least it was firm and to it he hung despairingly would that rush never cease his lungs were bursting he must let go oh the foam was thinning his head was above it now now it had departed leaving him like a stranded fish upon the shingle for half a minute or more he lay there gasping then looked behind him to see another comber approaching through the gloom he struggled to his feet fell rose again and ran or rather staggered forward with that tigerish water hissing at his heels forward still forward till he was beyond its reachyes on dry sand then his vital forces failed him one of his legs gave way and bleeding from a hundred hurts he fell heavily onto his face and there was still  the boat in which benita lay being so deep in the water proved very hard to row against the tide for the number of its passengers encumbered the oarsmen after a while a light off land breeze sprang up as here it often does towards morning and the officer thompson determined to risk hoisting the sail accordingly this was donewith some difficulty for the mast had to be drawn out and shippedalthough the women screamed as the weight of the air bent their frail craft over till the gunwale was almost level with the water  anyone who moves shall be thrown overboard said the officer who steered after which they were quiet  now they made good progress seawards but the anxieties of those who knew were very great since the wind showed signs of rising and if any swell should spring up that crowded cutter could scarcely hope to live in fact two hours later they were forced to lower the sail again and drift waiting for the dawn mr thompson strove to cheer them saying that now they were in the track of vessels and if they could see none when the light came he would run along the shore in the hope of finding a place free of breakers where they might land if they did not inspire hope at least his words calmed them and they sat in heavy silence watching the sky  at length it grew grey and then with a sudden glory peculiar to south africa the great red sun arose and began to dispel the mist from the surface of the sea half an hour more and this was gone and now the bright rays brought life back into their chilled frames as they stared at each other to see which of their company were still left alive they even asked for food and biscuit was given to them with water  all this while benita remained unconscious indeed one callous fellow who had been using her body as a footstool said that she must be dead and had better be thrown overboard as it would lighten the boat  if you throw that lady into the sea living or dead said mr thompson with an ominous lift of his eye you go with her mr batten remember who brought her here and how he died  then mr batten held his peace while thompson stood up and scanned the wide expanse of sea presently he whispered to a sailor near him who also stood up looked and nodded  that will be the other lines intermediate boat he said and the passengers craning their heads round saw far away to the right a streak of smoke upon the horizon orders were given a little corner of sail was hoisted with a white cloth of some sort tied above it and the oars were got out once more the cutter moved forward bearing to the left in the hope of intercepting the steamer  she came on with terrible swiftness and they who had miles of water to cover dared hoist no more sail in that breeze in half an hour she was nearly opposite to them and they were still far away a little more sail was let out driving them through the water at as quick a rate as they could venture to go the steamer was passing three miles or so away and black despair took hold of them now the resourceful thompson without apologies undressed and removing the white shirt that he had worn at the dance bade a sailor to tie it to an oar and wave it to and fro  still the steamer went on until presently they heard her siren going and saw that she was putting about  she has seen us said thompson thank god all of you for there is wind coming up pull down that sail we shant need it any more  half an hour later with many precautions for the wind he prophesied was already troubling the sea and sending little splashes of water over the stern of their deeply laden boat they were fast to a line thrown from the deck of the three thousand ton steamer castle bound for natal then with a rattle down came the accommodation ladder and strongarmed men standing on its grating dragged them one by one from the death to which they had been so near the last to be lifted up except thompson was benita round whom it was necessary to reeve a rope  any use asked the officer on the grating as he glanced at her quiet form  cant say i hope so answered thompson call your doctor and gently enough she was borne up the ships side  they wanted to cast off the boat but thompson remonstrated and in the end that also was dragged to deck meanwhile the news had spread and the awakened passengers of the castle clad in pyjamas dressinggowns and even blankets were crowding round the poor castaways or helping them to their cabins  i am a teetotaller said second officer thompson when he had made a brief report to the captain of the castle but if anyone will stand me a whiskey and soda i shall be obliged to him     iv  mr clifford  although the shock of the blow she had received upon her head was sufficient to make her insensible for so many hours benitas injuries were not of a really serious nature for as it happened the falling block or whatever it may have been had hit her forehead slantwise and not full to which accident she owed it that although the skin was torn and the scalp bruised her skull had escaped fracture under proper medical care her senses soon came back to her but as she was quite dazed and thought herself still on board the zanzibar the doctor considered it wise to preserve her in that illusion for a while so after she had swallowed some broth he gave her a sleeping draught the effects of which she did not shake off till the following morning  then she came to herself completely and was astonished to feel the pain in her head which had been bandaged and to see a strange stewardess sitting by her with a cup of beeftea in her hand  where am i is it a dream she asked  drink this and i will tell you answered the stewardess  benita obeyed for she felt hungry then repeated her question  your steamer was shipwrecked said the stewardess and a great many poor people were drowned but you were saved in a boat look there are your clothes they were never in the water  who carried me into the boat asked benita in a low voice  a gentleman they say miss who had wrapped you in a blanket and put a lifebelt on you  now benita remembered everything that happened before the darkness fellthe question to which she had given no answer the young couple who stood flirting by herall came back to her  was mr seymour saved she whispered her face grey with dread  i dare say miss answered the stewardess evasively but there is no gentleman of that name aboard this ship  at that moment the doctor came in and him too she plied with questions but having learned the story of roberts selfsacrifice from mr thompson and the others he would give her no answer for he guessed how matters had stood between them and feared the effects of the shock all he could say was that he hoped mr seymour had escaped in some other boat  it was not until the third morning that benita was allowed to learn the truth which indeed it was impossible to conceal any longer mr thompson came to her cabin and told her everything while she listened silently horrified amazed  miss clifford he said i think it was one of the bravest things that a man ever did on the ship i always thought him rather a headinair kind of swell but he was a splendid fellow and i pray god that he has lived as the lady and child for whom he offered himself up have done for they are both well again  yes she repeated after him mechanically splendid fellow indeed and she added with a strange flash of conviction i believe that he is still alive if he were dead i should know it  i am glad to hear you say so said mr thompson who believed the exact contrary  listen she went on i will tell you something when that dreadful accident occurred mr seymour had just asked me to marry him and i was going to answer that i wouldbecause i love him i believe that i shall still give him that answer  mr thompson replied again that he hoped so which being as honest and tenderhearted as he was brave and capable he did most earnestly but in his heart he reflected that her answer would not be given this side of the grave then as he had been deputed to do he handed her the note which had been found in the bosom of her dress and able to bear no more of this painful scene hurried from the cabin she read it greedily twice and pressed it to her lips murmuring  yes i will think kindly of you robert seymour kindly as woman can of man and now or afterwards you shall have your answer if you still wish for it whenever you come or wherever i go it shall be ready for you  that afternoon when she was more composed mrs jeffreys came to see benita bringing her baby with her the poor woman was still pale and shaken but the child had taken no hurt at all from its immersion in that warm water  what can you think of me she said falling on her knees by benita but oh i did not know what i was doing it was terror and my child and she kissed the sleeping infant passionately also i did not understand at the timei was too dazed andthat herohe gave his life for me when the others wished to beat me off with oars yes his blood is upon my handshe who died that i and my child might live  benita looked at her and answered very gently  perhaps he did not die after all do not grieve for if he did it was a very glorious death and i am prouder of him than i could have been had he lived on like the otherswho wished to beat you off with oars whatever is is by gods will and doubtless for the best at the least you and your child will be restored to your husband though it cost me one who would have beenmy husband  that evening benita came upon the deck and spoke with the other ladies who were saved learning every detail that she could gather but to none of the men except to mr thompson would she say a single word and soon seeing how the matter stood they hid themselves away from her as they had already done from mrs jeffreys  the castle had hung about the scene of the shipwreck for thirty hours and rescued one other boatload of survivors also a stoker clinging to a piece of wreckage but with the shore she had been unable to communicate for the dreaded wind had risen and the breakers were quite impassable to any boat to a passing steamer bound for port elizabeth however she had reported the terrible disaster which by now was known all over the world together with the names of those whom she had picked up in the boats  on the night of the day of benitas interview with mrs jeffreys the castle arrived off durban and anchored since she was too big a vessel to cross the bar as it was in those days at dawn the stewardess awoke benita from the uneasy sleep in which she lay to tell her that an old gentleman had come off in the tug and wished to see her for fear of exciting false hopes she was very careful to add that word old with her help benita dressed herself and as the sun rose flooding the berea the point the white town and fair natal beyond with light she went on to the deck and there leaning over the bulwark saw a thin greybearded man of whom after all these years the aspect was still familiar  a curious thrill went through her as she looked at him leaning there lost in thought after all he was her father the man to whom she owed her presence upon this bitter earth this place of terrors and delights of devastation and hope supernal perhaps too he had been as much sinned against as sinning she stepped up to him and touched him on the shoulder  father she said  he turned round with all the quickness of a young man for about him there was a peculiar agility which his daughter had inherited like his mind his body was still nimble  my darling he said i should have known your voice anywhere it has haunted my sleep for years my darling thank you for coming back to me and thank god for preserving you when so many were lost then he threw his arms about her and kissed her  she shrank from him a little for by inadvertence he had pressed upon the wound in her forehead  forgive me she said it is my head it was injured you know  then he saw the bandage about her brow and was very penitent  they did not tell me that you had been hurt benita he exclaimed in his light refined voice one of the stamps of that gentility of blood and breeding whereof all his rough years and errors had been unable to deprive him they only told me that you were saved it is part of my illfortune that at our first moment of greeting i should give you pain who have caused you so much already  benita felt that the words were an apology for the past and her heart was touched  it is nothing she answered you did not know or mean it  no dear i never knew or meant it believe me i was not a willing sinner only a weak one you are beautiful benitafar more so than i expected  what she answered smiling with this bandage round my head well in your eyes perhaps but inwardly she thought to herself that the description would be more applicable to her father who in truth notwithstanding his years was wonderfully handsome with his quick blue eyes mobile face gentle mouth with the wistful droop at the corners so like her own and grey beard how she wondered could this be the man who had struck her mother then she remembered him as he had been years before when he was a slave to liquor and knew that the answer was simple  tell me about your escape love he said patting her hand with his thin fingers you dont know what ive suffered i was waiting at the royal hotel here when the cable came announcing the loss of the zanzibar and all on board for the first time for many a year i drank spirits to drown my griefdont be afraid dearfor the first time and the last then afterwards came another cable giving the names of those who were known to be saved andthank god oh thank godyours among them and he gasped at the recollection of that relief  yes she said i suppose i should thankhimand another have you heard the story abouthow mr seymour saved me i mean  some of it while you were dressing yourself i have been talking to the officer who was in command of your boat he was a brave man benita and i am sorry to tell you he is gone  she grasped a stanchion and clung there staring at him with a wild white face  how do you know that father  mr clifford drew a copy of the natal mercury of the previous day from the pocket of his ulster and while she waited in an agony he hunted through the long columns descriptive of the loss of the zanzibar presently he came to the paragraph he sought and read it aloud to her it ran  the searchers on the coast opposite the scene of the shipwreck report that they met a kaffir who was travelling along the seashore who produced a gold watch which he said he had taken from the body of a white man that he found lying on the sand at the mouth of the umvoli river inside the watch is engraved to seymour robert seymour from his uncle on his twentyfirst birthday the name of mr seymour appears as a firstclass passenger to durban by the zanzibar he was a member of an old english family in lincolnshire this was his second journey to south africa which he visited some years ago with his brother on a biggame shooting expedition all who knew him then will join with us in deploring his loss mr seymour was a noted shot and an english gentleman of the best stamp he was last seen by one of the survivors of the catastrophe carrying miss clifford the daughter of the wellknown natal pioneer of that name into a boat but as this young lady is reported to have been saved and as he entered the boat with her no explanation is yet forthcoming as to how he came to his sad end  i fear that is clear enough said mr clifford as he folded up his paper  yes clear enough she repeated in a strained voice and yetyetoh father he had just asked me to marry him and i cant believe that he is dead before i had time to answer  good heavens said the old man they never told me that it is dreadfully sad god help you my poor child there is nothing more to say except that he was only one among three hundred who have gone with him be brave now before all these people lookhere comes the tug   the following week was very much of a blank to benita when they reached shore some old friends of her fathers took her and him to their house a quiet place upon the berea here now that the first excitement of rescue and grief was over the inevitable reaction set in bringing with it weakness so distressing that the doctor insisted upon her going to bed where she remained for the next five days with the healing up of the wound in her head her strength came back to her at last but it was a very sad benita who crept from her room one afternoon on to the verandah and looked out at the cruel sea peaceful now as the sky above  her father who had nursed her tenderly during these dark days came and sat by her taking her hand in his  this is capital he said glancing at her anxiously you are getting quite yourself again  i shall never be myself again she answered my old self is dead although the outside of me has recovered father i suppose that it is wrong but i wish that i were dead too i wish that he had taken me with him when he jumped into the sea to lighten the boat  dont speak like that he broke in hastily of course i know that i am not much to youhow can i be after all that is past but i love you dear and if i were left quite alone again and he broke off  you shall not be left alone if i can help it she replied looking at the old man with her dark and tender eyes we have only each other in the world now have we the rest have gone never to return  he threw his arms about her and drawing her to him kissed her passionately  if only you could learn to love me he said  i do love you she answered who now shall never love any other man upon the earth  this was the beginning of a deep affection which sprang up between mr clifford and his daughter and continued to the end  is there any news she asked a little later  nonenone about him the tide took his body away no doubt after the kaffir had gone i remember him well now he was a fine young man and it comes into my mind that when i said goodbye to him above those old ruins i wished that i had a son like that and to think that he went so near to becoming a son to me well the grass must bend when the wind blows as the natives say  i am glad that you knew him she answered simply  then they began talking about other matters he told her that all the story had become known and that people spoke of robert seymour as the hero also that there was a great deal of curiosity about her  then let us get away as soon as we can she said nervously but father where are we going  that will be for you to decide love listen now this is my position i have been quite steady for years and worked hard with the result that i and my partner have a fine farm in the transvaal on the high land near lake chrissie out wakkerstroom way we breed horses there and have done very well with them i have £1500 saved and the farm brings us in quite £600 a year beyond the expenses but it is a lonely place with only a few boers about although they are good fellows enough you might not care to live there with no company  i dont think that i should mind she answered smiling  not now but byandby you would when you know what it is like now i might sell my share in the farm to my partner who i think would buy it or i might trust to him to send me a part of the profits which perhaps he would not then if you wish it we could live in or near one of the towns or even as you have an income of your own go home to england if that is your will  is it your will she asked  he shook his head no all my life is here also i have something to find before i diefor your sake dear  do you mean up among those ruins she asked looking at him curiously  yes so you know about it he answered with a flash of his blue eyes oh of course seymour told you yes i mean among the ruinsbut i will tell you that story another timenot here not here what do you wish to do benita remember i am in your hands i will obey you in all things  not to stop in a town and not to go to england she replied while he hung eagerly upon her words for this has become my holy land father i will go with you to your farm there i can be quiet you and i together  yes he answered rather uneasily but you see benita we shall not be quite alone there my partner jacob meyer lives with me  jacob meyer ah i remember and she winced he is a german is he notand odd  german jew i imagine and very odd should have made his fortune a dozen times over and yet has never done anything too unpractical too visionary with all his brains and scheming not a good man benita although he suits me and for the matter of that under our agreement i cannot get rid of him  how did he become your partner she asked  oh a good many years ago he turned up at the place with a doleful story said that he had been trading among the zulus he was what we call a smouse out here and got into a row with them i dont know how the end of it was that they burned his waggon looted his tradegoods and oxen and killed his servants they would have killed him too only according to his own account he escaped in a very queer fashion  how  well he says by mesmerising the chief and making the man lead him through his followers an odd story enough but i can quite believe it of jacob he worked for me for six months and showed himself very clever then one night i remember it was a few days after i had told him of the story of the portuguese treasure in matabeleland he produced £500 in bank of england notes out of the lining of his waistcoat and offered to buy a half interest in the farm yes £500 although for all those months i had believed him to be a beggar well as he was so slim and better than no company in that lonely place in the end i accepted we have done well since except for the expedition after the treasure which we did not get although we more than paid our expenses out of the ivory we bought but next time we shall succeed i am sure he added with enthusiasm that is if we can persuade those makalanga to let us search on the mountain  benita smiled  i think you had better stick to the horsebreeding she said  you shall judge when you hear the story but you have been brought up in england will you not be afraid to go to lake chrissie  afraid of what she asked  oh of the loneliness and of jacob meyer  i was born on the veld father and i have always hated london as for your odd friend mr meyer i am not afraid of any man on earth i have done with men at the least i will try the place and see how i get on  very well answered her father with a sigh of relief you can always come back cant you  yes she said indifferently i suppose that i can always come back     v  jacob meyer  more than three weeks had gone by when one morning benita who slept upon the cartel or hidestrung bed in the waggon having dressed herself as best she could in that confined place thrust aside the curtain and seated herself upon the voorkisse or drivingbox the sun was not yet up and the air was cold with frost for they were on the transvaal highveld at the end of winter even through her thick cloak benita shivered and called to the driver of the waggon who also acted as cook and whose blanketdraped form she could see bending over a fire into which he was blowing life to make haste with the coffee  by and by missieby and by he answered coughing the rank smoke from his lungs kettle no sing yet and fire black as hell  benita reflected that popular report painted this locality red but without entering into argument sat still upon the chest waiting till the water boiled and her father appeared  presently he emerged from under the side flap of the waggon where he slept and remarking that it was really too cold to think of washing climbed to her side by help of the disselboom and kissed her  how far are we now from rooi krantz father she asked for that was the name of mr cliffords farm  about forty miles dear the waggon cannot make it tonight with these two sick oxen but after the midday outspan we will ride on and be there by sundown i am afraid you are tired of this trekking  no she answered i like it very much it is so restful and i sleep sound upon that cartel i feel as though i should like to trek on for the rest of my life  so you shall if you wish dear for whole months south africa is big and when the grass grows if you still wish it we will take a long journey  she smiled but made no answer knowing that he was thinking of the place so far away where he believed that once the portuguese had buried gold  the kettle was singing now merrily enough and hans the cook lifting it from the fire in triumphfor his blowing exertions had been severepoured into it a quantity of ground coffee from an old mustard tin then having stirred the mixture with a stick he took a red ember from the fire and dropped it into the kettle a process which as travellers in the veld know well has a clearing effect upon the coffee next he produced pannikins and handed them up with a pickle jar full of sugar to mr clifford upon the waggon chest milk they had none yet that coffee tasted a great deal better than it looked indeed benita drank two cups of it to warm herself and wash down the hard biscuit before the day was over glad enough was she that she had done so  the sun was rising huge and red it looked seen through the clinging mist and their breakfast finished mr clifford gave orders that the oxen which were filling themselves with the dry grass near at hand should be got up and inspanned the voorlooper a zulu boy who had left them for a little while to share the rest of the coffee with hans rose from his haunches with a grunt and departed to fetch them a minute or two later hans ceased from his occupation of packing up the things and said in a low voice  kek baasthat is look  following the line of his outstretched hand benita and her father perceived not more than a hundred yards away from them a great troop of wilderbeeste or gnu travelling along a ridge and pausing now and again to indulge in those extraordinary gambols which cause the boers to declare that these brutes have a worm in their brains  give me my rifle hans said mr clifford we want meat  by the time that the westleyrichards was drawn from its case and loaded only one buck remained for having caught sight of the waggon it turned to stare at it suspiciously mr clifford aimed and fired down went the buck then springing to its feet again vanished behind the ridge mr clifford shook his head sadly  i dont often do that sort of thing my dear but the light is still very bad still hes hit what do you say shall we get on the horses and catch him a canter would warm you  benita who was tenderhearted reflected that it would be kinder to put the poor creature out of its pain and nodded her head five minutes later they were cantering together up the rise mr clifford having first ordered the waggon to trek on till they rejoined it and slipped a packet of cartridges into his pocket beyond the rise lay a wide stretch of marshy ground bordered by another rise half a mile or more away from the crest of whichfor now the air was clear enoughthey saw the wounded bull standing on they went after him but before they could come within shot he had moved forward once more for he was only lightly hurt in the flank and guessed whence his trouble came  again and again did he retreat as they drew near until at length just as mr clifford was about to dismount to risk a long shot the beast took to its heels in earnest  come on he said dont lets be beat for by this time the hunter was alive in him  so off they went at a gallop up slopes and down slopes that reminded benita of the bay of biscay in a storm across halfdried vleis that in the wet season were ponds through stony ground and patches of antbear holes in which they nearly came to grief for five miles at least the chase went on since at the end of winter the wilderbeeste was thin and could gallop well notwithstanding its injury faster even than their good horses at last rising a ridge they found whither it was going for suddenly they were in the midst of vast herds of game thousands and tens of thousands of them stretching as far as the eye could reach  it was a wondrous sight that now alas will be seen no moreat any rate upon the transvaal veld wilderbeeste blesbok springbok in countless multitudes and amongst them a few quagga and hartebeeste with a sound like that of thunder their flashing myriad hoofs casting up clouds of dust from the fireblackened veld the great herds separated at the appearance of their enemy man this way and that they went in groups and long brown lines leaving the wounded and exhausted wilderbeeste behind them so that presently he was the sole tenant of that great cup of land  at him they rode till mr clifford who was a little ahead of his daughter drew almost alongside then the poor maddened brute tried its last shift stopping suddenly it wheeled round and charged head down mr clifford as it came held out his rifle in his right hand and fired at a hazard the bullet passed through the bull but could not stop its charge its horns held low struck the forelegs of the horse and next instant horse man and wilderbeeste rolled on the veld together  benita who was fifty yards behind uttered a little cry of fear but before ever she reached him her father had risen laughing for he was quite unhurt the horse too was getting up but the bull could rise no more it struggled to its forefeet uttered a kind of sobbing groan stared round wildly and rolled over dead  i never knew a wilderbeeste charge like that before said mr clifford confound it i believe my horse is lamed  lamed it was indeed where the bull had struck the foreleg though as it chanced not badly having tied a handkerchief to the horn of the buck in order to scare away the vultures and thrown some tufts of dry grass upon its body which he proposed if possible to fetch or send for mr clifford mounted his lame horse and headed for the waggon but they had galloped farther than they thought and it was midday before they came to what they took to be the road as there was no spoor upon it they followed this track backwards expecting to find the waggon outspanned but although they rode for mile upon mile no waggon could they see then realizing their mistake they retraced their steps and leaving this path at the spot where they had found it struck off again to the right  meanwhile the sky was darkening and at about three oclock in the afternoon a thunderstorm broke over them accompanied by torrents of icy rain the first fall of the spring and a bitter wind which chilled them through more after the heavy rain came drizzle and a thick mist that deepened as evening approached  now their plight was very wretched lost starved soaked to the skin with tired horses one of which was lame they wandered about on the lonely veld only one stroke of fortune came to them as the sun set for a few moments its rays pierced the mist telling them in what direction they should go turning their horses they headed for it and so rode on until the darkness fell then they halted a while but feeling that if they stood still in that horrible cold they would certainly perish before morning once more pushed on again by now mr cliffords horse was almost too lame to ride so he led it walking at his daughters side and reproaching himself bitterly for his foolishness in having brought her into this trouble  it doesnt matter father she answered wearily for she was very tired nothing matters one may as well die upon the veld as in the sea or anywhere else  on they plodded they knew not whither benita fell asleep upon her saddle and was awakened once by a hyena howling quite close to them and once by her horse falling to its knees  what is the time she said at last  her father struck a match and looked at his watch it was ten oclock they had been fifteen hours away from the waggon and without food at intervals mr clifford who had remounted fired his rifle now there was but one cartridge left and having caught sight of his daughters exhausted face by the light of the match he fired this also though in that desperate wilderness there was little hope of its bringing succour  shall we stop or go on he asked  i do not care she answered only if i stop i think it will be for ever let us go on  now the rain had ceased but the mist was as dense as before also they seemed to have got among bush for wet leaves brushed their faces utterly exhausted they stumbled forward till suddenly benita felt her horse stop as though a hand had seized its bridle and heard a mans voice speaking with a foreign accent say  mein gott where are you going  i wish i knew she answered like one in a dream  at this instant the moon rose above the mists and benita saw jacob meyer for the first time  in that light his appearance was not unpleasing a man of about forty years of age not over tall slight and active in build with a pointed black beard regular semitic features a complexion of an ivory pallor which even the african sun did not seem to tan and dark lustrous eyes that appeared now to sleep and now to catch the fire of the thoughts within yet weary though she was there was something in the mans personality which repelled and alarmed benita something wild and cruel she felt that he was filled with unsatisfied ambitions and desires and that to attain to them he would shrink at nothing in a moment he was speaking again in tones that compelled her attention  it was a good thought that brought me here to look for you no not a thoughtwhat do you call itan instinct i think your mind must have spoken to my mind and called me to save you see now clifford my friend where you have led your daughter see see and he pointed downwards  they leaned forward and stared there immediately beneath them was a mighty gulf whereof the moonlight did not reveal the bottom  you are no good veld traveller clifford my friend one more step of those silly beasts and down below there would have been two red heaps with bits of bones sticking out of themyes there on the rocks five hundred feet beneath ah you would have slept soundly tonight both of you  where is the place asked mr clifford in a dazed fashion leopards kloof  yes leopards kloof no other you have travelled along the top of the hill not at the bottom certainly that was a good thought which came to me from the lady your daughter for she is one of the thought senders i am sure ah it came to me suddenly it hit me like a stick whilst i was searching for you having found that you had lost the waggon it said to me ride to the top of leopards kloof ride hard i rode hard through the rocks and the darkness through the mist and the rain and not one minute had i been here when you came and i caught the ladys bridle  i am sure we are very grateful to you murmured benita  then i am paid back ten thousand times no it is i who am gratefuli who have saved your life through the thought you sent me  thought or no thought alls well that ends well broke in mr clifford impatiently and thank heaven we are not more than three miles away from home will you lead the way jacob you always could see in the dark  yes yes and he took hold of benitas bridle with his firm white hand oh my horse will follow or put your arm through his reinso now come on miss clifford and be afraid no more with jacob meyer you are safe  so they began their descent of the hill meyer did not speak again all his attention seemed to be concentrated upon finding a safe path on which the horses would not stumble nor did benita speak she was too utterly exhaustedso exhausted indeed that she could no longer control her mind and imagination these seemed to loose themselves from her and to acquire new powers notably that of entering into the secret thoughts of the man at her side she saw them pass before her like living things and yet she could not read them still something she did understandthat she had suddenly grown important to this man not in the way in which women are generally important to men but otherwise she felt as though she had become interwoven with the objects of his life and was henceforth necessary to their fulfilment as though she were someone whom he had been seeking for years on years the one person who could give him light in his darkness  these imaginings troubled her so that she was very thankful when they passed away as swiftly as they had arisen and she knew only that she was half dead with weariness and cold that her limbs ached and that the steep path seemed endless  at length they reached level ground and after travelling along it for a while and crossing the bed of a stream passed through a gate and stopped suddenly at the door of a house with lighted windows  here is your home at last miss clifford said the musical voice of jacob meyer and i thank the fate which rules us that it has taught me to bring you to it safely  making no answer she slid from the saddle only to find that she could not stand for she sank into a heap upon the ground with a gentle exclamation he lifted her and calling to two kaffirs who had appeared to take the horses led her into the house  you must go to bed at once he said conducting her to a door which opened out of the sittingroom i have had a fire lit in your chamber in case you should come and old tante sally will bring you soup with brandy in it and hot water for your feet ah there you are old vrouw come now help the lady your mistress is all ready  all baas answered the woman a stout halfbreed with a kindly face come now my little one and i will undress you  half an hour later benita having drunk more brandy than ever she had done in her life before was wrapped up and fast asleep  when she awoke the sun was streaming through the curtained window of her room and by the light of it she saw that the clock which stood upon the mantelpiece pointed to halfpast eleven she had slept for nearly twelve hours and felt that notwithstanding the cold and exposure save for stiffness and a certain numb feeling in her headthe result perhaps of the unaccustomed brandyshe was well and what was more quite hungry  outside on the verandah she heard the voice of jacob meyer with which she seemed already to have become familiar telling some natives to stop singing as they would wake the chieftainess inside he used the zulu word inkosikaas which she remembered meant headlady or chieftainess he was very thoughtful for her she reflected and was grateful till suddenly she remembered the dislike she had taken to the man  then she looked round her room and saw that it was very pretty well furnished and papered with watercolour pictures on the walls of no mean merit things that she had not expected in this faroff place also on a table stood a great bowl of arum lilies she wondered who had put them there whether it were the old halfbreed sally or jacob meyer also she wondered who had painted the pictures which were all of african scenery and something told her that both the flowers and the pictures came from jacob meyer  on the little table by her bed was a handbell which presently she rang instantly she heard the voice of sally calling for the coffee quick and next minute the woman entered bringing a tray with it and bread and butteryes and toast and eggs which had evidently been made ready for her speaking in english mixed with dutch words she told benita that her father was still in bed but sent her his love and wished to know how she did then while she ate her breakfast with appetite sally set her a bath and subsequently appeared carrying the contents of the box she had used upon the waggon which had now arrived safely at the farm benita asked who had ordered the box to be unpacked and sally answered that the heer meyer had ordered it so that she might not be disturbed in her sleep and that her things should be ready for her when she woke  the heer meyer thinks a great deal about other people said benita  ja ja answered the old halfbreed he tink much about people when he want to tink about them but he tink most about himself baas meyer he a very clever manoh a very clever man who want to be a great man too and one day missee he be a great man great and richif the heer god almighty let him     vi  the gold coin  six weeks had gone by since the eventful evening of benitas arrival at rooi krantz now the spring had fully come the veld was emerald with grass and bright with flowers in the kloof behind the house trees had put out their leaves and the mimosas were in bloom making the air heavy with their scent amongst them the ringdoves nested in hundreds and on the steep rocks of the precipice the rednecked vultures fed their young along the banks of the stream and round the borders of the lake the piglilies bloomed a sheet of white all the place was beautiful and full of life and hope nothing seemed dead and hopeless except benitas heart  her health had quite come back to her indeed never before had she felt so strong and well but the very soul had withered in her breast all day she thought and all night she dreamed of the man who in cold blood had offered up his life to save a helpless woman and her child she wondered whether he would have done this if he had heard the answer that was upon her lips perhaps that was why she had not been given time to speak that answer which might have made a coward of him for nothing more had been heard of robert seymour indeed already the tragedy of the ship zanzibar was forgotten the dead had buried their dead and since then worse disasters had happened in the world  but benita could not bury her dead she rode about the veld she sat by the lake and watched the wild fowl or at night heard them flighting over her in flocks she listened to the cooing of the doves the booming of the bitterns in the reeds and the drumming of the snipe high in air she counted the game trekking along the ridge till her mind grew weary she sought consolation from the breast of nature and found none she sought it in the starlit skies and oh they were very far away death reigned within her who outwardly was so fair to see  in the society of her father indeed she took pleasure for he loved her and love comforted her wounded heart in that of jacob meyer also she found interest for now her first fear of the man had died away and undoubtedly he was very interesting wellbred also after a fashion although a jew who had lost his own faith and rejected that of the christians  he told her that he was a german by birth that he had been sent to england as a boy to avoid the conscription which jews dislike since in soldiering there is little profit here he had become a clerk in a house of south african merchants and as a consequencehaving shown all the ability of his racewas despatched to take charge of a branch business in cape colony what happened to him there benita never discovered but probably he had shown too much ability of an oblique nature at any rate his connection with the firm terminated and for years he became a wandering smouse or trader until at length he drifted into partnership with her father  whatever might have been his past however soon she found that he was an extremely able and agreeable man it was he and no other who had painted the watercolours that adorned her room and he could play and sing as well as he painted also as robert had told her mr meyer was very wellread in subjects that are not usually studied on the veld of south africa indeed he had quite a library of books most of them histories or philosophical and scientific works of which he would lend her volumes fiction however he never read for the reason he told her that he found life itself and the mysteries and problems which surround it so much more interesting  one evening when they were walking together by the lake watching the long lights of sunset break and quiver upon its surface benitas curiosity overcame her and she asked him boldly how it happened that such a man as he was content to live the life he did  in order that i may reach a better he answered oh no not in the skies miss clifford for of them i know nothing nor as i believe is there anything to know but herehere  what do you mean by a better life mr meyer  i mean he answered with a flash of his dark eyes great wealth and the power that wealth brings ah i see you think me very sordid and materialistic but money is god in this world miss cliffordmoney is god  she smiled and answered i fear then that he is likely to prove an invisible god on the high veld mr meyer you will scarcely make a great fortune out of horsebreeding and here there is no one to rule  do you suppose then that is why i stop at rooi krantz just to breed horses has not your father told you about the great treasure hidden away up there among the makalanga  i have heard something of it she answered with a sigh also that both of you went to look for it and were disappointed  ah the englishman who was drownedmr seymourhe spoke of it did he not he found us there  yes and you wished to shoot himdo you remember  god in heaven yes because i thought he had come to rob us well i did not shoot and afterwards we were hunted out of the place which does not much matter as those fools of natives refused to let us dig in the fortress  then why do you still think about this treasure which probably does not exist  why miss clifford do you think about various things that probably do not exist perhaps because you feel that here or elsewhere they do exist well that is what i feel about the treasure and what i have always felt it exists and i shall find itnow i shall live to see more gold than you can even imagine and that is why i still continue to breed horses on the transvaal veld ah you laugh you think it is a nightmare that i breed  then suddenly he became aware of sally who had appeared over the fold of the rise behind them and asked irritably  what is it now old vrouw  the baas clifford wants to speak with you baas jacob messengers have come to you from far away  what messengers he asked  i know not answered sally fanning her fat face with a yellow pockethandkerchief they are strange people to me and thin with travelling but they talk a kind of zulu the baas wishes you to come  will you come also miss clifford no then forgive me if i leave you and lifting his hat he went  a strange man missee said old sally when he had vanished walking very fast  yes answered benita in an indifferent voice  a very strange man went on the old woman too much in his kop and she tapped her forehead i tink it will burst one day but if it does not burst then he will be great i tell you that before now i tell it you again for i tink his time come now i go cook dinner  benita sat by the lake till the twilight fell and the wild geese began to flight over her then she walked back to the house thinking no more of heer meyer thinking only that she was weary of this place in which there was nothing to occupy her mind and distract it from its ever present sorrow  at dinner or rather supper that night she noticed that both her father and his partner seemed to be suffering from suppressed excitement of which she thought she could guess the cause  did you find your messengers mr meyer she asked when the men had lit their pipes and the squarefaceas hollands was called in those days from the shape of the bottlewas set upon the rough table of speckled buchenhout wood  yes i found them he answered they are in the kitchen now and he looked at mr clifford  benita my dear said her father rather a curious thing has happened her face lit up but he shook his head no nothing to do with the shipwreckthat is all finished still something that may interest you if you care to hear a story  benita nodded she was in a mood to hear anything that would occupy her thoughts  you know something about this treasure business went on her father well this is the tale of it years ago after you and your mother had gone to england i went on a big game shooting expedition into the interior my companion was an old fellow called tom jackson a rolling stone and one of the best elephant hunters in africa we did pretty well but the end of it was that we separated north of the transvaal i bringing down the ivory that we had shot and traded and tom stopping to put in another season the arrangement being that he was to join me afterwards and take his share of the money i came here and bought this farm from a boer who was tired of itcheap enough too for i only gave him £100 for the 6000 acres the kitchens behind were his old house for i built a new one  a year had gone by before i saw any more of tom jackson and then he turned up more dead than alive he had been injured by an elephant and lay for some months among the makalanga to the north of matabeleland where he got fever badly at a place called bambatse on the zambesi these makalanga are a strange folk i believe their name means the people of the sun at any rate they are the last of some ancient race well while he was there he cured the old molimo or hereditary highpriest of this tribe of a bad fever by giving him quinine and naturally they grew friendly the molimo lived among ruins of which there are many over all that part of south africa no one knows who built them now probably it was people who lived thousands of years ago however this molimo told tom jackson a more recent legend connected with the place  he said that six generations before when his greatgreatgreat grandfather was chief mambo he called it the natives of all that part of south africa rose against the white menportuguese i supposewho still worked the gold there they massacred them and their slaves by thousands driving them up from the southward where lobengula rules now to the zambesi by which the portuguese hoped to escape to the coast at length a remnant of them not more than about two hundred men and women arrived at the stronghold called bambatse where the molimo now lives in a great ruin built by the ancients upon an impregnable mountain which overhangs the river with them they brought an enormous quantity of gold all the storedup treasure of the land which they were trying to carry off but although they reached the river they could not escape by it since the natives who pursued them in thousands watched day and night in canoes and the poor fugitives had no boats therefore it came about that they were shut up in this fortress which it was impossible to storm and there slowly perished of starvation  when it was known that they were all dead the natives who had followed them from the south and who wanted blood and revenge not gold which was of no use to them went away but the old priests forefather who knew the secret entrance to the place and who had been friendly to the portuguese forced his way in and there amidst the dead found one woman living but mad with griefa young and beautiful girl the daughter of the portuguese lord or captain he gave her food but in the night when some strength had returned to her she left him and at daybreak he found her standing on the peak that overhangs the river dressed all in white  he called some of his councillors and they tried to persuade her to come down from the rock but she answered no her betrothed and all her family and friends were dead and it was her will to follow them then they asked where was the gold for having watched day and night they knew it had not been thrown into the river she answered that it was where it was and that seek as he might no black man would ever find it she added that she gave it into his keeping and that of his descendants to safeguard until she came again also she said that if they were faithless to that trust then it had been revealed to her from heaven above that those same savages who had killed her father and her people would kill his people also when she had spoken thus she stood a while praying on the peak then suddenly hurled herself into the river and was seen no more  from that day to this the ruin has been held to be haunted and save the molimo himself who retires there to meditate and receive revelations from the spirits no one is allowed to set a foot in its upper part indeed the natives would rather die than do so consequently the gold still remains where it was hidden this place itself tom jackson did not see since notwithstanding his friendship for him the molimo refused to allow him to enter there  well tom never recovered he died here and is buried in the little graveyard behind the house which the boers made for some of their people it was shortly before his death that mr meyer became my partner for i forgot to say that i had told him the story and we determined to have a try for that great wealth you know the rest we trekked to bambatse pretending to be traders and found the old molimo who knew of me as having been tom jacksons friend we asked him if the story he had told to jackson were true and he answered that surely as the sun shone in the heavens it was trueevery word of itfor it and much more than he had spoken of had been handed down from father to son and that they even knew the name of the white lady who had killed herself it was ferreirayour mothers name benita though a common one enough in south africa  we asked him to allow us to enter the topmost stronghold which stands upon the hill but he refused saying that the curse still lay upon him and his and that no man should enter until the lady ferreira came again for the rest the place was free to us we might dig as we would so we did dig and found some gold buried with the ancients beads and bangles and wireabout £100 worth alsothat was on the day when the young seymours came upon us and accounts for meyers excitement for he thought that we were on the track of the treasurewe found a single gold coin no doubt one that had been dropped by the portuguese here it is and he threw a thin piece of gold on the table before her i have shown it to a man learned in those matters and he says that it is a ducat struck by one of the doges of venice  well we never found any more the end of it was that the makalanga caught us trying to get in to the secret stronghold by stealth and gave us the choice of clearing out or being killed so we cleared out for treasure is not of much use to dead men  mr clifford ceased speaking and filled his pipe while meyer helped himself to squareface in an absent manner as for benita she stared at the quaint old coin which had a hole in it wondering with what scenes of terror and of bloodshed it had been connected  keep it said her father it will go on that bracelet of yours  thank you dear she answered though i dont know why i should take all the portuguese treasure since we shall never see any more of it  why not miss clifford asked meyer quickly  the story tells you whybecause the natives wont even let you look for it also looking and finding are different things  natives change their minds sometimes miss clifford that story is not done it is only begun and now you shall hear its second chapter clifford may i call in the messengers and without waiting for an answer he rose and left the room  neither mr clifford nor his daughter said anything after he had gone benita appeared to occupy herself in fixing the broad gold coin to a little swivel on her bracelet but while she did so once more that sixth sense of hers awoke within her as she had been afraid at the dinner on the doomed steamer so again she was afraid again death and great fear cast their advancing shadows on to her soul that piece of gold seemed to speak to her yet alas she could not understand its story only she knew that her father and jacob meyer andyes yes yesrobert seymour had all a part in that tragedy oh how could that be when he was dead how could this gold link him to her she knew notshe cared not all she knew was that she would follow this treasure to the edge of the world and if need be over it if only it brought her back to him again     vii  the messengers  the door opened and through it came jacob meyer followed by three natives benita did not see or hear them her soul was far away there at the head of the room clad all in white for she wore no mourning save in her heart illuminated by the rays of the lamp that hung above her she stood still and upright for she had risen on the face and in her wide dark eyes a look that was very strange to see jacob meyer perceived it and stopped the three natives perceived it also and stopped there they stood all four of them at the end of the long sittingroom staring at the white benita and at her haunted eyes  one of the natives pointed with his thin finger to her face and whispered to the others meyer who understood their tongue caught the whisper it was  behold the spirit of the rock  what spirit and what rock he asked in a low voice  she who haunts bambatse she whom our eyes have seen answered the man still staring at benita  benita heard the whispering and knew it was about herself though not one word of it did she catch with a sigh she shook herself free from her visions and sat down in a chair close by then one by one the messengers drew near to her and each as he came made a profound obeisance touching the floor with his fingertips and staring at her face but her father they only saluted with an uplifted hand she looked at them with interest and indeed they were interesting in their way tall spare men light coloured with refined mobile faces here was no negroblood but rather that of some ancient people such as egyptians or phoenicians men whose forefathers had been wise and civilized thousands of years ago and perchance had stood in the courts of pharaoh or of solomon  their salutations finished the three men squatted in a line upon the floor drawing their fur karosses or robes about them and waited in silence jacob meyer thought a while then said  clifford will you translate to your daughter so that she may be sure she is told exactly what passes  next he turned and addressed the natives  your names are tamas tamala and hoba and you tamas are the son of the molimo of bambatse who is called mambo and you tamala and hoba are his initiated councillors is it so  they bowed their heads  good you tamas tell the story and give again your message that this lady the lady benita may hear it for she has a part in the matter  we understand that she has a part answered tamas we read in her face that she has the greatest part doubtless it is of her that the spirit told my father these spoken by my mouth are the words of the molimo my father which we have travelled so far to deliver  when you two white men visited bambatse four years ago you asked of me mambo to be admitted to the holy place that you might look for the treasure there which the portuguese hid in the time of my ancestor in the sixth generation i refused to allow you to look or even to enter the holy place because i am by birth the guardian of that treasure although i know not where it lies but now i am in a great strait i have news that lobengula the usurper who is king of the matabele has taken offence against me for certain reasons among them that i did not send him a sufficient tribute it is reported to me that he purposes next summer to despatch an impi to wipe me and my people out and to make my kraal black as the burnt veld i have little strength to resist him who is mighty and my people are not warlike from generation to generation they have been traders cultivators of the land workers in metal and men of peace who desire not to kill or be killed also they are few therefore i have no power to stand against lobengula  i remember the guns that you and your companion brought with you which can kill things from far away if i had a supply of those guns from behind my walls i might defy the impi of lobengula whose warriors use the assegai if you will bring me a hundred good guns and plenty of powder and bullets for them it is revealed to me that it will be lawful for me to admit you to the secret holy place where you may look for the buried gold for as long as you wish and if you can find it take it all away without hindrance from me or my people but i will be honest with you that gold will never be found save by the one appointed the white lady said so in the time of my forefather he heard it with his ears and i have heard it from his descendants with my ears and so it shall be still if you bring the guns you can come and see if either of you is that one appointed but i do not think that any man is so appointed for the secret is hid in woman but of this you can learn for yourselves i do but speak as i am bidden  this is my message spoken by my mouth tamas son of my body and my councillors who go with him will bear witness that he speaks the truth i mambo the molimo of bambatse send you greeting and will give you good welcome and fulfil my promise if you come with the farshooting guns ten times ten of them and the powder and the bullets wherewith i may drive off the matabele but not otherwise my son tamas and my councillors will drive your waggon into my country but you must bring no strange servants the spirit of the white woman who killed herself before the eyes of my forefather has been seen of late standing upon the point of rock also she has visited me at night in my secret place where her companions died i do not know all that this portends but i think that amongst other things she wished to tell me that the matabele are about to attack us i await the decree of the heavens i send you two karosses as a gift and a little ancient gold since ivory is too heavy for my messengers to carry and i have no waggon farewell  we have heard you said meyer when mr clifford had finished translating and we wish to ask you a question what do you mean when you say that the spirit of the white woman has been seen  i mean what i say white man answered tamas she was seen by all three of us standing upon the pinnacle at the dawn also my father saw and spoke with her alone in his sleep at night this is the third time in my fathers day that she has appeared thus and always before some great event  what was she like asked meyer  like oh like the lady who sits yonder yes quite the same or so it seemed to us but who knows we have seen no other white women and we were not very near let the lady come and stand side by side with the spirit so that we can examine them both and we shall be able to answer better do you accept the offer of the molimo  we will tell you tomorrow morning replied meyer a hundred rifles are many to find and will cost much money meanwhile for you there is food and a sleepingplace  the three men seemed disappointed at his answer which they evidently believed to be preliminary to a refusal for a moment or two they consulted together then tamas put his hand into a pouch and drew from it something wrapped in dry leaves which he undid revealing a quaint and beautiful necklace fashioned of twisted gold links wherein were set white stones that they had no difficulty in recognising as uncut diamonds of considerable value from this necklace also hung a crucifix moulded in gold  we offer this gift he said on behalf of mambo my father to the lady yonder to whom the karosses and the rough gold are of no use the chain has a story when the portuguese lady hurled herself into the river she wore it about her neck as she fell into the river she struck against a little point of rock which tore the chain away from hersee where it is broken and mended with gold wire it remained upon the point of rock and my forefather took it thence it is a gift to the lady if she will promise to wear it  accept it muttered mr clifford when he had finished translating this or you will give offence  so benita said i thank the molimo and accept his gift  then tamas rose and advancing cast the ancient tragic thing over her head as it fell upon her shoulders benita knew that it was a chain of destiny drawing her she knew not where this ornament that had last been worn by that woman bereaved and unhappy as herself who could find no refuge from her sorrow except in death had she felt it torn from her breast she wondered as she the living benita of today felt it fall upon her own  the three envoys rose bowed and went leaving them alone jacob meyer lifted his head as though to address her then changed his mind and was silent both the men waited for her to speak but she would not and in the end it was her father who spoke first  what do you say benita he asked anxiously  i i have nothing to say except that i have heard a very curious story this priests message is to you and mr meyer father and must be answered by you what have i to do with it  a great deal i think my dear or so those men seemed to believe at any rate i cannot go up there without you and i will not take you there against your wish for it is a long way off and a queer business the question is will you go  she thought a space while the two men watched her anxiously  yes she answered at length in a quiet voice i will go if you wish to go not because i want to find treasure but because the story and the country where it happened interest me indeed i dont believe much in the treasure even if they are superstitious and afraid to look for it themselves i doubt whether they would allow you to look if they thought it could be found to me the journey does not seem a good business speculation also there are risks  we think it good enough broke in meyer decidedly and one does not expect to get millions without trouble  yes yes said her father but she is rightthere are risks great risksfever wild beasts savages and others that one cannot foresee have i a right to expose her to them ought we not to go alone  it would be useless answered meyer those messengers have seen your daughter and mixed her up with their superstitious story of a ghost of which i who know that there are no such things believe nothing without her now we shall certainly fail  as for the risks father said benita personally i take no account of them for i am sure that what is to happen will happen and if i knew that i was to die upon the zambesi it would make no difference to me who do not care but as it chances i thinki cannot tell you whythat you and mr meyer are in more danger than i am it is for you to consider whether you will take the risks  mr clifford smiled i am old he said that is my answer  and i am accustomed to such things said meyer with a shrug of his shoulders who would not run a little danger for the sake of such a glorious chance wealth wealth more wealth than we can dream of and with it powerpower to avenge to reward to buy position and pleasure and all beautiful things which are the heritage of the very rich alone and he spread out his hands and looked upwards as though in adoration of this golden god  except such trifles as health and happiness commented benita not without sarcasm for this man and his material desires disgusted her somewhat especially when she contrasted him with another man who was lost to her though it was true that his past had been idle and unproductive enough yet they interested her also for benita had never met anyone like mr meyer so talented so eager and so soulless  then i understand it is settled she said  mr clifford hesitated but meyer answered at once  yes settled as far as anything can be  she waited a moment for her father to speak but he said nothing his chance had gone by  very well now we shall not need to trouble ourselves with further doubts or argument we are going to bambatse on the zambesi a distant place to look for buried gold and i hope mr meyer that if you find it the results will come up to your expectations and bring you all sorts of good luck goodnight father dear goodnight  my daughter thinks it will bring us illluck said mr clifford when the door had closed behind her that is her way of saying so  yes answered meyer gloomily she thinks that and she is one of those who have vision well she may be wrong also the question is shall we seize our opportunity and its dangers or remain here and breed bad horses all our lives while she who is not afraid laughs at us i am going to bambatse  again mr clifford made no direct answer only asked a question  how long will it take to get the guns and ammunition and what will they cost  about a week from wakkerstroom replied meyer old potgieter the trader there has just imported a hundred martinis and a hundred westleyrichards fallingblocks fifty of each with ten thousand rounds of cartridges will cost about £600 and we have as much as that in the bank also we have the new waggon and plenty of good oxen and horses we can take a dozen of the horses with us and sell them in the north of the transvaal for a fine price before we get into the tetsefly belt the oxen will probably carry us through as they are most of them salted  you have thought it all out jacob i see but it means a lot of money one way and another to say nothing of other things  yes a lot of money and those rifles are too good for kaffirs birmingham gaspipes would have done for them but there are none to be had but what is the money and what are the guns compared to all they will bring us  i think you had better ask my daughter jacob she seems to have her own ideas upon the subject  miss clifford has made up her mind and it will not change i shall ask her no more replied meyer  then he too left the room to give orders about the journey to wakkerstroom that he must take upon the morrow but mr clifford sat there till past midnight wondering whether he had done right and if they would find the treasure of which he had dreamed for years and what the future had in store for them  if only he could have seen   when benita came to breakfast the next morning she asked where mr meyer was and learned that he had already departed for wakkerstroom  certainly he is in earnest she said with a laugh  yes answered her father jacob is always in earnest though somehow his earnestness has not brought him much good so far if we fail it will not be want of thought and preparation on his part  nearly a week went by before meyer returned again and meanwhile benita made ready for her journey in the intervals of her simple preparations also she talked a good deal with the help of her father to the three sturdylooking makalanga who were resting thankfully after their long journey their conversation was general since by tacit consent no further mention was made of the treasure or of anything to do with it but it enabled her to form a fair opinion of them and their people she gathered that although they spoke a dialect of zulu they had none of the bravery of the zulus and indeed lived in deadly terror of the matabele who are bastard zulussuch terror in fact that she greatly doubted whether the hundred rifles would be of much use to them should they ever be attacked by that tribe  they were what their fathers had been before them agriculturists and workers in metalsnot fighting men also she set herself to learn what she could of their tongue which she did not find difficult for benita had a natural aptitude for languages and had never forgotten the dutch and zulu she used to prattle as a child which now came back to her very fast indeed she could already talk fairly in either of those languages especially as she spent her spare hours in studying their grammar and reading them  so the days went on till one evening jacob meyer appeared with two scotch carts laden with ten long boxes that looked like coffins and other smaller boxes which were very heavy to say nothing of a multitude of stores as mr clifford prophesied he had forgotten nothing for he even brought benita various articles of clothing and a revolver for which she had not asked  three days later they trekked away from rooi krantz upon a peculiarly beautiful sunday morning in the early spring giving it out that they were going upon a trading and shooting expedition in the north of the transvaal benita looked back at the pretty little stead and the wooded kloof behind it over which she had nearly fallen and the placid lake in front of it where the nesting wildfowl wheeled and sighed for to her now that she was leaving it the place seemed like home and it came into her mind that she would never see it any more     viii  bambatse  nearly four months had gone by when at length the waggon with which were mr clifford benita and jacob meyer camped one night within the country of the molimo of bambatse whose name was mambo or perhaps that was his title since according to tamas his son every chief in succession was called mambo though not all of them were molimos or representatives and prophets of god or the great spirit whom they knew as munwali thus sometimes the molimo or priest of munwali and the mambo or chief were different persons for instance he said that he tamas would be mambo on his fathers death but no visions were given to him therefore as yet at any rate he was not called to be molimo  in the course of this long journey they had met with many adventures such as were common to african travellers before the days of railroads adventures with wild beasts and native tribes adventures with swollen rivers also and one that was worst with thirst since for three days owing to the failure of a pit or pan where they expected to find water they were obliged to go without drink still none of these were very serious nor had any of the three of them ever been in better health than they were at this moment for by good luck they had escaped all fever indeed their rough wild life had agreed with benita extraordinarily well so well that any who had known her in the streets of london would scarcely have recognized her as the sunburnt active and wellformed young woman who sat that night by the camp fire  all the horses they had brought with them had been sold except some which had died and three that were salted or proof against the deadly horse sickness which they took on with them their own servants also had been sent back to rooi krantz in charge of a scotch cart laden with ivory purchased from boer hunters who had brought it down from the north of the transvaal therefore for this was part of the bargain the three makalanga were now their only attendants who drove and herded the cattle while benita cooked the food which the two white men shot or sometimes bought from natives  for days they had been passing through a country that was practically deserted and now having crossed a high nek the same on which robert seymour had left his waggon they were camped in low land which as they could see by the remains of walls that appeared everywhere had once been extensively enclosed and cultivated to their right was a rising mountainous ground beyond which said the makalanga ran the zambesi and in front of them not more than ten miles away a great isolated hill none other than that place that they had journeyed so far to reach bambatse round which flowed the great river indeed thither one of the three makalanga he who was named hoba had gone on to announce their approach  they had outspanned amongst ruins most of them circular in shape and benita studying them in the bright moonlight guessed that once these had been houses that place now so solitary hundreds or thousands of years ago was undoubtedly the home of a great population thousands rather than hundreds she thought since close at hand in the middle of one of these round houses grew a mighty baobab tree that could not have seen less than ten or fifteen centuries since the seed whence it sprang pierced the cement floor which was still visible about its giant bole  tamas the molimos son saw her studying these evidences of antiquity and approaching saluted her  lady he said in his own language which by now she spoke very well ladyand he waved his hand with a fine gesturebehold the city of my people  how do you know that it was their city she asked  i do not know lady stones cannot speak the spirits are silent and we have forgotten still i think so and our fathers have told us that but six or eight generations ago many folk lived here though it was not they who built these walls even fifty years ago there were many but now the matabele have killed them and we are few tomorrow you will see how few come here and look and he led her through the entrance of a square cattle kraal which stood close by within were tufts of rank grass and a few bushes and among these scores of skulls and other bones  the matabele killed these in the time of moselikatse he said now do you wonder that we who remain fear the matabele and desire guns to defend ourselves from them even if we must sell our secrets in order to buy those guns who have no money to pay for them  no she answered looking at the tall dignified man into whose soul the irons of fear and slavery had burnt so deep no i do not wonder  next morning at daybreak they trekked on always through these evidences of dead forgotten people they had not more than ten miles to cover to reach their long journeys end but the road if so it could be called ran uphill and the oxen whereof only fourteen were now left to drag the heavyladen waggon were thin and footsore so that their progress was very slow indeed it was past midday when at length they began to enter what by apology might be called the town of bambatse  when we go away from this it will have to be by water i think unless we can buy trekcattle said meyer looking at the labouring oxen with a doubtful eye  why asked mr clifford anxiously  because several of those beasts have been bitten by tetsefly like my horse and the poison is beginning to work i thought so last night but now i am sure look at their eyes it was down in that bit of bush veld eight days ago i said that we ought not to camp there  at this moment they came to the crest of the ridge and on its further side saw the wonderful ruins of bambatse close at hand in front of them stood a hill jutting out as it were into the broad waters of the zambesi river which to a great extent protected it upon three sides the fourth that opposite to them except at one place where a kind of natural causeway led into the town was also defended by nature since here for more than fifty feet in height the granite rock of the base of the hill rose sheer and unclimbable on the mount itself that in all may have covered eight or ten acres of ground and surrounded by a deep donga or ditch were three rings of fortifications set one above the other mighty walls which it was evident had been built by no modern hand looking at them benita could well understand how it came about that the poor fugitive portuguese had chosen this as their last place of refuge and were overcome at length not by the thousands of savages who followed and surrounded them but by hunger indeed the place seemed impregnable to any force that was not armed with siege guns  on the hither side of this natural fosse which doubtless in ancient times had been filled with water led from the zambesi stood the village of the bambatse makalanga a collection of seventy or eighty wretched huts round like those of their forefathers but built of mud and thatch about them lay the gardens or square fields that were well cultivated and at this season rich with ripening corn benita however could see no cattle and concluded therefore that these must be kept on the hill for safety and within its walls  down the rough road they lumbered and through the village where the few women and children stared at them in a frightened way then they came to the causeway which on its further side was blocked with thorns and rough stones taken from the ruins while they waited for these to be removed by some men who now appeared benita looked at the massive circular wall still thirty or forty feet in height by perhaps twenty through its base built of granite blocks without mortar and ornamented with quaint patterns of other coloured stones in its thickness she could see grooves where evidently had once been portcullises but these had disappeared long ago  it is a wonderful place she said to her father i am glad that i came have you been all over it  no only between the first and second walls and once between the second and third the old temple or whatever it is is on the top and into that they would never admit us it is there that the treasure lies  that the treasure is supposed to lie she answered with a smile but father what guarantee have you that they will do so now perhaps they will take the guns and show us the dooror rather the gate  your daughter is right there is none and before a box is taken off the waggon we must get one said meyer oh i know it is risky and it would have been better to make sure first but it is too late to talk of that now look the stones are cleared trek ontrek  the long waggonwhip cracked the poor tiredout oxen strained at the yokes and on they went through the entrance of that fateful fortress that was but just wide enough to admit them inside lay a great open space which as they could see from the numerous ruins had once been filled with buildings that now were half hidden by grass trees and creepers this was the outer ring of the temple where in ancient days the priests and captains had their home travelling across it for perhaps a hundred and fifty yards they came near the second wall which was like the first only not quite so solid and saw that on a stretch of beaten ground and seated in the shadow for the day was hot the people of bambatse were gathered to greet them  when within fifty yards they dismounted from the horses which were left with the waggon in the charge of the makalanga tamala then benita taking her position between her father and jacob meyer they advanced towards the ring of natives of whom there may have been two hundredall of them adult men  as they came except one figure who remained seated with his back against the wall the human circle stood up as a token of respect and benita saw that they were of the same stamp as the messengerstall and goodlooking with melancholy eyes and a cowed expression wearing the appearance of people who from day to day live in dread of slavery and death opposite to them was a break in the circle through which tamas led them and as they crossed it benita felt that all those people were staring at her with their sad eyes a few paces from where the man crouched against the wall his head hidden by a beautifully worked blanket that was thrown over it were placed three wellcarved stools upon these at a motion from tamas they sat themselves down and as it was not dignified for them to speak first remained silent  be patient and forgive said tamas at length my father mambo prays to the munwali and the spirits of his fathers that this coming of yours may be fortunate and that a vision of those things that are to be may descend upon him  benita feeling nearly two hundred pairs of eyes concentrated upon her wished that the vision might come quickly but after a minute or two fell into tune with the thing and almost enjoyed this strange experience those mighty ancient walls built by hands unknown which had seen so much history and so much death the silent triple ring of patient solemn men the last descendants of a cultured race the crouching figure hidden beneath the blanket who imagined himself to be communicating with his godit was all very strange very well worth the seeing to one who had wearied of the monotony of civilization  look the man stirred and threw back his blanket revealing a head white with age a spiritual ascetic face so thin that every bone showed in it and dark eyes which stared upwards unseeingly like those of a person in a trance thrice he sighed while his tribesmen watched him then he let his eyes fall upon the three white people seated in front of him first he looked at mr clifford and his face grew troubled then at jacob meyer and it was anxious and alarmed lastly he stared at benita and while he did so the dark eyes became calm and happy  white maiden he said in a soft low voice for you at least i have good tidings though death come near to you though you see him on your right hand and your left and in front of you and behind you i say fear not here you who have known deep sorrow shall find happiness and rest o maiden with whom goes the spirit of one pure and fair as you who died so long ago  then while benita wondered at his words spoken with such sweet earnestness that although she believed nothing of them they brought a kind of comfort to her he looked once more at her father and jacob meyer and as it were with an effort was silent  have you no pleasant prophecy for me old friend said jacob who have come so far to hear it  at once the aged face grew inscrutable all expression vanished behind a hundred wrinkles and he answered  none white mannone that i am charged to deliver search the skies for yourself you who are so wise and read them if you can lords he went on in another voice i greet you in the name and presence of my children son tamas i greet you also you have done your mission well listen nowyou are weary and would rest and eat still bear with me for i have a word to say look around you you see all my tribe not twenty times ten above the age of boys we who once were countless as the leaves on yonder trees in spring why are we dead because of the amandabele those fierce dogs whom two generations ago moselikatse the general of chaka brought up to the south of us who ravish us and kill us year by year  we are not warlike we who have outlived war and the lust of slaying we are men of peace who desire to cultivate the land and to follow our arts which have descended to us from our ancestors and to worship the heavens above us whither we depart to join the spirits of our forefathers but they are fierce and strong and savage and they come up and murder our children and old people and take away the young women and the maidens to be slaves and with them all our cattle where are our cattle lobengula chief of the amandabele has them scarce a cow is left to give milk to the sick or to the motherless babe and yet he sends for cattle tribute say his messengers deliver tribute or my impi will come and take it with your lives but we have no cattleall are gone we have nothing left to us but this ancient mountain and the works built thereon and a little corn on which we live yes i say iti the molimoi whose ancestors were great kingsi who have still more wisdom in me than all the hosts of the amandabele and as he spoke the old mans grey head sank upon his breast and the tears ran down his withered cheeks while his people answered  mambo it is true  now listen again he went on lobengula threatens us therefore i sent to these white men who were here before saying that if they would bring me a hundred guns and powder and ball to enable us to beat off the amandabele from behind these strong walls of ours i would take them into the secret holy place where for six generations no white man has set a foot and there suffer them to search for the treasure which is hid therein no man knows where that treasure which they asked leave to find four winters gone we refused it then and drove them hence because of the curse laid upon us by the white maid who died the last of the portuguese who foretold her peoples fate for us if we gave up the buried gold save to one appointed my children the spirit of bambatse has visited me i have seen her and others have seen her and in my sleep she said to me suffer the men to come and search for with them is one of the blood to whom my peoples wealth is given and great is your danger for many spears draw nigh my children i sent my son and other messengers on a far journey to where i knew the men dwelt and they have returned after many months bringing those men with them bringing with them also another of whom i knew nothingyes her who is appointed her of whom the spirit spoke  then he lifted his withered hand and held it towards benita saying i tell you that yonder she sits for whom the generations have waited  it is so answered the makalanga it is the white lady come again to take her own  friends asked the molimo while they wondered at his strange speech tell me have you brought the guns  surely answered mr clifford they are there in the waggon every one of them the best that can be made and with them ten thousand cartridges bought at a great cost we have fulfilled our share of the bargain now will you fulfil yours or shall we go away again with the guns and leave you to meet the matabele with your assegais  say you the agreement while we listen answered the molimo  good said mr clifford it is this that you shall find us food and shelter while we are with you that you shall lead us into the secret place at the head of the hill where the portuguese died and the gold is hidden that you shall allow us to search for that gold when and where we will that if we discover the gold or anything else of value to us you shall suffer us to take it away and assist us upon our journey either by giving us boats and manning them to travel down the zambesi or in whatever fashion may be most easy that you shall permit none to hurt molest or annoy us during our sojourn among you is that our contract  not quite all of it said the molimo there is this to add first that you shall teach us how to use the guns secondly that you shall search for and find the treasure if so it is appointed without our help since in this matter it is not lawful for us to meddle thirdly that if the amandabele should chance to attack us while you are here you shall do your best to assist us against their power  do you then expect attack asked meyer suspiciously  white man we always expect attack is it a bargain  yes answered mr clifford and jacob meyer in one voice the latter adding the guns and the cartridges are yours lead us now to the hidden place we have fulfilled our part we trust to the honour of you and all your people to fulfil yours  white maiden asked the molimo addressing benita do you also say that it is a bargain  what my father says i say  good said the molimo then in the presence of my people and in the name of the munwali i mambo who am his prophet declare that it is so agreed between us and may the vengeance of the heavens fall upon those who break our pact let the oxen of the white men be outspanned their horses fed their waggon unloaded that we may count the guns let food be brought into the guesthouse also and after they have eaten i who alone of all of you have ever entered it will lead them to the holy place that there they may begin to search for that which the white men desire from age to ageto find it if they can if not to depart satisfied and at peace     ix  the oath of maduna  mr clifford and meyer rose to return to the waggon in order to superintend the unyoking of the oxen and to give directions as to their herding and the offsaddling of the horses benita rose also wondering when the food that had been promised would be ready for she was hungry meanwhile the molimo was greeting his son tamas patting his hand affectionately and talking to him when suddenly benita who watched this domestic scene with interest heard a commotion behind her turning to discover its cause she perceived three great man clad in full war panoply shields on their left arms spears in their right hands black ostrich plumes rising from the polished rings woven in their hair black moochas about their middles and black oxtails tied beneath their knees who marched through the throng of makalanga as though they saw them not  the matabele the matabele are on us cried a voice while other voices shouted fly to your walls and yet others kill them they are few  but the three men marched on unheeding till they stood before mambo  who are you and what do you seek the old man asked boldly though the fear that had taken hold of him at the sight of these strangers was evident enough for his whole body shook  surely you should know chief of bambatse answered their spokesman with a laugh for you have seen the like of us before we are the children of lobengula the great elephant the king the black bull the father of the amandabele and we have a message for your ear little old man which finding that you leave your gate open we have walked in to deliver  speak your message then envoys of lobengula in my ear and in those of my people said the molimo  your people are these all your people the spokesman replied contemptuously why then what need was there for the indunas of the king to send so large an impi under a great general against you when a company of lads armed with sticks would have served the turn we thought that these were but the sons of your house the men of your own family whom you had called together to eat with the white strangers  close the entrance in the wall cried the molimo stung to fury by the insult and a voice answered  father it is already done  but the matabele who should have been frightened only laughed again and their spokesman said  see my brothers he thinks to trap us who are but three well kill on old wizard if you will but know that if a hand is lifted this spear of mine goes through your heart and that the children of lobengula die hard know also that then the impi which waits not far away will destroy you every one man and woman youth and maiden little ones who hold the hand and infants at the breast none shall be leftnone at all to say here once lived the cowardly makalanga of bambatse nay be not foolish but talk softly with us so that perhaps we may spare your lives  then the three men placed themselves back to back in such fashion that they faced every way and could not be smitten down from behind and waited  i do not kill envoys said the molimo but if they are foulmouthed i throw them out of my walls your message men of the amandabele  i hear you hearken now to the word of lobengula  then the envoy began to speak using the pronoun i as though it were the matabele king himself who spoke to his vassal the makalanga chief i sent to you last year you slave who dare to call yourself mambo of the makalanga demanding a tribute of cattle and women and warning you that if they did not come i would take them they did not come but that time i spared you now i send again hand over to my messengers fifty cows and fifty oxen with herds to drive them and twelve maidens to be approved by them or i wipe you out who have troubled the earth too long and that before another moon has waned  those are the words of lobengula he concluded and taking the horn snuffbox from the slit in his ear helped himself then insolently passed it to the molimo  so great was the old chiefs rage that forgetting his selfcontrol he struck the box from the hand of his tormentor to the ground where the snuff lay spilled  just so shall the blood of your people be spilled through your rash foolishness said the messenger calmly as he picked up the box and as much of the snuff as he could save  hearken said the molimo in a thin trembling voice your king demands cattle knowing that all the cattle are gone that scarce a cow is left to give drink to a motherless babe he asks for maidens also but if he took those he seeks we should have none left for our young men to marry and why is this so it is because the vulture lobengula has picked us to the bone yes while we are yet alive he has torn the flesh from us year by year his soldiers have stolen and killed till at last nothing is left of us and now he seeks what we have not got to give in order that he may force a quarrel upon us and murder us there is nought left for us to give lobengula you have your answer  indeed replied the envoy with a sneer how comes it then that yonder i see a waggon laden with goods and oxen in the yokes yes he repeated with meaning with goods whereof we have known the like at buluwayo for lobengula also sometimes buys guns from white men o little makalanga come now give us the waggon with its load and the oxen and the horses and though it be but a small gift we will take it away and ask nothing more this year  how can i give you the property of my guests the white men asked the molimo get you gone and do your worst or you shall be thrown from the walls of the fortress  good but know that very soon we shall return and make an end of you who are tired of these long and troublesome journeys to gather so little go tend your corn dwellers in bambatse for this i swear in the name of lobengula never shall you see it ripen more  now the crowd of listening makalanga trembled at his words but in the old molimo they seemed only to rouse a storm of prophetic fury for a moment he stood staring up at the blue sky his arms outstretched as though in prayer then he spoke in a new voicea clear quiet voice that did not seem to be his own  who am i he said i am the molimo of the bambatse makalanga i am the ladder between them and heaven i sit on the topmost bough of the tree under which they shelter and there in the crest of the tree munwali speaks with me what to you are winds to me are voices whispering in my spirits ears once my forefathers were great kings they were mambos of all the land and that is still my name and dignity we lived in peace we laboured we did wrong to no man then you zulu savages came upon us from the southeast and your path was red with blood year after year you robbed and you destroyed you raided our cattle you murdered our men you took our maidens and our children to be your women and your slaves until at length of all this pit filled with the corn of life there is left but a little handful and this you say you will eat up also lest it should fall into good ground and grow again i tell you that i think it will not be so but whether or no that happens i have words for the ear of your kinga message for a message say to him that thus speaks the wise old molimo of bambatse  i see him hunted like a wounded hyena through the rivers in the deep bush and over the mountain i see him die in pain and misery but his grave i see not for no man shall know it i see the white man take his land and all his wealth yea to them and to no son of his shall his people give the bayéte the royal salute of his greatness and his power this alone shall remain to hima name accursed from generation to generation and last of all i see peace upon the land and upon my childrens children he paused then added for you cruel dog that you are this message also from the munwali by the lips of his molimo i lift no hand against you but you shall not live to look again upon your kings face begone now and do your worst  for a moment the three matabele seemed to be frightened and benita heard one of them say to his companions  the wizard has bewitched us he has bewitched the great elephant and all his people shall we kill him  but quickly shaking off his fears their spokesman laughed and answered  so that is what you have brought the white people here for old traitorto plot against the throne of lobengula  he wheeled round and stared at mr clifford and jacob meyer then added  good greybeard and blackbeard i myself will put you both to such a death as you have never heard of and as for the girl since she is well favoured she shall brew the kings beer and be numbered amongst the kings wivesunless indeed he is pleased to give her to me  in an instant the thing was done at the mans words about benita meyer who had been listening to his threats and bombast unconcerned suddenly seemed to awake his dark eyes flashed his pale face turned cruel snatching the revolver from his belt he seemed to point and fire it with one movement and downdead or dyingwent the matabele  men did not stir they only stared accustomed as they were to death in that wild land the suddenness of this deed surprised them the contrast between the splendid brutal savage who had stood before them a moment ago and the limp black thing going to sleep upon the ground was strange enough to move their imaginations there he lay and there over him the smoking pistol in his hand meyer stood and laughed  benita felt that the act was just and the awful punishment deserved yet that laugh of jacobs jarred upon her for in it she thought she heard the mans heart speaking and oh its voice was merciless surely justice should not laugh when her sword falls  behold now said the molimo in his still voice pointing at the dead matabele with his finger do i speak lies or is it true that this man shall not look more upon his kings face well as it was with the servant so it shall be with the lord only more slowly it is the decree of the munwali spoken by the voice of his mouth the molimo of bambatse go children of lobengula and bear with you as an offering this firstfruit of the harvest that the white men shall reap among the warriors of his people  the thin voice died away and there was silence so intense that benita thought she heard the scraping of the feet of a green lizard which crept across a stone a yard or two away  then of a sudden it ended of a sudden the two remaining matabele turned and fled for their lives and as when dogs run a flock of sheep will wheel about and pursue them so did the makalanga they grabbed at the messengers with their hands tearing their finery from them they struck them with sticks they pounded them with stones till at length two bruised and bleeding men finding all escape cut off and led perhaps by some instinct staggered back to where benita stood horrified at this dreadful scene and throwing themselves upon the ground clutched at her dress and prayed for mercy  move a little miss clifford said meyer three of those brutes will not weigh heavier than one upon my conscience  no no you shall not she answered mambo these men are messengers spare them  hearken to the voice of pity said the old prophet spoken in a place where pity never was and not in vain let them go give mercy to the merciless for she buys their lives with a prayer  they will bring the others on us muttered tamas and even old mr clifford shook his head sadly but the molimo only said  i have spoken let them go that which will befall must befall and from this deed no ill shall come that would not have come otherwise  you hear depart swiftly said benita in zulu  with difficulty the two men dragged themselves to their feet and supporting each other stood before her one of them a clever powerfulfaced man whose black hair was tinged with grey addressing himself to benita gasped  hear me that fool there and he pointed to his dead companion whose boasting brought his death upon him was but a low fellow i who kept silence and let him talk am maduna a prince of the royal house who justly deserve to die because i turned my back upon these dogs yet i and my brother here take life at your hands lady who now that i have had time to think would refuse it at theirs for whether i stay or go does not matter the impi waits the slayers are beneath the walls those things which are decreed will happen there yonder old wizard speaks true listen lady should it chance that you have cause to demand two lives at the hands of maduna in his own name and the name of his king he promises them to you in safety shall they pass they and all that is theirs without toll taken remember the oath of maduna lady in the hour of your need and do you my brother bear witness to it among our people  then straightening themselves as well as they were able these two sorely hurt men lifted their right arms and gave benita the salute due to a chieftainess this done taking no note of any other creature there they limped away to the gate that had been opened for them and vanished beyond the wall  all this while meyer had stood silent now he spoke with a bitter smile  charity miss clifford said a certain paul as reported in your new testament covers a multitude of sins i hope very much that it will serve to cover our remains from the aasvogels after we have met our deaths in some such fashion as that brute promised us and he pointed to the dead man  benita looked at her father in question  mr meyer means my dear that you have done a foolish thing in begging the lives of those matabele it would have been safer for us if they were dead who as it is have gone off burning for revenge of course i understand it was natural enough but and he hesitated and stopped  the chief did not say so broke in benita with agitation besides if he had i should not have cared it was bad enough to see one man killed like that and she shivered i could not bear any more  you should not be angry at the fellows death seeing that it was what he said of you which brought it upon him meyer replied with meaning otherwise he might have gone unharmed as far as i was concerned for the rest i did not interfere because i saw it was useless also i am a fatalist like our friend the molimo and believe in what is decreed the truth is he added sharply among savages ladies are not in place  why did you not say that down at rooi krantz jacob asked mr clifford you know i thought so all the while but somehow i was overruled now what i suggest is that we had better get out of this place as fast as we caninstantly as soon as we have eaten before our retreat is cut off  meyer looked at the oxen which had been outspanned nine were wandering about picking up what food they could but the five which were supposed to have been bitten by tetsefly had lain down  nine wornout and footsore oxen will not draw the waggon he said also in all probability the place is already surrounded by matabele who merely let us in to be sure of the guns which their spies must have told them we were carrying lastly having spent so much and come so far i do not mean to go without what we seek still if you think that your daughters danger is greater within these walls than outside of them you might try if we can hire servants which i doubt or possibly if any rowers are to be had you could go down the zambesi in a canoe risking the fever you and she must settle it clifford  difficulties and dangers every way one looks benita what do you say asked her father distractedly  benita thought a moment she wished to escape from mr meyer of whom she was weary and afraid and would have endured much to do so on the other hand her father was tired out and needed rest also to turn his back upon this venture now would have been a bitter blow to him moreover lacking cattle and men how was it to be done lastly something within her that same voice which had bidden her to come seemed to bid her to stay very soon she had made up her mind  father dear she said thank you for thinking of me but as far as i can see we should run more risks trying to get away than we do in stopping here i wanted to come though you warned me against it and now i must take my chance and trust to god to bring us safe through all dangers surely with all those rifles the makalanga ought to be able to hold such a place as this against the matabele  i hope so answered her father but they are a timid folk still though it would have been far better never to have come i think with you that it is best to stay where we are and trust to god     x  the mountain top  if our adventurers or any of them hoped that they were going to be led to the secret places of the fortress that day they were destined to disappointment indeed the remainder of it was employed arduously enough in unpacking rifles and a supply of ammunition also in giving to a few of the leading makalanga preliminary lessons in the method of their use a matter as to which their ideas were of the vaguest the rest of the tribe having brought their women and children into the outer enclosure of the ancient stronghold and with them their sheep and goats and the few cattle which remained to them were employed in building up the entrance permanently with stones a zigzag secret path upon the river side that could be stopped in a few minutes being now their only method of ingress and egress through the thickness of the walls a certain number of men were also sent out as spies to discover if possible the whereabouts of the matabele impi  that there was some impi they were almost sure for a woman who had followed them reported that the injured captain maduna and his companion had been met at a distance of about three miles from bambatse by a small party of matabele who were hiding in some bushes and that these men had made litters for them and carried them away whither she did not know for she had not dared to pursue them further  that night benita passed in the guesthouse which was only a hut rather larger than the others while the two men slept in the waggon just outside she was so tired that for a long while she could not rest her mind kept flying back to all the events of the day the strange words of that mystic old molimo concerning herself the arrival of the brutal messengers and the indaba that followed then the sudden and awful destruction of their spokesman at the hand of jacob meyer the scene would not leave her eyes she saw it again and yet again the quick transformation of meyers indifferent face when the soldier began to insult and threaten her the lightninglike movement of his hand the flash the report the change from life to death and the slayers cruel laugh he could be very terrible jacob meyer when his passions were roused  and what had roused them then she could not doubt that it was herselfnot mere chivalry towards a woman even if he were capable of chivalry merely for that he would never have taken such risk of future trouble and revenge no it was something deeper he had never said anything or done anything yet long ago instinct or insight had caused benita to suspect the workings of his mind and now she was sure of them the thought was terribleworse than all her other dangers put together true she had her father to rely on but he had been somewhat ailing of late age and these arduous journeys and anxieties had told upon him supposing that anything were to happen to himif he died for instance how dreadful her position might become left alone far from the reach of help with savagesand jacob meyer  oh if it had not been for that dreadful shipwreck how different might be her lot today well it was the thought of the shipwreck and of him whom she had lost therein which had driven her on to this adventure that in it perhaps her suffering mind might be numbed to rest and now she must face its issues god still remained above her and she would put her trust in him after all if she died what did it matter  but that old molimo had promised her that she was safe from death that she should find here happiness and rest though not that of the grave he promised this speaking as one who knew of all her grief and a very little while afterwards in the case of the matabele soldier he had proved himself a prophet of awful power alsoshe knew not how she knew not whynow as before her inmost heart seemed to bear witness that this old dreamers words were true and that for her in some strange manner unforeseen there still remained a rest  comforted a little by this intuition at length benita fell asleep  next morning when she came out of the hut benita was met by her father who with a cheerful countenance informed her that at any rate as yet there was no sign of the matabele a few hours later too some spies came in who said that for miles round nothing could be seen or heard of them still the preparations for defence went on and the hundred best men having been furnished with the rifles were being drilled in the use of them by tamas and his two companions tamala and hoba who had learned how to handle a gun very well in the course of their long journey the shooting of these raw recruits however proved to be execrable indeed so dangerous were they that when one of them fired at a mark set upon the wall it was found necessary to order all the rest to lie down as it was a poor trek oxluckily it was sickand two sheep were killed  foreseeing a scarcity of provisions in the event of a siege meyer provident as ever had already decreed the death of the tetsebitten cattle these were accordingly despatched and having been skinned and cut up their flesh was severed into long strips to be dried in the burning sun as biltong which secretly benita hoped she might never be called upon to eat yet the time was to come when she would swallow that hard tetsepoisoned flesh with thankfulness  at midday after they had eaten mr clifford and meyer went to the molimo where he sat against the second wall and pointing to the men with the guns said  we have fulfilled our bargain now fulfil yours lead us to the holy place that we may begin our search  so be it he answered follow me white people  then quite unattended he guided them round the inner wall till they came to a path of rock not more than a yard wide beneath which was a precipice fifty feet or so in depth that almost overhung the river this giddy path they followed for about twenty paces to find that it ended in a cleft in the wall so narrow that only one person could walk through it at a time that it must have been the approach to the second stronghold was evident however since it was faced on either side with dressed stones and even the foundation granite had been worn by the human feet which had passed here for ages upon ages this path zigzagged to and fro in the thickness of the wall till it brought them finally within its circle a broad belt of steeplyrising ground covered like that below with the tumbled ruins of buildings amidst which grew bush and trees  heaven send that the gold is not buried here said mr clifford surveying the scene for if it is we shall never find it  the molimo seemed to guess the meaning of his words from his face for he answered  i think not here the besiegers won this place and camped in it for many weeks i could show you were they built their fires and tried to undermine the last wall within which the portuguese sat about until hunger killed them for they could not eat their gold follow me again  so on they went up the slope till they came to the base of the third wall and as before passed round it and reached a point above the river but now there was no passage only some shallow and almost precipitous steps cut from single stones leading from the foot of the wall to its summit more than thirty feet above  really said benita contemplating this perilous ascent with dismay the ways of treasure seekers are hard i dont think i can while her father also looked at them and shook his head  we must get a rope said meyer to the molimo angrily how can we climb that place without one with such a gulf below  i am old but i climb it said the aged man in mild surprise since to him who had trodden it all his life it seemed not difficult still he added i have a rope above which i use upon dark nights i will ascend and let it down  ascend he did accordingly indeed it was a wondrous sight to see his withered legs scrambling from step to step as unconcernedly as though he were going upstairs no monkey could have been more agile or more absolutely impervious to the effects of height soon he vanished inor rather throughthe crest of the wall and presently appeared again on the top step whence he let down a stout hide rope remarking that it was securely tied so anxious was meyer to enter the hidden place of which he had dreamed so long that he scarcely waited for it to reach his hand before he began the climb which he accomplished safely then sitting on the top of the wall he directed mr clifford to fasten the end of the rope round benitas waist and her turn came  it was not so bad as she expected for she was agile and the knowledge that the rope would prevent disaster gave her confidence in a very little while she had grasped meyers outstretched hand and been drawn into safety through a kind of aperture above the top step then the rope was let down again for her father who tied it about his middle well was it that he did so since when he was about halfway up awkwardness or perhaps loss of nerveneither of them wonderful in an old mancaused his foot to slip and had it not been for the rope which meyer and the molimo held he would certainly have fallen into the river some hundreds of feet below as it was he recovered himself and presently arrived panting and very pale in her relief benita kissed him and even as she did so thought again that she had been very near to being left alone with jacob meyer  alls well that ends well my dear he said but upon my word i am beginning to wish that i had been content with the humble profits of horsebreeding  benita made no answer it seemed too late for any useful consideration of the point  clever men those ancients said meyer see and he pointed out to her how by drawing a heavy stone which still lay close by over the aperture through which they had crept the ascent of the wall could be made absolutely impossible to any enemy since at its crest it was battened outwards not inwards as is usual in these ancient ruins  yes she answered we ought to feel safe enough inside here and thats as well since i do not feel inclined to go out again at present  then they paused to look about them and this was what they saw  the wall built like those below of unmortared blocks of stone remained in a wonderfully good state of preservation for its only enemies had been time the tropical rains and the growth of shrubs and trees which here and there had cracked and displaced the stones it enclosed all the top of the hill perhaps three acres of ground and on it at intervals were planted soapstone pillars each of them about twelve feet in height and fashioned at the top to a rude resemblance of a vulture many of these columns however had been blown down or perhaps struck by lightning and lay broken upon the wall or if they had fallen inward at its foot but some six or eight perhaps were still standing  benita learned afterwards that they must have been placed there by the ancient phoenicians or whatever people constructed this gigantic fortification and had something to do with the exact recordings of the different seasons of the year and their subdivisions by means of the shadows which they cast as yet however she did not pay much attention to them for she was engaged in considering a more remarkable relic of antiquity which stood upon the very verge of the precipice the wall indeed being built up to its base on either side  it was the great cone of which richard seymour had told her fifty feet high or more such as once was found in the phoenician temples but in this case it was not built of masonry but shaped by the hand of man out of a single gigantic granite monolith of the sort that are sometimes to be met with in africa that thousands or millions of years ago had been left standing thus when the softer rock around it was worn away by time and weather on the inner side of this cone were easy steps whereby it could be ascended and its top which might have been six feet in diameter was fashioned in the shape of a cup probably for the purposes of acts of worship and of sacrifice this extraordinary monument which except on the river side could not be seen from below on account of the slope of the hill leaned slightly outwards so that a stone dropped from its crest would fall into the waters of the stream  thence it was said the molimo that my forefathers saw the last of the portuguese the fair daughter of the great captain ferreira hurl herself to death after she had given the gold into our keeping and laid the curse upon it until she came again so in my dreams have i seen and heard her also ay and others have seen her but these only from by the river far below  he paused awhile looking at benita with his queer dreamy eyes then said suddenly  say lady do you remember nothing of that matter  now benita grew vexed for the whole thing was uncanny and jarred upon her  how can i remember she asked who was born not five and twenty years ago  i do not know he answered how should i know who am but an ignorant old black man who was born not much more than eighty years ago yet lady tell me for i seek your wisdom where were you born from out of the earth or out of the heavens what you shake your head you who do not remember well neither do i remember yet it is true that all circles meet somewhere and it is true that the portuguese maiden said she would come again and lastly it is true that she was such an one as you are for she haunts this place and i who have seen her sitting yonder in the moonlight know her beauty well yet mayhap she comes no more in flesh but still her spirit comes for lady out of those eyes of yours i see it gaze at me come he added abruptly let us descend the wall for as you cannot remember there is more to show you have no fearthe steps are easy  so they went down without much difficulty since from the accumulation of rubbish and other causes the wall was a great deal lower on this side and found themselves in the usual dense growth of vegetation and brushwood through which ran a little path it led them past the ruins of buildings whereof the use and purpose were long since forgotten for their roofs had fallen in hundreds or thousands of years ago to the entrance of a cave which was placed almost at the foot of the monolithic cone but thirty or forty yards further from the circle of the wall here the molimo bade them stay while he lit the lamps within five minutes passed and he returned saying that all was ready  be not afraid of what you may see he added for know white people that save my forefathers and myself none have entered this place since the portuguese perished here nor have we who do but come hither to pray and receive the word of the munwali ever ventured to disturb it as it was so it is come lady come she whose spirit goes with you was the last of your white race to pass this door it is therefore fitting that your feet and her spirit should be the first to enter it again  benita hung back a little for the adventure was eerie then determined that she would show no fear in the presence of this old priest took the thin hand he stretched out to her and walked forward with head erect the two men began to follow her but the molimo stopped them saying  not so the maiden enters first alone with me it is her house and should it please her to ask you to dwell therein so be it but first she must visit her house alone  nonsense said mr clifford angrily i will not have it it will frighten her  lady do you trust me asked the molimo  yes she answered adding father i think you had better let me go alone i am not afraid now and it may be wisest not to thwart him this is a very strange businessnot like anything elseand really i think that i had better go alone if i do not come back presently you can follow  those who break in upon the sleep of the dead should walk gently gently piped the old molimo in a singsong voice the maidens breath is pure the maidens foot is light her breath will not offend the dead her step will not disturb the dead white men white men anger not the dead for the dead are mighty and will be revenged upon you when you are dead soon very soon when you are deaddead in your sorrows dead in your sins dead gathered to that company of the dead who await us here  and still chanting his mystic song he led benita by the hand out of the light onward into darkness away from life onward into the place of death     xi  the sleepers in the cave  like every other passage in this old fortress the approach to the cave was narrow and winding presumably the ancients had arranged them thus to facilitate their defence after the third bend however benita saw a light ahead which flowed from a native lamp lit in the arched entrance at the side of this arch was a shellshaped hollow cut in the rock about three feet above the floor its appearance seemed familiar to her why she was soon to learn although at the moment she did not connect it with anything in particular the cave beyond was large lofty and not altogether natural for its walls had evidently been shaped or at any rate trimmed by man probably here the old priests had established their oracle or place of offering  at first benita could not see much since in that great cavern two lamps of hippopotamus oil gave but little light presently however her eyes became accustomed to the gloom and as they advanced up its length she perceived that save for a skin rug upon which she guessed the molimo sat at his solitary devotions and some gourds and platters for water and food all the front part of the place appeared to be empty beyond in its centre stood an object of some gleaming metal that from its double handles and roller borne upon supports of rock she took to be some kind of winch and rightly for beneath it was the mouth of a great well the water supply of the topmost fortification  beyond the well was a stone altar shaped like a truncated cone or pyramid and at some distance away against the far wall as she dimly discovered by the lamp that stood upon the altar cut in relief upon that wall indeed a colossal cross to which vigorously if rudely executed in white stone hung the image of christ crucified the crown of thorns upon his drooping head now she understood whatever may have been the first worship to which this place was dedicated christians had usurped it and set up here the sacred symbol of their faith awful enough to look upon in such surroundings doubtless also the shellshaped basin at the entrance had served the worshippers in this underground chapel as a stoup for holy water  the molimo lifted the lamp from the altar and having adjusted its wick held it up in front of the rood before which although she was no catholic benita bowed her head and crossed herself while he watched her curiously then he lowered it and she perceived that on the cemented floor lay great numbers of shrouded forms that at first looked to her like folk asleep he stepped to one of them and touched it with his foot whereon the cloth which with it was covered crumbled into dust revealing beneath a white skeleton  all those sleepers rested well indeed for they had been dead at least two hundred years there they laymen women and children though of the last but few some of them had ornaments on their bones some were clad in armour and by all the men were swords or spears or knives and here and there what she took to be primitive firearms certain of them also had turned into mummies in that dry airgrotesque and dreadful objects from which she gladly averted her eyes  the molimo led her forward to the foot of the crucifix where upon its lowest step and upon the cemented floor immediately beneath it respectively lay two shapes decorously covered with shawls of some heavy material interwoven with gold wire for the manufacture of which the makalanga were famous when first the portuguese came into contact with them the molimo took hold of the cloths that seemed almost as good now as on the day when they were woven and lifted them revealing beneath the figures of a man and woman the features were unrecognizable although the hair white in the mans case and raven black in that of the woman remained perfect they had been great people for orders glittered upon the mans breast and his sword was gold hilted whilst the womans bones were adorned with costly necklaces and jewels and in her hand was still a book bound in sheets of silver benita took it up and looked at it it was a missal beautifully illuminated which doubtless the poor lady had been reading when at length she sank exhausted into the sleep of death  see the lord ferreira and his wife said the molimo whom their daughter laid thus before she went to join them then at a motion from benita he covered them up again with their golden cloths  here they sleep he went on in his chanting voice a hundred and fifty and three of thema hundred and fifty and three and when i dream in this place at night i have seen the ghosts of every one of them arise from beside their forms and come gliding down the cavethe husband with the wife the child with the motherto look at me and ask when the maiden returns again to take her heritage and give them burial  benita shuddered the solemn awfulness of the place and scene oppressed her she began to think that she too saw those ghosts  it is enough she said let us be going  so they went and the pitiful agonized christ upon the cross at which she glanced from time to time over her shoulder faded to a white blot then vanished away in the darkness through which from generation to generation it kept its watch above the dead those dead that in their despair once had cried to it for mercy and bedewed its feet with tears  glad oh glad was she when she had left that haunted place behind her and saw the wholesome light again  what have you seen asked her father and meyer in one breath as they noted her white and frightened face  she sank upon a stone seat at the entrance of the cave and before she could open her lips the molimo answered for her  the maiden has seen the dead the spirit who goes with her has given greeting to its dead that it left so long ago the maiden has done reverence to the white one who hangs upon the cross and asked a blessing and a pardon of him as she whose spirit goes with her did reverence before the eyes of my forefathers and asked a blessing and a pardon ere she cast herself away and he pointed to the little golden crucifix which hung upon benitas bosom attached to the necklace which tamas the messenger had given her at rooi krantz  now he went on now the spell is broken and the sleepers must depart to sleep elsewhere enter white men enter if you dare and ask for pardon and for blessing if it may be found and gather up the dry bones and take the treasure that was theirs if it may be found and conquer the curse that goes with the treasure for all save one if you can if you can if you can rest you here maiden in the sweet sunshine and follow me white men follow me into the dark of the dead to seek for that which the white men love and once more he vanished down the passage turning now and again to beckon to them while they went after him as though drawn against their wish for now at the last moment some superstitious fear spread from him to them and showed itself in their eyes  to benita half fainting upon the stone seat for this experience had shaken her to the heart it seemed but a few minutes though really the best part of an hour had gone by when her father reappeared as whitefaced as she had been  where is mr meyer she asked  oh he answered he is collecting all the golden ornaments off those poor bodies and tumbling their bones together in a corner of the cave  benita uttered an exclamation of horror  i know what you mean said her father but curse the fellow he has no reverence although at first he seemed almost as scared as i was myself he said that as we could not begin our search with all those corpses about they had best be got out of the way as soon as possible or perhaps it was because he is really afraid of them and wanted to prove to himself that they are nothing more than dust benita went on the old man to tell you the truth i wish heartily that we had left this business alone i dont believe that any good will come of it and certainly it has brought enough trouble already that old prophet of a molimo has the second sight or something like it and he does not hide his opinion but keeps chuckling away in that dreadful place and piping out his promises of ill to be  he promised me nothing but good said benita with a little smile though i dont see how it can happen but if you dislike the thing father why not give it up and try to escape  it is too late dear he replied passionately meyer would never come and i cant in honour leave him also i should laugh at myself for the rest of my life and after all why should we not have the gold if it can be found it belongs to nobody we do not get it by robbery or murder nuggets are of no use to portuguese who have been dead two hundred years and whose heirs if they have any it is impossible to discover nor can it matter to them whether they lie about singly as they died or were placed after death or piled together in a corner our fears were mere churchyard superstitions which we have caught from that ghoul of a molimo dont you agree with me  yes i suppose so answered benita though a fate may cling to certain things or places perhaps at any rate i think that it is of no use turning back now even if we had anywhere to turn so we may as well go through with the venture and await its end give me the waterbottle please i am thirsty  a while later jacob meyer appeared carrying a great bundle of precious objects wrapped in one of the gold cerecloths which bundle he hid away behind a stone  the cave is much tidier now he said as he flicked the thick dust which had collected on them during his unhallowed task from his hands and hair and garments then he drank greedily and asked  have you two made any plans for our future researches  they shook their heads  well then i have i thought them out while i was bonecarting and here they are it is no use our going down below again for one thing the journey is too dangerous and takes too long and for another we are safer up above where we have plenty to do  but said benita how about things to eat and sleep on and the rest  simple enough miss clifford we must get them up the kaffirs will bring them to the foot of the third wall and we will haul them to its top with a rope of water it seems there is plenty in that well which is fed by a spring a hundred and fifty feet down and the old chain is still on the roller so we only need a couple of buckets from the waggon of wood for cooking there is plenty also growing on the spot and we can camp in the cave or outside of it as we like according to the state of the weather now do you rest here while i go down i will be back in an hour with some of the gear and then you must help me  so he went and the end of it was that before nightfall they had enough things for their immediate needs and by the second night working very hard were more or less comfortably established in their strange habitation the canvas flap from the waggon was arranged as a tent for benita the men sleeping beneath a thickleaved tree near by close at hand under another tree was their cooking place the provisions of all sorts including a couple of cases of squareface and a large supply of biltong from the slaughtered cattle they stored with a quantity of ammunition in the mouth of the cave fresh meat also was brought to them daily and hauled up in basketsthat is until there was none to bringand with it grain for bread and green mealies to serve as vegetables therefore as the water from the well proved to be excellent and quite accessible they were soon set up in all things necessary and to these they added from time to time as opportunity offered  in all these preparations the old molimo took a part nor when they were completed did he show any inclination to leave them in the morning he would descend to his people below but before nightfall he always returned to the cave where for many years it had been his custom to sleepat any rate several times a week in the gruesome company of the dead portuguese jacob meyer persuaded mr clifford that his object was to spy upon them and talked of turning him out but benita between whom and the old man had sprung up a curious friendship and sympathy prevented it pointing out that they were much safer with the molimo as a kind of hostage than they could be without him also that his knowledge of the place and of other things might prove of great help to them so in the end he was allowed to remain as indeed he had a perfect right to do  all this while there was no sign of any attack by the matabele indeed the fear of such a thing was to some extent dying away and benita watching from the top of the wall could see that their nine remaining oxen together with the two horsesfor that belonging to jacob meyer had diedand the makalanga goats and sheep were daily driven out to graze also that the women were working in the crops upon the fertile soil around the lowest wall still a strict watch was kept and at night everyone slept within the fortifications moreover the drilling of the men and their instruction in the use of firearms went on continually under tamas who now in his fathers old age was the virtual chief of the people  it was on the fourth morning that at length all their preparations being completed the actual search for the treasure began first the molimo was closely interrogated as to its whereabouts since they thought that even if he did not know this exactly some traditions of the fact might have descended to him from his ancestors but he declared with earnestness that he knew nothing save that the portuguese maiden had said that it was hidden nor he added had any dream or vision come to him concerning this matter in which he took no interest if it was there it was there if it was not there it was not thereit remained for the white men to search and see  for no very good reason meyer had concluded that the gold must have been concealed in or about the cave so here it was that they began their investigations  first they bethought them of the well into which it might possibly have been thrown but the fact of this matter proved very difficult to ascertain tying a piece of metalit was an old portuguese swordhiltto a string they let it down and found that it touched water at a depth of one hundred and twenty feet and bottom at a depth of one hundred and fortyseven feet therefore there were twentyseven feet of water weighting a bucket they sank it until it rested upon this bottom then wound it up again several times on the third occasion it brought up a human bone and a wire anklet of pure gold but this proved nothing except that some ancient perhaps thousands of years ago had been thrown or had fallen into the well  still unsatisfied jacob meyer who was a most intrepid person determined to investigate the place himself a task of no little difficulty and danger since proper ladders were wanting nor had they existed was there anything to stand them on therefore it came to this a seat must be rigged on to the end of the old copper chain and be lowered into the pit after the fashion of the bucket but as benita pointed out although they might let him down it was possible that they would not be able to draw him up again in which case his plight must prove unfortunate so when the seat had been prepared an experiment was made with a stone weighing approximately as much as a man this benita and her father let down easily enough but as they anticipated when it came to winding it up again their strength was barely sufficient to the task three people could do it well but with two the thing was risky now meyer askedor rather commandedthe molimo to order some of his men to help him but this the old chief refused point blank to do  first he made a number of excuses they were all employed in drilling and in watching for the matabele they were afraid to venture here and so forth at last meyer grew furious his eyes flashed he ground his teeth and began to threaten  white man said the molimo when he had done it cannot be i have fulfilled my bargain with you search for the gold find it and take it away if you can but this place is holy none of my tribe save he who holds the office of molimo for the time may set a foot therein kill me if you willi care not but so it is and if you kill me afterwards they will kill you  now meyer seeing that nothing was to be gained by violence changed his tone and asked if he himself would help them  i am old my strength is small he replied yet i will put my hand to the chain and do my best but if i were you i would not descend that pit  still i will descend it and tomorrow said meyer     xii  the beginning of the search  accordingly on the next day the great experiment was made the chain and ancient winding gear had been tested and proved to be amply sufficient to the strain therefore nothing remained save for meyer to place himself in the wooden seat with an oillamp and in case this should be extinguished matches and candles of both of which they had a large supply  he did so boldly enough and swung out over the mouth of the pit while the three of them clutched the handles of the winch then they began to lower and slowly his white face disappeared into the black depth at every few turns his descent was stopped that he might examine the walls of the well and when he was about fifty feet down he called to them to hold on which they did listening while he struck at the rock with a hammer for here it sounded very hollow  at length he shouted to them to lower away again and they obeyed until nearly all the chain was out and they knew he must be near the water now benita peeping over the edge saw that the star of light had vanished his lamp was out nor did he appear to attempt to relight it they shouted down the well to him but no answer coming began to wind up as fast as they were able it was all that their united strength could manage and very exhausted were they when at length jacob reappeared at the top at first from the look of him they thought that he was dead and had he not tied himself to the chain dead he certainly would have been for evidently his senses had left him long ago indeed he had fallen almost out of the seat over which his legs hung limply his weight being supported by the hide rope beneath his arms which was made fast to the chain  they swung him in and dashed water over his face till to their relief at last he began to gasp for breath and revived sufficiently to enable them to halflead and halfcarry him out into the fresh air  what happened to you asked clifford  poisoned with gases i suppose meyer answered with a groan for his head was aching sadly the air is often bad at the bottom of deep wells but i could smell or feel nothing until suddenly my senses left me it was a near thinga very near thing  afterwards when he had recovered a little he told them that at one spot deep down in the well on the river side of it he found a place where it looked as though the rock had been cut away for a space of about six feet by four and afterwards built up again with another sort of stone set in hard mortar or cement immediately beneath too were socketholes in which the ends of beams still remained suggesting that here had been a floor or platform it was while he was examining these rotted beams that insensibility overcame him he added that he thought that this might be the entrance to the place where the gold was hidden  if so said mr clifford hidden it must remain since it can have no better guardian than bad air also floors like that are common in all wells to prevent rubbish from falling into the water and the stonework you saw probably was only put there by the ancients to mend a fault in the rock and prevent the wall from caving in  i hope so said meyer since unless that atmosphere purifies a good deal i dont think that even i dare go down again and until one gets there of that it is difficult to be sure though of course a lantern on a string will tell one something  this was the end of their first attempt the search was not renewed until the following afternoon when meyer had recovered a little from the effects of the poisoning and the chafing of the hide ropes beneath his arms indeed from the former he never did quite recover since thenceforward benita who for her own reasons watched the man closely discovered a marked and progressive change in his demeanour hitherto he had appeared to be a reserved man one who kept tight hand upon himself and if she knew certain things about him it was rather because she guessed or deduced them than because he allowed them to be seen on two occasions only had he shown his heart before herwhen they had spoken together by the shores of lake chrissie on the day of the arrival of the messengers and he declared his ardent desire for wealth and power and quite recently when he killed the matabele envoy yet she felt certain that this heart of his was very passionate and insurgent that his calm was like the ice that hides the stream beneath which its currents run fiercely none can see whither the fashion in which his dark eyes would flash even when his pale countenance remained unmoved told her so as did other things  for instance when he was recovering from his swoon the first words that passed his lips were in german of which she understood a little and she thought that they shaped themselves to her name coupled with endearing epithets from that time forward he became less guardedor rather it seemed as though he were gradually losing power to control himself he would grow excited without apparent cause and begin to declaim as to what he would do when he had found the gold how he would pay the world back all it had caused him to sufferhow he would become a king  i am afraid that you will find that exalted position rather lonely said benita with a careless laugh and next minute was sorry that she had spoken for he answered looking at her in a way that she did not like  oh no there will be a queena beautiful queen whom i shall endow with wealth and deck with jewels and surround with love and worship  what a fortunate lady she said still laughing but taking the opportunity to go away upon some errand  at other times especially after dark he would walk up and down in front of the cave muttering to himself or singing wild old german songs in his rich voice also he made a habit of ascending the granite pillar and seating himself there and more than once called down to her to come up and share his throne still these outbreaks were so occasional that her father whose perceptions appeared to benita to be less keen than formerly scarcely noticed them and for the rest his demeanour was what it had always been  further researches into the well being out of the question their next step was to make a thorough inspection of the chapelcave itself they examined the walls inch by inch tapping them with a hammer to hear if they sounded hollow but without result they examined the altar but it proved to be a solid mass of rock by the help of a little ladder they had made they examined the crucifix and discovered that the white figure on the cross had evidently been fashioned out of some heathen statue of soft limestone for at its back were the remains of draperies and long hair which the artist had not thought it necessary to cut away also they found that the arms had been added and were of a slightly different stone and that the weight of the figure was taken partly by an iron staple which supported the body and partly by strong copper wire twisted to resemble cord and painted white which was passed round the wrists and supported the arms this wire ran through loops of rock cut in the traverse of the cross that itself was only raised in relief by chiselling away the solid stone behind  curiously enough this part of the search was left to mr clifford and benita since it was one that jacob meyer seemed reluctant to undertake a jew by birth and a man who openly professed his want of belief in that or any other religion he yet seemed to fear this symbol of the christian faith speaking of it as horrible and unlucky yes he who without qualm or remorse had robbed and desecrated the dead that lay about its feet well the crucifix told them nothing but as mr clifford lantern in hand descended the ladder which benita held jacob meyer who was in front of the altar called to them excitedly that he had found something  then it is more than we have said mr clifford as he laid down the ladder and hurried to him  meyer was sounding the floor with a staff of woodan operation which he had only just began after the walls proved barren  listen now he said letting the heavy staff drop a few paces to the right of the altar where it produced the hard metallic clang that comes from solid stone when struck then he moved to the front of the altar and dropped it again but now the note was hollow and reverberant again and again he repeated the experiment till they had exactly mapped out where the solid rock ended and that which seemed to be hollow begana space of about eight feet square  weve got it he said triumphantly thats the entrance to the place where the gold is and the others were inclined to agree with him  now it remained to put their theory to the proofa task of no small difficulty indeed it took them three days of hard continual work it will be remembered that the floor of the cave was cemented over and first of all this cement which proved to be of excellent quality being largely composed of powdered granite must be broken up by the help of a steel crowbar which they had brought with them in the waggon at length that part of their task was completed revealing the rock beneath by this time benita was confident that whatever might lie below it was not the treasure since it was evident that the poor dying portuguese would not have had the time or the strength to cement it over when she told the others so however meyer convinced that he was on the right tack answered that doubtless it was done by the makalanga after the portuguese days as it was well known that they retained a knowledge of the building arts of their forefathers until quite a recent period when the matabele began to kill them out  when at length the cement was cleared away and the area swept they discoveredfor there ran the line of itthat here a great stone was set into the floor it must have weighed several tons as it was set in cement however to lift it even if they had the strength to work the necessary levers proved quite impossible there remained only one thing to be doneto cut a way through when they had worked at this task for several hours and only succeeded in making a hole six inches deep mr clifford whose old bones ached and whose hands were very sore suggested that perhaps they might break it up with gunpowder accordingly a pound flask of that explosive was poured into the hole which they closed over with wet clay and a heavy rock leaving a quill through which ran an extemporized fuse of cotton wick all being prepared their fuse was lit and they left the cave and waited  five minutes afterwards the dull sound of an explosion reached their ears but more than an hour went by before the smoke and fumes would allow them to enter the place and then it was to find that the results did not equal their expectations to begin with the slab was only crackednot shattered since the strength of the powder had been expended upwards not downwards as would have happened in the case of dynamite of which they had none moreover either the heavy stone which they had placed upon it striking the roof of the cave or the concussion of the air had brought down many tons of rock and caused wide and dangerouslooking cracks also though she said nothing of it it seemed to benita that the great white statue on the cross was leaning a little further forward than it used to do so the net result of the experiment was that they were obliged to drag away great fragments of the fallen roof that lay upon the stone which remained almost as solid and obdurate as before  so there was nothing for it but to go on working with the crowbar at length towards the evening of the third day of their labour when the two men were utterly tired out a hole was broken through demonstrating the fact that beneath this cover lay a hollow of some sort mr clifford to say nothing of benita who was heartily weary of the business wished to postpone proceedings till the morrow but jacob meyer would not so they toiled on until about eleven oclock at night when at length the aperture was of sufficient size to admit a man now as in the case of the well they let down a stone tied to a string to find that the place beneath was not more than eight feet deep then to ascertain the condition of the air a candle was lowered which at first went out but presently burnt well enough this point settled they brought their ladder whereby jacob descended with a lantern  in another minute they heard the sound of guttural german oaths rising through the hole mr clifford asked what was the matter and received the reply that the place was a tomb with nothing in it but an accursed dead monk information at which benita could not help bursting into laughter  the end of it was that both she and her father went down also and there sure enough lay the remains of the old missionary in his cowl with an ivory crucifix about his neck and on his breast a scroll stating that he marco born at lisbon in 1438 had died at bambatse in the year 1503 having laboured in the empire of monomotapa for seventeen years and suffered great hardships and brought many souls to christ the scroll added that it was he who before he entered into religion was a sculptor by trade that had fashioned the figure on the cross in this chapel out of that of the heathen goddess which had stood in the same place from unknown antiquity it ended with a request addressed to all good christians in latin that they who soon must be as he was would pray for his soul and not disturb his bones which rested here in the hope of a blessed resurrection  when this pious wish was translated to jacob meyer by mr clifford who still retained some recollection of the classics which he had painfully acquired at eton and oxford the jew could scarcely contain his wrath indeed looking at his bleeding hands instead of praying for the soul of that excellent missionary to reach whose remains he had laboured with such arduous incessant toil he cursed it wherever it might be and unceremoniously swept the bones which the document asked him not to disturb into a corner of the tomb in order to ascertain whether there was not perhaps some stair beneath them  really mr meyer said benita who in spite of the solemnity of the surroundings could not control her sense of humour if you are not careful the ghosts of all these people will haunt you  let them haunt me if they can he answered furiously i dont believe in ghosts and defy them all  at this moment looking up benita saw a figure gliding out of the darkness into the ring of light so silently that she started for it might well have been one of those ghosts in whom jacob meyer did not believe in fact however it was the old molimo who had a habit of coming upon them thus  what says the white man he asked of benita while his dreamy eyes wandered over the three of them and the hole in the violated tomb  he says that he does not believe in spirits and that he defies them she answered  the white goldseeker does not believe in spirits and he defies them mambo repeated in his singsong voice he does not believe in the spirits that i see all around me now the angry spirits of the dead who speak together of where he shall lie and of what shall happen to him when he is dead and of how they will welcome one who disturbs their rest and defies and curses them in his search for the riches which he loves there is one standing by him now dressed in a brown robe with a dead man cut in ivory like to that and he pointed to the crucifix in jacobs hands and he holds the ivory man above him and threatens him with sleepless centuries of sorrow when he is also one of those spirits in which he does not believe  then meyers rage blazed out he turned upon the molimo and reviled him in his own tongue saying that he knew well where the treasure was hidden and that if he did not point it out he would kill him and send him to his friends the spirits so savage and evil did he look that benita retreated a little way while mr clifford strove in vain to calm him but although meyer laid his hand upon the knife in his belt and advanced upon him the old molimo neither budged an inch nor showed the slightest fear  let him rave on he said when at length meyer paused exhausted just so in a time of storm the lightnings flash and the thunder peals and the water foams down the face of rock but then comes the sun again and the hill is as it has ever been only the storm is spent and lost i am the rock he is but the wind the fire and the rain it is not permitted that he should hurt me and those spirits in whom he does not believe treasure up his curses to let them fall again like stones upon his head  then with a contemptuous glance at jacob the old man turned and glided back into the darkness out of which he had appeared     xiii  benita plans escape  the next morning while she was cooking breakfast benita saw jacob meyer seated upon a rock at a little distance sullen and disconsolate his chin was resting on his hand and he watched her intently never taking his eyes from her face she felt that he was concentrating his will upon her that some new idea concerning her had come into his mind for it was one of her miseries that she possessed the power of interpreting the drift of this mans thoughts much as she detested him there existed that curious link between them  it may be remembered that on the night when they first met at the crest of leopards kloof jacob had called her a thoughtsender and some knowledge of their mental intimacy had come home to benita from that day forward her chief desire had been to shut a door between their natures to isolate herself from him and him from her yet the attempt was never entirely successful  fear and disgust took hold of her bending there above the fire all the while aware of the jews dark eyes that searched her through and through benita formed a sudden determination she would implore her father to come away with her  of course such an attempt would be terribly dangerous of the matabele nothing had been seen but they might be about and even if enough cattle could be collected to draw the waggon it belonged to meyer as much as to her father and must therefore be left for him still there remained the two horses which the molimo had told her were well and getting fat  at this moment meyer rose and began to speak to her  what are you thinking of miss clifford he asked in his soft foreign voice  she started but answered readily enough  of the wood which is green and the kid cutlets which are getting smoked are you not tired of kid mr meyer she went on  he waved the question aside you are so goodoh i mean itso really good that you should not tell stories even about small things the wood is not green i cut it myself from a dead tree and the meat is not smoked nor were you thinking of either you were thinking of me as i was thinking of you but what exactly was in your mind this time i do not know and that is why i ask you to tell me  really mr meyer she answered flushing my mind is my own property  ah do you say so now i hold otherwisethat it is my property as mine is yours a gift that nature has given to each of us  i seek no such gift she answered but even then much as she would have wished to do so she could not utter a falsehood and deny this horrible and secret intimacy  i am sorry for that as i think it very precious more precious even than the gold which we cannot find for miss clifford it brings me nearer you  she turned upon him but he held up his hand and went on  oh do not be angry with me and do not fear that i am going to trouble you with soft speeches for i shall not unless a time should come as i think that perhaps it will when you may wish to listen to them but i want to point out something to you miss clifford is it not a wonderful thing that our minds should be so in tune and is there not an object in all this did i believe as you do i should say that it was heaven working in usno do not answer that the working comes from lower down i take no credit for reading that upon your lips the retort is too easy and obvious i am content to say however that the work is that of instinct and nature or if you will of fate pointing out a road by which together we might travel to great ends  i travel my road alone mr meyer  i know i know and that is the pity of it the trouble between man and woman is that not in one case out of a million even if they be lovers do they understand each other their eyes may seek one another their hands and lips may meet and yet they remain distinct apart and often antagonistic there is no communication of the soul but when it chances to be hewn from the same rock as it wereoh then what happiness may be theirs and what opportunities  possibly mr meyer but to be frank the question does not interest me  not yet but i am sure that one day it will meanwhile i owe you an apology i lost my temper before you last night well do not judge me hardly for i was utterly worn out and that old idiot vexed me with his talk about ghosts in which i do not believe  then why did it make you so angry surely you could have afforded to treat it with contempt instead of doingas you did  upon my word i dont know but i suppose most of us are afraid lest we should be forced to accept that which we refuse this ancient place gets upon the nerves miss clifford yours as well as mine i can afford to be open about it because i know that you know think of its associations all the crime that has been committed here for ages and ages all the suffering that has been endured here doubtless human sacrifices were offered in this cave or outside of it that great burnt ring in the rock there may have been where they built the fires and then those portuguese starving to death slowly starving to death while thousands of savages watched them die have you ever thought what it means but of course you have for like myself you are cursed with imagination god in heaven is it wonderful that it gets upon the nerves especially when one cannot find what one is looking for that vast treasureand his face became ecstaticthat shall yet be yours and mine and make us great and happy  but which at present only makes me a scullerymaid and most unhappy replied benita cheerfully for she heard her fathers footstep dont talk any more of the treasure mr meyer or we shall quarrel we have enough of that during business hours when we are hunting for it you know give me the dish will you this meat is cooked at last  still benita could not be rid of that treasure since after breakfast the endless unprofitable search began again once more the cave was sounded and other hollow places were discovered upon which the two men got to work with infinite labour three of them were broken into in as many days and like the first found to be graves only this time of ancients who perhaps had died before christ was born there they lay upon their sides their bones burnt by the hot cement that had been poured over them their goldheaded and goldferruled rods of office in their hands their goldcovered pillows of wood such as the egyptians used beneath their skulls gold bracelets upon their arms and ankles cakes of gold beneath them which had fallen from the rotted pouches that once hung about their waists vases of fine glazed pottery that had been filled with offerings or in some cases with gold dust to pay the expenses of their journey in the other world standing round them and so forth  in their way these discoveries were rich enoughfrom one tomb alone they took over a hundred and thirty ounces of goldto say nothing of their surpassing archæological interest still they were not what they sought all that gathered wealth of monomotapa which the fleeing portuguese had brought with them and buried in this their last stronghold  benita ceased to take the slightest interest in the matter she would not even be at the pains to go to look at the third skeleton although it was that of a man who had been almost a giant and to judge from the amount of bullion which he took to the tomb with him a person of great importance in his day she felt as though she wished never to see another human bone or ancient bead or bangle the sight of a street in bayswater in a london fogyes or a toyshop window in westbourne grovewould have pleased her a hundred times better than these unique remains that had they known of them in those days would have sent half the learned societies of europe crazy with delight she wished to escape from bambatse its wondrous fortifications its mysterious cone its cave its dead andfrom jacob meyer  benita stood upon the top of her prison wall and looked with longing at the wide open lands below she even dared to climb the stairs which ran up the mighty cone of granite and seated herself in the cuplike depression on its crest whence jacob meyer had called to her to come and share his throne it was a dizzy place for the pillar leaning outwards its point stood almost clear of the waterscarped rock so that beneath her was a sheer drop of about four hundred feet to the zambesi bed at first the great height made her feel faint her eyes swam and unpleasant tremors crept along her spine so that she was glad to sink to the floor whence she knew she could not fall by degrees however she recovered her nerve and was able to study the glorious view of stream and marshes and hills beyond  for she had come here with a purpose to see whether it would not be possible to escape down the river in a canoe or in native boats such as the makalanga owned and used for fishing or to cross from bank to bank apparently it was impossible for although the river beneath and above them was still enough about a mile below began a cataract that stretched as far as she could see and was bordered on either side by rocky hills covered with forest over which even if they could obtain porters a canoe could not be carried this indeed she had already heard from the molimo but knowing his timid nature she wished to judge of the matter for herself it came to this then if they were to go it must be on the horses  descending the cone benita went to find her father to whom as yet she had said nothing of her plans the opportunity was good for she knew that he would be alone as it chanced on that afternoon meyer had gone down the hill in order to try to persuade the makalanga to give them ten or twenty men to help them in their excavations in this it will be remembered he had already failed so far as the molimo was concerned but he was not a man easily turned from his purpose and he thought that if he could see tamas and some of the other captains he might be able by bribery threats or otherwise to induce them to forget their superstitious fears and help in the search as a matter of fact he was utterly unsuccessful since one and all they declared that for them to enter that sacred place would mean their deaths and that the vengeance of heaven would fall upon their tribe and destroy it root and branch  mr clifford on whom all this heavy labour had begun to tell was taking advantage of the absence of his taskmaster jacob to sleep awhile in the hut which they had now built for themselves beneath the shadow of the baobabtree as she reached it he came out yawning and asked her where she had been benita told him  a giddy place he said i have never ventured to try it myself what did you go up there for dear  to look at the river while mr meyer was away father for if he had seen me do so he would have guessed my reason indeed i dare say that he will guess it now  what reason benita  to see whether it would not be possible to escape down it in a boat but there is no chance it is all rapids below with hills and rocks and trees on either bank  what need have you to escape at present he asked eyeing her curiously  every need she answered with passion i hate this place it is a prison and i loathe the very name of treasure also and she paused  also what dear  also and her voice sank to a whisper as though she feared that he should overhear her even at the bottom of the hill also i am afraid of mr meyer  this confession did not seem to surprise her father who merely nodded his head and said  go on  father i think that he is going mad and it is not pleasant for us to be cooped up here alone with a madman especially when he has begun to speak to me as he does now  you dont mean that he has been impertinent to you said the old man flushing up for if so  no not impertinentas yet and she told him what had passed between meyer and herself adding you see father i detest this man indeed i want to have nothing to do with any man for me all that is over and done with and she gave a dry little sob which appeared to come from her very heart and yet he seems to be getting some kind of power over me he follows me about with his eyes prying into my mind and i feel that he is beginning to be able to read it i can bear no more father father for gods sake take me away from this hateful hill and its gold and its dead and let us get out into the veld again together  i should be glad enough dearest he answered i have had plenty of this wildgoose chase which i was so mad as to be led into by the love of wealth indeed i am beginning to believe that if it goes on much longer i shall leave my bones here  and if such a dreadful thing as that were to happen what would become of me alone with jacob meyer she asked quietly i might even be driven to the same fate as that poor girl two hundred years ago and she pointed to the cone of rock behind her  for heavens sake dont talk like that he broke in  why not one must face things and it would be better than jacob meyer for who would protect me here  mr clifford walked up and down for a few minutes while his daughter watched him anxiously  i can see no plan he said stopping opposite her we cannot take the waggon even if there are enough oxen left to draw it for it is his as much as mine and i am sure that he will never leave this treasure unless he is driven away  and i am sure i hope that he will not but father the horses are our own it was his that died you remember we can ride away on them  he stared at her and answered  yes we could ride away to our deaths suppose they got sick or lame suppose we meet the matabele or could find no game to shoot suppose one of us fell illoh and a hundred things what then  why then it is just as well to perish in the wilderness as here where our risks are almost as great we must take our chance and trust to god perhaps he will be merciful and help us listen now father tomorrow is sunday when you and i do no work that we can help mr meyer is a jew and he wont waste sunday well now i will say that i want to go down to the outer wall to fetch some clothes which i left in the waggon and to take others for the native women to wash and of course you will come with me perhaps he will be deceived and stay behind especially as he has been there today then we can get the horses and guns and ammunition and anything else that we can carry in the way of food and persuade the old molimo to open the gate for us you know the little side gate that cannot be seen from up here and before mr meyer misses us and comes to look we shall be twenty miles away andhorses cant be overtaken by a man on foot  he will say that we have deserted him and that will be true  you can leave a letter with the molimo explaining that it was my fault that i was getting ill and thought that i should die and that you knew it would not be fair to ask him to come and so to lose the treasure to every halfpenny of which he is welcome when it is found oh father dont hesitate any longer say that you will take me away from mr meyer  so be it then answered mr clifford and as he spoke hearing a sound they looked up and saw jacob approaching them  luckily he was so occupied with his own thoughts that he never noted the guilty air upon their faces and they had time to compose themselves a little but even thus his suspicions were aroused  what are you talking of so earnestly he asked  we were wondering how you were getting on with the makalanga answered benita fibbing boldly and whether you would persuade them to face the ghosts did you  not i he answered with a scowl those ghosts are our worst enemies in this place the cowards swore that they would rather die i should have liked to take some of them at their word and make ghosts of them but i remembered the situation and didnt dont be afraid miss clifford i never even lost my temper outwardly at any rate well there it is if they wont help us we must work the harder ive got a new plan and well begin on it tomorrow  not tomorrow mr meyer replied benita with a smile it is sunday and we rest on sunday you know  oh i forgot the makalanga with their ghosts and you with your sundayreally i do not know which is the worse well then i must do my own share and yours too i suppose and he turned with a shrug of his shoulders     xiv  the flight  the next morning sunday meyer went to work on his new plan what it was benita did not trouble to inquire but she gathered that it had something to do with the measuring out of the chapel cave into squares for the more systematic investigation of each area at twelve oclock he emerged for his midday meal in the course of which he remarked that it was very dreary working in that place alone and that he would be glad when it was monday and they could accompany him his words evidently disturbed mr clifford not a little and even excited some compunction in the breast of benita  what would his feelings be she wondered when he found that they had run away leaving him to deal with their joint undertaking singlehanded almost was she minded to tell him the whole truth yetand this was a curious evidence of the mans ascendancy over hershe did not perhaps she felt that to do so would be to put an end to their scheme since then by argument blandishments threats force or appeal to their sense of loyalty it mattered not which he would bring about its abandonment but she wanted to fulfil that scheme to be free of bambatse its immemorial ruins its graveyard cave and the ghoul jacob meyer who could delve among dead bones and in living hearts with equal skill and insight and yet was unable to find the treasure that lay beneath either of them  so they hid the truth and talked with feverish activity about other things such as the drilling of the makalanga and the chances of an attack by the matabele which happily now seemed to be growing small also of the conditions of their cattle and the prospect of obtaining more to replace those that had died indeed benita went farther in her newfound zeal of deception she proceeded to act a lie yes even with her fathers reproachful eyes fixed upon her incidentally she mentioned that they were going to have an outing to climb down the ladder and visit the makalanga camp between the first and second walls and mix with the great world for a few hours also to carry their washing to be done there and bring up some clean clothes and certain books which she had left below  jacob came out of his thoughts and calculations and listened gloomily  i have half a mind to come with you he said words at which benita shivered it certainly is most cursed lonesome in that cave and i seem to hear things in it as though those old bones were rattling sounds like sighs and whispers too which are made by the draught  well why dont you asked benita  it was a bold stroke but it succeeded if he had any doubts they vanished and he answered at once  because i have not the time we have to get this business finished one way or another before the wet season comes on and we are drowned out of the place with rain or rotted by fever take your afternoon out miss clifford every maid of all work is entitled to as much and i am afraid that is your billet here only he added with that care for her safety which he always showed in his more temperate moods pray be careful clifford to get back before sundown that wall is too risky for your daughter to climb in the dusk call me from the foot of it you have the whistle and i will come down to help her up i think ill go with you after all no i wont i made myself so unpleasant to them yesterday that those makalanga cant wish to see any more of me at present i hope you will have a more agreeable afternoon than i shall why dont you take a ride outside the wall your horses are fat and want exercise and i do not think that you need be afraid of the matabele then without waiting for an answer he rose and left them  mr clifford looked after him doubtfully  oh i know said benita it seems horribly mean but one must do shabby things sometimes here are the bundles all ready so let us be off  accordingly they went and from the top of the wall benita glanced back to bid goodbye to that place which she hoped never to see again yet she could not feel as though she looked her last upon it to her it wore no air of farewell and even as she descended the perilous stairs she found herself making mental notes as to how they might best be climbed again also she could not believe that she had done with mr meyer it seemed to her as though for a long while yet her future would be full of him  they reached the outer fortifications in safety and there were greeted with some surprise but with no displeasure by the makalanga whom they found still drilling with the rifles in the use of which a certain number of them appeared to have become fairly proficient going to the hut in which the spare goods from the waggon had been stored they quickly made their preparations here also mr clifford wrote a letter one of the most unpleasant that he had ever been called upon to compose it ran thus  dear meyer  i dont know what you will think of us but we are escaping from this place the truth is that i am not well and my daughter can bear it no longer she says that if she stops here she will die and that hunting for treasure in that ghastly graveyard is shattering her nerves i should have liked to tell you but she begged me not being convinced that if i did you would overpersuade us or stop us in some way as for the gold if you can find it take it all i renounce my share we are leaving you the waggon and the oxen and starting down country on our horses it is a perilous business but less so than staying here under the circumstances if we never meet again we hope that you will forgive us and wish you all good fortuneyours sincerely and with much regret  t clifford   the letter written they saddled the horses which had been brought up for their inspection and were found to be in good case and fastened their scanty belongings and as many cartridges as they could carry in packs behind their saddles then each of them armed with a riflefor during their long journeyings benita had learned to shootthey mounted and made for the little sideentrance as the main gate through which they had passed on their arrival was now built up this sideentrance a mere slit in the great wall with a precipitous approach was open for now that their fear of the matabele had to some extent passed off the makalanga used it to drive their sheep and goats in and out since it was so constructed with several twists and turns in the thickness of the wall that in a few minutes it could be effectually blocked by stones that lay at hand also the ancient architect had arranged it in such a fashion that it was entirely commanded from the crest of the wall on either side  the makalanga who had been watching their proceedings curiously made no attempt to stop them although they guessed that they might have a little trouble with the sentries who guarded the entrances all day and even when it was closed at night with whom also mr clifford proposed to leave the letter when they reached the place however and had dismounted to lead the horses down the winding passage and the steep ascent upon its further side it was to find that the only guard visible proved to be the old molimo himself who sat there apparently half asleep  but as they came he showed himself to be very much awake for without moving he asked them at once whither they were going  to take a ride answered mr clifford the lady my daughter is weary of being cooped up in this fortress and wishes to breathe the air without let us pass friend or we shall not be back by sunset  if you be coming back at sunset white man why do you carry so many things upon your packs and why are your saddlebags filled with cartridges he asked surely you do not speak the truth to me and you hope that never more will you see the sun set upon bambatse  now understanding that it was hopeless to deceive him benita exclaimed boldly  it is so but oh my father stay us not for fear is behind us and therefore we fly hence  and is there no fear before you maiden fear of the wilderness where none wander save perchance the amandabele with their bloody spears fear of wild beasts and of sickness that may overtake you so that first one and then the other you perish there  there is plenty my father but none of them so bad as the fear behind yonder place is haunted and we give up our search and would dwell there no more  it is haunted truly maiden but its spirits will not harm you whom they welcome as one appointed and we are ever ready to protect you because of their command that has come to me in dreams nor indeed is it the spirits whom you fear but rather the white man your companion who would bend you to his will deny it not for i have seen it all  then knowing the truth surely you will let us go she pleaded for i swear to you that i dare not stay  who am i that i should forbid you he asked yet i tell you that you would do well to stay and save yourselves much terror maiden have i not said it days and day ago that here and here only you must accomplish your fate go now if you will but you shall return again and once more he seemed to begin to doze in the sun  the two of them consulted hastily together  it is no use turning back now said benita who was almost weeping with doubt and vexation i will not be frightened by his vague talk what can he know of the future more than any of the rest of us besides all he says is that we shall come back again and if that does happen at least we shall have been free for a little while come father  as you wish answered mr clifford who seemed too miserable and depressed to argue only he threw down the letter upon the molimos lap and begged him to give it to meyer when he came to look for them  the old man took no notice no not even when benita bade him farewell and thanked him for his kindness praying that all good fortune might attend him and his tribe did he answer a single word or even look up so they led their horses down the narrow passage where there was scarcely room for them to pass and up the steep path beyond on the further side of the ancient ditch they remounted them while the makalanga watched them from the walls and cantered away along the same road by which they had come  now this road or rather track ran first through the gardens and then among the countless ruined houses that in bygone ages formed the great city whereof the mount bambatse had been the citadel and sanctuary the relics of a lost civilization extended for several miles and were bounded by a steep and narrow neck or pass in the encircling hills the same that robert seymour and his brother had found too difficult for their waggon at the season in which they visited the place some years before this pass or port as it is called in south africa had been strongly fortified for on either side of it were the ruins of towers moreover at its crest it was so narrow and steepsided that a few men posted there even if they were armed only with bows and arrows could hold an attacking force in check for a considerable time beyond it after the hill was descended a bushclad plain dotted with kopjes and isolated granite pillars formed of boulders piled one upon another rolled away for many miles  mr clifford and benita had started upon their mad journey about three oclock in the afternoon and when the sun began to set they found themselves upon this plain fifteen or sixteen miles from bambatse of which they had long lost sight for it lay beyond the intervening hills near to them was a kopje where they had outspanned by a spring of water when on their recent journey and since they did not dare to travel in the dark here they determined to offsaddle for round this spring was good grass for the horses  as it chanced they came upon some hartebeeste here which were trekking down to drink but although they would have been glad of meat they were afraid to shoot fearing lest they should attract attention nor for the same reason did they like to light a fire so having kneehaltered the horses in such fashion that they could not wander far and turned them loose to feed they sat down under a tree and made some sort of a meal off the biltong and cooked corn which they had brought with them by the time this was finished darkness fell for there was little moon so that nothing remained to do except to sleep within a circle of a few dead thornboughs which they had drawn about their camp this then they did and so weary were they both that notwithstanding all the emotions through which they had passed and their fears lest lions should attack themfor of these brutes there were many in this veldrested soundly and undisturbed till within half an hour of dawn  rising somewhat chilled for though the air was warm a heavy dew had soaked their blankets once more they ate and drank by starlight while the horses which they had tied up close to them during the night filled themselves with grass at the first break of day they saddled them and before the sun rose were on their road again at length up it came and the sight and warmth of it put new heart into benita her fears seemed to depart with the night and she said to her father that this successful start was of good augury to which he only answered that he hoped so  all that day they rode forward in beautiful weather not pressing their horses for now they were sure that jacob meyer who if he followed at all must do so on foot would never be able to overtake them at noon they halted and having shot a small buck benita cooked some of it in the one pot that they had brought with them and they ate a good meal of fresh meat  riding on again towards sundown they came to another of their old campingplaces also a bushcovered kopje here the spring of water was more than halfway up the hill so there they offsaddled in a green bower of a place that because of its ferns and mosses looked like a rock garden now although they had enough cold meat for food they thought themselves quite safe in lighting a fire indeed this it seemed necessary to do since they had struck the fresh spoor of lions and even caught sight of one galloping away in the tall reeds on the marshy land at the foot of the hill  that evening they fared sumptuously upon venison and as on the previous day lay down to rest in a little boma or fence made of boughs but they were not allowed to sleep well this night for scarcely had they shut their eyes when a hyena began to howl about them they shouted and the brute went away but an hour or two later they heard ominous grunting sounds followed presently by a loud roar which was answered by another roar whereat the horses began to whinny in a frightened fashion  lions said mr clifford jumping up and throwing dead wood on the fire till it burnt to a bright blaze  after that all sleep became impossible for although the lions did not attack them having once winded the horses they would not go away but continued wandering round the kopje grunting and growling this went on till abut three oclock in the morning when at last the beasts took their departure for they heard them roaring in the distance now that they seemed safe having first made up the fire they tried to get some rest  when as it appeared to her benita had been asleep but a little while she was awakened by a new noise it was still dark but the starlight showed her that the horses were quite quiet indeed one of them was lying down and the other eating some green leaves from the branches of the tree to which it was tethered therefore that noise had not come from any wild animal of which they were afraid she listened intently and presently heard it again it was a murmur like to that of people talking somewhere at the bottom of the hill then she woke her father and told him but although once or twice they thought they heard the sound of footsteps nothing else could be distinguished still they rose and having saddled and bridled the horses as noiselessly as might be waited for the dawn  at last it came up on the side of the kopje they were in clear air above which shone the red lights of morning but under them lay billows of dense pearlhued mist by degrees this thinned beneath the rays of the risen sun and through it looking gigantic in that light benita saw a savage wrapped in a kaross who was walking up and down and yawning a great spear in his hand  look she whispered look and mr clifford stared down the line of her outstretched finger  the matabele he said my god the matabele     xv  the chase  the matabele it was sure enough there could be no doubt of it for soon three other men joined the sentry and began to talk with him pointing with their great spears at the side of the hill evidently they were arranging a surprise when there was sufficient light to carry it out  they have seen our fire whispered her father to benita now if we wish to save our lives there is only one thing to doride for it before they muster the impi will be camped upon the other side of the hill so we must take the road we came by  that runs back to bambatse faltered benita  bambatse is better than the grave said her father pray heaven that we may get there  to this argument there was no answer so having drunk a sup of water and swallowing a few mouthfuls of food as they went they crept to the horses mounted them and as silently as possible began to ride down the hill  the sentry was alone again the other three men having departed he stood with his back towards them presently when they were quite close on to him he heard their horses hoofs upon the grass wheeled round at the sound and saw them then with a great shout he lifted his spear and charged  mr clifford who was leading held out his rifle at arms lengthto raise it to his shoulder he had no timeand pulled the trigger benita heard the bullet clap upon the hide shield and next instant saw the matabele warrior lying on his back beating the air with his hands and feet also she saw beyond the shoulder of the kopje which they were rounding hundreds of men marching and behind them a herd of cattle the dim light gleaming upon the stabbing spears and on the horns of the oxen she glanced to the right and there were more men the two wings of the impi were closing upon them only a little lane was left in the middle they must get through before it shut  come she gasped striking the horse with her heel and the butt of her gun and jerking at its mouth  her father saw also and did likewise so that the beasts broke into a gallop now from the point of each wing sprang out thin lines of men looking like great horns or nippers whose business it was to meet and cut them off could they pass between them before they did meet that was the question and upon its answer it depended whether or no they had another three minutes to live to think of mercy at the hands of these bloodthirsty brutes after they had just killed one of their number before their eyes was absurd it was true he had been shot in selfdefence but what count would savages take of that or of the fact that they were but harmless travellers white people were not very popular with the matabele just then as they knew well also their murder in this remote place with not another of their race within a couple of hundred miles would never even be reported and much less avenged it was as safe as any crime could possibly be  all this passed through their minds as they galloped towards those closing points oh the horror of it but two hundred yards to cover and their fate would be decided either they would have escaped at least for a while or time would be done with them or a third alternative they might be taken prisoners in all probability a yet more dreadful doom even then benita determined that if she could help it this should not befall her she had the rifle and the revolver that jacob meyer had given her surely she would be able to find a moment to use one or the other upon herself she clenched her teeth and struck the horse again and again so that now they flew along the matabele soldiers were running their best to catch them and if these had been given but five seconds of start caught they must have been but that short five seconds saved their lives  when they rushed through them the foremost men of the nippers were not more than twenty yards apart seeing that they had passed these halted and hurled a shower of spears after them one flashed by benitas cheek a line of light she felt the wind of it another cut her dress and a third struck her fathers horse in the near hind leg just above the kneejoint remaining fast there for a stride or two and then falling to the ground at first the beast did not seem to be incommoded by this wound indeed it only caused it to gallop quicker and benita rejoiced thinking that it was but a scratch then she forgot about it for some of the matabele who had guns began to shoot them and although their marksmanship was vile one or two of the bullets went nearer than was pleasant lastly a man the swiftest runner of them all shouted after them in zulu  the horse is wounded we will catch you both before the sun sets  then they passed over the crest of a rise and lost sight of them for a while  thank god gasped benita when they were alone again in the silent veld but mr clifford shook his head  do you think they will follow us she asked  you heard what the fellow said he answered evasively doubtless they are on their way to attack bambatse and have been round to destroy some other wretched tribe and steal the cattle which we saw yes i fear that they will follow the question is which of us can get to bambatse first  surely we ought to on the horses father  yes if nothing happens to them and as he spoke the words the mare which he was riding dropped sharply upon her hind leg the same that had been struck with the spear then recovered herself and galloped on  did you see that he asked  she nodded then said  shall we get off and look at the cut  certainly not he answered our only chance is to keep her moving if once the wound stiffens theres an end the sinew cannot have been severed or it would have come before now  so they pushed on  all that morning did they canter forward wherever the ground was smooth enough to allow them to do so and notwithstanding the increasing lameness of mr cliffords mare made such good progress that by midday they reached the place where they had passed the first night after leaving bambatse here sheer fatigue and want of water forced them to stop a little while they dismounted and drank greedily from the spring after which they allowed the horses to drink also indeed it was impossible to keep them away from the water then they ate a little not because they desired food but to keep up their strength and while they did so examined the mare by now her hind leg was much swollen and blood still ran from the gash made by the assegai moreover the limb was drawn up so that the point of the hoof only rested on the ground  we must get on before it sets fast said mr clifford and they mounted again  great heavens what was this the mare would not stir in his despair mr clifford beat it cruelly whereupon the poor brute hobbled forward a few paces on three legs and again came to a standstill either an injured sinew had given or the inflammation was now so intense that it could not bend its knee understanding what this meant to them benitas nerve gave out at last and she burst into weeping  dont cry love he said gods will be done perhaps they have given up the hunt by now at any rate my legs are left and bambatse is not more than sixteen miles away forward now and holding to her saddlestrap they went up the long long slope which led to the poort in the hills around bambatse  they would have liked to shoot the mare but being afraid to fire a rifle could not do so so they left the unhappy beast to its fate and with it everything it carried except a few of the cartridges before they went however at benitas prayer her father devoted a few seconds to unbuckling the girths and pulling off the bridle so that it might have a chance of life for a little way it hobbled after them on three legs then the saddle still upon its back stood whinnying piteously till at last to benitas intense relief a turn in their path hid it from their sight  half a mile further on she looked round in the faint hope that it might have recovered itself and followed but no mare was to be seen something else was to be seen however for there three or four miles away upon the plain behind them easy to be distinguished in that dazzling air were a number of black spots that occasionally seemed to sparkle  what are they she asked faintly as one who feared the answer  the matabele who follow us answered her father or rather a company of their swiftest runners it is their spears that glitter so now my love this is the position he went on as they struggled forward those men will catch us before ever we can get to bambatse they are trained to run like that for fifty miles if need be but with this start they cannot catch your horse you must go on and leave me to look after myself  never never she exclaimed  but you shall and you must i am your father and i order you as for me what does it matter i may hide from them and escape orat least i am old my life is done whereas yours is before you now goodbye and go on and he let go of the saddlestrap  by way of answer benita pulled up the horse  not one yard she said setting her mouth  then he began to storm at her calling her disobedient and undutiful and when this means failed to move her to implore her almost with tears  father dear she said leaning down towards him as he walked for now they were going on again i told you why i wanted to run away from bambatse didnt ibecause i would rather risk my life than stay well do you think that i wish to return there and live in that place alone with jacob meyer also i will tell you another thing you remember about mr seymour well i cant get over that i cant get over it at all and therefore although of course i am afraid it is all one to me no we will escape together or die together the first if we can  then with a groan he gave up the argument and as he found breath they discussed their chances their first idea was to hide but save for a few trees all the country was open there was no place to cover them they thought of the banks of the zambesi but between them and the river rose a bare rockstrewn hill with several miles of slope long before they could reach its crest even if a horse were able to travel there they must be overtaken in short there was nothing to do except to push for the nek and if they were fortunate enough to reach it before the matabele to abandon the horse there and try to conceal themselves among the ruins of the houses beyond this perhaps they might do when once the sun was down  but they did not deceive themselves the chances were at least fifty to one against them unless indeed their pursuers grew weary and let them go  at present however they were by no means weary for having perceived them from far away the longlegged runners put on the pace and the distance between them and their quarry was lessening  father said benita please understand one thing i do not mean to be taken alive by those savages  oh how can i he faltered  i dont ask you she answered i will see to that myself only if i should make any mistake and she looked at him  the old man was getting very tired he panted up the steep hillside and stumbled against the stones benita noted it and slipping from the horse made him mount while she ran alongside then when he was a little rested they changed places again and so covered several miles of country subsequently when both of them were nearly exhausted they tried riding togethershe in front and he behind for their baggage had long since been thrown away but the weary beast could not carry this double burden and after a few hundred yards of it stumbled fell struggled to its feet again and stopped  so once more they were obliged to ride and walk alternately  now there was not much more than an hour of daylight left and the narrow pass lay about three miles ahead of them that dreadful three miles ever thereafter it was benitas favourite nightmare at the beginning of it the leading matabele were about two thousand yards behind them halfway about a thousand and at the commencement of the last mile say five hundred  nature is a wonderful thing and great are its resources in extremity as the actual crisis approached the weariness of these two seemed to depart or at any rate it was forgotten they no longer felt exhausted nor had they been fresh from their beds could they have climbed or run better even the horse seemed to find new energy and when it lagged mr clifford dug the point of his hunting knife into its flank gasping panting now one mounted and now the other they struggled on towards that crest of rock while behind them came death in the shape of those sleuthhounds of matabele the sun was going down and against its flaming ball when they glanced back they could see their dark forms outlined the broad spears also looked red as though they had been dipped in blood they could even hear their taunting shouts as they called to them to sit down and be killed and save trouble  now they were not three hundred yards away and the crest of the pass was still half a mile ahead five minutes passed and here where the track was very rough the horse blundered upwards slowly mr clifford was riding at the time and benita running at his side holding to the stirrup leather she looked behind her the savages fearing that their victims might find shelter over the hill were making a rush and the horse could go no faster one man a great tall fellow quite outdistanced his companions two minutes more and he was not over a hundred paces from them a little nearer than they were to the top of the pass then the horse stopped and refused to stir any more  mr clifford jumped from the saddle and benita who could not speak pointed to the pursuing matabele he sat down upon a rock cocked his rifle took a deep breath and aimed and fired at the soldier who was coming on carelessly in the open mr clifford was a good shot and shaken though he was at this supreme moment his skill did not fail him the man was struck somewhere for he staggered about and fell then slowly picked himself up and began to hobble back towards his companions who when they met him stopped a minute to give him some kind of assistance  that halt proved their salvation for it gave them time to make one last despairing rush and gain the brow of the poort not that this would have saved them however since where they could go the matabele could follow and there was still light by which the pursuers would have been able to see to catch them indeed the savages having laid down the wounded man came on with a yell of rage fifty or more of them  over the pass father and daughter struggled benita riding after them perhaps sixty yards away ran the matabele gathered in a knot now upon the narrow ancient road bordered by steep hillsides  then suddenly from all about them as it appeared to benita broke out the blaze and roar of rifles rapid and continuous down went the matabele by twos and threes till at last it seemed as though but quite a few of them were left upon their feet and those came on no more they turned and fled from the neck of the narrow pass to the open slope beyond  benita sank to the ground and the next thing that she could remember was hearing the soft voice of jacob meyer who said  so you have returned from your ride miss clifford and perhaps it was as well that the thought came from you to me that you wished me to meet you here in this very place     xvi  back at bambatse  how they reached bambatse benita never could remember but afterwards she was told that both she and her father were carried upon litters made of oxhide shields when she came to her own mind again it was to find herself lying in her tent outside the mouth of the cave within the third enclosure of the templefortress her feet were sore and her bones ached physical discomforts that brought back to her in a flash all the terrors through which she had passed  again she saw the fierce pursuing matabele again heard their cruel shouts and the answering crack of the rifles again amidst the din and the gathering darkness distinguished the gentle foreign voice of meyer speaking his words of sarcastic greeting next oblivion fell upon her and after it a dim memory of being helped up the hill with the sun pouring on her back and assisted to climb the steep steps of the wall by means of a rope placed around her then forgetfulness again  the flap of her tent was drawn aside and she shrank back upon her bed shutting her eyes for fear lest they should fall upon the face of jacob meyer feeling that it was not he or learning it perhaps from the footfall she opened them a little peeping at her visitor from between her long lashes he proved to benot jacob or her father but the old molimo who stood beside her holding in his hand a gourd filled with goats milk then she sat up and smiled at him for benita had grown very fond of this ancient man who was so unlike anyone that she had ever met  greeting lady he said softly smiling back at her with his lips and dreamy eyes for his old face did not seem to move beneath its thousand wrinkles i bring you milk drink it is fresh and you need food  so she took the gourd and drank to the last drop for it seemed to her that she had never tasted anything so delicious  good good murmured the molimo now you will be well again  yes i shall get well she answered but oh what of my father  fear not he is still sick but he will recover also you shall see him soon  i have drunk all the milk she broke out there is none left for him  plenty plenty he answered waving his thin hand there are two cups fullone for each we have not many shegoats down below but the best of their milk is saved for you  tell me all that has happened father and the old priest who liked her to call him by that name smiled again with his eyes and squatted down in the corner of the tent  you went away you remember that you would go although i told you that you must come back you refused my wisdom and you went and i have learned all that befell you and how you two escaped the impi well that night after sunset when you did not return came the black oneyes yes i mean meyer whom we name so because of his beard and he added deliberately his heart he came running down the hill asking for you and i gave him the letter  he read it and oh then he went mad he cursed in his own tongue he threw himself about he took a rifle and wished to shoot me but i sat silent and looked at him till he grew quiet then he asked why i had played him this trick but i answered that it was no trick of mine who had no right to keep you and your father prisoners against your will and that i thought you had gone away because you were afraid of him which was not wonderful if that was how he talked to you i told him too i who am a doctor that unless he was careful he would go mad that already i saw madness in his eye after which he became quiet for my words frightened him then he asked what could be done and i saidthat night nothing since you must be far away so that it would be useless to follow you but better to go to meet you when you came back he asked what i meant by your coming back and i answered that i meant what i said that you would come back in great haste and perilalthough you would not believe me when i told you sofor i had it from the munwali whose child you are  so i sent out my spies and that night went by and the next day and night went by and we sat still and did nothing though the black one wished to wander out alone after you but on the following morning at the dawn a messenger came in who reported that it had been called to him by his brethren who were hidden upon hilltops and in other places for miles and miles that the matabele impi having destroyed another family of the makalanga far down the zambesi was advancing to destroy us also and in the afternoon came a second spy who reported that you two had been surrounded by the impi but had broken through them and were riding hitherward for your lives then i took fifty of the best of our people and put them under the command of tamas my son and sent them to ambush the pass for against the matabele warriors on the plain we who are not warlike do not dare to fight  the black one went with them and when he saw how sore was your strait wished to run down to meet the matabele for he is a brave man but i had said to tamasno do not try to fight them in the open for there they will certainly kill you moreover lady i was sure that you would reach the top of the poort well you reached it though but by the breadth of a blade of grass and my children shot with the new rifles and the place being narrow so that they could not miss killed many of those hyenas of amandabele but to kill matabele is like catching fleas on a dogs back there are always more still it served its turn you and your father were brought away safely and we lost no one  where then are the matabele now asked benita  outside our walls a whole regiment of them three thousand men or more under the command of the captain maduna he of the royal blood whose life you begged but who nevertheless hunted you like a buck  perhaps he did not know who it was suggested benita  perhaps not the molimo answered rubbing his chin for in such matters even a matabele generally keeps faith and you may remember he promised you life for life however they are here ravening like lions round the walls and that is why we carried you up to the top of the hill that you might be safe from them  but are you safe my father  i think so he replied with a dry little chuckle in his throat whoever built this fortress built it strong and we have blocked the gates also they caught no one outside all are within the walls together with the sheep and goats lastly we have sent most of the women and children across the zambesi in canoes to hide in places we know of whither the amandabele cannot follow for they dare not swim a river therefore for those of us that remain we have food for three months and before then the rains will drive the impi out  why did you not all go across the river father  for two reasons lady the first is that if we once abandoned our stronghold which we have held from the beginning lobengula would take it and keep it so that we could never reenter into our heritage which would be a shame to us and bring down the vengeance of the spirits of our ancestors upon our heads the second is that as you have returned to us we stay to protect you  you are very good to me murmured benita  nay nay we brought you here and we do what i am told to do from above trouble may still come upon you yes i think that it will come but once more i pray you have no fear for out of this evil root shall spring a flower of joy and he rose to go  stay said benita has the chief meyer found the gold  no he has found nothing but he hunts and hunts like a hungry jackal digging for a bone but that bone is not for him it is for you lady you and you only oh i know you do not seek still you shall find only the next time that you want help do not run away into the wilderness hear the word of munwali given by his mouth the molimo of bambatse and as he spoke the old priest backed himself out of the tent stopping now and again to bow to benita  a few minutes later her father entered looking very weak and shaken and supporting himself upon a stick happy was the greeting of these two who with their arms about each others neck gave thanks for their escape from great peril  you see benita we cant get away from this place mr clifford said presently we must find that gold  bother the gold she answered with energy i hate its very name who can think of gold with three thousand matabele waiting to kill us  somehow i dont feel afraid of them any more said her father they have had their chance and lost it and the makalanga swear that now they have guns to command the gates the fortress cannot be stormed still i am afraid of someone  who  jacob mayer i have seen him several times and i think that he is going mad  the molimo said that too but why  from the look of him he sits about muttering and glowing with those dark eyes of his and sometimes groans and sometimes bursts into shouts of laughter that is when the fit is on him for generally he seems right enough but get up if you think you can and you shall judge for yourself  i dont want to said benita feebly father i am more afraid of him now than ever oh why did you not let me stop down below among the makalanga instead of carrying me up here again where we must live alone with that terrible jew  i wished to dear but the molimo said we should be safer above and ordered his people to carry you up also jacob swore that unless you were brought back he would kill me now you understand why i believe that he is mad  why why gasped benita again  god knows he answered with a groan but i think that he is sure that we shall never find the gold without you since the molimo has told him that it is for you and you alone and he says the old man has second sight or something of the sort well he would have murdered mei saw it in his eyeso i thought it better to give in rather than that you should be left here sick and alone of course there was one way and he paused  she looked at him and asked  what way  to shoot him before he shot me he answered in a whisper for your sake dearbut i could not bring myself to do it  no she said with a shudder not thatnot that better that we should die than that his blood should be upon our hands now i will get up and try to show no fear i am sure that is best and perhaps we shall be able to escape somehow meanwhile let us humour him and pretend to go on looking for this horrible treasure  so benita rose to discover that save for her stiffness she was but little the worse and finding all things placed in readiness set to work with her fathers help to cook the evening meal as usual of meyer who doubtless had placed things in readiness she saw nothing  before nightfall he came however as she knew he would indeed although she heard no step and her back was towards him she felt his presence the sense of it fell upon her like a cold shadow turning round she beheld the man he was standing close by but above her upon a big granite boulder in climbing which his soft veld schoons or hide shoes had made no noise for meyer could move like a cat the last rays from the sinking sun struck him full outlining his agile nervous shape against the sky and in their intense red light which flamed upon him he appeared terrible he looked like a panther about to spring his eyes shone like a panthers and benita knew that she was the prey whom he desired still remembering her resolution she determined to show no fear and addressed him  goodevening mr meyer oh i am so stiff that i cannot lift my neck to look at you and she laughed  he bounded softly from the rock like a panther again and stood in front of her  you should thank the god you believe in he said that by now you are not stiff indeedall that the jackals have left of you  i do mr meyer and i thank you too it was brave of you to come out to save us father she called come and tell mr meyer how grateful we are to him  mr clifford hobbled out from his hut under the tree saying  i have told him already dear  yes answered jacob you have told me why repeat yourself i see that supper is ready let us eat for you must be hungry afterwards i have something to tell you  so they ate with no great appetite any of themindeed meyer touched but little food though he drank a good deal first of strong black coffee and afterwards of squareface and water but on benita he pressed the choicest morsels that he could find eyeing her all the while and saying that she must take plenty of nutriment or her beauty would suffer and her strength wane benita bethought her of the fairy tales of her childhood in which the ogre fed up the princess whom he purposed to devour  you should think of your own strength mr meyer she said you cannot live on coffee and squareface  it is all i need tonight i am astonishingly well since you came back i can never remember feeling so well or so strong i can do the work of three men and not be tired all this afternoon for instance i have been carrying provisions and other things up that steep wall for we must prepare for a long siege together yet i should never know that i had lifted a single basket but while you were awayah then i felt tired  benita changed the subject asking him if he had made any discoveries  not yet but now that you are back the discoveries will soon come do not be afraid i have my plan which cannot fail also it was lonely working in that cave without you so i only looked about a little outside till it was time to go to meet you and shoot some of those matabele do you knowi killed seven of them myself when i was shooting for your sake i could not miss and he smiled at her  benita shrank from him visibly and mr clifford said in an angry voice  dont talk of those horrors before my daughter it is bad enough to have to do such things without speaking about them afterwards  you are right he replied reflectively and i apologise though personally i never enjoyed anything so much as shooting those matabele well they are gone and there are plenty more outside listen they are singing their evening hymn and with his long finger he beat time to the volleying notes of the dreadful matabele warchant which floated up from the plain below it sounds quite religious doesnt it only the wordsno i will not translate them in our circumstances they are too personal  now i have something to say to you it was unkind of you to run away and leave me like that not honourable either indeed he added with a sudden outbreak of the panther ferocity had you alone been concerned clifford i tell you frankly that when we met again i should have shot you traitors deserve to be shot dont they  please stop talking to my father like that broke in benita in a stern voice for her anger had overcome her fear also it is i whom you should blame  it is a pleasure to obey you he answered bowing i will never mention the subject any more nor do i blame youwho couldnot jacob meyer i quite understand that you found it very dull up here and ladies must be allowed their fancies also you have come back so why talk of the matter but listen on one point i have made up my mind for your own sake you shall not go away any more until we leave this together when i had finished carrying up the food i made sure of that if you go to look tomorrow morning you will find that no one can come up that walland what is more no one can go down it moreover that i may be quite certain in future i shall sleep near the stair myself  benita and her father stared at each other  the molimo has a right to come she said it is his sanctuary  then he must celebrate his worship down below for a little while the old fool pretends to know everything but he never guessed what i was going to do besides we dont want him breaking in upon our privacy do we he might see the gold when we find it and rob us of it afterwards     xvii  the first experiment  again benita and her father stared at each other blankly almost with despair they were trapped cut off from all help in the power of a man who was going mad mr clifford said nothing he was old and growing feeble for years although he did not know it meyer had dominated him and never more so than in this hour of stress and bewilderment moreover the man had threatened to murder him and he was afraid not so much for himself as for his daughter if he were to die now what would happen to her left alone with jacob meyer the knowledge of his own folly understood too late filled him with shame how could he have been so wicked as to bring a girl upon such a quest in the company of an unprincipled jew of whose past he knew nothing except that it was murky and dubious he had committed a great crime led on by a love of lucre and the weight of it pressed upon his tongue and closed his lips he knew not what to say  for a little while benita was silent also hope died within her but she was a boldspirited woman and by degrees her courage reasserted itself indignation filled her breast and shone through her dark eyes suddenly she turned upon jacob who sat before them smoking his pipe and enjoying their discomfiture  how dare you she asked in a low concentrated voice how dare you you coward  he shrank a little beneath her scorn and anger then seemed to recover and brace himself as one does who feels that a great struggle is at hand upon the issue of which everything depends  do not be angry with me he answered i cannot bear it it hurtsah you dont know how it hurts well i will tell you and before your father for that is more honourable i darefor your sake  for my sake how can it benefit me to be cooped up in this horrible place with you i would rather trust myself with the makalanga or even she added with bitter scorn even with those bloodyminded matabele  you ran away from them very fast a little while ago miss clifford but you do not understand me when i said for your sake i meant for my own see now you tried to leave me the other day and did not succeed another time you might succeed and thenwhat would happen to me  i do not know mr meyer and her eyes addedi do not care  ah but i know last time it drove me nearly mad next time i should go quite mad  because you believe that through me you will find this treasure of which you dream day and night mr meyer  yes he interrupted quickly because i believe that in you i shall find the treasure of which i dream day and night and because that treasure has become necessary to my life  benita turned quickly towards her father who was puzzling over the words but before either of them could speak jacob passed his hand across his brow in a bewildered way and said  what was i talking of the treasure yes the uncountable treasure of pure gold that lies hid so deep that is so hard to discover and to possess the useless buried treasure that would bring such joy and glory to us both if only it could be come at and reckoned out piece by piece coin by coin through the long long years of life  again he paused then went on  well miss clifford you are quite right that is why i have dared to make you a prisoner because as the old molimo said the treasure is yours and i wish to share it now about this treasure it seems that it cant be found can it although i have worked so hard and he looked at his delicate scarred hands  quite so mr meyer it cant be found so you had better let us go down to the makalanga  but there is a way miss clifford there is a way you know where it lies and you can show me  if i knew i would show you soon enough mr meyer for then you could take the stuff and our partnership would be at an end  not until it is divided ounce by ounce and coin by coin but firstfirst you must show me as you say you will and as you can  how mr meyer i am not a magician  ah but you are i will tell you how having your promise listen now both of you i have studied i know a great many secret things and i read in your face that you have the giftlet me look in your eyes a while miss clifford and you will go to sleep quite gently and then in your sleep which shall not harm you at all you will see where that gold lies hidden and you will tell us  what do you mean asked benita bewildered  i know what he means broke in mr clifford you mean that you want to mesmerize her as you did the zulu chief  benita opened her lips to speak but meyer said quickly  no no hear me first before you refuse you have the gift the precious gift of clairvoyance that is so rare  how do you know that mr meyer i have never been mesmerized in my life  it does not matter how i do know it i have been sure of it from the moment when first we met that night by the kloof although perhaps you felt nothing then it was that gift of yours working upon a mind in tune my mind which led me there in time to save you as it was that gift of yours which warned you of the disaster about to happen to the shipoh i have heard the story from your own lips your spirit can loose itself from the body it can see the past and the future it can discover the hidden things  i do not believe it answered benita but at least it shall not be loosed by you  it shall it shall he cried with passion his eyes blazing on her as he spoke oh i foresaw all this and that is why i was determined you should come with us so that should other means fail we might have your power to fall back upon well they have failed i have been patient i have said nothing but now there is no other way will you be so selfish so cruel as to deny me you who can make us all rich in an hour and take no hurt at all no more than if you had slept awhile  yes answered benita i refuse to deliver my will into the keeping of any living man and least of all into yours mr meyer  he turned to her father with a gesture of despair  cannot you persuade her clifford she is your daughter she will obey you  not in that said benita  no answered mr clifford i cannot and i wouldnt if i could my daughter is quite right moreover i hate this supernatural kind of thing if we cant find this gold without it then we must let it alone that is all  meyer turned aside to hide his face and presently looked up again and spoke quite softly  i suppose that i must accept my answer but when you talked of any living man just now miss clifford did you include your father  she shook her head  then will you allow him to try to mesmerize you  benita laughed  oh yes if he likes she said but i do not think that the operation will be very successful  good we will see tomorrow now like you i am tired i am going to bed in my new camp by the wall he added significantly    why are you so dead set against this business asked her father when he had gone  oh father she answered cant you see dont you understand then it is hard to have to tell you but i must in the beginning mr meyer only wanted the gold now he wants more me as well as the gold i hate him you know that is why i ran away but i have read a good deal about this mesmerism and seen it once or twice and who knows if once i allow his mind to master my mind although i hate him so much i might become his slave  i understand now said mr clifford oh why did i ever bring you here it would have been better if i had never seen your face again   on the morrow the experiment was made mr clifford attempted to mesmerize his daughter all the morning jacob who it now appeared had practical knowledge of this doubtful art tried to instruct him therein in the course of the lesson he informed him that for a short period in the past having great natural powers in that direction he had made use of them professionally only giving up the business because he found it wrecked his health mr clifford remarked that he had never told him that before  there are lots of things in my life that i have never told you replied jacob with a little secret smile for instance once i mesmerized you although you did not know it and that is why you always have to do what i want you to except when your daughter is near you for her influence is stronger than mine  mr clifford stared at him  no wonder benita wont let you mesmerize her he said shortly  then jacob saw his mistake  you are more foolish than i thought he said how could i mesmerize you without your knowing it i was only laughing at you  i didnt see the laugh replied mr clifford uneasily and they went on with the lesson  that afternoon it was put to proofin the cave itself where meyer seemed to think that the influences would be propitious benita who found some amusement in the performance was seated upon the stone steps underneath the crucifix one lamp on the altar and others one each side of her  in front stood her father staring at her and waving his hands mysteriously in obedience to jacobs directions so ridiculous did he look indeed while thus engaged that benita had the greatest difficulty in preventing herself from bursting into laughter this was the only effect which his grimaces and gesticulations produced upon her although outwardly she kept a solemn appearance and even from time to time shut her eyes to encourage him once when she opened them again it was to perceive that he was becoming very hot and exhausted and that jacob was watching him with such an unpleasant intentness that she reclosed her eyes that she might not see his face  it was shortly after this that of a sudden benita did feel something a kind of penetrating power flowing upon her something soft and subtle that seemed to creep into her brain like the sound of her mothers lullaby in the dim years ago she began to think that she was a lost traveller among alpine snows wrapped round by snow falling falling in ten myriad flakes every one of them with a little heart of fire then it came to her that she had heard this snowsleep was dangerous the last of all sleeps and that its victims must rouse themselves or die  benita roused herself just in timeonly just for now she was being borne over the edge of a precipice upon the wings of swans and beneath her was darkness wherein dim figures walked with lamps where their hearts should be oh how heavy were her eyelids surely a weight hung to each of them a golden weight there there they were open and she saw her father had ceased his efforts he was rubbing his brow with a red pockethandkerchief but behind him with rigid arms outstretched his glowing eyes fastened on her face stood jacob meyer by an effort she sprang to her feet shaking her head as a dog does  have done with this nonsense she said it tires me and snatching one of the lamps she ran swiftly down the place  benita expected that jacob meyer would be very angry with her and braced herself for a scene but nothing of the sort happened a while afterwards she saw the two of them approaching engaged apparently in amicable talk  mr meyer says that i am no mesmerist love said her father and i can quite believe him but for all that it is a weary job i am as tired as i was after our escape from the matabele  she laughed and answered  to judge by results i agree with you the occult is not in your line father you had better give it up  did you then feel nothing asked meyer  nothing at all she answered looking him in the eyes no thats wrong i felt extremely bored and sorry to see my father making himself ridiculous grey hairs and nonsense of that sort dont go well together  no he answered i agree with younot of that sort and the subject dropped  for the next few days to her intense relief benita heard no more of mesmerism to begin with there was something else to occupy their minds the matabele tired of marching round the fortress and singing endless warsongs had determined upon an assault from their point of vantage on the topmost wall the three could watch the preparations which they made trees were cut down and brought in from a great distance that rude ladders might be fashioned out of them also spies wandered round reconnoitring for a weak place in the defences when they came too near the makalanga fired on them killing some so that they retreated to the camp which they had made in a fold of ground at a little distance suddenly it occurred to meyer that although here the matabele were safe from the makalanga bullets it was commanded from the greater eminence and by way of recreation he set himself to harass them his rifle was a sporting martini and he had an ample supply of ammunition moreover he was a beautiful marksman with sight like that of a hawk  a few trial shots gave him the range it was a shade under seven hundred yards and then he began operations lying on the top of the wall and resting his rifle upon a stone he waited until the man who was superintending the manufacture of the ladders came out into the open when aiming carefully he fired the soldier a whitebearded savage sprang into the air and fell backwards while his companions stared upwards wondering whence the bullet had come  pretty wasnt it said meyer to benita who was watching through a pair of fieldglasses  i dare say she answered but i dont want to see any more and giving the glasses to her father she climbed down the wall  but meyer stayed there and from time to time she heard the report of his rifle in the evening he told her that he had killed six men and wounded ten more adding that it was the best days shooting which he could remember  what is the use when there are so many she asked  not much he answered but it annoys them and amuses me also it was part of our bargain that we should help the makalanga if they were attacked  i believe that you like killing people she said  i dont mind it miss clifford especially as they tried to kill you     xviii  the other benita  at irregular times when he had nothing else to do jacob went on with his manshooting in which mr clifford joined him though with less effect soon it became evident that the matabele were very much annoyed by the fatal accuracy of this fire loss of life they did not mind in the abstract but when none of them knew but that their own turn might come next to perish beneath these downward plunging bullets the matter wore a different face to them to leave their camp was not easy since they had made a thorn boma round it to protect them in case the makalanga should make a night sally also they could find no other convenient spot the upshot of it all was to hurry their assault which they delivered before they had prepared sufficient ladders to make it effective  at the first break of dawn on the third day after mr cliffords attempt at mesmerism benita was awakened by the sounds of shouts and firing having dressed herself hastily she hurried in the growing light towards that part of the wall from below which the noise seemed to come and climbing it found her father and jacob already seated there their rifles in hand  the fools are attacking the small gate through which you went out riding miss clifford the very worst place that they could have chosen although the wall looks very weak there said the latter if those makalanga have any pluck they ought to teach them a lesson  then the sun rose and they saw companies of matabele who carried ladders in their hands rushing onwards through the morning mist till their sight of them was obstructed by the swell of the hill on these companies the two white men opened fire with what result they could not see in that light presently a great shout announced that the enemy had gained the fosse and were setting up the ladders up to this time the makalanga appeared to have done nothing but now they began to fire rapidly from the ancient bastions which commanded the entrance the impi was striving to storm and soon through the thinning fog they perceived wounded matabele staggering and crawling back towards their camp of these the light now better jacob did not neglect to take his toll  meanwhile the ancient fortress rang with the hideous tumult of the attack it was evident that again and again as their fierce warshouts proclaimed the matabele were striving to scale the wall and again and again were beaten back by the raking rifle fire once a triumphant yell seemed to announce their success the fire slackened and benita grew pale with fear  the makalanga cowards are bolting muttered mr clifford listening with terrible anxiety  but if so their courage came back to them for presently the guns cracked louder and more incessant than before and the savage cries of kill kill kill dwindled and died away another five minutes and the matabele were in full retreat bearing with them many dead and wounded men upon their backs or stretched out on the ladders  our makalanga friends should be grateful to us for those hundred rifles said jacob as he loaded and fired rapidly sending his bullets wherever the clusters were thickest had it not been for them their throats would have been cut by now he added for they could never have stopped those savages with the spear  yes and ours too before nightfall said benita with a shudder for the sight of this desperate fray and fear of how it might end had sickened her thank heaven it is over perhaps they will give up the siege and go away  but notwithstanding their costly defeat for they had lost over a hundred men the matabele who were afraid to return to buluwayo except as victors did nothing of the sort they only cut down a quantity of reeds and scrub and moved their camp nearly to the banks of the river placing it in such a position that it could no longer be searched by the fire of the two white men here they sat themselves down sullenly hoping to starve out the garrison or to find some other way of entering the fortress  now meyers shooting having come to an end for lack of men to shoot at since the enemy exposed themselves no more he was again able to give his full attention to the matter of the treasure hunt  as nothing could be found in the cave he devoted himself to the outside enclosure which it may be remembered was grown over with grass and trees and crowded with ruins in the most important of these ruins they began to dig somewhat aimlessly and were rewarded by finding a certain amount of gold in the shape of beads and ornaments and a few more skeletons of ancients but of the portuguese hoard there was no sign thus it came about that they grew gloomier day by day till at last they scarcely spoke to each other jacobs angry disappointment was written on his face and benita was filled with despair since to escape from their gaoler above and the matabele below seemed impossible moreover she had another cause for anxiety  the illhealth which had been threatening her father for a long while now fell upon him in earnest so that of a sudden he became a very old man his strength and energy left him and his mind was so filled with remorse for what he held to be his crime in bringing his daughter to this awful place and with terror for the fate that threatened her that he could think of nothing else in vain did she try to comfort him he would only wring his hands and groan praying that god and she would forgive him now too meyers mastery over him became continually more evident mr clifford implored the man almost with tears to unblock the wall and allow them to go down to the makalanga he even tried to bribe him with the offer of all his share of the treasure if it were found and when that failed of his property in the transvaal  but jacob only told him roughly not to be a fool as they had to see the thing through together then he would go again and brood by himself and benita noticed that he always took his rifle or a pistol with him evidently he feared lest her father should catch him unprepared and take the law into his own hands by means of a sudden bullet  one comfort she had however although he watched her closely the jew never tried to molest her in any way not even with more of his enigmatic and amorous speeches by degrees indeed she came to believe that all this was gone from his mind or that he had abandoned his advances as hopeless  a week passed since the matabele attack and nothing had happened the makalanga took no notice of them and so far as she was aware the old molimo never attempted to climb the blocked wall or otherwise to communicate with them a thing so strange that knowing his affection for her benita came to the conclusion that he must be dead killed perhaps in the attack even jacob meyer had abandoned his digging and sat about all day doing nothing but think  their meal that night was a miserable affair since in the first place provisions were running short and there was little to eat and in the second no one spoke a word benita could swallow no food she was weary of that sundried trekox for since meyer had blocked the wall they had little else but by good fortune there remained plenty of coffee and of this she drank two cups which jacob prepared and handed to her with much politeness it tasted very bitter to her but this benita reflected was because they lacked milk and sugar supper ended meyer rose and bowed to her muttering that he was going to bed and a few minutes later mr clifford followed his example she went with her father to the hut beneath the tree and having helped him to remove his coat which now he seemed to find difficulty in doing for himself bade him goodnight and returned to the fire  it was very lonely there in the silence for no sound came from either the matabele or the makalanga camps and the bright moonlight seemed to people the place with fantastic shadows that looked alive benita cried a little now that her father could not see her and then also sought refuge in bed evidently the end whatever it might be was near and of it she could not bear to think moreover her eyes were strangely heavy so much so that before she had finished saying her prayers sleep fell upon her and she knew no more  had she remained as wakeful as it was often her fate to be during those fearful days towards midnight she might have heard some lightfooted creature creeping to her tent and seen that the moonrays which flowed through the gaping and illclosed flap were cut off by the figure of a man with glowing eyes whose projected arms waved over her mysteriously but benita neither heard nor saw in her drugged rest she did not know that her sleep turned gradually to a magic swoon she had no knowledge of her rising or of how she threw her thick cloak about her lit her lamp and in obedience to that beckoning finger glided from the tent she never heard her father stumble from his hut disturbed by the sound of footsteps or the words that passed between him and jacob meyer while lamp in hand she stood near them like a strengthless ghost  if you dare to wake her hissed jacob i tell you that she will die and afterwards you shall die and he fingered the pistol at his belt no harm shall come to heri swear it follow and see man man be silent our fortunes hang on it  then overcome also by the strange fierceness of that voice and gaze he followed  on they go to the winding neck of the cavern first jacob walking backwards like the herald of majesty then majesty itself in the shape of this longhaired deathlike woman cloaked and bearing in her hand the light and last behind the old whitebearded man like time following beauty to the grave now they were in the great cavern and now avoiding the open tombs the well mouth and the altar they stood beneath the crucifix  be seated said meyer and the entranced benita sat herself down upon the steps at the foot of the cross placing the lamp on the rock pavement before her and bowing her head till her hair fell upon her naked feet and hid them he held his hands above her for a while then asked  do you sleep  i sleep came the strange slow answer  is your spirit awake  it is awake  command it to travel backwards through the ages to the beginning and tell me what you see here  i see a rugged cave and wild folk dwelling in it an old man is dying yonder and she pointed to the right and a black woman with a babe at her breast tends him a man it is her husband enters the cave he holds a torch in one hand and with the other drags a buck  cease said meyer how long is this ago  thirtythree thousand two hundred and one years came the answer spoken without any hesitation  pass on he said pass on thirty thousand years and tell me what you see  for a long while there was silence  why do you not speak he asked  be patient i am living through those thirty thousand years many a life many an age but none may be missed  again there was silence for a long while till at length she spoke  they are done all of them and now three thousand years ago i see this place changed and smoothly fashioned peopled by a throng of worshippers clad in strange garments with clasps upon them behind me stands the graven statue of a goddess with a calm and cruel face in front of the altar burns a fire and on the altar whiterobed priests are sacrificing an infant which cries aloud  pass on pass on meyer said hurriedly as though the horror of that scene had leapt to his eyes pass on two thousand seven hundred years and tell me what you see  again there was a pause while the spirit he had evoked in the body of benita lived through those ages then slowly she answered  nothing the place is black and desolate only the dead sleep beneath its floor  wait till the living come again he commanded then speak  they are here she replied presently tonsured monks one of whom fashions this crucifix and their followers who bow before the host upon the altar they come they goof whom shall i tell you  tell me of the portuguese of those who were driven here to die  i see them all she answered after a pause two hundred and three of them they are ragged and wayworn and hungry among them is a beautiful woman a girl she draws near to me she enters into me you must ask herthis was spoken in a very faint voicei am i no more  mr clifford attempted to interrupt but fiercely meyer bade him to be silent  speak he commanded but the crouching figure shook her head  speak he said again whereon another voice not that of benita answered in another tongue  i hear but i do not understand your language  great heaven said meyer it is portuguese and for a while the terror of the thing struck him dumb for he was aware that benita knew no portuguese he knew it however who had lived at lorenço marquez  who are you he asked in that tongue  i am benita da ferreira i am the daughter of the captain da ferreira and of his wife the lady christinha who stand by you now turn and you will see them  jacob started and looked about him uneasily  what did she say i did not catch it all asked mr clifford  he translated her words  but this is black magic exclaimed the old man benita knows no portuguese so how comes she to speak it  because she is no longer our benita she is another benita benita da ferreira the molimo was right when he said that the spirit of the dead woman went with her as it seems the name has gone he added  have done said mr clifford the thing is unholy wake her up or i will  and bring about her death touch or disturb her and i tell you she will die and he pointed to benita who crouched before them so white and motionless that indeed it seemed as though already she were dead be quiet he went on i swear to you that no hurt shall come to her also that i will translate everything to you promise or i will tell you nothing and her blood be on your head  then mr clifford groaned and said  i promise  tell me your story benita da ferreira how came you and your people here  the tribes of monomotapa rose against our rule they killed many of us in the lower land yes they killed my brother and him to whom i was affianced the rest of us fled north to this ancient fortress hoping thence to escape by the river the zambesi the mambo our vassal gave us shelter here but the tribes besieged the walls in thousands and burnt all the boats so that we could not fly by the water many times we beat them back from the wall the ditch was full of their dead and at last they dared to attack no more  then we began to starve and they won the first wall we went on starving and they won the second wall but the third wall they could not climb so we died one by one we laid ourselves down in this cave and died till i alone was left for while our people had food they gave it to me who was the daughter of their captain yes alone i knelt at the foot of this crucifix by the body of my father praying to the blessed son of mary for the death that would not come and kneeling there i swooned when i awoke again the mambo and his men stood about me for now knowing us to be dead the tribes had gone and those who were in hiding across the river had returned and knew how to climb the wall they bore me from among the dead they gave me food so that my strength came back but in the night i who in my wickedness would not live escaped from them and climbed the pillar of black rock so that when the sun rose they saw me standing there they begged of me to come down promising to protect me but i said no who in the evil of my heart only desired to die that i might join my father and my brother and one who was dearer to me than all they asked of me where the great treasure was hidden  at these words jacob gasped then rapidly translated them while the figure before them became silent as though it felt that for the moment the power of his will was withdrawn  speak on i bid you he said and she continued the rich slow voice dropping word after word from the lips of benita in the alien speech that this benita never knew  i answered that it was where it was and that if they gave it up to any save the one appointed then that fate which had befallen my people would befall theirs also yes i gave it into their keeping until i came again since with his dying breath my father had commanded me to reveal it to none and i believed that i who was about to die should never come again  then i made my last prayer i kissed the golden crucifix that now hangs upon this breast wherein i dwell and the hand of the living benita was lifted and moving like the hand of a dead thing slowly drew out the symbol from beneath the cloak held it for a moment in the lamplight and let it fall to its place again i put my hands before my eyes that i might not see and i hurled myself from the pinnacle  now the voice ceased but from the lips came a dreadful sound such as might be uttered by one whose bones are shattered upon rocks followed by other sounds like those of one who chokes in water they were so horrible to hear that mr clifford nearly fainted and even jacob meyer staggered and turned white as the white face of benita  wake her for gods sake wake her said her father she is dying as that woman died hundreds of years ago  not till she has told us where the gold is be quiet you fool she does not feel or suffer it is the spirit within her that lives through the past again  once more there was silence it seemed as though the story were all told and the teller had departed  benita da ferreira said meyer at length i command you tell me are you dead  oh would that i were dead as my body is dead wailed the lips of benita alas i cannot die who suffer this purgatory and must dwell on here alone until the destined day yes yes the spirit of her who was benita da ferreira must haunt this place in solitude this is her doom to be the guardian of that accursed gold which was wrung from the earth by cruelty and paid for with the lives of men  is it still safe whispered jacob  i will look then after a pause i have looked it is there every grain of it in oxhide bags only one of them has fallen and burst that which is black and red  where is it he said again  i may not tell you never never  is there anyone whom you may tell  yes  whom  her in whose breast i lie  tell her then  i have told her she knows  and may she tell me  let her guard the secret as she will o my guardian i thank thee my burden is departed my sin of selfmurder is atoned  benita da ferreira are you gone  no answer  benita clifford do you hear me  i hear you said the voice of benita speaking in english although jacob forgetting had addressed her in portuguese  where is the gold  in my keeping  tell me i command you  but no words came though he questioned her many times no words came till at last her head sank forward upon her knees and in a faint voice she murmured  loose me or i die     xix  the awaking  still jacob meyer hesitated the great secret was unlearned and if this occasion passed might never be learned but if he hesitated mr clifford did not the knowledge of his childs danger the sense that her life was mysteriously slipping away from her under pressure of the ghastly spell in which she lay enthralled stirred him to madness his strength and manhood came back to him he sprang straight at meyers throat gripped it with one hand and with the other drew the knife he wore  you devil he gasped wake her or you shall go with her and he lifted the knife  then jacob gave in shaking off his assailant he stepped to benita and while her father stood behind him with the lifted blade began to make strange upward passes over her and to mutter words of command for a long while they took no effect indeed both of them were almost sure that she was gone despair gripped her father and meyer worked at his black art so furiously that the sweat burst out upon his forehead and fell in great drops to the floor  oh at last at last she stirred her head lifted itself a little her breast heaved  lord in heaven i have saved her muttered jacob in german and worked on  now the eyes of benita opened and now she stood up and sighed but she said nothing only like a person walking in her sleep she began to move towards the entrance of the cave her father going before her with the lamp on she went and out of it straight to her tent where instantly she cast herself upon her bed and sank into deep slumber it was as though the power of the druginduced oblivion which for a while was overmastered by that other stronger power invoked by jacob had reasserted itself  meyer watched her for awhile then said to mr clifford  dont be afraid and dont attempt to disturb her she will wake naturally in the morning  i hope so for both our sakes he answered glaring at him for if not you or i or the two of us will never see another  meyer took no notice of his threats indeed the man seemed so exhausted that he could scarcely stand  i am done he said now as she is safe i dont care what happens to me i must rest and he staggered from the tent like a drunken man  outside at the place where they ate mr clifford heard him gulping down raw gin from the bottle then he heard no more  all the rest of the night and for some hours of the early morning did her father watch by the bed of benita although lightly clad as he was the cold of dawn struck to his bones at length when the sun was well up she rose in her bed and her eyes opened  what are you doing here father she said  i have come to see where you were dear you are generally out by now  i suppose that i must have overslept myself then she replied wearily but it does not seem to have refreshed me much and my head aches oh i remember she added with a start i have had such a horrid dream  what about he asked as carelessly as he could  i cant recall it quite but it had to do with mr meyer and she shivered it seemed as though i had passed into his power as though he had taken possession of me body and soul and forced me to tell him all the secret things  what secret things benita  she shook her head  i dont know now but we went away among dead people and i told him there oh father i am afraid of that manterribly afraid protect me from him and she began to cry a little  of course i will protect you dear something has upset your nerves come dress yourself and youll soon forget it all ill light the fire  a quarter of an hour later benita joined him looking pale and shaken but otherwise much as usual she was ravenously hungry and ate of the biscuits and dried meat with eagerness  the coffee tastes quite different from that which i drank last night she said i think there must have been something in it which gave me those bad dreams where is mr meyer oh i know and again she put her hand to her head he is still asleep by the wall  who told you that  i cant say but it is so he will not come here till one oclock there i feel much better now what shall we do father  sit in the sun and rest i think dear  yes let us do that on the top of the wall we can see the makalanga from there and it will be a comfort to be sure that there are other human beings left in the world besides ourselves and jacob meyer  so presently they went and from the spot whence meyer used to shoot at the matabele camp looked down upon the makalanga moving about the first enclosure far below by the aid of the glasses benita even thought that she recognised tamas although of this it was difficult to be sure for they were all very much alike still the discovery quite excited her  i am sure it is tamas she said and oh how i wish that we were down there with him although it is true that then we should be nearer to the matabele but they are better than mr meyer much better  now for a while they were silent till at length she said suddenly  father you are keeping something back from me and things begin to come back tell me did i go anywhere last night with mr meyeryou and he and i together  he hesitated and looked guilty mr clifford was not a good actor  i see that we did i am sure that we did father tell me i must know i will know  then he gave way  i didnt want to speak dear but perhaps it is best it is a very strange story will you promise not to be upset  i will promise not to be more upset than i am at present she answered with a sad little laugh go on  you remember that jacob meyer wanted to mesmerize you  i am not likely to forget it she answered  well last night he did mesmerize you  what she said what oh how dreadful now i understand it all but when  when you were sound asleep i suppose at least the first i knew of it was that some noise woke me and i came out of the hut to see you following him like a dead woman with a lamp in your hand  then he told her all the story while she listened aghast  how dared he she gasped when her father had finished the long tale i hate him i almost wish that you had killed him and she clenched her little hands and shook them in the air  that is not very christian of you miss clifford said a voice behind her but it is past one oclock and as i am still alive i have come to tell you that it is time for luncheon  benita wheeled round upon the stone on which she sat and there standing amidst the bushes a little way from the foot of the wall was jacob meyer their eyes met hers were full of defiance and his of conscious power  i do not want any luncheon mr meyer she said  but i am sure that you do please come down and have some please come down  the words were spoken humbly almost pleadingly yet to benita they seemed as a command at any rate with slow reluctance she climbed down the shattered wall followed by her father and without speaking they went back to their camping place all three of them jacob leading the way  when they had eaten or made pretence to eat he spoke  i see that your father has told you everything miss clifford and of that i am glad as for me it would have been awkward who must ask your forgiveness for so much but what could i do i knew as i have always known that it was only possible to find this treasure by your help so i gave you something to make you sleep and then in your sleep i hypnotized you andyou know the rest i have great experience in this art but i have never seen or heard of anything like what happened and i hope i never shall again  hitherto benita had sat silent but now her burning indignation and curiosity overcame her shame and hatred  mr meyer she said you have done a shameful and a wicked thing and i tell you at once that i can never forgive you  dont say that please dont say that he interrupted in tones of real grief make allowances for me i had to learn and there was no other way you are a born clairvoyante one among ten thousand my art told me so and you know all that is at stake  by which you mean so many ounces of gold mr meyer  by which i mean the greatness that gold can give miss clifford  such greatness mr meyer as a week of fever or a matabele spear or gods will can rob you of but the thing is done and soon or late the sin must be paid for now i want to ask you a question you believe in nothing you have told me so several times you say that there is no such thing as a spirit that when we die we die and theres an end do you not  yes i do  then tell me what was it that spoke out of my lips last night and how came it that i who know no portuguese talked to you in that tongue  he shrugged his shoulders  you have put a difficult question but one i think that can be answered there is no such thing as a spirit an identity that survives death but there is such a thing as the subconscious self which is part of the animating principle of the universe and if only its knowledge can be unsealed knows all that has passed and all that is passing in that universe one day perhaps you will read the works of my compatriot hegel and there you will find it spoken of  you explain nothing  i am about to explain miss clifford last night i gave to your subconscious selfthat which knows allthe strength of liberty so that it saw the past as it happened in this place already you knew the story of the dead girl benita da ferreira and that story you reenacted talking the tongue she used as you would have talked greek or any other tongue had it been hers it was not her spirit that animated you although at the time i called it so for shortness but your own buried knowledge tricked out and furnished by the effort of your human imagination that her name benita should have been yours also is no doubt a strange coincidence but no more also we have no proof that it was so only what you said in your trance  perhaps said benita who was in no mood for philosophical argument perhaps also one day you will see a spirit mr meyer and think otherwise  when i see a spirit and know that it is a spirit then doubtless i shall believe in spirits but what is the good of talking of such things i do not seek spirits i seek portuguese gold now i am sure you can tell where that gold lies you would have told us last night had not your nervous strength failed you who are unaccustomed to the state of trance speaking as benita da ferreira you said that you saw it and described its condition then you could or would say no more and it became necessary to waken you miss clifford you must let me mesmerize you once again for a few minutes only for then we will waste no time on past histories and we shall find the gold unless indeed he added by an afterthought and looking at her sharply you know already where it is in which case i need not trouble you  i do not know mr meyer i remember nothing about the gold  which proves my theory what purported to be the spirit of benita da ferreira said that it had passed the secret on to you but in your waking state you do not know that secret in fact she did not pass it on because she had no existence but in your subconscious state you will know therefore i must mesmerize you again not at once but in a few days time when you have quite recovered let us say next wednesday three days hence  you shall never mesmerize me again mr meyer  no not while i live broke in her father who had been listening to this discussion in silence  jacob bowed his head meekly  you think so now but i think otherwise what i did last night i did against your will and that i can do again only much more easily but i had rather do it with your will who work not for my own sake only but for the sake of all of us and now let us talk no more of the matter lest we should grow angry then he rose and went away  the next three days were passed by benita in a state of constant dread she knew in herself that jacob meyer had acquired a certain command over her that an invincible intimacy had sprung up between them she was acquainted with his thoughts thus before he asked for it she would find herself passing him some article at table or elsewhere or answering a question that he was only about to ask moreover he could bring her to him from a little distance thus on two or three occasions when she was wandering about their prison enclosure as she was wont to do for the sake of exercise she found her feet draw to some spotnow one place and now anotherand when she reached it there before her was jacob meyer  forgive me for bringing you here he would say smiling after his crooked fashion and lifting his hat politely but i wish to ask you if you have not changed your mind as to being mesmerized  then for a while he would hold her with his eyes so that her feet seemed rooted to the ground till at length it was as though he cut a rope by some action of his will and set her free and choked with wrath and blind with tears benita would turn and run from him as from a wild beast  but if her days were evil oh what were her nights she lived in constant terror lest he should again drug her food or drink and while she slept throw his magic spell upon her to protect herself from the first danger she would swallow nothing that had been near him now also she slept in the hut with her father who lay near its door a loaded rifle at his side for he had told jacob outright that if he caught him at his practices he would shoot him a threat at which the younger man laughed aloud for he had no fear of mr clifford  throughout the long hours of darkness they kept watch alternately one of them lying down to rest while the other peered and listened nor did benita always listen in vain for twice at least she heard stealthy footsteps creeping about the hut and felt that soft and dreadful influence flowing in upon her then she would wake her father whispering he is there i can feel that he is there but by the time that the old man had painfully dragged himself to his feetfor now he was becoming very feeble and acute rheumatism or some such illness had got hold of himand crept from the hut there was no one to be seen only through the darkness he would hear the sound of a retreating step and of low mocking laughter  thus those miserable days went by and the third morning came that dreaded wednesday before it was dawn benita and her father neither of whom had closed their eyes that night talked over their strait long and earnestly and they knew that its crisis was approaching  i think that i had better try to kill him benita he said i am growing dreadfully weak and if i put it off i may find no strength and you will be at his mercy i can easily shoot him when his back is turned and though i hate the thought of such a deed surely i shall be forgiven or if not i cannot help it i must think of my duty to you not of myself  no no she answered i will not have it it would be murder although he has threatened you after all father i believe that the man is half mad and not responsible we must take our chance and trust to god to save us if he does not she added at the worst i can always save myself and she touched the pistol which now she wore day and night  so be it said mr clifford with a groan let us pray for deliverance from this hell and keep our hands clean of blood     xx  jacob meyer sees a spirit  for a while they were silent then benita said  father is it not possible that we might escape after all perhaps that stair on the rampart is not so completely blocked that we could not climb over it  mr clifford thinking of his stiff limbs and aching back shook his head and answered  i dont know meyer has never let me near enough to see  well why do you not go to look you know he sleeps till late now because he is up all night take the glasses and examine the top of the wall from inside that old house near by he will not see or hear you but if i came near he would know and wake up  if you like love i can try but what are you going to do while i am away  i shall climb the pillar  you dont mean and he stopped  no no nothing of that sort i shall not follow the example of benita da ferreira unless i am driven to it i want to look that is all one can see far from that place if there is anything to see perhaps the matabele are gone now we have heard nothing of them lately  so they dressed themselves and as soon as the light was sufficiently strong came out of the hut and parted mr clifford rifle in hand limping off towards the wall and benita going towards the great cone she climbed it easily enough and stood in the little cuplike depression on its dizzy peak waiting for the sun to rise and disperse the mists which hung over the river and its banks  now whatever may have been the exact ceremonial use to which the ancients put this pinnacle without doubt it had something to do with sunworship this indeed was proved by the fact that at any rate at this season of the year the first rays of the risen orb struck full upon its point thus it came about that as she stood there waiting benita of a sudden found herself suffused in light so vivid and intense that clothed as she was in a dress which had once been white it must have caused her to shine like a silver image for several minutes indeed this golden spear of fire blinded her so that she could see nothing but stood quite still afraid to move and waiting until as the sun grew higher its level rays passed over her this they did presently and plunging into the valley began to drive away the fog now she looked down along the line of the river  the matabele camp was invisible for it lay in a hollow almost at the foot of the fortress beyond it however was a rising swell of ground it may have been half a mile from where she stood and on the crest of it she perceived what looked like a waggon tent with figures moving round it they were shouting also for through the silence of the african morn the sound of their voices floated up to her  as the mist cleared off benita saw that without doubt it was a waggon for there stood the long row of oxen also it had just been captured by the matabele for these were about it in numbers at the moment however they appeared to be otherwise occupied for they were pointing with their spears to the pillar on bambatse  then it occurred to benita that placed as she was in that fierce light with only the sky for background she must be perfectly visible from the plain below and that it might be her figure perched like an eagle between heaven and earth which excited their interest yes and not theirs only for now a white man appeared who lifted what might have been a gun or a telescope towards her she was sure from the red flannel shirt and the broad hat which he wore that he must be a white man and oh how her heart yearned towards him whoever he might be the sight of an angel from heaven could scarcely have been more welcome to benita in her wretchedness  yet surely she must be dreaming what should a white man and a waggon be doing in that place and why had not the matabele killed him at once she could not tell yet they appeared to have no murderous intentions since they continued to gesticulate and talk whilst he stared upwards with the telescope if it were a telescope so things went on for a long time for meanwhile the oxen were outspanned until indeed more matabele arrived who led off the white man apparently against his will towards their camp where he disappeared then there was nothing more to be seen benita descended the column  at its foot she met her father who had come to seek her  what is the matter he asked noting her excited face  oh she said or rather sobbed there is a waggon with a white man below i saw the matabele capture him  then i am sorry for the poor devil answered the father for he is dead by now but what could a white man have been doing here some hunter i suppose who has walked into a trap  the face of benita fell  i hoped she said that he might help us  as well might he hope that we could help him he is gone and there is an end well peace to his soul and we have our own troubles to think of i have been to look at that wall and it is useless to think of climbing it if he had been a professional mason meyer could not have built it up better no wonder that we have seen nothing more of the molimo for only a bird could reach us  where was mr meyer asked benita  asleep in a blanket under a little shelter of boughs by the stair at least i thought so though it was rather difficult to make him out in the shadow at any rate i saw his rifle set against a tree come let us go to breakfast no doubt he will turn up soon enough  so they went and for the first time since the sunday benita ate a hearty meal of biscuits soaked in coffee although her father was so sure that by now he must have perished on the matabele spears the sight of the white man and his waggon had put new life into her bringing her into touch with the world again after all might it not chance that he had escaped  all this while there had been no sign of jacob meyer this however did not surprise them for now he ate his meals alone taking his food from a little general store and cooking it over his own fire when they had finished their breakfast mr clifford remarked that they had no more drinking water left and benita said that she would go to fetch a pailful from the well in the cave her father suggested that he should accompany her but she answered that it was not necessary as she was quite able to wind the chain by herself so she went carrying the bucket in one hand and a lamp in the other  as she walked down the last of the zigzags leading to the cave benita stopped a moment thinking that she saw a light and then went on since on turning the corner there was nothing but darkness before her evidently she had been mistaken she reached the well and hung the pail on to the great copper hook wondering as she did so how many folk had done likewise in the far far past for the massive metal of that hook was worn quite thin with use then she let the roller run and the sound of the travelling chain clanked dismally in that vaulted empty place at length the pail struck the water and she began to wind up again pausing at times to rest for the distance was long and the chain heavy the bucket appeared benita drew it to the side of the well and lifted it from the hook then took up her lamp to be gone  feeling or seeing something which she was not sure she held the lamp above her head and by its light perceived a figure standing between her and the entrance to the cave  who are you she asked whereon a soft voice answered out of the darkness the voice of jacob meyer  do you mind standing still for a few minutes miss clifford i have some paper here and i wish to make a sketch you do not know how beautiful you look with that light above your head illuminating the shadows and the thorncrowned crucifix beyond you know whatever paths fortune may have led me into by nature i am an artist and never in my life have i seen such a picture one day it will make me famous       how statuelike i see thee stand      the agate lamp within thy hand  thats what i should put under it you know the lines dont you  yes mr meyer but i am afraid you will have to paint your picture from memory as i cannot hold up this lamp any longer my arm is aching already i do not know how you came here but as you have followed me perhaps you will be so kind as to carry this water  i did not follow you miss clifford although you never saw me i entered the cave before you to take measurements  how can you take measurements in the dark  i was not in the dark i put out my light when i caught sight of you knowing that otherwise you would run away and fate stood me in good stead you came on as i willed that you should do now let us talk miss clifford have you changed your mind you know the time is up  i shall never change my mind let me pass you mr meyer  no no not until you have listened you are very cruel to me very cruel indeed you do not understand that rather than do you the slightest harm i would die a hundred times  i do not ask you to die i ask you to leave me alonea much easier matter  but how can i leave you alone when you are a part of me wheni love you there the truth is out and now say what you will  benita lifted the bucket of water its weight seemed to steady her then she put it down again since escape was impracticable she must face the situation  i have nothing to say mr meyer except that i do not love you or any living man and i never shall i thank you for the compliment you have paid me and there is an end  any living man he repeated after her that means you love a dead manseymour he who was drowned no wonder that i hated him when first my eyes fell on him years ago long before you had come into our lives prescience the subconscious self again well what is the use of loving the dead those who no longer have any existence who have gone back into the clay out of which they were formed and are not nor evermore shall be you have but one life turn turn to the living and make it happy  i do not agree with you mr meyer to me the dead are still living one day i shall find them now let me go  i will not let you go i will plead and wrestle with you as in the old fable my namesake of my own race wrestled with the angel until at length you bless me you despise me because i am a jew because i have had many adventures and not succeeded because you think me mad but i tell you that there is the seed of greatness in me give yourself to me and i will make you great for now i know that it was you whom i needed to supply what is lacking in my nature we will win the wealth and together we will rule  until a few days hence we starve or the matabele make an end of us no mr meyer no and she tried to push past him  he stretched out his arms and stopped her  listen he said i have pleaded with you as man with woman now as you refuse me and as you alone stand between me and madness i will take another course i am your master your will is servant to my will i bid you obey me  he fixed his eyes upon hers and benita felt her strength begin to fail  ah he said you are my servant now and to show it i shall kiss you on the lips then i shall throw the sleep upon you and you will tell me what i want to know afterwards we can be wed when it pleases me oh do not think that your father will defend you for if he interferes i shall kill that foolish old man whom until now i have only spared for your sake remember that if you make me angry i shall certainly kill him and your fathers blood will be on your head now i am going to kiss you  benita lifted her hand to find the pistol at her waist it fell back again she had no strength it was as though she were paralysed as a bird is paralysed by a snake so that it cannot open its wings and fly away but sits there awaiting death she was given over into the hands of this man whom she hated could heaven allow such a thing she wondered dimly and all the while his lips drew nearer to her face  they touched her own and then why or wherefore benita never understood the spell broke all his power was gone she was as she had been a free woman mistress of herself contemptuously she thrust the man aside and not even troubling to run lifted her pail of water and walked away  soon she saw the light again and joyfully extinguished her lamp indeed the breast of benita which should have been so troubled after the scene through which she had passed strangely enough was filled with happiness and peace as that glorious sunlight had broken on her eyes so had another light of freedom arisen in her soul she was no longer afraid of jacob meyer that coward kiss of his had struck off the shackles which bound her to him her mind had been subject to his mind but now that his physical nature was brought into the play his mental part had lost its hold upon her  as she approached the hut she saw her father seated on a stone outside it since the poor old man was now so weak and full of pain that he could not stand for very long and seeing remembered meyers threats against him at the thought all her newfound happiness departed  she might be safe she felt sure that she was safe but how about her father if meyer could not get his way probably he would be as good as his word and kill him she shivered at the thought then recovering herself walked forward steadily with her bucket of water  you have been a long while gone my love said mr clifford  yes father mr meyer was in the cave and kept me  how did he get there and what did he want  i dont know how he got therecrept in when we were not looking i suppose but as for what he wantedlisten dear and word for word she told him what had passed  before she had finished her father was almost choking with wrath  the dirty jew the villain he gasped i never dreamed that he would dare to attempt such an outrage well thank heaven i can still hold a rifle and when he comes out  father she said gently that man is mad he is not responsible for his actions and therefore except in selfdefence you must not think of such a thing as for what he said about you i believe it was only an empty threat and for me you need have no fear his power over me is gone it went like a flash when his lips touched me and she rubbed her own as though to wipe away some stain i am afraid of nothing more i believeyes i believe the old molimo was right and that all will end well  as she was speaking benita heard a shuffling sound behind her and turned to learn its cause then she saw a strange sight jacob meyer was staggering towards them dragging one foot after the other through the grass and stones his face was ghastly pale his jaw had dropped like that of a dead man and his eyes were set wide open and full of horror  what is the matter with you man asked mr clifford  iihave seen a ghost he whispered you did not come back into the cave did you he added pointing at benita who shook her head  what ghost asked mr clifford  i dont know but my lamp went out and then a light began to shine behind me i turned and on the steps of that crucifix i saw a woman kneeling her arms clasped the feet of the figure her forehead rested upon the feet her long black hair flowed down she was dressed in white and the light came from her body and her head very slowly she turned and looked at me and oh heaven that face and he put his hand before his eyes and groaned it was beautiful yes yes but fearful to see like an avenging angel i fled and the lightonly the lightcame with me down the cave even at the mouth of it there was a little i have seen a spirit i who did not believe in spirits i have seen a spirit and i tell you that not for all the gold in the world will i enter that place again  then before they could answer suddenly as though his fear had got some fresh hold of him jacob sprang forward and fled away crashing through the bushes and leaping from rock to rock like a frightened buck     xxi  the message from the dead  meyer always said that he did not believe in spirits remarked mr clifford reflectively  well he believes in them now answered benita with a little laugh but father the poor man is mad that is the fact of it and we must pay no attention to what he says  the old molimo and some of his peopletamas for instancedeclared that they have seen the ghost of benita da ferreira are they mad also benita  i dont know father who can say all these things are a mystery all i do know is that i have never seen a ghost and i doubt if i ever shall  no but when you were in that trance something that was not you spoke out of your mouth which something said that it was your namesake the other benita well as you say we cant fathom these things especially in a haunted kind of place like this but the upshot of it is that i dont think we have much more to fear from jacob  i am not so sure father mad people change their moods very suddenly  as it happened benita was quite right towards suppertime jacob meyer reappeared looking pale and shaken but otherwise much as usual  i had a kind of fit this morning he explained the result of an hallucination which seized me when my light went out in that cave i remember that i thought i had seen a ghost whereas i know very well that no such thing exists i was the victim of disappointment anxieties and other still stronger emotions and he looked at benita therefore please forget anything i said or did andwould you give me some supper  benita did so and he ate in silence with some heartiness when he had finished his food and swallowed two or three tots of squareface he spoke again  i have come here where i know i am not welcome upon business he said in a calm matteroffact voice i am tired of this place and i think it is time that we attained the object of our journey here namely to find the hidden gold that as we all know can only be done in a certain way through the clairvoyant powers of one of us and the hypnotic powers of another miss clifford i request that you will allow me to throw you into a state of trance you have told us everything else but you have not yet told us where the treasure is hidden and this it is necessary that we should know  and if i refuse mr meyer  then i am sorry but i must take means to compel your obedience under those circumstances much against my will i shall be obligedhere his eye blazed out wildlyto execute your father whose obstinacy and influence stand between us and splendid fortunes no clifford he added dont stretch out your hand towards that rifle for i am already covering you with the pistol in my pocket and the moment your hand touches it i shall fire you poor old man do you imagine for a single second that sick as you are and with your stiff limbs you can hope to match yourself against my agility intellect and strength why i could kill you in a dozen ways before you could lift a finger against me and by the god i do not believe in unless your daughter is more compliant kill you i will  that remains to be seen my friend said mr clifford with a laugh for he was a brave old man i am not certain that the godwhom you do not believe inwill not kill you first  now benita who had been taking counsel with herself looked up and said suddenly  very well mr meyer i consentbecause i must tomorrow morning you shall try to mesmerize me if you can in the same place before the crucifix in the cave  no he answered quickly it was not there it was here and here it shall be again the spot you mention is unpropitious to me the attempt would fail  it is the spot that i have chosen answered benita stubbornly  and this is the spot that i have chosen miss clifford and my will must prevail over yours  because you who do not believe in spirits are afraid to reenter the cave mr meyer lest you should chance  never mind what i am or am not afraid of he replied with fury make your choice between doing my will and your fathers life tomorrow morning i shall come for your answer and if you are still obstinate within half an hour he will be dead leaving you and me alone together oh you may call me wicked and a villain but it is you who are wicked you you you who force me to this deed of justice  then without another word he sprang up and walked away from them backwards as he went covering mr clifford with the pistol which he had drawn from his pocket the last that they saw of him were his eyes which glowered at them through the darkness like those of a lion  father said benita when she was sure that he had gone that madman really means to murder you there is no doubt of it  none whatever dear if i am alive tomorrow night i shall be lucky unless i can kill him first or get out of his way  well she said hurriedly i think you can i have an idea he is afraid to go into that cave i am sure let us hide ourselves there we can take food and shall have plenty of water whereas unless rain falls he can get nothing to drink  but what then benita we cant stop in the dark for ever  no but we can wait there until something happens something must and will happen his disease wont stand still he may go raving mad and kill himself or he may attempt to attack us though that is not likely and then we must do what we can in self defence or help may reach us from somewhere at the worst we shall only die as we should have died outside come let us be quick lest he should change his mind and creep back upon us  so mr clifford gave way knowing that even if he could steel himself to do the deed of attempting to kill jacob he would have little chance against that strong and agile man such a struggle would only end in his own death and benita must then be left alone with meyer and his insane passions  hurriedly they carried their few belongings into the cave first they took most of the little store of food that remained the three handlamps and all the paraffin there was but one tin then returning they fetched the bucket the ammunition and their clothes afterwards as there was still no sign of meyer they even dared to drag in the waggon tent to make a shelter for benita and all the wood that they had collected for firing this proved a wearisome business for the logs were heavy and in his crippled state mr clifford could carry no great burden indeed towards the end benita was forced to complete the task alone while he limped beside her with his rifle lest jacob should surprise them  when at length everything was done it was long past midnight and so exhausted were they that notwithstanding their danger they flung themselves down upon the canvas tent which lay in a heap at the end of the cave near the crucifix and fell asleep  when benita woke the lamp had gone out and it was pitch dark fortunately however she remembered where she had put the matches and the lantern with a candle in it she lit the candle and looked at her watch it was nearly six oclock the dawn must be breaking outside within an hour or two jacob meyer would find that they had gone suppose that his rage should overcome his fear and that he should creep upon them they would know nothing of it until his face appeared in the faint ring of light or he might even shoot her father out of the darkness what could she do that would give them warning a thought came to her  taking one of the tent ropes and the lantern for her father still slept heavily she went down to the entrance of the cave and at the end of the last zigzag where once a door had been managed to make it fast to a stone hinge about eighteen inches above the floor and on the other side to an eye opposite that was cut in the solid rock to receive a bolt of wood or iron meyer she knew had no lamps or oil only matches and perhaps a few candles therefore if he tried to enter the cave it was probable that he would trip over the rope and thus give them warning then she went back washed her face and hands with some water that they had drawn on the previous night to satisfy their thirst and tidied herself as best she could this done as her father still slept she filled the lamps lit one of them and looked about her for she was loth to wake him  truly it was an awful place in which to dwell there above them towered the great white crucifix there in the corner were piled the remains of the portuguese a skull with long hair still hanging to it grinned at her a withered hand was thrust forward as though to clutch her oh no wonder that in such a spot jacob meyer had seen ghosts in front too was the yawning grave where they had found the monk indeed his bones wrapped in dark robes still lay within for jacob had tumbled them back again then beyond and all around deep dark and utter silence  at last her father woke and glad enough was she of his human company they breakfasted upon some biscuits and water and afterwards while mr clifford watched near the entrance with his rifle benita set to work to arrange their belongings the tent she managed to prop up against the wall of the cave by help of some of the wood which they had carried in beneath it she spread their blankets that it might serve as a sleeping place for them both and outside placed the food and other things  while she was thus engaged she heard a sound at the mouth of the cavejacob meyer was entering and had fallen over her rope down it she ran lantern in hand to her father who with his rifle raised was shouting  if you come in here i put a bullet through you  then came the answer in jacobs voice which rang hollow in that vaulted place  i do not want to come in i shall wait for you to come out you cannot live long in there the horror of the dark will kill you i have only to sit in the sunlight and wait  then he laughed and they heard the sound of his footsteps retreating down the passage  what are we to do asked mr clifford despairingly we cannot live without light and if we have light he will certainly creep to the entrance and shoot us he is quite mad now i am sure of it from his voice  benita thought a minute then she answered  we must build up the passage look and she pointed to the lumps of rock that the explosion of their mine had shaken down from the roof and the slabs of cement that they had broken from the floor with the crowbar at once at once she went on he will not come back for some hours probably not till night  so they set to work and never did benita labour as it was her lot to do that day such of the fragments as they could lift they carried between them others they rolled along by help of the crowbar for hour after hour they toiled at their task luckily for them the passage was not more than three feet wide by six feet six high and their material was ample before the evening they had blocked it completely with a wall several feet in thickness which wall they supported on the inside with lengths of the firewood lashed across to the old hinges and boltholes or set obliquely against its face  it was done and they regarded their work with pride although it seemed probable that they were building up their own tomb because of its position at an angle of the passage they knew that meyer could not get to it with a pole to batter it down also there was no loose powder left so his only chance would be to pull it to pieces with his hands and this they thought might be beyond his power at least should he attempt it they would have ample warning yet that day was not to pass without another trouble  just as they had rolled up and levered into place a long fragment of rock designed to prevent the ends of their supporting pieces of wood from slipping on the cement floor mr clifford uttered an exclamation then said  i have wrung my back badly help me to the tent i must lie down  slowly and with great pain they staggered up the cave mr clifford leaning on benita and a stick till reaching the tent at last he almost fell on to the blankets and remained there practically crippled  now began benitas terrible time the worst of all her life every hour her father became more ill even before they took refuge in the cave he was completely broken down and now after this accident he began to suffer very much his rheumatism or sciatica or whatever it was seemed to settle upon the hurt muscles of his back causing him so much pain that he could scarcely sleep for ten minutes at a stretch moreover he would swallow but little of the rough food which was all benita was able to prepare for him nothing indeed except biscuit soaked in black coffee which she boiled over a small fire made of wood that they had brought with them and occasionally a little broth tasteless stuff enough for it was only the essence of biltong or sundried flesh flavoured with some salt  then there were two other terrors against she must fight the darkness and the dread of jacob meyer perhaps the darkness was the worse of them to live in that hideous gloom in which their single lamp for she dared burn no more lest the oil should give out seemed but as one star to the whole night ah who that had not endured it could know what it meant there the sick man yonder the grinning skeletons around the blackness and the silence and beyond these again a miserable death or jacob meyer but of him benita saw nothing though once or twice she thought that she heard his voice raving outside the wall which they had built if so either he did not try to pull it down or he failed in the attempt or perhaps he feared that should he succeed he would be greeted by a bullet so at last she gave up thinking about him should he force his way into the cave she must deal with the situation as best she could meanwhile her fathers strength was sinking fast  three awful days went by in this fashion and the end drew near although she tried to force herself to it benita could not swallow enough food to keep up her strength now that the passage was closed the atmosphere of this old vault for it was nothing more thickened by the smoke of the fire which she was obliged to burn grew poisonous and choked her want of sleep exhausted her dread of what the morrow might bring forth crushed her strong spirit she began to break down knowing that the hour was near when she and her father must die together  once as she slept awhile at his side being wakened by his groaning benita looked at her watch it was midnight she rose and going to the embers of the little fire warmed up some of her biltong broth which she poured into a tin pannikin with difficulty she forced him to swallow a few mouthfuls of it then feeling a sudden weakness drank the rest herself it gave her power to think and her father dozed off into an uneasy sleep  alas thinking was of no use nothing could be done there was no hope save in prayer restlessness seized benita and taking the lantern she wandered round the cave the wall that they had built remained intact and oh to think that beyond it flowed the free air and shone the blessed stars back she came again skirting the pits that jacob meyer had dug and the grave of the old monk till she reached the steps of the crucifix and holding up her candle looked at the thorncrowned brow of the christ above  it was wonderfully carved that dying face was full of pity would not he whom it represented pity her she knelt down on the topmost step and clasping the pierced feet with her arms began to pray earnestly not for herself but that she might save her father she prayed as she had never prayed before and so praying sank into a torpor or a swoon  it seemed to benita that this sleep of hers suddenly became alive in it she saw many things for instance she saw herself seated in a state of trance upon that very step where now she knelt while before her stood her father and jacob meyer moreover something spoke in her she could not hear a voice but she seemed to see the words written in the air before her these were the words  clasp the feet of the christ and draw them to the left the passage beneath leads to the chamber where the gold is hid and thence to the river bank that is the secret which ere i depart i the dead benita pass on to you the living benita as i am commanded in life and death peace be to your soul  thrice did this message appear to repeat itself in the consciousness of benita then suddenly as she had slept she woke again with every letter of it imprinted on her mind doubtless it was a dream nothing but a dream bred by the fact that her arms were clasping the feet of the crucifix what did it say draw them to the left  she did so but nothing stirred again she tried and still nothing stirred of course it was a dream why had such been sent to mock her in a kind of mad irritation she put out all her remaining strength and wrestled with those stony feet they moved a littlethen of a sudden without any further effort on her part swung round as high as the knees where drapery hung concealing the join in them yes they swung round revealing the head of a stair up which blew a cold wind that it was sweet to breathe  benita rose gasping then she seized her lantern and ran to the little tent where her father lay     xxii  the voice of the living  mr clifford was awake again now  where have you been he asked querulously in a thin voice i wanted you then as the light from the candle shone upon it he noted the change that had come over her pale face and added what has happened is meyer dead are we free  benita shook her head he was alive a few hours ago for i could hear him raving and shouting outside the wall we built but father it has all come back to me i believe that i have found it  what has come back what have you found are you mad too like jacob  what something told me when i was in the trance which afterwards i forgot but now remember and i have found the passage which leads to where they hid the gold it begins behind the crucifix where no one ever thought of looking  this matter of the gold did not seem to interest mr clifford in his state all the wealth beneath the soil of africa would not have appealed to him moreover he hated the name of that accursed treasure which was bringing them to such a miserable end  where does the passage run have you looked he asked  not yet but the voice in me saidi mean i dreamedthat it goes down to the riverside if you leant on me do you think that you could walk  not one inch he answered here where i am i shall die  no no dont talk like that we may be saved now that i have found a way oh if only you couldif only you could walk or if i had the strength to carry you and she wrung her hands and began to weep so weak was she  her father looked at her searchingly then he said  well love i cannot so theres an end but you can and you had better go  what and leave you never  yes and leave me look there is but a little oil left and only a few candles the biscuits are done and neither of us can swallow that biltong any more i suppose that i am dying and your health and strength are failing you quickly in this darkness if you stop here you must soon follow me and what is the alternative the madman outsidethat is if you could find strength to pull down the wall which i doubt you had best go benita  but still she said she would not  do you not see he added that it is my only chance of life if you go you may be able to bring me help before the end comes should there be a passage the probability is that although they know nothing of it it finishes somewhere by the wall of the first enclosure where the makalanga are if so you may find the molimo or if he is dead tamas or one of the others and they will help us go benita go at once  i never thought of that she answered in a changed voice of course it may be so if the passage goes down at all well at least i can look and come back to tell you  then benita placed the remainder of the oil close by her fathers side so that he could refill the lamp for the use of his hands still remained to him also she set there such crumbs of biscuit as were left some of the biltong a flask of hollands and a pail of water this done she put on her long cloak filled one of its pockets with biltong and the other with matches and three of the four remaining candles the fourth she insisted on leaving beside her fathers bed when everything was ready she knelt down at his side kissed him and from her heart put up a prayer that they might both live to meet again although she knew well that this they could scarcely hope to do  had two people ever been in a more dreadful situation she wondered as she looked at her father lying there whom she must leave to fight with death alone in that awful place while she went forth to meet him in the unknown bowels of the earth  mr clifford read her thoughts yes he said it is a strange parting and a wild errand but who knows it may please providence to take you through and if notwhy our troubles will soon be over  then once more they kissed and not daring to try to speak benita tore herself away passing into the passage whereof the lower half of the crucifix formed the door she paused for a moment to examine it and to place a fragment of rock in such fashion that it could not shut again behind her her idea was that it worked by aid of some spring but now she saw that this was not so as the whole mass hung upon three stone hinges beautifully concealed the dust and corrosion of ages which had made this door so hard to open by filling up the tiny spaces between it and its framework had also rendered these cracks utterly imperceptible to the eye so accurately was it fashioned indeed that no one who did not know its secret would have discovered it if they searched for months or years  though at the time benita took little note of such details the passage beyond and the stair descending from it showed the same perfect workmanship evidently this secret way dated not from the portuguese period but from that of the phoenicians or other ancients to whose treasurechamber it was the approach opening as it did from their holy of holies to which none were admitted save the head priests the passage which was about seven feet high by four wide had been hewn out of the live rock of the mountain for thousands of little marks left by the workmens chisels were still discernible upon its walls so it was with the stair that had been but little used and remained fresh as the day when it was finished  down the steps candle in hand flitted benita counting them as she went the thirtieth brought her to a landing here it was that she saw the first traces of that treasure which they had suffered so much to find something glittered at her feet she picked it up it was a little bar of gold weighing two or three ounces that doubtless had been dropped there throwing it down again she looked in front of her and to her dismay saw a door of wood with iron bolts but the bolts had never been shot and when she pulled at it the door creaked upon its rusty hinges and opened she was on the threshold of the treasurechamber  it was square and of the size of a small room packed on either side almost to the low vaulted roof with small bags of raw hide carelessly arranged quite near to the door one of these bags had slipped down and burst open it was filled with gold some in ingots and some in raw nuggets for there they lay in a shining scattered heap as she stooped to look it came into the mind of benita that her father had said that in her trance she had told them that one of the bags of treasure was burst and that the skin of which it had been made was black and red behold before her lay the burst bag and the colour of the hide was black and red  she shivered the thing was uncanny terrible uncanny was it also to see in the thick dust which in the course of twenty or more of centuries had gathered on the floor the mark of footprints those of the last persons who had visited this place there had been two of them a man and a woman and they were no savages for they wore shoes benita placed her foot in the print left by that dead woman it filled it exactly it might have been her own perhaps she thought to herself that other benita had descended here with her father after the portuguese had hidden away their wealth that she might be shown where it was and of what it consisted  one more glance at all this priceless miseryworking gold and on she went she who was seeking the gold of life and liberty for herself and him who lay above supposing that the stairway ended there she stopped she looked round but could see no other door to see the better she halted and opened the glass of her lantern still she could perceive nothing and her heart sank yet why did the candle flicker so fiercely and why was the air in this deep place so fresh she walked forward a pace or two then noticed suddenly that those footprints of the dead that she was following disappeared immediately in front of her and she stopped  it was but just in time one step more and she would have fallen down the mouth of a deep pit once it had been covered with a stone but this stone was removed and had never been replaced look there it stood against the wall of the chamber well was this for benita since her frail strength would not have sufficed to stir that massive block even if she had discovered its existence beneath the dust  now she saw that down the pit ran another ladderlike stair of stone very narrow and precipitous without hesitation she began its descent down she went and downone hundred steps two hundred steps two hundred and seventyfive steps and all the way wherever the dust had gathered the mans and the womans footprints ran before her there was a double line of them one line going down and the other line returning those that returned were the last for often they appeared over those that descended why had these dead people returned benita wondered  the stair had ended now she was in a kind of natural cave for its sides and roof were rugged moreover water trickled and dripped from them it was not very large and it smelt horribly of mud and other things again she searched by the feeble light of her candle but could see no exit suddenly she saw something else however for stepping on what she took to be a rock to her horror it moved beneath her she heard a snap as of jaws a violent blow upon the leg nearly knocked her off her feet and as she staggered backwards she saw a huge and loathsome shape rushing away into the darkness the rock that she had trodden on was a crocodile which had its den here with a little scream she retreated to her stair death she had expectedbut to be eaten by crocodiles  yet as benita stood there panting a blessed hope rose in her breast if a crocodile came in there it must also get out and where such a great creature could go a woman would be able to follow also she must be near the water since otherwise it could never have chosen this hole for its habitation she collected her courage and having clapped her hands and waved the lantern about to scare any alligators that might still be lurking there hearing and seeing nothing more she descended to where she had trodden upon the reptile evidently this was its bed for its long body had left an impress upon the mud and all about lay the remains of creatures that it had brought in for food moreover a path ran outwards its wellworn trail distinct even in that light  she followed this path which ended apparently in a blank wall then it was that benita guessed why those dead folks footprints had returned for here had been a doorway which in some past age those who used it built up with blocks of stone and cement how then did the crocodile get out stooping down she searched and perceived a few yards to the right of the door a hole that looked as though it were waterworn now benita thought that she understood the rock was softer here and centuries of flood had eaten it away leaving a crack in the stratum which the crocodiles had found out and enlarged down she went on her hands and knees and thrusting the lantern in front of her crept along that noisome drain for this was what it resembled and nowoh now she felt air blowing in her face and heard the sound of reeds whispering and water running and saw hanging like a lamp in the blue sky a starthe morning star benita could have wept she could have worshipped it yet she pushed on between rocks till she found herself among tall reeds and standing in water she had gained the banks of the zambesi  instantly by instinct as it were benita extinguished her candle fearing lest it should betray her for constant danger had made her very cunning the dawn had not yet broken but the waning moon and the stars gave a good light she paused to look there above her towered the outermost wall of bambatse against which the river washed except at such times as the present when it was very low  so she was not in the fortress as she had hoped but without it and oh what should she do go back again how would that serve her father or herself go on then she might fall into the hands of the matabele whose camp was a little lower down as from her perch upon the top of the cone she had seen that poor white man do ah the white man if only he lived and she could reach him perhaps they had not killed him after all it was madness yet she would try to discover something impelled her to take the risk if she failed and escaped perhaps then she might call to the makalanga and they would let down a rope and draw her up the wall before the matabele caught her she would not go back emptyhanded to die in that dreadful place with her poor father better perish here in the sweet air and beneath the stars even if it were upon a matabele spear or by a bullet from her own pistol  she looked about her to take her bearings in case it should ever be necessary for her to return to the entrance of the cave this proved easy for a hundred or so feet above herwhere the sheer face of the cliff jutted out a little at that very spot indeed on which tradition said that the body of the señora da ferreira had struck in its fall and the necklace benita wore today was torn from hera stunted mimosa grew in some cleft of the rock to mark the crocodile run itself she bent down a bunch of reeds and having first lit a few tandstickor brimstone matches and thrown them about inside of it that the smell of them might scare the beast should it wish to return she set her lantern behind a stone near to the mouth of the hole  then benita began her journey which when the river was high it would not have been possible for her to make except by swimming as it was a margin of marsh was left between her and the steep rocky side of the mount from which the great wall rose and through this she made her way never was she likely to forget that walk the tall reeds dripped their dew upon her until she was soaked long blacktailed finchessaccaboolas the natives call themflew up undisturbed and lobbed away across the river owls flitted past and bitterns boomed at the coming of the dawn great fish splashed also in the shallows or were they crocodiles benita hoped notfor one day she had seen enough of crocodiles  it was all very strange could she be the same woman she wondered who not a year before had been walking with her cousins down westbourne grove and studying whiteleys windows what would these cousins say now if they could see her whitefaced largeeyed desperate splashing through the mud upon the unknown banks of the zambesi flying from death to death  on she struggled above her the pearly sky in which the stars were fading around her the wet reeds and pervading all the heavy lowlying mists of dawn she was past the round of the walls and at length stood upon dry ground where the matabele had made their camp but in that fog she saw no matabele probably their fires were out and she chanced to pass between the sentries instinctively more than by reason she headed for that hillock upon which she had seen the white mans waggon in the vague hope that it might still be there on she struggled still on till at length she blundered against something soft and warm and perceived that it was an ox tied to a trektow beyond which were other oxen and a white waggoncap  so it was still there but the white man where was he through the dense mist benita crept to the disselboom then seeing and hearing nothing she climbed to the voorkissie and kneeling on it separated the tent flaps and peered into the waggon still she could see nothing because of the mist yet she heard something a man breathing in his sleep somehow she thought that it was a white man a kaffir did not breathe like that she did not know what to do so remained kneeling there it seemed as though the man who was asleep began to feel her presence for he muttered to himselfsurely the words were english then quite suddenly he struck a match and lit a candle which stood in a beer bottle by his side she could not see his face while he lit the match for his arm hid it and the candle burned up slowly then the first thing she saw was the barrel of a revolver pointing straight at her  now my black friend said a pleasant voice down you go or i shoot one two oh my god  the candle burned up its light fell upon the white elfish face of benita whose long dark hair streamed about her it shone in her great eyes still she could see nothing for it dazzled her  oh my god said the voice again benita benita have you come to tell me that i must join you well i am ready my sweet my sweet now i shall hear your answer  yes she whispered and crawling forward down the cartel benita fell upon his breast  for she knew him at lastdead or living she cared notshe knew him and out of hell crept to him her heaven and her home     xxiii  benita gives her answer  your answer benita robert said dreamily for to him this thing seemed a dream  have i not given it months ago oh i remember it was only in my heart not on my lips when that blow fell on me then afterwards i heard what you had done and i nearly died i wished that i might die to be with you but i could not i was too strong now i understand the reason well it seems that we are both living and whatever happens here is my answer if it is worth anything to you once and for all i love you i am not ashamed to say it because very soon we may be separated for the last time but i cannot talk now i have come here to save my father  where is he benita  dying in a cave up at the top of that fortress i got down by a secret way are the matabele still here  very much so he answered but something has happened my guard woke me an hour ago to say that a messenger had arrived from their king lobengula and now they are talking over the message that is how you came to get through otherwise the sentries would have assegaied you the brutes and he drew her to him and kissed her passionately for the first time then as though ashamed of himself let her go  have you anything to eat she asked iiam starving i didnt feel it before but now  starving you starving while ilook here is some cold meat which i could not get down last night and put by for the kaffirs great heavens that i should feed you with kaffirs leavings but it is goodeat it  benita took the stuff in her fingers and swallowed it greedily she who for days had lived on nothing but a little biscuit and biltong it tasted delicious to hernever had she eaten anything so good and all the while he watched her with glowing eyes  how can you look at me she said at length i must be horrible i have been living in the dark and crawling through mud i trod upon a crocodile and she shuddered  whatever you are i never want to see you different he answered slowly to me you are most beautiful  even then wreck as she was the poor girl flushed and there was a mist in her eyes as she looked up and said  thank you i dont care now what happens to me and what has happened doesnt matter at all but can we get away  i dont know he answered but i doubt it go and sit on the waggonbox for a few minutes while i dress and we will see  benita went the mist was thinning now and through it she saw a sight at which her heart sank for between her and the mount bambatse matabele were pouring towards their camp on the rivers edge they were cut off a couple of minutes later robert joined her and as he came she looked at him anxiously in the growing light he seemed older than when they had parted on the zanzibar changed too for now his face was serious and he had grown a beard also he appeared to limp  i am afraid there is an end she said pointing to the matabele below  yes it looks like it but like you i say what does it matter now and he took her hand in his adding let us be happy while we can if only for a few minutes they will be here presently  what are you she asked a prisoner  thats it i was following you when they captured me for i have been here before and knew the way they were going to kill me on general principles only it occurred to one of them who was more intelligent than the rest that i being a white man might be able to show them how to storm the place now i was sure that you were there for i saw you standing on that point though they thought you were the spirit of bambatse so i wasnt anxious to help them for thenyou know what happens when the matabele are the stormers butas you still livedi wasnt anxious to die either so i set them to work to dig a hole with their assegais and sharp axes through granite they have completed exactly twenty feet of it and i reckon that there are one hundred and forty to go last night they got tired of that tunnel and talked of killing me again unless i could show them a better plan now all the fat is in the fire and i dont know what is to happen hullo here they come hide in the waggon quick  benita obeyed and from under cover of the tent where the matabele could not see her watched and listened the party that approached consisted of a chief and about twenty men who marched behind him as a guard benita knew that chief he was the captain maduna he of the royal blood whose life she had saved by his side was a natal zulu robert seymours driver who could speak english and acted as interpreter  white man said maduna a message has reached us from our king lobengula makes a great war and has need of us he summons us back from this petty fray this fight against cowards who hide behind walls whom otherwise we would have killed everyone yes if we sat here till we grew old so for this time we leave them alone  robert answered politely that he was glad to hear it and wished them a good journey  wish yourself a good journey white man was the stern reply  why do you desire that i should accompany you to lobengula  no you go before us to the kraal of the black one who is even greater than the child of moselikatse to that king who is called death  robert crossed his arms and said say on  white man i promised you life if you would show us how to pierce or climb those walls but you have made fools of usyou have set us to cut through rock with spears and axes yes to hoe at rock as though it were soilyou who with the wisdom of your people could have taught us some better way therefore we must go back to our king disgraced having failed in his service and therefore you who have mocked us shall die come down now that we may kill you quietly and learn whether or no you are a brave man  then it was while her lovers hand was moving towards the pistol hidden beneath his coat that benita with a quick movement emerged from the waggon in which she crouched and stood up at his side upon the driving box  ow said the captain it is the white maiden now how came she here surely this is great magic can a woman fly like a bird and they stared at her amazed  what does it matter how i came chief maduna she answered in zulu yet i will tell you why i came it was to save you from dipping your spear in the innocent blood and bringing on your head the curse of the innocent blood answer me now who gave you and your brother yonder your lives within that wall when the makalanga would have torn you limb from limb as hyenas tear a buck was it i or another  inkosikaaschieftainess replied the great captain raising his broad spear in salute it was you and no other  and what did you promise me then prince maduna  maiden of high birth i promised you your life and your goods should you ever fall into my power  does a leader of the amandabele one of the royal blood lie like a mashona or a makalanga slave does he do worsetell half the truth only like a cheat who buys and keeps back half the price she asked contemptuously maduna you promised me not one life but two two lives and the goods that belong to both ask of your brother there who was witness of the words  great heavens muttered robert seymour to himself as he looked at benita standing with outstretched hand and flashing eyes who would have thought that a starved woman could play such a part with death on the hazard  it is as this daughter of white chiefs says answered the man to whom she had appealed when she freed us from the fangs of those dogs you promised her two lives my brother one for yours and one for mine  hear him went on benita he promised me two lives and how did this prince of the royal blood keep his promise when i and the old man my father rode hence in peace he loosed his spears upon us he hunted us yet it was the hunters who fell into the trap not the hunted  maiden replied maduna in a shamed voice that was your fault not mine if you had appealed to me i would have let you go but you killed my sentry and then the chase began and ere i knew who you were my runners were out of call  little time had i to ask your mercy but so be it said benita i accept your word and i forgive you that offence now fulfil your oath begone and leave us in peace  still maduna hesitated  i must make report to the king he said what is this white man to you that i should spare him i give you your life and your fathers life not that of this white man who has tricked us if he were your father or your brother it would be otherwise but he is a stranger and belongs to me not to you  maduna she asked do women such as i am share the waggon of a stranger this man is more to me than father or brother he is my husband and i claim his life  ow said the spokesman of the audience we understand now she is his wife and has a right to him if she were not his wife she would not be in his waggon it is plain that she speaks the truth though how she came here we do not know unless as we think she is a witch and he smiled at his own cleverness  inkosikaas said maduna you have persuaded me i give you the life of that white fox your husband and i hope that he will not trick you as he has tricked us and set you to hoe rock instead of soil and he looked at robert wrathfully i give him to you and all his belongings now is there anything else that you would ask  yes replied benita coolly you have many oxen there which you took from the other makalanga mine are eaten and i need cattle to draw my waggon i ask a present of twenty of them and she added by an afterthought two cows with young calves for my father is sick yonder and must have milk  oh give them to her give them to her said maduna with a tragic gesture that in any other circumstances would have made benita laugh give them to her and see that they are good ones before she asks our shields and spears alsofor after all she saved my life  so men departed to fetch those cows and oxen which presently were driven in  while this talk was in progress the great impi of the matabele was massing for the march on the flat ground a little to the right of them now they began to come past in companies preceded by the lads who carried the mats and cookingpots and drove the captured sheep and cattle by this time the story of benita the witchwoman whom they could not kill and who had mysteriously flown from the top of the peak into their prisoners waggon had spread among them they knew also that it was she who had saved their general from the makalanga and those who had heard her admired the wit and courage with which she had pleaded and won her cause therefore as they marched past in their companies singing a song of abuse and defiance of the makalanga who peered at them from the top of the wall they lifted their great spears in salutation to benita standing upon the waggonbox  indeed they were a wondrous and imposing spectacle such a one as few white women have ever seen  at length all were gone except maduna and a bodyguard of two hundred men he walked to the front of the waggon and addressed robert seymour  listen you fox who set us to hoe granite he said indignantly you have outwitted us this time but if ever i meet you again then you die now i have given you your life but he added almost pleadingly if you are really brave as white men are said to be will you not come down and fight me man to man for honours sake  i think not answered robert when he understood this challenge for what chance should i have against so brave a warrior also this ladymy wifeneeds my help on her journey home  maduna turned from him contemptuously to benita  i go he said and fear not you will meet no matabele on that journey have you more words for me o beautiful one with a tongue of oil and a wit that cuts like steel  yes answered benita you have dealt well with me and in reward i give you of my good luck bear this message to your king from the white witch of bambatse for i am she and no other that he leave these makalanga my servants to dwell unharmed in their ancient home and that he lift no spear against the white men lest that evil which the molimo foretold to you should fall upon him  ah said maduna now i understand how you flew from the mountain top into this mans waggon you are not a white woman you are the ancient witch of bambatse herself you have said it and with such it is not well to war great lady of magic spirit from of old i salute you and i thank you for your gifts of life and fortune farewell  then he too stalked away at the head of his guard so that presently save for the three zulu servants and the herd of cattle robert and benita were left utterly alone  now her part played and the victory won benita burst into tears and fell upon her lovers breast  presently she remembered and freed herself from his arms  i am a selfish wretch she said how dare i be so happy when my father is dead or dying we must go at once  go where asked the bewildered robert  to the top of the mountain of course whence i came oh please dont stop to question me ill tell you as we walk stay and she called to the zulu driver who with an air of utter amazement was engaged in milking one of the gift cows to fill two bottles with the milk  had we not better shout to the makalanga to let us in suggested robert while this was being done and benita wrapped some cooked meat in a cloth  no no they will think i am what i said i wasthe witch of bambatse whose appearance heralds misfortune and fear a trap besides we could not climb the top wall you must follow my road and if you can trust them bring two of those men with you with lanterns the lad can stop to herd the cattle  three minutes later followed by the two zulus they were walkingor rather runningalong the banks of the zambesi  why do you not come quicker she asked impatiently oh i beg your pardon you are lame robert what made you lame and oh why are you not dead as they all swore you were you youhero for i know that part of the story  for a very simple reason benita because i didnt die when that kaffir took the watch from me i was insensible thats all the sun brought me to life afterwards then some natives turned up good people in their way although i could not understand a word they said they made a stretcher of boughs and carried me for some miles to their kraal inland it hurt awfully for my thigh was broken but i arrived at last there a kaffir doctor set my leg in his own fashion it has left it an inch shorter than the other but thats better than nothing  in that place i lay for two solid months for there was no white man within a hundred miles and if there had been i could not have communicated with him afterwards i spent another month limping up towards natal until i could buy a horse the rest is very short hearing of my reported death i came as fast as i could to your fathers farm rooi krantz where i learned from the old vrouw sally that you had taken to treasurehunting the same treasure that i told you of on the zanzibar  so i followed your spoor met the servants whom you had sent back who told me all about you and in due course after many adventures as they say in a book walked into the camp of our friends the matabele  they were going to kill me at once when suddenly you appeared upon that point of rock glittering likelike the angel of the dawn i knew that it must be you for i had found out about your attempted escape and how you were hunted back to this place but the matabele all thought that it was the spirit of bambatse who has a great reputation in these parts well that took off their attention and afterwards as i told you it occurred to them that i might be an engineer you know the rest dont you  yes answered benita softly i know the rest  then they plunged into the reeds and were obliged to stop talking since they must walk in single file presently benita looked up and saw that she was under the thorn which grew in the cleft of the rock also with some trouble she found the bunch of reeds that she had bent down to mark the inconspicuous hole through which she had crept and by it her lantern it seemed weeks since she had left it there  now she said light your candles and if you see a crocodile please shoot     xxiv  the true gold  let me go first said robert  no answered benita i know the way but please do watch for that horrible crocodile  then she knelt down and crept into the hole while after her came robert and after him the two zulus who protested that they were not antbears to burrow under ground lifting the lantern she searched the cave and as she could see no signs of the crocodile walked on boldly to where the stair began  be quick she whispered to robert for in that place it seemed natural to speak low my father is above and near his death i am dreadfully afraid lest we should be too late  so they toiled up the endless steps a very strange procession for the two zulus bold men enough outside were shaking with fright till at length benita clambered out of the trap door on to the floor of the treasure chamber and turned to help robert whose lameness made him somewhat slow and awkward  whats all that he asked pointing to the hide sacks while they waited for the two scared kaffirs to join them  oh she answered indifferently gold i believe look there is some of it on the floor over benita da ferreiras footsteps  gold why it must be worth and who on earth is benita da ferreira  i will tell you afterwards she has been dead two or three hundred years it was her gold or her peoples and those are her footprints in the dust how stupid you are not to understand never mind the hateful stuff come on quickly  so they passed the door which she had opened that morning and clambered up the remaining stairway so full was benita of terrors that she could never remember how she climbed them suppose that the foot of the crucifix had swung to suppose that her father were dead suppose that jacob meyer had broken into the cave well for herself she was no longer afraid of jacob meyer oh they were there the heavy door had begun to close but mercifully her bit of rock kept it ajar  father father she cried running towards the tent  no answer came she threw aside the flap held down the lantern and looked there he lay white and still she was too late  he is dead he is dead she wailed robert knelt down at her side and examined the old man while she waited in an agony  he ought to be he said slowly but benita i dont think he is i can feel his heart stir no dont stop to talk pour out some of that squareface and here mix it with this milk  she obeyed and while he held up her fathers head with a trembling hand emptied a little of the drink into his mouth at first it ran out again then almost automatically he swallowed some and they knew that he was alive and thanked heaven ten minutes later mr clifford was sitting up staring at them with dull and wondering eyes while outside the two zulus whose nerves had now utterly broken down were contemplating the pile of skeletons in the corner and the white towering crucifix and loudly lamenting that they should have been brought to perish in this place of bones and ghosts  is it jacob meyer who makes that noise asked mr clifford faintly and benita where have you been so long andwho is this gentleman with you i seem to remember his face  he is the white man who was in the waggon father an old friend come to life again robert cant you stop the howling of those kaffirs though i am sure i dont wonder that they howl i should have liked to do so for days oh father father dont you understand me we are saved yes snatched out of hell and the jaws of death  is jacob meyer dead then he asked  i dont know where he is or what has happened to him and i dont care but perhaps we had better find out robert there is a madman outside make the kaffirs pull down that wall would you and catch him  what wall what madman he asked staring at her  oh of course you dont know that either you know nothing ill show you and you must be prepared for probably he will shoot at us  it all sounds a little risky doesnt it asked robert doubtfully  yes but we must take the risk we cannot carry my father down that place and unless we can get him into light and air soon he will certainly die the man outside is jacob meyer his partneryou remember him all these weeks of hardship and treasurehunting have sent him off his head and he wanted to mesmerize me and  and what make love to you  she nodded then went on  so when he could not get his way about the mesmerism and so forth he threatened to murder my father and that is why we had to hide in this cave and build ourselves up till at last i found the way out  amiable gentleman mr jacob meyer now as always said robert flushing to think that you should have been in the power of a scoundrel like that well i hope to come square with him  dont hurt him dear unless you are obliged remember he is not responsible he thought he saw a ghost here the other day  unless he behaves himself he is likely to see a good many soon muttered robert  then they went down the cave and as silently as possible began to work at the wall destroying in a few minutes what had been built up with so much labour when it was nearly down the zulus were told that there was an enemy outside and that they must help to catch him if necessary but were not to harm him they assented gladly enough indeed to get out of that cave they would have faced half a dozen enemies  now there was a hole right through the wall and robert bade benita stand to one side then as soon as his eyes became accustomed to the little light that penetrated there he drew his revolver and beckoned the kaffirs to follow down the passage they crept slowly lest they should be blinded when they came to the glare of the sunshine while benita waited with a beating heart  a little time went by she never knew how long till suddenly a rifle shot rang through the stillness benita was able to bear no more she rushed down the winding passage and presently just beyond its mouth in a blurred and indistinct fashion saw that the two white men were rolling together on the ground while the kaffirs sprang round watching for an opportunity to seize one of them at that moment they succeeded and robert rose dusting his hands and knees  amiable gentleman mr jacob meyer he repeated i could have killed him as his back was towards me but didnt because you asked me not then i stumbled with my lame leg and he whipped round and let drive with his rifle look and he showed her where the bullet had cut his ear luckily i got hold of him before he could loose off another  benita could find no words her heart was too full of thankfulness only she seized roberts hand and kissed it then she looked at jacob  he was lying upon the broad of his back the two big zulus holding his arms and legs his lips were cracked blue and swollen his face was almost black but his eyes still shone bright with insanity and hate  i know you he screamed hoarsely to robert you are another ghost the ghost of that man who was drowned otherwise my bullet would have killed you  yes mr meyer seymour answered i am a ghost now you boys heres a bit of rope tie his hands behind his back and search him there is a pistol in that pocket  they obeyed and presently meyer was disarmed and bound fast to a tree  water he moaned for days i have had nothing but the dew i could lick off the leaves  pitying his plight benita ran into the cave and returned presently with a tin of water one of the kaffirs held it to his lips and he drank greedily then leaving one zulu to watch him robert benita and the other zulu went back and as gently as they could carried out mr clifford on his mattress placing him in the shade of a rock where he lay blessing them feebly because they had brought him into the light again at the sight of the old man meyers rage blazed up afresh  ah he screamed if only i had killed you long ago she would be mine now not that fellows it was you who stood between us  look here my friend broke in robert i forgive you everything else but mad or sane be good enough to keep miss cliffords name off your lips or i will hand you over to those kaffirs to be dealt with as you deserve  then jacob understood and was silent they gave him more water and food to eat some of the meat that they had brought with them which he devoured ravenously  are you sensible now asked robert when he had done then listen to me i have some good news for you that treasure you have been hunting for has been found we are going to give you half of it one of the waggons and some oxen and clear you out of this place then if i set eyes on you again before we get to a civilized country i shoot you like a dog  you lie said meyer sullenly you want to turn me out into the wilderness to be murdered by the makalanga or the matabele  very well said robert untie him boys and bring him along i will show him whether i lie  where are they taking me to asked meyer not into the cave i wont go into the cave it is haunted if it hadnt been for the ghost there i would have broken down their wall long ago and killed that old snake before her eyes whenever i went near that wall i saw it watching me  first time i ever heard of a ghost being useful remarked robert bring him along no benita he shall see whether i am a liar  so the lights were lit and the two stalwart zulus hauled jacob forward robert and benita following at first he struggled violently then on finding that he could not escape went on his teeth chattering with fear  it is cruel remonstrated benita  a little cruelty will not do him any harm robert answered he has plenty to spare for other people besides he is going to get what he has been looking for so long  they led jacob to the foot of the crucifix where a paroxysm seemed to seize him then pushed him through the swinging doorway beneath and down the steep stairs till once more they all stood in the treasurechamber  look said robert and drawing his huntingknife he slashed one of the hide bags whereon instantly there flowed out a stream of beads and nuggets now my friend am i a liar he asked  at this wondrous sight jacobs terror seemed to depart from him and he grew cunning  beautiful beautiful he said more than i thoughtsacks and sacks of gold i shall be a king indeed no no it is all a dreamlike the rest i dont believe its there loose my arms and let me feel it  untie him said robert at the same time drawing his pistol and covering the man he cant do us any hurt  the kaffirs obeyed and jacob springing at the slashed bag plunged his thin hands into it  no lie he screamed no lie as he dragged the stuff out and smelt at it gold gold gold hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gold lets make a bargain englishman and i wont kill you as i meant to do you take the girl and give me all the gold and in his ecstasy he began to pour the glittering ingots over his head and body  a new version of the tale of danaë began robert in a sarcastic voice then suddenly paused for a change had come over jacobs face a terrible change  it turned ashen beneath the tan his eyes grew large and round he put up his hands as though to thrust something from him his whole frame shivered and his hair seemed to erect itself slowly he retreated backwards and would have fallen down the unclosed traphole had not one of the kaffirs pushed him away back he went still back till he struck the further wall and stood there perhaps for half a minute he lifted his hand and pointed first to those ancient footprints some of which still remained in the dust of the floor and next as they thought at benita his lips moved fast he seemed to be pleading remonstrating yetand this was the ghastliest part of itfrom them there came no sound lastly his eyes rolled up until only the whites of them were visible his face became wet as though water had been poured over it and still without a sound he fell forward and moved no more  so terrible was the scene that with a howl of fear the two kaffirs turned and fled up the stairway robert sprang to the jew dragged him over on to his back put his hand upon his breast and lifted his eyelids  dead he said stone dead privation brain excitement heart failurethats the story  perhaps answered benita faintly but really i think that i begin to believe in ghosts also look i never noticed them before and i didnt walk there but those footsteps seem to lead right up to him then she turned too and fled   another week had gone by the waggons were laden with a burden more precious perhaps than waggons have often borne before in one of them on a veritable bed of gold slept mr clifford still very weak and ill but somewhat better than he had been and with a good prospect of recovery at any rate for a while they were to trek a little after dawn and already robert and benita were up and waiting she touched his arm and said to him  come with me i have a fancy to see that place once more for the last time  so they climbed the hill and the steep steps in the topmost wall that meyer had blockedreopened nowand reaching the mouth of the cave lit the lamps which they had brought with them and entered there were the fragments of the barricade that benita had built with desperate hands there was the altar of sacrifice standing cold and grey as it had stood for perhaps three thousand years there was the tomb of the old monk who had a companion now for in it jacob meyer lay with him his bones covered by the débris that he himself had dug out in his mad search for wealth and there the white christ hung awful on his cross only the skeletons of the portuguese were gone for with the help of his kaffirs robert had moved them every one into the empty treasurechamber closing the trap beneath and building up the door above so that there they might lie in peace at last  in this melancholy place they tarried but a little while then turning their backs upon it for ever went out and climbed the granite cone to watch the sun rise over the broad zambesi up it came in glory that same sun which had shone upon the despairing benita da ferreira and upon the english benita when she had stood there in utter hopelessness and seen the white man captured by the matabele  now different was their state indeed and there in that high place whence perhaps many a wretched creature had been cast to death whence certainly the portuguese maiden had sought her death these two happy beings were not ashamed to give thanks to heaven for the joy which it had vouchsafed to them and for their hopes of life full and long to be travelled hand in hand behind them was the terror of the cave beneath them were the mists of the valley but above them the light shone and rolled and sparkled and above them stretched the eternal sky  they descended the pillar and near the foot of it saw an old man sitting it was mambo the molimo of the makalanga even when they were still far away from him they knew his snowwhite head and thin ascetic face as they drew near benita perceived that his eyes were closed and whispered to robert that he was asleep yet he had heard them coming and even guessed her thought  maiden he said in his gentle voice maiden who soon shall be a wife i do not sleep although i dream of you as i have dreamt before what did i say to you that day when first we met that for you i had good tidings that though death was all about you you need not fear that in this place you who had known great sorrow should find happiness and rest yet maiden you would not believe the words of the munwali spoken by his prophets lips as he at your side who shall be your husband would not believe me in years past when i told him that we should meet again  father she answered i thought your rest was that which we find only in the grave  you would not believe he went on without heeding her and therefore you tried to fly and therefore your heart was torn with terror and with agony when it should have waited for the end in confidence and peace  father my trial was very sore  maiden i know it and because it was so sore that patient spirit of bambatse bore with you and through it all guided your feet aright yes with you has that spirit gone by day by night in the morning and in the evening who was it that smote the man who lies dead yonder with horror and with madness when he would have bent your will to his and made you a wife to him who was it that told you the secret of the treasurepit and what footsteps went before you down its stair who was it that led you past the sentries of the amandabele and gave you wit and power to snatch your lords life from madunas bloody hand yes with you it has gone and with you it will go no more shall the white witch stand upon the pillar point at the rising of the sun or in the shining of the moon  father i have never understood you and i do not understand you now said benita what has this spirit to do with me  he smiled a little then answered slowly  that i may not tell you that you shall learn one day but never here when you also have entered into silence then you shall learn but i say to you that this shall not be till your hair is as white as mine and your years are as many ah you thought that i had deserted you when fearing for your fathers life you wept and prayed in the darkness of the cave yet it was not so for i did but suffer the doom which i had read to fulfil itself as it must do  he rose to his feet and resting on his staff laid one withered hand upon the head of benita  maiden he said we meet no more beneath the sun yet because you have brought deliverance to my people because you are sweet and pure and true take with you the blessing of munwali spoken by the mouth of his servant mambo the old molimo of bambatse though from time to time you must know tears and walk in the shade of sorrows long and happy shall be your days with him whom you have chosen children shall spring up about you and childrens children and with them also shall the blessing go the gold you white folk love is yours and it shall multiply and give food to the hungry and raiment to those that are acold yet in your own heart lies a richer store that cannot melt away the countless treasure of mercy and of love when you sleep and when you wake love shall take you by the hand till at length he leads you through lifes dark cave to that eternal house of purest gold which soon or late those that seek it shall inherit and with his staff he pointed to the glowing morning sky wherein one by one little rosy clouds floated upwards and were lost  to robert and to benitas misty eyes they looked like brightwinged angels throwing wide the black doors of night and heralding that conquering glory at whose advent despair and darkness flee away
