76635081	their silver wedding journey  by william dean howells   part i  note several chapter heading numerals are out of order or missing in this 1899 edition however the text is all present in the three volumes dw    i  you need the rest said the business end and your wife wants you to go as well as your doctor besides its your sabbatical year and you could send back a lot of stuff for the magazine  is that your notion of a sabbatical year asked the editor  no i throw that out as a bait to your conscience you neednt write a line while youre gone i wish you wouldnt for your own sake although every number that hasnt got you in it is a back number for me  thats very nice of you fulkerson said the editor i suppose you realize that its nine years since we took every other week from dryfoos  well that makes it all the more sabbatical said fulkerson the two extra years that youve put in here over and above the old style sabbatical seven are just so much more to your credit it was your right to go two years ago and now its your duty couldnt you look at it in that light  i dare say mrs march could the editor assented i dont believe she could be brought to regard it as a pleasure on any other terms  of course not said fulkerson if you wont take a year take three months and call it a sabbatical summer but go anyway you can make up half a dozen numbers ahead and tom here knows your ways so well that you neednt think about every other week from the time you start till the time you try to bribe the customs inspector when you get back i can take a hack at the editing myself if toms inspiration gives out and put a little of my advertising fire into the thing he laid his hand on the shoulder of the young fellow who stood smiling by and pushed and shook him in the liking there was between them now you go march mrs fulkerson feels just as i do about it we had our outing last year and we want mrs march and you to have yours you let me go down and engage your passage and  no no the editor rebelled ill think about it but as he turned to the work he was so fond of and so weary of he tried not to think of the question again till he closed his desk in the afternoon and started to walk home the doctor had said he ought to walk and he did so though he longed to ride and looked wistfully at the passing cars  he knew he was in a rut as his wife often said but if it was a rut it was a support too it kept him from wobbling she always talked as if the flowery fields of youth lay on either side of the dusty road he had been going so long and he had but to step aside from it to be among the butterflies and buttercups again he sometimes indulged this illusion himself in a certain ironical spirit which caressed while it mocked the notion they had a tacit agreement that their youth if they were ever to find it again was to be looked for in europe where they met when they were young and they had never been quite without the hope of going back there some day for a long sojourn they had not seen the time when they could do so they were dreamers but as they recognized even dreaming is not free from care and in his dream march had been obliged to work pretty steadily if not too intensely he had been forced to forego the distinctly literary ambition with which he had started in life because he had their common living to make and he could not make it by writing graceful verse or even graceful prose he had been many years in a sufficiently distasteful business and he had lost any thought of leaving it when it left him perhaps because his hold on it had always been rather lax and he had not been able to conceal that he disliked it at any rate he was supplanted in his insurance agency at boston by a subordinate in his office and though he was at the same time offered a place of nominal credit in the employ of the company he was able to decline it in grace of a chance which united the charm of congenial work with the solid advantage of a better salary than he had been getting for work he hated it was an incredible chance but it was rendered appreciably real by the necessity it involved that they should leave boston where they had lived all their married life where mrs march as well as their children was born and where all their tender and familiar ties were and come to new york where the literary enterprise which formed his chance was to be founded  it was then a magazine of a new sort which his business partner had imagined in such leisure as the management of a newspaper syndicate afforded him and had always thought of getting march to edit the magazine which is also a book has since been realized elsewhere on more or less prosperous terms but not for any long period and every other week was apparentlythe only periodical of the kind conditioned for survival it was at first backed by unlimited capital and it had the instant favor of a popular mood which has since changed but which did not change so soon that the magazine had not time to establish itself in a wide acceptance it was now no longer a novelty it was no longer in the maiden blush of its first success but it had entered upon its second youth with the reasonable hope of many years of prosperity before it in fact it was a very comfortable living for all concerned and the marches had the conditions almost dismayingly perfect in which they had often promised themselves to go and be young again in europe when they rebelled at finding themselves elderly in america their daughter was married and so very much to her mothers mind that she did not worry about her even though she lived so far away as chicago still a wild frontier town to her boston imagination and their son as soon as he left college had taken hold on every other week under his fathers instruction with a zeal and intelligence which won him fulkersons praise as a chip of the old block these two liked each other and worked into each others hands as cordially and aptly as fulkerson and march had ever done it amused the father to see his son offering fulkerson the same deference which the business end paid to seniority in march himself but in fact fulkersons forehead was getting as he said more intellectual every day and the years were pushing them all along together  still march had kept on in the old rut and one day he fell down in it he had a long sickness and when he was well of it he was so slow in getting his grip of work again that he was sometimes deeply discouraged his wife shared his depression whether he showed or whether he hid it and when the doctor advised his going abroad she abetted the doctor with all the strength of a womans hygienic intuitions march himself willingly consented at first but as soon as he got strength for his work he began to temporize and to demur he said that he believed it would do him just as much good to go to saratoga where they always had such a good time as to go to carlsbad and mrs march had been obliged several times to leave him to his own undoing she always took him more vigorously in hand afterwards     ii  when he got home from the every other week office the afternoon of that talk with the business end he wanted to laugh with his wife at fulkersons notion of a sabbatical year she did not think it was so very droll she even urged it seriously against him as if she had now the authority of holy writ for forcing him abroad she found no relish of absurdity in the idea that it was his duty to take this rest which had been his right before  he abandoned himself to a fancy which had been working to the surface of his thought we could call it our silver wedding journey and go round to all the old places and see them in the reflected light of the past  oh we could she responded passionately and he had now the delicate responsibility of persuading her that he was joking  he could think of nothing better than a return to fulkersons absurdity it would be our silver wedding journey just as it would be my sabbatical yeara good deal after date but i suppose that would make it all the more silvery  she faltered in her elation didnt you say a sabbatical year yourself she demanded  fulkerson said it but it was a figurative expression  and i suppose the silver wedding journey was a figurative expression too  it was a notion that tempted me i thought you would enjoy it dont you suppose i should be glad too if we could go over and find ourselves just as we were when we first met there  no i dont believe now that you care anything about it  well it couldnt be done anyway so that doesnt matter  it could be done if you were a mind to think so and it would be the greatest inspiration to you you are always longing for some chance to do original work to get away from your editing but youve let the time slip by without really trying to do anything i dont call those little studies of yours in the magazine anything and now you wont take the chance thats almost forcing itself upon you you could write an original book of the nicest kind mix up travel and fiction get some love in  oh thats the stalest kind of thing  well but you could see it from a perfectly new point of view you could look at it as a sort of dispassionate witness and treat it humorouslyof course it is ridiculousand do something entirely fresh  it wouldnt work it would be carrying water on both shoulders the fiction would kill the travel the travel would kill the fiction the love and the humor wouldnt mingle any more than oil and vinegar  well and what is better than a salad  but this would be all saladdressing and nothing to put it on she was silent and he yielded to another fancy we might imagine coming upon our former selves over there and travelling round with thema wedding journey en partie carree  something like that i call it a very poetical idea she said with a sort of provisionality as if distrusting another ambush  it isnt so bad he admitted how young we were in those days  too young to know what a good time we were having she said relaxing her doubt for the retrospect i dont feel as if i really saw europe then i was too inexperienced too ignorant too simple i would like to go just to make sure that i had been he was smiling again in the way he had when anything occurred to him that amused him and she demanded what is it  nothing i was wishing we could go in the consciousness of people who actually hadnt been beforecarry them all through europe and let them see it in the old simplehearted american way  she shook her head you couldnt theyve all been  all but about sixty or seventy millions said march  well those are just the millions you dont know and couldnt imagine  im not so sure of that  and even if you could imagine them you couldnt make them interesting all the interesting ones have been anyway  some of the uninteresting ones too i used to meet some of that sort over there i believe i would rather chance it for my pleasure with those that hadnt been  then why not do it i know you could get something out of it  it might be a good thing he mused to take a couple who had passed their whole life here in new york too poor and too busy ever to go and had a perfect famine for europe all the time i could have them spend their sunday afternoons going aboard the different boats and looking up their accommodations i could have them sail in imagination and discover an imaginary europe and give their grotesque misconceptions of it from travels and novels against a background of purely american experience we neednt go abroad to manage that i think it would be rather nice  i dont think it would be nice in the least said mrs march and if you dont want to talk seriously i would rather not talk at all  well then lets talk about our silver wedding journey  i see you merely want to tease and i am not in the humor for it  she said this in a great many different ways and then she was really silent he perceived that she was hurt and he tried to win her back to goodhumor he asked her if she would not like to go over to hoboken and look at one of the hanseatic league steamers some day and she refused when he sent the next day and got a permit to see the boat she consented to go     iii  he was one of those men who live from the inside outward he often took a hint for his actions from his fancies and now because he had fancied some people going to look at steamers on sundays he chose the next sunday himself for their visit to the hanseatic boat at hoboken to be sure it was a leisure day with him but he might have taken the afternoon of any other day for that matter and it was really that invisible thread of association which drew him  the colmannia had been in long enough to have made her toilet for the outward voyage and was looking her best she was tipped and edged with shining brass without and within and was redcarpeted and whitepainted as only a ship knows how to be a little uniformed steward ran before the visitors and showed them through the dim white corridors into typical staterooms on the different decks and then let them verify their first impression of the grandeur of the diningsaloon and the luxury of the ladies parlor and musicroom march made his wife observe that the tables and sofas and easychairs which seemed so carelessly scattered about were all suggestively screwed fast to the floor against rough weather and he amused himself with the heavy german browns and greens and coppers in the decorations which he said must have been studied in color from sausage beer and spinach to the effect of those large marchpanes in the roof she laughed with him at the tastelessness of the race which they were destined to marvel at more and more but she made him own that the stewardesses whom they saw were charmingly like servingmaids in the fliegende blatter when they went ashore she challenged his silence for some assent to her own conclusion that the colmannia was perfect  she has only one fault he assented shes a ship  yes said his wife and i shall want to look at the norumbia before i decide  then he saw that it was only a question which steamer they should take and not whether they should take any he explained at first gently and afterwards savagely that their visit to the colmannia was quite enough for him and that the vessel was not built that he would be willing to cross the atlantic in  when a man has gone so far as that he has committed himself to the opposite course in almost so many words and march was neither surprised nor abashed when he discovered himself before they reached home offering his wife many reasons why they should go to europe she answered to all no he had made her realize the horror of it so much that she was glad to give it up she gave it up with the best feeling all that she would ask of him was that he should never mention europe to her again she could imagine how much he disliked to go if such a ship as the colmannia did not make him want to go  at the bottom of his heart he knew that he had not used her very well he had kindled her fancy with those notions of a sabbatical year and a silver wedding journey and when she was willing to renounce both he had persisted in taking her to see the ship only to tell her afterwards that he would not go abroad on any account it was by a psychological juggle which some men will understand that he allowed himself the next day to get the sailings of the norumbia from the steamship office he also got a plan of the ship showing the most available staterooms so that they might be able to choose between her and the colmannia from all the facts     iv  from this time their decision to go was none the less explicit because so perfectly tacit  they began to amass maps and guides she got a baedeker for austria and he got a bradshaw for the continent which was never of the least use there but was for the present a mine of unavailable information he got a phrasebook too and tried to rub up his german he used to read german when he was a boy with a young enthusiasm for its romantic poetry and now for the sake of schiller and uhland and heine he held imaginary conversations with a barber a bootmaker and a banker and tried to taste the joy which he had not known in the language of those poets for a whole generation he perceived of course that unless the barber the bootmaker and the banker answered him in terms which the author of the phrasebook directed them to use he should not get on with them beyond his first question but he did not allow this to spoil his pleasure in it in fact it was with a tender emotion that he realized how little the world which had changed in everything else so greatly had changed in its ideal of a phrasebook  mrs march postponed the study of her baedeker to the time and place for it and addressed herself to the immediate business of ascertaining the respective merits of the colmannia and norumbia she carried on her researches solely among persons of her own sex its experiences were alone of that positive character which brings conviction and she valued them equally at first or second hand she heard of ladies who would not cross in any boat but the colmannia and who waited for months to get a room on her she talked with ladies who said that nothing would induce them to cross in her there were ladies who said she had twice the motion that the norumbia had and the vibration from her twin screws was frightful it always was on those twinscrew boats and it did not affect their testimony with mrs march that the norumbia was a twinscrew boat too it was repeated to her in the third or fourth degree of hearsay that the discipline on the colmannia was as perfect as that on the cunarders ladies whose friends had tried every line assured her that the table of the norumbia was almost as good as the table of the french boats to the best of the belief of lady witnesses still living who had friends on board the colmannia had once got aground and the norumbia had once had her bridge carried off by a tidal wave or it might be the colmannia they promised to ask and let her know their lightest word availed with her against the most solemn assurances of their husbands fathers or brothers who might be all very well on land but in navigation were not to be trusted they would say anything from a reckless and culpable optimism she obliged march all the same to ask among them but she recognized their guilty insincerity when he came home saying that one man had told him you could have played croquet on the deck of the colmannia the whole way over when he crossed and another that he never saw the racks on in three passages he had made in the norumbia  the weight of evidence was he thought in favor of the norumbia but when they went another sunday to hoboken and saw the ship mrs march liked her so much less than the colmannia that she could hardly wait for monday to come she felt sure all the good rooms on the colmannia would be gone before they could engage one  from a consensus of the nerves of all the ladies left in town so late in the season she knew that the only place on any steamer where your room ought to be was probably just where they could not get it if you went too high you felt the rolling terribly and people tramping up and down on the promenade under your window kept you awake the whole night if you went too low you felt the engine thump thump thump in your head the whole way over if you went too far forward you got the pitching if you went aft on the kitchen side you got the smell of the cooking the only place really was just back of the diningsaloon on the south side of the ship it was smooth there and it was quiet and you had the sun in your window all the way over he asked her if he must take their room there or nowhere and she answered that he must do his best but that she would not be satisfied with any other place  in his despair he went down to the steamer office and took a room which one of the clerks said was the best when he got home it appeared from reference to the ships plan that it was the very room his wife had wanted from the beginning and she praised him as if he had used a wisdom beyond his sex in getting it  he was in the enjoyment of his unmerited honor when a belated lady came with her husband for an evening call before going into the country at sight of the plans of steamers on the marches table she expressed the greatest wonder and delight that they were going to europe they had supposed everybody knew it by this time but she said she had not heard a word of it and she went on with some felicitations which march found rather unduly filial in getting a little past the prime of life he did not like to be used with too great consideration of his years and he did not think that he and his wife were so old that they need be treated as if they were going on a golden wedding journey and heaped with all sorts of impertinent prophecies of their enjoying it so much and being so much the better for the little outing under his breath he confounded this lady for her impudence but he schooled himself to let her rejoice at their going on a hanseatic boat because the germans were always so careful of you she made her husband agree with her and it came out that he had crossed several times on both the colmannia and the norumbia he volunteered to say that the colmannia was a capital seaboat she did not have her nose under water all the time she was steady as a rock and the captain and the kitchen were simply out of sight some people did call her unlucky  unlucky mrs march echoed faintly why do they call her unlucky  oh i dont know people will say anything about any boat you know she broke her shaft once and once she got caught in the ice  mrs march joined him in deriding the superstition of people and she parted gayly with this overgood young couple as soon as they were gone march knew that she would say you must change that ticket my dear we will go in the norumbia  suppose i cant get as good a room on the norumbia  then we must stay  in the morning after a night so bad that it was worse than no night at all she said she would go to the steamship office with him and question them up about the colmannia the people there had never heard she was called an unlucky boat they knew of nothing disastrous in her history they were so frank and so full in their denials and so kindly patient of mrs marchs anxieties that he saw every word was carrying conviction of their insincerity to her at the end she asked what rooms were left on the norumbia and the clerk whom they had fallen to looked through his passenger list with a shaking head he was afraid there was nothing they would like  but we would take anything she entreated and march smiled to think of his innocence in supposing for a moment that she had ever dreamed of not going  we merely want the best he put in one flight up no noise or dust with sun in all the windows and a place for fire on rainy days  they must be used to a good deal of american joking which they do not understand in the foreign steamship offices the clerk turned unsmilingly to one of his superiors and asked him some question in german which march could not catch perhaps because it formed no part of a conversation with a barber a bootmaker or a banker a brief drama followed and then the clerk pointed to a room on the plan of the norumbia and said it had just been given up and they could have it if they decided to take it at once  they looked and it was in the very place of their room on the colmannia it was within one of being the same number it was so providential if it was providential at all that they were both humbly silent a moment even mrs march was silent in this supreme moment she would not prompt her husband by a word a glance and it was from his own free will that he said we will take it  he thought it was his free will but perhaps ones will is never free and this may have been an instance of pure determinism from all the events before it no event that followed affected it though the day after they had taken their passage on the norumbia he heard that she had once been in the worst sort of storm in the month of august he felt obliged to impart the fact to his wife but she said that it proved nothing for or against the ship and confounded him more by her reason than by all her previous unreason reason is what a man is never prepared for in women perhaps because he finds it so seldom in men     v  during nearly the whole month that now passed before the date of sailing it seemed to march that in some familiar aspects new york had never been so interesting he had not easily reconciled himself to the place after his many years of boston but he had got used to the ugly grandeur to the noise and the rush and he had divined more and more the careless goodnature and friendly indifference of the vast sprawling ungainly metropolis there were happy moments when he felt a poetry unintentional and unconscious in it and he thought there was no point more favorable for the sense of this than stuyvesant square where they had a flat their windows looked down into its treetops and across them to the truncated towers of st georges and to the plain redbrick whitetrimmed front of the friends meeting house he came and went between his dwelling and his office through the two places that form the square and after dinner his wife and he had a habit of finding seats by one of the fountains in livingston place among the fathers and mothers of the hybrid east side children swarming there at play the elders read their english or italian or german or yiddish journals or gossiped or merely sat still and stared away the days fatigue while the little ones raced in and out among them crying and laughing quarrelling and kissing sometimes a mother darted forward and caught her child from the brink of the basin another taught hers to walk holding it tightly up behind by its short skirts another publicly nursed her baby to sleep  while they still dreamed but never thought of going to europe the marches often said how european all this was if these women had brought their knitting or sewing it would have been quite european but as soon as they had decided to go it all began to seem poignantly american in like manner before the conditions of their exile changed and they still pined for the old world they contrived a very agreeable illusion of it by dining now and then at an austrian restaurant in union square but later when they began to be homesick for the american scenes they had not yet left they had a keener retrospective joy in the strictly new york sunset they were bowed out into  the sunsets were uncommonly characteristic that may in union square they were the color of the red stripes in the american flag and when they were seen through the delirious architecture of the broadway side or down the perspective of the crossstreets where the elevated trains silhouetted themselves against their pink they imparted a feeling of pervasive americanism in which all impression of alien savors and civilities was lost one evening a fire flamed up in hoboken and burned for hours against the west in the lurid crimson tones of a conflagration as memorably and appealingly native as the colors of the sunset  the weather for nearly the whole month was of a mood familiar enough in our early summer and it was this which gave the sunsets their vitreous pink a thrilling coolness followed a first blaze of heat and in the long respite the thoughts almost went back to winter flannels but at last a hot wave was telegraphed from the west and the week before the norumbia sailed was an anguish of burning days and breathless nights which fused all regrets and reluctances in the hope of escape and made the exiles of two continents long for the sea with no care for either shore     vi  their steamer was to sail early they were up at dawn because they had scarcely lain down and march crept out into the square for a last breath of its morning air before breakfast he was now eager to be gone he had broken with habit and he wished to put all traces of the past out of sight but this was curiously like all other early mornings in his consciousness and he could not alienate himself from the wonted environment he stood talking on everyday terms of idle speculation with the familiar policeman about a stray parrot in the top of one of the trees where it screamed and clawed at the dead branch to which it clung then he went carelessly indoors again as if he were secure of reading the reporters story of it in that next days paper which he should not see  the sense of an inseverable continuity persisted through the breakfast which was like other breakfasts in the place they would be leaving in summer shrouds just as they always left it at the end of june the illusion was even heightened by the fact that their son was to be in the apartment all summer and it would not be so much shut up as usual the heavy trunks had been sent to the ship by express the afternoon before and they had only themselves and their stateroom baggage to transport to hoboken they came down to a carriage sent from a neighboring liverystable and exchanged goodmornings with a driver they knew by name  march had often fancied it a chief advantage of living in new york that you could drive to the steamer and start for europe as if you were starting for albany he was in the enjoyment of this advantage now but somehow it was not the consolation he had expected he knew of course that if they had been coming from boston for instance to sail in the norumbia they would probably have gone on board the night before and sweltered through its heat among the strange smells and noises of the dock and wharf instead of breakfasting at their own table and smoothly bowling down the asphalt on to the ferryboat and so to the very foot of the gangway at the ships side all in the cool of the early morning but though he had now the cool of the early morning on these conditions there was by no means enough of it  the sun was already burning the life out of the air with the threat of another day of the terrible heat that had prevailed for a week past and that last breakfast at home had not been gay though it had been lively in a fashion through mrs marchs efforts to convince her son that she did not want him to come and see them off of her daughters coming all the way from chicago there was no question and she reasoned that if he did not come to say goodby on board it would be the same as if they were not going  dont you want to go march asked with an obscure resentment  i dont want to seem to go she said with the calm of those who have logic on their side  as she drove away with her husband she was not so sure of her satisfaction in the feint she had arranged though when she saw the ghastly partings of people on board she was glad she had not allowed her son to come she kept saying this to herself and when they climbed to the ship from the wharf and found themselves in the crowd that choked the saloons and promenades and passages and stairways and landings she said it more than once to her husband  she heard weary elders pattering empty politenesses of farewell with friends who had come to see them off as they stood withdrawn in such refuges as the ships architecture afforded or submitted to be pushed and twirled about by the surging throng when they got in its way she pitied these in their affliction which she perceived that they could not lighten or shorten but she had no patience with the young girls who broke into shrieks of nervous laughter at the coming of certain young men and kept laughing and beckoning till they made the young men see them and then stretched their hands to them and stood screaming and shouting to them across the intervening heads and shoulders some girls of those whom no one had come to bid goodby made themselves merry or at least noisy by rushing off to the diningroom and looking at the cards on the bouquets heaping the tables to find whether any one had sent them flowers others whom young men had brought bunches of violets hid their noses in them and dropped their fans and handkerchiefs and cardcases and thanked the young men for picking them up others had got places in the musicroom and sat there with open boxes of longstemmed roses in their laps and talked up into the faces of the men with becoming lifts and slants of their eyes and chins in the midst of the turmoil children struggled against peoples feet and knees and bewildered mothers flew at the ships officers and battered them with questions alien to their respective functions as they amiably stifled about in their thick uniforms  sailors slung over the ships side on swinging seats were placidly smearing it with paint at that last moment the bulwarks were thickly set with the heads and arms of passengers who were making signs to friends on shore or calling messages to them that lost themselves in louder noises midway some of the women in the steerage were crying they were probably not going to europe for pleasure like the firstcabin passengers or even for their health on the wharf below march saw the face of one young girl twisted with weeping and he wished he had not seen it he turned from it and looked into the eyes of his son who was laughing at his shoulder he said that he had to come down with a goodby letter from his sister which he made an excuse for following them but he had always meant to see them off he owned the letter had just come with a special delivery stamp and it warned them that she had sent another goodby letter with some flowers on board mrs march scolded at them both but with tears in her eyes and in the renewed stress of parting which he thought he had put from him march went on taking note as with alien senses of the scene before him while they all talked on together and repeated the nothings they had said already  a rank odor of beetroot sugar rose from the farbranching sheds where some freight steamers of the line lay and seemed to mingle chemically with the noise which came up from the wharf next to the norumbia the mass of spectators deepened and dimmed away into the shadow of the roofs and along their front came files of carriages and trucks and carts and discharged the arriving passengers and their baggage and were lost in the crowd which they penetrated like slow currents becoming clogged and arrested from time to time and then beginning to move again  the passengers incessantly mounted by the canvasdraped galleries leading fore and aft into the ship bareheaded bluejacketed brassbuttoned stewards dodged skillfully in and out among them with their handbags holdalls hatboxes and stateroom trunks and ran before them into the different depths and heights where they hid these burdens and then ran back for more some of the passengers followed them and made sure that their things were put in the right places most of them remained wedged among the earlier comers or pushed aimlessly in and out of the doors of the promenades  the baggage for the hold continually rose in huge blocks from the wharf with a loud clucking of the tackle and sank into the open maw of the ship momently gathering herself for her long race seaward with harsh hissings and rattlings and gurglings there was no apparent reason why it should all or any of it end but there came a moment when there began to be warnings that were almost threats of the end the ships whistle sounded as if marking a certain interval and mrs march humbly entreated sternly commanded her son to go ashore or else be carried to europe they disputed whether that was the last signal or not she was sure it was and she appealed to march who was moved against his reason he affected to talk calmly with his son and gave him some last charges about every other week  some people now interrupted their leavetaking but the arriving passengers only arrived more rapidly at the gangways the bulks of baggage swung more swiftly into the air a bell rang and there rose womens cries oh that is the shorebell and mens protests it is only the first bell more and more began to descend the gangways fore and aft and soon outnumbered those who were coming aboard  march tried not to be nervous about his sons lingering he was ashamed of his anxiety but he said in a low voice better be off tom  his mother now said she did not care if tom were really carried to europe and at last he said well he guessed he must go ashore as if there had been no question of that before and then she clung to him and would not let him go but she acquired merit with herself at last by pushing him into the gangway with her own hands he nodded and waved his hat from its foot and mixed with the crowd  presently there was hardly any one coming aboard and the sailors began to undo the lashings of the gangways from the ships side files of men on the wharf laid hold of their rails the stewards guarding their approach looked up for the signal to come aboard and in vivid pantomime forbade some belated leavetakers to ascend these stood aside exchanging bows and grins with the friends whom they could not reach they all tried to make one another hear some last words the moment came when the saloon gangway was detached then it was pulled ashore and the section of the bulwarks opening to it was locked not to be unlocked on this side of the world an indefinable impulse communicated itself to the steamer while it still seemed motionless it moved the thick spread of faces on the wharf which had looked at times like some sort of strange flowers in a level field broke into a universal tremor and the air above them was filled with hats and handkerchiefs as if with the flight of birds rising from the field  the marches tried to make out their sons face they believed that they did but they decided that they had not seen him and his mother said that she was glad it would only have made it harder to bear though she was glad he had come over to say goodby it had seemed so unnatural that he should not when everybody else was saying goodby  on the wharf color was now taking the place of form the scene ceased to have the effect of an instantaneous photograph it was like an impressionistic study as the ship swung free of the shed and got into the stream the shore lost reality up to a certain moment all was still new york all was even hoboken then amidst the grotesque and monstrous shows of the architecture on either shore march felt himself at sea and on the way to europe  the fact was accented by the trouble people were already making with the decksteward about their steamer chairs which they all wanted put in the best places and march with a certain heartache was involuntarily verifying the instant in which he ceased to be of his native shores while still in full sight of them when he suddenly reverted to them and as it were landed on them again in an incident that held him breathless a man bareheaded and with his arms flung wildly abroad came flying down the promenade from the steerage capitan capitan there is a woman he shouted in nondescript english she must go hout she must go hout some vital fact imparted itself to the ships command and seemed to penetrate to the ships heart she stopped as if with a sort of majestic relenting a tug panted to her side and lifted a ladder to it the bareheaded man and a woman gripping a baby in her arms sprawled safely down its rungs to the deck of the tug and the steamer moved seaward again  what is it oh what is it his wife demanded of marchs share of their common ignorance a young fellow passing stopped as if arrested by the tragic note in her voice and explained that the woman had left three little children locked up in her tenement while she came to bid some friends on board goodby  he passed on and mrs march said what a charming face he had even before she began to wreak upon that wretched mother the overwrought sympathy which makes good women desire the punishment of people who have escaped danger she would not hear any excuse for her her children oughtnt to have been out of her mind for an instant  dont you want to send back a line to ours by the pilot march asked  she started from him oh was i really beginning to forget them  in the saloon where people were scattered about writing pilots letters she made him join her in an impassioned epistle of farewell which once more left none of the nothings unsaid that they had many times reiterated she would not let him put the stamp on for fear it would not stick and she had an agonizing moment of doubt whether it ought not to be a german stamp she was not pacified till the steward in charge of the mail decided  i shouldnt have forgiven myself march said if we hadnt let tom know that twenty minutes after he left us we were still alive and well  its to bella too she reasoned  he found her making their stateroom look homelike with their familiar things when he came with their daughters steamer letter and the flowers and fruit she had sent she said very well they would all keep and went on with her unpacking he asked her if she did not think these home things made it rather ghastly and she said if he kept on in that way she should certainly go back on the pilotboat he perceived that her nerves were spent he had resisted the impulse to an illtimed joke about the lifepreservers under their berths when the sound of the breakfasthorn wavering first in the distance found its way nearer and clearer down their corridor     vii  in one of the many visits to the steamship office which his wifes anxieties obliged him to make march had discussed the question of seats in the diningsaloon at first he had his ambition for the captains table but they convinced him more easily than he afterwards convinced mrs march that the captains table had become a superstition of the past and conferred no special honor it proved in the event that the captain of the norumbia had the good feeling to dine in a lower saloon among the passengers who paid least for their rooms but while the marches were still in their ignorance of this they decided to get what adventure they could out of letting the head steward put them where he liked and they came in to breakfast with a careless curiosity to see what he had done for them  there seemed scarcely a vacant place in the huge saloon through the oval openings in the centre they looked down into the lower saloon and up into the musicroom as thickly thronged with breakfasters the tables were brightened with the bouquets and the floral designs of ships anchors harps and doves sent to the lady passengers and at one time the marches thought they were going to be put before a steamyacht realized to the last detail in blue and white violets the ports of the saloon were open and showed the level sea the ship rode with no motion except the tremor from her screws the sound of talking and laughing rose with the clatter of knives and forks and the clash of crockery the homely smell of the coffee and steak and fish mixed with the spice of the roses and carnations the stewards ran hither and thither and a young foolish joy of travel welled up in the elderly hearts of the pair when the head steward turned out the swivelchairs where they were to sit they both made an inclination toward the people already at table as if it had been a company at some farforgotten table dhote in the later sixties the head steward seemed to understand as well as speak english but the tablestewards had only an effect of english which they eked out with bleace for all occasions of inquiry apology or reassurance as the equivalent of their native bitte otherwise there was no reason to suppose that they did not speak german which was the language of a good half of the passengers the stewards looked english however in conformity to what seems the ideal of every kind of foreign seafaring people and that went a good way toward making them intelligible  march to whom his wife mainly left their obeisance made it so tentative that if it should meet no response he could feel that it had been nothing more than a forward stoop such as was natural in sitting down he need not really have taken this precaution those whose eyes he caught more or less nodded in return  a nicelooking boy of thirteen or fourteen who had the place on the left of the lady in the sofa seat under the port bowed with almost magisterial gravity and made the lady on the sofa smile as if she were his mother and understood him march decided that she had been some time a widow and he easily divined that the young couple on her right had been so little time husband and wife that they would rather not have it known next them was a young lady whom he did not at first think so goodlooking as she proved later to be though she had at once a pretty nose with a slight upward slant at the point long eyes under fallen lashes a straight forehead not too high and a mouth which perhaps the exigencies of breakfasting did not allow all its characteristic charm she had what mrs march thought interesting hair of a dull black roughly rolled away from her forehead and temples in a fashion not particularly becoming to her and she had the air of not looking so well as she might if she had chosen the elderly man on her right it was easy to see was her father they had a family likeness though his fair hair now ashen with age was so different from hers he wore his beard cut in the fashion of the second empire with a louis napoleonic mustache imperial and chin tuft his neat head was cropt close and there was something gallic in its effect and something remotely military he had blue eyes really less severe than he meant though be frowned a good deal and managed them with glances of a staccato quickness as if challenging a potential disagreement with his opinions  the gentleman on his right who sat at the head of the table was of the humorous subironical american expression and a smile at the corner of his kindly mouth under an irongray full beard cut short at once questioned and tolerated the newcomers as he glanced at them he responded to marchs bow almost as decidedly as the nice boy whose mother he confronted at the other end of the table and with his comely bulk formed an interesting contrast to her vivid slightness she was brilliantly dark behind the gleam of the goldrimmed glasses perched on her pretty nose  if the talk had been general before the marches came it did not at once renew itself in that form nothing was said while they were having their first struggle with the tablestewards who repeated the order as if to show how fully they had misunderstood it the gentleman at the head of the table intervened at last and then im obliged to you march said for your german i left mine in a phrasebook in my other coat pocket  oh i wasnt speaking german said the other it was merely their kind of english  the company were in the excitement of a novel situation which disposes people to acquaintance and this exchange of small pleasantries made every one laugh except the father and daughter but they had the effect of being tacitly amused  the mother of the nice boy said to mrs march you may not get what you ordered but it will be good  even if you dont know what it is said the young bride and then blushed as if she had been too bold  mrs march liked the blush and the young bride for it and she asked have you ever been on one of these german boats before they seem very comfortable  oh dear no weve never been on any boat before she made a little petted mouth of deprecation and added simpleheartedly my husband was going out on business and he thought he might as well take me along  the husband seemed to feel himself brought in by this and said he did not see why they should not make it a pleasuretrip too they put themselves in a position to be patronized by their deference and in the pauses of his talk with the gentleman at the head of the table march heard his wife abusing their inexperience to be unsparingly instructive about european travel he wondered whether she would be afraid to own that it was nearly thirty years since she had crossed the ocean though that might seem recent to people who had never crossed at all  they listened with respect as she boasted in what an anguish of wisdom she had decided between the colmannia and the norumbia the wife said she did not know there was such a difference in steamers but when mrs march perfervidly assured her that there was all the difference in the world she submitted and said she supposed she ought to be thankful that they had hit upon the right one they had telegraphed for berths and taken what was given them their room seemed to be very nice  oh said mrs march and her husband knew that she was saying it to reconcile them to the inevitable all the rooms on the norumbia are nice the only difference is that if they are on the south side you have the sun  im not sure which is the south side said the bride we seem to have been going west ever since we started and i feel as if we should reach home in the morning if we had a good night is the ocean always so smooth as this  oh dear no said mrs march its never so smooth as this and she began to be outrageously authoritative about the ocean weather she ended by declaring that the june passages were always good and that if the ship kept a southerly course they would have no fogs and no icebergs she looked round and caught her husbands eye what is it have i been bragging well you understand she added to the bride ive only been over once a great while ago and i dont really know anything about it and they laughed together but i talked so much with people after we decided to go that i feel as if i had been a hundred times  i know said the other lady with caressing intelligence that is just the way with she stopped and looked at the young man whom the head steward was bringing up to take the vacant place next to march he came forward stuffing his cap into the pocket of his blue serge sack and smiled down on the company with such happiness in his gay eyes that march wondered what chance at this late day could have given any human creature his content so absolute and what calamity could be lurking round the corner to take it out of him the newcomer looked at march as if he knew him and march saw at a second glance that he was the young fellow who had told him about the mother put off after the start he asked him whether there was any change in the weather yet outside and he answered eagerly as if the chance to put his happiness into the mere sound of words were a favor done him that their ship had just spoken one of the big hanseatic mailboats and she had signalled back that she had met ice so that they would probably keep a southerly course and not have it cooler till they were off the banks  the mother of the boy said i thought we must be off the banks when i came out of my room but it was only the electric fan at the foot of the stairs  that was what i thought said mrs march i almost sent my husband back for my shawl both the ladies laughed and liked each other for their common experience  the gentleman at the head of the table said they ought to have fans going there by that pillar or else close the ports they only let in heat  they easily conformed to the american convention of jocosity in their talk it perhaps no more represents the individual mood than the convention of dulness among other people but it seemed to make the young man feel at home  why do you think its uncomfortably warm he asked from what march perceived to be a meteorology of his own he laughed and added it is pretty summerlike as if he had not thought of it before he talked of the big mailboat and said he would like to cross on such a boat as that and then he glanced at the possible advantage of having your own steamyacht like the one which he said they had just passed so near that you could see what a good time the people were having on board he began to speak to the marches his talk spread to the young couple across the table it visited the mother on the sofa in a remark which she might ignore without apparent rejection and without really avoiding the boy it glanced off toward the father and daughter from whom it fell to rest with the gentleman at the head of the table  it was not that the father and daughter had slighted his overture if it was so much as that but that they were tacitly preoccupied or were of some philosophy concerning their fellowbreakfasters which did not suffer them for the present at least to share in the common friendliness this is an attitude sometimes produced in people by a sense of just or even unjust superiority sometimes by serious trouble sometimes by transient annoyance the cause was not so deepseated but mrs march before she rose from her place believed that she had detected a slant of the young ladys eyes from under her lashes toward the young man and she leaped to a conclusion concerning them in a matter where all logical steps are impertinent she did not announce her arrival at this point till the young man had overtaken her before she got out of the saloon and presented the handkerchief she had dropped under the table  he went away with her thanks and then she said to her husband well hes perfectly charming and i dont wonder shes taken with him that kind of cold girl would be though im not sure that she is cold shes interesting and you could see that he thought so the more he looked at her i could see him looking at her from the very first instant he couldnt keep his eyes off her she piqued his curiosity and made him wonder about her  now look here isabel this wont do i can stand a good deal but i sat between you and that young fellow and you couldnt tell whether he was looking at that girl or not  i could i could tell by the expression of her face  oh well if its gone as far as that with you i give it up when are you going to have them married  nonsense i want you to find out who all those people are how are you going to do it  perhaps the passenger list will say he suggested     viii  the list did not say of itself but with the help of the head stewards diagram it said that the gentleman at the head of the table was mr r m kenby the father and the daughter were mr e b triscoe and miss triscoe the bridal pair were mr and mrs leffers the mother and her son were mrs adding and mr roswell adding the young man who came in last was mr l j burnamy march carried the list with these names carefully checked and rearranged on a neat plan of the table to his wife in her steamer chair and left her to make out the history and the character of the people from it in this sort of conjecture long experience had taught him his futility and he strolled up and down and looked at the life about him with no wish to penetrate it deeply  long island was now a low yellow line on the left some fishingboats flickered off the shore they met a few sail and left more behind but already and so near one of the greatest ports of the world the spacious solitude of the ocean was beginning there was no swell the sea lay quite flat with a fine mesh of wrinkles on its surface and the sun flamed down upon it from a sky without a cloud with the light fair wind there was no resistance in the sultry air the thin dun smoke from the smokestack fell about the decks like a stifling veil  the promenades were as uncomfortably crowded as the sidewalk of fourteenth street on a summers day and showed much the social average of a new york shopping thoroughfare distinction is something that does not always reveal itself at first sight on land and at sea it is still more retrusive a certain democracy of looks and clothes was the most notable thing to march in the apathetic groups and detached figures his criticism disabled the saloon passengers of even so much personal appeal as he imagined in some of the secondcabin passengers whom he saw across their barrier they had at least the pathos of their exclusion and he could wonder if they felt it or envied him at hoboken he had seen certain people coming on board who looked like swells but they had now either retired from the crowd or they had already conformed to the prevailing type it was very well as a type he was of it himself but he wished that beauty as well as distinction had not been so lost in it  in fact he no longer saw so much beauty anywhere as he once did it might be that he saw life more truly than when he was young and that his glasses were better than his eyes had been but there were analogies that forbade his thinking so and he sometimes had his misgivings that the trouble was with his glasses he made what he could of a pretty girl who had the air of not meaning to lose a moment from flirtation and was luring her fellowpassengers from under her sailor hat she had already attached one of them and she was hooking out for more she kept moving herself from the waist up as if she worked there on a pivot showing now this side and now that side of her face and visiting the admirer she had secured with a smile as from the lamp of a revolving light as she turned  while he was dwelling upon this folly with a sense of impersonal pleasure in it as complete through his years as if he were already a disembodied spirit the pulse of the engines suddenly ceased and he joined the general rush to the rail with a fantastic expectation of seeing another distracted mother put off but it was only the pilot leaving the ship he was climbing down the ladder which hung over the boat rising and sinking on the sea below while the two men in her held her from the ships side with their oars in the offing lay the white steamyacht which now replaces the picturesque pilotsloop of other times the norumbias screws turned again under half a head of steam the pilot dropped from the last rung of the ladder into the boat and caught the bundle of letters tossed after him then his men let go the line that was towing their craft and the incident of the steamers departure was finally closed it had been dramatically heightened perhaps by her final impatience to be off at some added risks to the pilot and his men but not painfully so and march smiled to think how men whose lives are all of dangerous chances seem always to take as many of them as they can  he heard a girls fresh voice saying at his shoulder well now we are off and i suppose youre glad papa  im glad were not taking the pilot on at least answered the elderly man whom the girl had spoken to and march turned to see the father and daughter whose reticence at the breakfast table had interested him he wondered that he had left her out of the account in estimating the beauty of the ships passengers he saw now that she was not only extremely pretty but as she moved away she was very graceful she even had distinction he had fancied a tone of tolerance and at the same time of reproach in her voice when she spoke and a tone of defiance and not very successful denial in her fathers and he went back with these impressions to his wife whom he thought he ought to tell why the ship had stopped  she had not noticed the ships stopping in her study of the passenger list and she did not care for the pilots leaving but she seemed to think his having overheard those words of the father and daughter an event of prime importance with a womans willingness to adapt the means to the end she suggested that he should follow them up and try to overhear something more she only partially realized the infamy of her suggestion when he laughed in scornful refusal  of course i dont want you to eavesdrop but i do want you to find out about them and about mr burnamy too i can wait about the others or manage for myself but these are driving me to distraction now will you  he said he would do anything he could with honor and at one of the earliest turns he made on the other side of the ship he was smilingly halted by mr burnamy who asked to be excused and then asked if he were not mr march of every other week he had seen the name on the passenger list and felt sure it must be the editors he seemed so trustfully to expect march to remember his own name as that of a writer from whom he had accepted a short poem yet unprinted that the editor feigned to do so until he really did dimly recall it he even recalled the short poem and some civil words he said about it caused burnamy to overrun in confidences that at once touched and amused him     ix  burnamy it seemed had taken passage on the norumbia because he found when he arrived in new york the day before that she was the first boat out his train was so much behind time that when he reached the office of the hanseatic league it was nominally shut but he pushed in by sufferance of the janitor and found a berth which had just been given up in one of the saloondeck rooms it was that or nothing and he felt rich enough to pay for it himself if the bird of prey who had cabled him to come out to carlsbad as his secretary would not stand the difference between the price and that of the lowerdeck sixinaroom berth which he would have taken if he had been allowed a choice  with the three hundred dollars he had got for his book less the price of his passage changed into german banknotes and gold pieces and safely buttoned in the breast pocket of his waistcoat he felt as safe from pillage as from poverty when he came out from buying his ticket he covertly pressed his arm against his breast from time to time for the joy of feeling his money there and not from any fear of finding it gone he wanted to sing he wanted to dance he could not believe it was he as he rode up the lonely length of broadway in the cablecar between the wild irregular walls of the canyon which the cablecars have all to themselves at the end of a summer afternoon  he went and dined and he thought he dined well at a spanishamerican restaurant for fifty cents with a halfbottle of california claret included when he came back to broadway he was aware that it was stiflingly hot in the pinkish twilight but he took a cablecar again in lack of other pastime and the motion served the purpose of a breeze which he made the most of by keeping his hat off it did not really matter to him whether it was hot or cool he was imparadised in weather which had nothing to do with the temperature partly because he was born to such weather in the gayety of soul which amused some people with him and partly because the world was behaving as he had always expected he was opulently content with the present moment but he thought very tolerantly of the future and he confirmed himself in the decision he had already made to stick to chicago when he came back to america new york was very well and he had no sentiment about chicago but he had got a foothold there he had done better with an eastern publisher he believed by hailing from the west and he did not believe it would hurt him with the eastern public to keep on hailing from the west  he was glad of a chance to see europe but he did not mean to come home so dazzled as to see nothing else against the american sky he fancied for he really knew nothing that it was the light of europe not its glare that he wanted and he wanted it chiefly on his material so as to see it more and more objectively it was his power of detachment from this that had enabled him to do his sketches in the paper with such charm as to lure a cash proposition from a publisher when he put them together for a book but he believed that his business faculty had much to do with his success and he was as proud of that as of the book itself perhaps he was not so very proud of the book he was at least not vain of it he could detach himself from his art as well as his material  like all literary temperaments he was of a certain hardness in spite of the susceptibilities that could be used to give coloring to his work he knew this well enough but he believed that there were depths of unprofessional tenderness in his nature he was good to his mother and he sent her money and wrote to her in the little indiana town where he had left her when he came to chicago after he got that invitation from the bird of prey he explored his heart for some affection that he had not felt for him before and he found a wish that his employer should not know it was he who had invented that nickname for him he promptly avowed this in the newspaper office which formed one of the eyries of the bird of prey and made the fellows promise not to give him away he failed to move their imagination when he brought up as a reason for softening toward him that he was from burnamys own part of indiana and was a benefactor of tippecanoe university from which burnamy was graduated but they relished the cynicism of his attempt and they were glad of his good luck which he was getting square and not rhomboid as most people seem to get their luck they liked him and some of them liked him for his clean young life as well as for his cleverness his life was known to be as clean as a girls and he looked like a girl with his sweet eyes though he had rather more chin than most girls  the conductor came to reverse his seat and burnamy told him he guessed he would ride back with him as far as the cars to the hoboken ferry if the conductor would put him off at the right place it was nearly nine oclock and he thought he might as well be going over to the ship where he had decided to pass the night after he found her and went on board he was glad he had not gone sooner a queasy odor of drainage stole up from the waters of the dock and mixed with the rank gross sweetness of the bags of beetroot sugar from the freightsteamers there was a coming and going of carts and trucks on the wharf and on the ship a rattling of chains and a clucking of pulleys with sudden outbreaks and then sudden silences of trampling seaboots burnamy looked into the diningsaloon and the musicroom with the notion of trying for some naps there then he went to his stateroom his roommate whoever he was to be had not come and he kicked off his shoes and threw off his coat and tumbled into his berth  he meant to rest awhile and then get up and spend the night in receiving impressions he could not think of any one who had done the facts of the eve of sailing on an atlantic liner he thought he would use the material first in a letter to the paper and afterwards in a poem but he found himself unable to grasp the notion of its essential relation to the choice between chicken croquettes and sweetbreads as entrees of the restaurant dinner where he had been offered neither he knew that he had begun to dream and that he must get up he was just going to get up when he woke to a sense of freshness in the air penetrating from the new day outside he looked at his watch and found it was quarter past six he glanced round the stateroom and saw that he had passed the night alone in it then he splashed himself hastily at the basin next his berth and jumped into his clothes and went on deck anxious to lose no feature or emotion of the ships departure  when she was fairly off he returned to his room to change the thick coat he had put on at the instigation of the early morning air his roommate was still absent but he was now represented by his stateroom baggage and burnamy tried to infer him from it he perceived a social quality in his dresscoat case capacious gladstone hatbox rug umbrella and soleleather steamer trunk which he could not attribute to his own equipment the things were not so new as his they had an effect of polite experience with a foreign registry and customs label on them here and there they had been chosen with both taste and knowledge and burnamy would have said that they were certainly english things if it had not been for the initials u s a which followed the name of e b triscoe on the end of the steamer trunk showing itself under the foot of the lower berth  the lower berth had fallen to burnamy through the default of the passenger whose ticket he had got at the last hour the clerk in the steamer office had been careful to impress him with this advantage and he now imagined a trespass on his property but he reassured himself by a glance at his ticket and went out to watch the ships passage down the stream and through the narrows after breakfast he came to his room again to see what could be done from his valise to make him look better in the eyes of a girl whom he had seen across the table of course he professed a much more general purpose he blamed himself for not having got at least a pair of the white tennisshoes which so many of the passengers were wearing his russet shoes had turned shabby on his feet but there was a pair of enamelled leather boots in his bag which he thought might do  his room was in the group of cabins on the upper deck he had already missed his way to it once by mistaking the corridor which it opened into and he was not sure that he was not blundering again when he peered down the narrow passage where he supposed it was a lady was standing at an open stateroom door resting her hands against the jambs and leaning forward with her head within and talking to some one there before he could draw back and try another corridor he heard her say perhaps hes some young man and wouldnt care  burnamy could not make out the answer that came from within the lady spoke again in a tone of reluctant assent no i dont suppose you could but if he understood perhaps he would offer  she drew her head out of the room stepping back a pace and lingering a moment at the threshold she looked round over her shoulder and discovered burnamy where he stood hesitating at the head of the passage she ebbed before him and then flowed round him in her instant escape with some murmured incoherencies about speaking to her father she vanished in a corridor on the other side of the ship while he stood staring into the doorway of his room  he had seen that she was the young lady for whom he had come to put on his enamelled shoes and he saw that the person within was the elderly gentleman who had sat next her at breakfast he begged his pardon as he entered and said he hoped he should not disturb him im afraid i left my things all over the place when i got up this morning  the other entreated him not to mention it and went on taking from his handbag a variety of toilet appliances which the sight of made burnamy vow to keep his own simple combs and brushes shut in his valise all the way over you slept on board then he suggested arresting himself with a pair of low shoes in his hand he decided to put them in a certain pocket of his steamer bag  oh yes burnamy laughed nervously i came near oversleeping and getting off to sea without knowing it and i rushed out to save myself and so  he began to gather up his belongings while he followed the movements of mr triscoe with a wistful eye he would have liked to offer his lower berth to this senior of his when he saw him arranging to take possession of the upper but he did not quite know how to manage it he noticed that as the other moved about he limped slightly unless it were rather a weary easing of his person from one limb to the other he stooped to pull his trunk out from under the berth and burnamy sprang to help him  let me get that out for you he caught it up and put it on the sofa under the port is that where you want it  why yes the other assented youre very good and as he took out his key to unlock the trunk he relented a little farther to the intimacies of the situation have you arranged with the bathsteward yet its such a full boat  no i havent said burnamy as if he had tried and failed till then he had not known that there was a bathsteward shall i get him for you  no no our bedroomsteward will send him i dare say thank you  mr triscoe had got his trunk open and burnamy had no longer an excuse for lingering in his defeat concerning the bathsteward as he felt it to be he had not the courage now to offer the lower berth he went away forgetting to change his shoes but he came back and as soon as he got the enamelled shoes on and shut the shabby russet pair in his bag he said abruptly mr triscoe i wish youd take the lower berth i got it at the eleventh hour by some fellows giving it up and it isnt as if id bargained for it a month ago  the elder man gave him one of his staccato glances in which burnamy fancied suspicion and even resentment but he said after the moment of reflection which he gave himself why thank you if you dont mind really  not at all cried the young man i should like the upper berth better well have the steward change the sheets  oh ill see that he does that said mr triscoe i couldnt allow you to take any trouble about it he now looked as if he wished burnamy would go and leave him to his domestic arrangements     x  in telling about himself burnamy touched only upon the points which he believed would take his listeners intelligent fancy and he stopped so long before he had tired him that march said he would like to introduce him to his wife he saw in the agreeable young fellow an image of his own youth with some differences which he was willing to own were to the young fellows advantage but they were both from the middle west in their native accent and their local tradition they were the same they were the same in their aspirations they were of one blood in their literary impulse to externate their thoughts and emotions  burnamy answered with a glance at his enamelled shoes that he would be delighted and when her husband brought him up to her mrs march said she was always glad to meet the contributors to the magazine and asked him whether he knew mr kendricks who was her favorite without giving him time to reply to a question that seemed to depress him she said that she had a son who must be nearly his own age and whom his father had left in charge of every other week for the few months they were to be gone that they had a daughter married and living in chicago she made him sit down by her in marchs chair and before he left them march heard him magnanimously asking whether mr kendricks was going to do something more for the magazine soon he sauntered away and did not know how quickly burnamy left this question to say with the laugh and blush which became him in her eyes  mrs march there is something i should like to tell you about if you will let me  why certainly mr burnamy she began but she saw that he did not wish her to continue  because he went on its a little matter that i shouldnt like to go wrong in  he told her of his having overheard what miss triscoe had said to her father and his belief that she was talking about the lower berth he said he would have wished to offer it of course but now he was afraid they might think he had overheard them and felt obliged to do it  i see said mrs march and she added thoughtfully she looks like rather a proud girl  yes the young fellow sighed  she is very charming she continued thoughtfully but not so judicially  well burnamy owned that is certainly one of the complications and they laughed together  she stopped herself after saying i see what you mean and suggested i think i should be guided by circumstances it neednt be done at once i suppose  well burnamy began and then he broke out with a laugh of embarrassment ive done it already  oh then it wasnt my advice exactly that you wanted  no  and how did he take it  he said he should be glad to make the exchange if i really didnt mind burnamy had risen restlessly and she did not ask him to stay she merely said  oh well im glad it turned out so nicely  im so glad you think it was the thing to do he managed to laugh again but he could not hide from her that he was not feeling altogether satisfied would you like me to send mr march if i see him he asked as if he did not know on what other terms to get away  do please she entreated and it seemed to her that he had hardly left her when her husband came up why where in the world did he find you so soon  did you send him for me i was just hanging round for him to go march sank into the chair at her side well is he going to marry her  oh you may laugh but there is something very exciting she told him what had happened and of her belief that burnamys handsome behavior had somehow not been met in kind  march gave himself the pleasure of an immense laugh it seems to me that this mr burnamy of yours wanted a little more gratitude than he was entitled to why shouldnt he have offered him the lower berth and why shouldnt the old gentleman have taken it just as he did did you want him to make a counteroffer of his daughters hand if he does i hope mr burnamy wont come for your advice till after hes accepted her  he wasnt very candid i hoped you would speak about that dont you think it was rather natural though  for him very likely but i think you would call it sinuous in some one you hadnt taken a fancy to  no no i wish to be just i dont see how he could have come straight at it and he did own up at last she asked him what burnamy had done for the magazine and he could remember nothing but that one small poem yet unprinted he was rather vague about its value but said it had temperament  he has temperament too she commented and she had made him tell her everything he knew or could be forced to imagine about burnamy before she let the talk turn to other things  the life of the promenade had already settled into seafaring form the steamer chairs were full and people were reading or dozing in them with an effect of long habit those who would be walking up and down had begun their walks some had begun going in and out of the smokingroom ladies who were easily affected by the motion were lying down in the musicroom groups of both sexes were standing at intervals along the rail and the promenaders were obliged to double on a briefer course or work slowly round them shuffleboard parties at one point and ringtoss parties at another were forming among the young people it was as lively and it was as dull as it would be two thousand miles at sea it was not the least cooler yet but if you sat still you did not suffer  in the prompt monotony the time was already passing swiftly the decksteward seemed hardly to have been round with tea and bouillon and he had not yet gathered up all the empty cups when the horn for lunch sounded it was the youngest of the tablestewards who gave the summons to meals and whenever the pretty boy appeared with his bugle funny passengers gathered round him to make him laugh and stop him from winding it his part of the joke was to fulfill his duty with gravity and only to give way to a smile of triumph as he walked off     xi  at lunch in the faded excitement of their first meeting the people at the marches table did not renew the premature intimacy of their breakfast talk mrs march went to lie down in her berth afterwards and march went on deck without her he began to walk to and from the barrier between the first and second cabin promenades lingering near it and musing pensively for some of the people beyond it looked as intelligent and as socially acceptable even to their clothes as their pecuniary betters of the saloon  there were two women a mother and daughter whom he fancied to be teachers by their looks going out for a little rest or perhaps for a little further study to fit them more perfectly for their work they gazed wistfully across at him whenever he came up to the barrier and he feigned a conversation with them and tried to convince them that the stamp of inferiority which their poverty put upon them was just or if not just then inevitable he argued with them that the sort of barrier which here prevented their being friends with him if they wished it ran invisibly through society everywhere but he felt ashamed before their kind patient intelligent faces and found himself wishing to excuse the fact he was defending was it any worse he asked them than their not being invited to the entertainments of people in upper fifth avenue he made them own that if they were let across that barrier the whole second cabin would have a logical right to follow and they were silenced but they continued to gape at him with their sincere gentle eyes whenever he returned to the barrier in his walk till he could bear it no longer and strolled off toward the steerage  there was more reason why the passengers there should be penned into a little space of their own in the sort of pit made by the narrowing deck at the bow they seemed to be all foreigners and if any had made their fortunes in our country they were hiding their prosperity in the return to their own they could hardly have come to us more shabby and squalid than they were going away but he thought their average less apathetic than that of the saloon passengers as he leaned over the rail and looked down at them some one had brought out an electric battery and the lumpish boys and slattern girls were shouting and laughing as they writhed with the current a young mother seated flat on the deck with her bare feet stuck out inattentively nursed her babe while she laughed and shouted with the rest a man with his head tied in a shawl walked about the pen and smiled grotesquely with the well side of his toothacheswollen face the owner of the battery carried it away and a group of little children with blue eyes and yellow hair gathered in the space he had left and looked up at a passenger near march who was eating some plums and cherries which he had brought from the luncheon table he began to throw the fruit down to them and the children scrambled for it  an elderly man with a thin grave aquiline face said i shouldnt want a child of mine down there  no march responded it isnt quite what one would choose for ones own its astonishing though how we reconcile ourselves to it in the case of others  i suppose its something well have to get used to on the other side suggested the stranger  well answered march you have some opportunities to get used to it on this side if you happen to live in new york and he went on to speak of the raggedness which often penetrated the frontier of comfort where he lived in stuyvesant square and which seemed as glad of alms in food or money as this poverty of the steerage  the other listened restively like a man whose ideals are disturbed i dont believe i should like to live in new york much he said and march fancied that he wished to be asked where he did live it appeared that he lived in ohio and he named his town he did not brag of it but he said it suited him he added that he had never expected to go to europe but that he had begun to run down lately and his doctor thought he had better go out and try carlsbad  march said to invite his further confidence that this was exactly his own case the ohio man met the overture from a common invalidism as if it detracted from his own distinction and he turned to speak of the difficulty he had in arranging his affairs for leaving home his heart opened a little with the word and he said how comfortable he and his wife were in their house and how much they both hated to shut it up when march offered him his card he said he had none of his own with him but that his name was eltwin he betrayed a simple wish to have march realize the local importance he had left behind him and it was not hard to comply march saw a grand army button in the lapel of his coat and he knew that he was in the presence of a veteran  he tried to guess his rank in telling his wife about him when he went down to find her just before dinner but he ended with a certain sense of affliction there are too many elderly invalids on this ship i knock against people of my own age everywhere why arent your youthful lovers more in evidence my dear i dont believe they are lovers and i begin to doubt if theyre young even  it wasnt very satisfactory at lunch certainly she owned but i know it will be different at dinner she was putting herself together after a nap that had made up for the lost sleep of the night before i want you to look very nice dear shall you dress for dinner she asked her husbands image in the stateroom glass which she was preoccupying  i shall dress in my peajacket and seaboots it answered  i have heard that they always dress for dinner on the big cunard and white star boats when its good weather she went on placidly i shouldnt want those people to think you were not up in the convenances  they both knew that she meant the reticent father and daughter and march flung out i shouldnt want them to think you werent theres such a thing as overdoing  she attacked him at another point what has annoyed you what else have you been doing  nothing ive been reading most of the afternoon  the maiden knight  this was the book which nearly everybody had brought on board it was just out and had caught an instant favor which swelled later to a tidal wave it depicted a heroic girl in every trying circumstance of mediaeval life and gratified the perennial passion of both sexes for historical romance while it flattered womans instinct of superiority by the celebration of her unintermitted triumphs ending in a preposterous and wholly superfluous selfsacrifice  march laughed for pleasure in her guess and she pursued i suppose you didnt waste time looking if anybody had brought the last copy of every other week  yes i did and i found the one you had left in your steamer chairfor advertising purposes probably  mr burnamy has another she said i saw it sticking out of his pocket this morning  oh yes he told me he had got it on the train from chicago to see if it had his poem in it hes an ingenuous soulin some ways  well that is the very reason why you ought to find out whether the men are going to dress and let him know he would never think of it himself  neither would i said her husband  very well if you wish to spoil his chance at the outset she sighed  she did not quite know whether to be glad or not that the men were all in sacks and cutaways at dinner it saved her from shame for her husband and mr burnamy but it put her in the wrong every one talked even the father and daughter talked with each other and at one moment mrs march could not be quite sure that the daughter had not looked at her when she spoke she could not be mistaken in the remark which the father addressed to burnamy though it led to nothing     xii  the dinner was uncommonly good as the first dinner out is apt to be and it went gayly on from soup to fruit which was of the american abundance and variety and as yet not of the veteran freshness imparted by the icecloset everybody was eating it when by a common consciousness they were aware of alien witnesses they looked up as by a single impulse and saw at the port the gaunt face of a steerage passenger staring down upon their luxury he held on his arm a child that shared his regard with yet hungrier eyes a boys nose showed itself as if tiptoed to the height of the mans elbow a young girl peered over his other arm  the passengers glanced at one another the two tablestewards with their napkins in their hands smiled vaguely and made some indefinite movements  the bachelor at the head of the table broke the spell im glad it didnt begin with the little neck clams  probably they only let those people come for the dessert march suggested  the widow now followed the direction of the other eyes and looked up over her shoulder she gave a little cry and shrank down the young bride made her petted mouth in appeal to the company her husband looked severe as if he were going to do something but refrained not to make a scene the reticent father threw one of his staccato glances at the port and mrs march was sure that she saw the daughter steal a look at burnamy  the young fellow laughed i dont suppose theres anything to be done about it unless we pass out a plate  mr kenby shook his head it wouldnt do we might send for the captain or the chief steward  the faces at the port vanished at other ports profiles passed and repassed as if the steerage passengers had their promenade under them but they paused no more  the marches went up to their steamer chairs and from her exasperated nerves mrs march denounced the arrangement of the ship which had made such a cruel thing possible  oh he mocked they had probably had a good substantial meal of their own and the scene of our banquet was of the quality of a picture a purely aesthetic treat but supposing it wasnt were doing something like it every day and every moment of our lives the norumbia is a piece of the whole worlds civilization set afloat and passing from shore to shore with unchanged classes and conditions a ships merely a small stage where were brought to close quarters with the daily drama of humanity  well then she protested i dont like being brought to close quarters with the daily drama of humanity as you call it and i dont believe that the large english ships are built so that the steerage passengers can stare in at the saloon windows while one is eating and im sorry we came on the norumbia  ah you think the norumbia doesnt hide anything he began and he was going to speak of the men in the furnace pits of the steamer how they fed the fires in a welding heat and as if they had perished in it crept out on the forecastle like blanched phantasms of toil but she interposed in time  if theres anything worse for pitys sake dont tell me she entreated and he forebore  he sat thinking how once the world had not seemed to have even death in it and then how as he had grown older death had come into it more and more and suffering was lurking everywhere and could hardly be kept out of sight he wondered if that young burnamy now saw the world as he used to see it a place for making verse and making love and full of beauty of all kinds waiting to be fitted with phrases he had lived a happy life burnamy would be lucky if he should live one half as happy and yet if he could show him his whole happy life just as it had truly been must not the young man shrink from such a picture of his future  say something said his wife what are you thinking about  oh burnamy he answered honestly enough  i was thinking about the children she said i am glad bella didnt try to come from chicago to see us off it would have been too silly she is getting to be very sensible i hope tom wont take the covers off the furniture when he has the fellows in to see him  well i want him to get all the comfort he can out of the place even if the moths eat up every stick of furniture  yes so do i and of course youre wishing that you were there with him march laughed guiltily well perhaps it was a crazy thing for us to start off alone for europe at our age  nothing of the kind he retorted in the necessity he perceived for staying her drooping spirits i wouldnt be anywhere else on any account isnt it perfectly delicious it puts me in mind of that night on the lake ontario boat when we were starting for montreal there was the same sort of red sunset and the air wasnt a bit softer than this  he spoke of a night on their weddingjourney when they were sill new enough from europe to be comparing everything at home with things there  well perhaps we shall get into the spirit of it again she said and they talked a long time of the past  all the mechanical noises were muffled in the dull air and the wash of the ships course through the waveless sea made itself pleasantly heard in the offing a steamer homeward bound swam smoothly by so close that her lights outlined her to the eye she sent up some signal rockets that soared against the purple heaven in green and crimson and spoke to the norumbia in the mysterious mute phrases of ships that meet in the dark  mrs march wondered what had become of burnamy the promenades were much freer now than they had been since the ship sailed when she rose to go below she caught sight of burnamy walking the deck transversely with some lady she clutched her husbands arm and stayed him in rich conjecture  do you suppose he can have got her to walking with him already  they waited till burnamy and his companion came in sight again she was tilting forward and turning from the waist now to him and now from him  no its that pivotal girl said march and his wife said well im glad he wont be put down by them  in the musicroom sat the people she meant and at the instant she passed on down the stairs the daughter was saying to the father i dont see why you didnt tell me sooner papa  it was such an unimportant matter that i didnt think to mention it he offered it and i took it that was all what difference could it have made to you  none but one doesnt like to do any one an injustice  i didnt know you were thinking anything about it  no of course not     xiii  the voyage of the norumbia was one of those which passengers say they have never seen anything like though for the first two or three days out neither the doctor nor the decksteward could be got to prophesy when the ship would be in there was only a day or two when it could really be called rough and the seasickness was confined to those who seemed wilful sufferers they lay on the cushioned benching around the stairslanding and subsisted on biscuit and beef tea without qualifying the monotonous wellbeing of the other passengers who passed without noticing them  the second morning there was rain and the air freshened but the leaden sea lay level as before the sun shone in the afternoon with the sunset the fog came thick and white the ship lowed dismally through the night from the dense folds of the mist answering noises called back to her just before dark two men in a dory shouted up to her close under her bows and then melted out of sight when the dark fell the lights of fishingschooners were seen and their bells pealed once loud cries from a vessel near at hand made themselves heard some people in the diningsaloon sang hymns the smokingroom was dense with cigar fumes and the cardplayers dealt their hands in an atmosphere emulous of the fog without  the norumbia was off the banks and the second day of fog was cold as if icebergs were haunting the opaque pallor around her in the ranks of steamer chairs people lay like mummies in their dense wrappings in the musicroom the little children of travel discussed the different lines of steamers on which they had crossed and babes of five and seven disputed about the motion on the cunarders and white stars their nurses tried in vain to still them in behalf of older passengers trying to write letters there  by the next morning the ship had run out of the fog and people who could keep their feet said they were glad of the greater motion which they found beyond the banks they now talked of the heat of the first days out and how much they had suffered some who had passed the night on board before sailing tried to impart a sense of their misery in trying to sleep  a day or two later a storm struck the ship and the sailors stretched canvas along the weather promenade and put up a sheathing of boards across the bow end to keep off the rain yet a day or two more and the sea had fallen again and there was dancing on the widest space of the lee promenade  the little events of the sea outside the steamer offered themselves in their poor variety once a ship in the offing with all its square sails set lifted them like three white towers from the deep on the rim of the ocean the length of some westward liner blocked itself out against the horizon and swiftly trailed its smoke out of sight a few tramp steamers lounging and lunging through the trough of the sea were overtaken and left behind an old brigantine passed so close that her rusty iron sides showed plain and one could discern the faces of the people on board  the steamer was oftenest without the sign of any life beyond her one day a small bird beat the air with its little wings under the roof of the promenade and then flittered from sight over the surface of the waste a school of porpoises stiff and wooden in their rise plunged clumsily from wave to wave the deep itself had sometimes the unreality the artificiality of the canvas sea of the theatre commonly it was livid and cold in color but there was a morning when it was delicately misted and where the mist left it clear it was blue and exquisitely iridescent under the pale sun the wrinkled waves were finely pitted by the falling spray these were rare moments mostly when it was not like painted canvas is was hard like black rock with surfaces of smooth cleavage where it met the sky it lay flat and motionless or in the rougher weather carved itself along the horizon in successions of surges  if the sun rose clear it was overcast in a few hours then the clouds broke and let a little sunshine through to close again before the dim evening thickened over the waters sometimes the moon looked through the ragged curtain of vapors one night it seemed to shine till morning and shook a path of quicksilver from the horizon to the ship through every change after she had left the fog behind the steamer drove on with the pulse of her engines that stopped no more than a mans heart stops in a course which had nothing to mark it but the spread of the furrows from her sides and the wake that foamed from her stern to the western verge of the sea  the life of the ship like the life of the sea was a sodden monotony with certain events which were part of the monotony in the morning the little stewards bugle called the passengers from their dreams and half an hour later called them to their breakfast after such as chose had been served with coffee by their bedroomstewards then they went on deck where they read or dozed in their chairs or walked up and down or stood in the way of those who were walking or played shuffleboard and ringtoss or smoked and drank whiskey and aerated waters over their cards and papers in the smokingroom or wrote letters in the saloon or the musicroom at eleven oclock they spoiled their appetites for lunch with tea or bouillon to the music of a band of secondcabin stewards at one a single blast of the bugle called them to lunch where they glutted themselves to the torpor from which they afterwards drowsed in their berths or chairs they did the same things in the afternoon that they had done in the forenoon and at four oclock the deckstewards came round with their cups and saucers and their plates of sandwiches again to the music of the band there were two buglecalls for dinner and after dinner some went early to bed and some sat up late and had grills and toast at twelve the lights were put out in the saloons and the smokingrooms  there were various smells which stored themselves up in the consciousness to remain lastingly relative to certain moments and places a whiff of whiskey and tobacco that exhaled from the door of the smokingroom the odor of oil and steam rising from the open skylights over the engineroom the scent of stale bread about the doors of the diningsaloon  the life was like the life at a seaside hotel only more monotonous the walking was limited the talk was the tentative talk of people aware that there was no refuge if they got tired of one another the flirting itself such as there was of it must be carried on in the glare of the pervasive publicity it must be crude and bold or not be at all  there seemed to be very little of it there were not many young people on board of saloon quality and these were mostly girls the young men were mainly of the smokingroom sort they seldom risked themselves among the steamer chairs it was gayer in the second cabin and gayer yet in the steerage where robuster emotions were operated by the accordion the passengers there danced to its music they sang to it and laughed to it unabashed under the eyes of the firstcabin witnesses clustered along the rail above the pit where they took their rude pleasures  with march it came to his spending many hours of each long swift day in his berth with a book under the convenient electric light he was safe there from the acquaintances which constantly formed themselves only to fall into disintegration and cling to him afterwards as inorganic particles of weatherguessing and smokingroom gossip about the ships run  in the earliest hours of the voyage he thought that he saw some faces of the great world the world of wealth and fashion but these afterward vanished and left him to wonder where they hid themselves he did not meet them even in going to and from his meals he could only imagine them served in those palatial staterooms whose interiors the stewards now and then rather obtruded upon the public there were people whom he encountered in the promenades when he got up for the sunrise and whom he never saw at other times at midnight he met men prowling in the dark whom he never met by day but none of these were people of the great world before six oclock they were sometimes secondcabin passengers whose barrier was then lifted for a little while to give them the freedom of the saloon promenade  from time to time he thought he would look up his ohioan and revive from a closer study of him his interest in the rare american who had never been to europe but he kept with his elderly wife who had the effect of withholding him from marchs advances young mr and mrs leffers threw off more and more their disguise of a longmarried pair and became frankly bride and groom they seldom talked with any one else except at table they walked up and down together smiling into each others faces they sat side by side in their steamer chairs one shawl covered them both and there was reason to believe that they were holding each others hands under it  mrs adding often took the chair beside mrs march when her husband was straying about the ship or reading in his berth and the two ladies must have exchanged autobiographies for mrs march was able to tell him just how long mrs adding had been a widow what her husband died of and what had been done to save him how she was now perfectly wrapt up in her boy and was taking him abroad with some notion of going to switzerland after the summers travel and settling down with him at school there she and mrs march became great friends and rose as his mother called him attached himself reverently to march not only as a celebrity of the first grade in his quality of editor of every other week but as a sage of wisdom and goodness with whom he must not lose the chance of counsel upon almost every hypothesis and exigency of life  march could not bring himself to place burnamy quite where he belonged in contemporary literature when rose put him very high in virtue of the poem which he heard burnamy was going to have printed in every other week and of the book which he was going to have published and he let the boy bring to the young fellow the flattery which can come to any author but once in the first request for his autograph that burnamy confessed to have had they were so near in age though they were ten years apart that rose stood much more in awe of burnamy than of others much more his seniors he was often in the company of kenby whom he valued next to march as a person acquainted with men he consulted march upon kenbys practice of always taking up the language of the country he visited if it were only for a fortnight and he conceived a higher opinion of him from marchs approval  burnamy was most with mrs march who made him talk about himself when he supposed he was talking about literature in the hope that she could get him to talk about the triscoes but she listened in vain as he poured outhis soul in theories of literary art and in histories of what he had written and what he meant to write when he passed them where they sat together march heard the young fellows perpetually recurring i i i my my my me me me and smiled to think how she was suffering under the dripdrip of his innocent egotism  she bore in a sort of scientific patience his attentions to the pivotal girl and miss triscoes indifference to him in which a less penetrating scrutiny could have detected no change from meal to meal it was only at table that she could see them together or that she could note any break in the reserve of the father and daughter the signs of this were so fine that when she reported them march laughed in scornful incredulity but at breakfast the third day out the triscoes with the authority of people accustomed to social consideration suddenly turned to the marches and began to make themselves agreeable the father spoke to march of every other week which he seemed to know of in its relation to him and the young girl addressed herself to mrs marchs motherly sense not the less acceptably because indirectly she spoke of going out with her father for an indefinite time as if it were rather his wish than hers and she made some inquiries about places in germany they had never been in germany they had some idea of dresden but the idea of dresden with its american colony seemed rather tiresome and did mrs march know anything about weimar  mrs march was obliged to say that she knew nothing about anyplace in germany and she explained perhaps too fully where and why she was going with her husband she fancied a boston note in that scorn for the tiresomeness of dresden but the girls style was of new york rather than of boston and her accent was not quite of either place mrs march began to try the triscoes in this place and in that to divine them and to class them she had decided from the first that they were society people but they were cultivated beyond the average of the few swells whom she had met and there had been nothing offensive in their manner of holding themselves aloof from the other people at the table they had a right to do that if they chose  when the young lefferses came in to breakfast the talk went on between these and the marches the triscoes presently left the table and mrs march rose soon after eager for that discussion of their behavior which march knew he should not be able to postpone  he agreed with her that they were society people but she could not at once accept his theory that they had themselves been the objects of an advance from them because of their neutral literary quality through which they were of no social world but potentially common to any later she admitted this as she said for the sake of argument though what she wanted him to see now was that this was all a step of the girls toward finding out something about burnamy  the same afternoon about the time the decksteward was making his round with his cups miss triscoe abruptly advanced upon her from a neighboring corner of the bulkhead and asked with the air of one accustomed to have her advances gratefully received if she might sit by her the girl took marchs vacant chair where she had her cup of bouillon which she continued to hold untasted in her hand after the first sip mrs march did the same with hers and at the moment she had got very tired of doing it burnamy came by for the hundredth time that day and gave her a hundredth bow with a hundredth smile he perceived that she wished to get rid of her cup and he sprang to her relief  may i take yours too he said very passively to miss triscoe  you are very good she answered and gave it  mrs march with a casual air suggested do you know mr burnamy miss triscoe the girl said a few civil things but burnamy did not try to make talk with her while he remained a few moments before mrs march the pivotal girl came in sight tilting and turning in a rare moment of isolation at the corner of the musicroom and he bowed abruptly and hurried off to join her  miss triscoe did not linger she alleged the necessity of looking up her father and went away with a smile so friendly that mrs march might easily have construed it to mean that no blame attached itself to her in miss triscoes mind  then you dont feel that it was a very distinct success her husband asked on his return  not on the surface she said  better let ill enough alone he advised  she did not heed him all the same she cares for him the very fact that she was so cold shows that  and do you think her being cold will make him care for her  if she wants it to     xiv  at dinner that day the question of the maiden knight was debated among the noises and silences of the band young mrs leffers had brought the book to the table with her she said she had not been able to lay it down before the last horn sounded in fact she could have been seen reading it to her husband where he sat under the same shawl the whole afternoon  dont you think its perfectly fascinating she asked mrs adding with her petted mouth  well said the widow doubtfully its nearly a week since i read it and ive had time to get over the glow  oh i could just read it forever the bride exclaimed  i like a book said her husband that takes me out of myself i dont want to think when im reading  march was going to attack this ideal but he reflected in time that mr leffers had really stated his own motive in reading he compromised well i like the author to do my thinking for me  yes said the other that is what i mean  the question is whether the maiden knight fellow does it said kenby taking duck and pease from the steward at his shoulder  what my wife likes in it is to see what one woman can do and be singlehanded said march  no his wife corrected him what a man thinks she can  i suppose said mr triscoe unexpectedly that were like the english in our habit of going off about a book like a train of powder  if youll say a row of bricks march assented ill agree with you its certainly anglosaxon to fall over one another as we do when we get going it would be interesting to know just how much liking there is in the popularity of a given book  its like the run of a song isnt it kenby suggested you cant stand either when it reaches a given point  he spoke to march and ignored triscoe who had hitherto ignored the rest of the table  its very curious march said the book or the song catches a mood or feeds a craving and when one passes or the other is glutted  the discouraging part is triscoe put in still limiting himself to the marches that its never a question of real taste the things that go down with us are so crude so coarsely spiced they tickle such a vulgar palatenow in france for instance he suggested  well i dont know returned the editor after all we eat a good deal of bread and we drink more pure water than any other people even when we drink it iced i fancy it isnt so bad as absinthe  the young bride looked at him gratefully but she said if we cant get icewater in europe i dont know what mr leffers will do and the talk threatened to pass among the ladies into a comparison of american and european customs  burnamy could not bear to let it i dont pretend to be very well up in french literature he began but i think such a book as the maiden knight isnt such a bad piece of work people are liking a pretty wellbuilt story when they like it of course its sentimental and it begs the question a good deal but it imagines something heroic in character and it makes the reader imagine it too the man who wrote that book may be a donkey half the time but hes a genius the other half byandby hell do somethingafter hes come to see that his maiden knight was a foolthat i believe even you wont be down on mr march if he paints a heroic type as powerfully as he does in this book  he spoke with the authority of a journalist and though he deferred to march in the end he deferred with authority still march liked him for coming to the defence of a young writer whom he had not himself learned to like yet yes he said if he has the power you say and can keep it after he comes to his artistic consciousness  mrs leffers as if she thought things were going her way smiled rose adding listened with shining eyes expectantly fixed on march his mother viewed his rapture with tender amusement the steward was at kenbys shoulder with the salad and his entreating bleace and triscoe seemed to be questioning whether he should take any notice of burnamys general disagreement he said at last im afraid we havent the documents you dont seem to have cared much for french books and i havent read the maiden knight he added to march but i dont defend absinthe icewater is better what i object to is our indiscriminate taste both for raw whiskeyand for milkandwater  no one took up the question again and it was kenby who spoke next the doctor thinks if this weather holds that we shall be into plymouth wednesday morning i always like to get a professional opinion on the ships run  in the evening as mrs march was putting away in her portfolio the journalletter which she was writing to send back from plymouth to her children miss triscoe drifted to the place where she sat at their table in the diningroom by a coincidence which they both respected as casual  we had quite a literary dinner she remarked hovering for a moment near the chair which she later sank into it must have made you feel very much at home or perhaps youre so tired of it at home that you dont talk about books  we always talk shop in some form or other said mrs march my husband never tires of it a good many of the contributors come to us you know  it must be delightful said the girl she added as if she ought to excuse herself for neglecting an advantage that might have been hers if she had chosen im sorry one sees so little of the artistic and literary set but new york is such a big place  new york people seem to be very fond of it said mrs march those who have always lived there  we havent always lived there said the girl but i think one has a good time therethe best time a girl can have its all very well coming over for the summer one has to spend the summer somewhere are you going out for a long time  only for the summer first to carlsbad  oh yes i suppose we shall travel about through germany and then go to paris we always do my father is very fond of it  you must know it very well said mrs march aimlessly  i was born thereif that means knowing it i lived theretill i was eleven years old we came home after my mother died  oh said mrs march  the girl did not go further into her family history but by one of those leaps which seem to women as logical as other progressions she arrived at asking is mr burnamy one of the contributors  mrs march laughed he is going to be as soon as his poem is printed  poem  yes mr march thinks its very good  i thought he spoke very nicely about the maiden knight and he has been very nice to papa you know they have the same room  i think mr burnamy told me mrs march said  the girl went on he had the lower berth and he gave it up to papa hes done everything but turn himself out of doors  im sure hes been very glad mrs march ventured on burnamys behalf but very softly lest if she breathed upon these budding confidences they should shrink and wither away  i always tell papa that theres no country like america for real unselfishness and if theyre all like that in chicago the girl stopped and added with a laugh but im always quarrelling with papa about america  we have a daughter living in chicago said mrs march alluringly  but miss triscoe refused the bait either because she had said all she meant or because she had said all she would about chicago which mrs march felt for the present to be one with burnamy she gave another of her leaps i dont see why people are so anxious to get it like europe at home they say that there was a time when there were no chaperons before hoops you know she looked suggestively at mrs march resting one slim hand on the table and controlling her skirt with the other as if she were getting ready to rise at any moment when they used to sit on their steps  it was very pleasant before hoopsin every way said mrs march i was young then and i lived in boston where i suppose it was always simpler than in new york i used to sit on our steps it was delightful for girlsthe freedom  i wish i had lived before hoops said miss triscoe  well there must be places where its before hoops yet seattle and portland oregon for all i know mrs march suggested and there must be people in that epoch everywhere  like that young lady who twists and turns said miss triscoe giving first one side of her face and then the other they have a good time i suppose if europe came to us in one way it had to come in another if it came in galleries and all that sort of thing it had to come in chaperons youll think im a great extremist mrs march but sometimes i wish there was more america instead of less i dont believe its as bad as people say does mr march she asked taking hold of the chair with one hand to secure her footing from any caprice of the sea while she gathered her skirt more firmly into the other as she rose does he think that america is goingall wrong  all wrong how  oh in politics dont you know and government and all that and bribing and the lower classes having everything their own way and the horrid newspapers and everything getting so expensive and no regard for family or anything of that kind  mrs march thought she saw what miss triscoe meant but she answered still cautiously i dont believe he does always though there are times when he is very much disgusted then he says that he is getting too oldand we always quarrel about thatto see things as they really are he says that if the world had been going the way that people over fifty have always thought it was going it would have gone to smash in the time of the anthropoidal apes  oh yes darwin said miss triscoe vaguely well im glad he doesnt give it up i didnt know but i was holding out just because i had argued so much and was doing it out ofopposition goodnight she called her salutation gayly over her shoulder and mrs march watched her gliding out of the saloon with a graceful tilt to humor the slight roll of the ship and a little lurch to correct it once or twice and wondered if burnamy was afraid of her it seemed to her that if she were a young man she should not be afraid of miss triscoe  the next morning just after she had arranged herself in her steamer chair he approached her bowing and smiling with the first of his many bows and smiles for the day and at the same time miss triscoe came toward her from the opposite direction she nodded brightly to him and he gave her a bow and smile too he always had so many of them to spare  here is your chair mrs march called to her drawing the shawl out of the chair next her own mr march is wandering about the ship somewhere  ill keep it for him said miss triscoe and as burnamy offered to take the shawl that hung in the hollow of her arm she let it slip into his hand with an oh thank you which seemed also a permission for him to wrap it about her in the chair  he stood talking before the ladies but he looked up and down the promenade the pivotal girl showed herself at the corner of the musicroom as she had done the day before at first she revolved there as if she were shedding her light on some one hidden round the corner then she moved a few paces farther out and showed herself more obviously alone clearly she was there for burnamy to come and walk with her mrs march could see that and she felt that miss triscoe saw it too she waited for her to dismiss him to his flirtation but miss triscoe kept chatting on and he kept answering and making no motion to get away mrs march began to be as sorry for her as she was ashamed for him then she heard him saying would you like a turn or two and miss triscoe answering why yes thank you and promptly getting out of her chair as if the pains they had both been at to get her settled in it were all nothing  she had the composure to say you can leave your shawl with me miss triscoe and to receive her fervent oh thank you before they sailed off together with inhuman indifference to the girl at the corner of the musicroom then she sank into a kind of triumphal collapse from which she roused herself to point her husband to the chair beside her when he happened along  he chose to be perverse about her romance well now you had better let them alone remember kendricks he meant one of their young friends whose loveaffair they had promoted till his happy marriage left them in lasting doubt of what they had done my sympathies are all with the pivotal girl hadnt she as much right to him for the time being or for good and all as miss triscoe  that depends upon what you think of burnamy  well i dont like to see a girl have a young man snatched away from her just when shes made sure of him how do you suppose she is feeling now  she isnt feeling at all shes letting her revolving light fall upon half a dozen other young men by this time collectively or consecutively all that she wants to make sure of is that theyre young menor old ones even  march laughed but not altogether at what his wife said ive been having a little talk with papa triscoe in the smokingroom  you smell like it said his wife not to seem too eager well  well papa triscoe seems to be in a pout he doesnt think things are going as they should in america he hasnt been consulted or if he has his opinion hasnt been acted upon  i think hes horrid said mrs march who are they  i couldnt make out and i couldnt ask but ill tell you what i think  what  that theres no chance for burnamy hes taking his daughter out to marry her to a crowned head     xv  it was this afternoon that the dance took place on the south promenade everybody came and looked and the circle around the waltzers was three or four deep between the surrounding heads and shoulders the hats of the young ladies wheeling and whirling and the faces of the men who were wheeling and whirling them rose and sank with the rhythm of their steps the space allotted to the dancing was walled to seaward with canvas and was prettily treated with german and american flags it was hard to go wrong with flags miss triscoe said securing herself under mrs marchs wing  where they stood they could see burnamys face flashing and flushing in the dance at the end of the first piece he came to them and remained talking and laughing till the music began again  dont you want to try it he asked abruptly of miss triscoe  isnt it ratherpublic she asked back  mrs march could feel the hand which the girl had put through her arm thrill with temptation but burnamy could not  perhaps it is rather obvious he said and he made a long glide over the deck to the feet of the pivotal girl anticipating another young man who was rapidly advancing from the opposite quarter the next moment her hat and his face showed themselves in the necessary proximity to each other within the circle  how well she dances said miss triscoe  do you think so she looks as if she had been wound up and set going  shes very graceful the girl persisted  the day ended with an entertainment in the saloon for one of the marine charities which address themselves to the hearts and pockets of passengers on all steamers there were recitations in english and german and songs from several people who had kindly consented and ever more piano performance most of those who took part were of the race gifted in art and finance its children excelled in the music and its fathers counted the gatemoney during the last half of the programme with an audible clinking of the silver on the table before them  miss triscoe was with her father and mrs march was herself chaperoned by mr burnamy her husband had refused to come to the entertainment she hoped to leave burnamy and miss triscoe together before the evening ended but miss triscoe merely stopped with her father in quitting the saloon to laugh at some features of the entertainment as people who take no part in such things do burnamy stood up to exchange some unimpassioned words with her and then they said goodnight  the next morning at five oclock the norumbia came to anchor in the pretty harbor of plymouth in the cool early light the town lay distinct along the shore quaint with its small english houses and stately with come public edifices of unknown function on the uplands a countryseat of aristocratic aspect showed itself on one of the heights on another the tower of a country church peered over the treetops there were lines of fortifications as peaceful at their distance as the stone walls dividing the green fields the very ironclads in the harbor close at hand contributed to the amiable gayety of the scene under the pale blue english sky already broken with clouds from which the flush of the sunrise had not quite faded the breath of the land came freshly out over the water one could almost smell the grass and the leaves gulls wheeled and darted over the crisp water the tones of the english voices on the tender were pleasant to the ear as it fussed and scuffled to the ships side a few score of the passengers left her with their baggage they formed picturesque groups on the tenders deck and they set out for the shore waving their hands and their handkerchiefs to the friends they left clustering along the rail of the norumbia mr and mrs leffers bade march farewell in the final fondness inspired by his having coffee with them before they left the ship they said they hated to leave  the stop had roused everybody and the breakfast tables were promptly filled except such as the passengers landing at plymouth had vacated these were stripped of their cloths and the remaining commensals placed at others the seats of the lefferses were given to marchs old ohio friend and his wife he tried to engage them in the tally which began to be general in the excitement of having touched land but they shyly held aloof  some english newspapers had come aboard from the tug and there was the usual goodnatured adjustment of the american selfsatisfaction among those who had seen them to the eversurprising fact that our continent is apparently of no interest to europe there were some meagre new york stockmarket quotations in the papers a paragraph in fine print announced the lynching of a negro in alabama another recorded a coalmining strike in pennsylvania  i always have to get used to it over again said kenby this is the twentieth time i have been across and im just as much astonished as i was the first to find out that they dont want to know anything about us here  oh said march curiosity and the weather both come from the west san francisco wants to know about denver denver about chicago chicago about new york and new york about london but curiosity never travels the other way any more than a hot wave or a cold wave  ah but london doesnt care a rap about vienna said kenby  well some pressures give out before they reach the coast on our own side it isnt an infallible analogy  triscoe was fiercely chewing a morsel as if in haste to take part in the discussion he gulped it and broke out why should they care about us anyway  march lightly ventured oh men and brothers you know  that isnt sufficient ground the chinese are men and brothers so are the southamericans and centralafricans and hawaiians but were not impatient for the latest news about them its civilization that interests civilization  i hope that fact doesnt leave us out in the cold with the barbarians burnamy put in with a smile  do you think we are civilized retorted the other  we have that superstition in chicago said burnamy he added still smiling about the newyorkers i mean  youre more superstitious in chicago than i supposed new york is an anarchy tempered by vigilance committees  oh i dont think you can say that kenby cheerfully protested since the reformers came in look at our streets  yes our streets are clean for the time being and when we look at them we think we have made a clean sweep in our manners and morals but how long do you think it will be before tammany will be in the saddle again  oh never in the world said the optimistic head of the table  i wish i had your faith or i should if i didnt feel that it is one of the things that help to establish tammanys with us you will see our tammany in power after the next election kenby laughed in a largehearted incredulity and his laugh was like fuel to the others flame new york is politically a mediaeval italian republic and its morally a frontier miningtown socially its he stopped as if he could not say what  i think its a place where you have a very nice time papa said his daughter and burnamy smiled with her not because he knew anything about it  her father went on as if he had not heard her its as vulgar and crude as money can make it nothing counts but money and as soon as theres enough it counts for everything in less than a year youll have tammany in power it wont be more than a year till youll have it in society  oh no oh no came from kenby he did not care much for society but he vaguely respected it as the stronghold of the proprieties and the amenities  isnt society a good place for tammany to be in asked march in the pause triscoe let follow upon kenbys laugh  theres no reason why it shouldnt be society is as bad as all the rest of it and what new york is politically morally and socially the whole country wishes to be and tries to be  there was that measure of truth in the words which silences no one could find just the terms of refutation  well said kenby at last its a good thing there are so many lines to europe weve still got the right to emigrate  yes but even there we dont escape the abuse of our infamous newspapers for exercising a mans right to live where he chooses and there is no country in europeexcept turkey or spainthat isnt a better home for an honest man than the united states  the ohioan had once before cleared his throat as if he were going to speak now he leaned far enough forward to catch triscoes eye and said slowly and distinctly i dont know just what reason you have to feel as you do about the country i feel differently about it myselfperhaps because i fought for it  at first the others were glad of this arrogance it even seemed an answer but burnamy saw miss triscoes cheek flush and then he doubted its validity  triscoe nervously crushed a biscuit in his hand as if to expend a violent impulse upon it he said coldly i was speaking from that standpoint  the ohioan shrank back in his seat and march felt sorry for him though he had put himself in the wrong his old hand trembled beside his plate and his head shook while his lips formed silent words and his shy wife was sharing his pain and shame  kenby began to talk about the stop which the norumbia was to make at cherbourg and about what hour the next day they should all be in cuxhaven miss triscoe said they had never come on the hanseatic line before and asked several questions her father did not speak again and after a little while he rose without waiting for her to make the move from table he had punctiliously deferred to her hitherto eltwin rose at the same time and march feared that he might be going to provoke another defeat in some way  eltwin lifted his voice and said trying to catch triscoes eye i think i ought to beg your pardon sir i do beg your pardon  march perceived that eltwin wished to make the offer of his reparation as distinct as his aggression had been and now he quaked for triscoe whose daughter he saw glance apprehensively at her father as she swayed aside to let the two men come together  that is all right colonel  major eltwin conscientiously interposed  major triscoe bowed and he put out his hand and grasped the hand which had been tremulously rising toward him there cant be any doubt of what we did no matter what weve got  no no said the other eagerly that was what i meant sir i dont think as you do but i believe that a man who helped to save the country has a right to think what he pleases about it  triscoe said that is all right my dear sir may i ask your regiment  the marches let the old fellows walk away together followed by the wife of the one and the daughter of the other they saw the young girl making some graceful overtures of speech to the elder woman as they went  that was rather fine my dear said mrs march  well i dont know it was a little too dramatic wasnt it it wasnt what i should have expected of real life  oh you spoil everything if thats the spirit youre going through europe in  it isnt as soon as i touch european soil i shall reform     xvi  that was not the first time general triscoe had silenced question of his opinions with the argument he had used upon eltwin though he was seldom able to use it so aptly he always found that people suffered his belief in our national degeneration much more readily when they knew that he had left a diplomatic position in europe he had gone abroad as secretary of a minor legation to come home and fight for the union some millions of other men had gone into the war from the varied motives which impelled men at that time but he was aware that he had distinction as a man of property and a man of family in doing so his family had improved as time passed and it was now so old that back of his grandfather it was lost in antiquity this ancestor had retired from the sea and become a merchant in his native rhode island port where his son established himself as a physician and married the daughter of a former slavetrader whose social position was the highest in the place triscoe liked to mention his maternal grandfather when he wished a listener to realize just how anomalous his part in a war against slavery was it heightened the effect of his pose  he fought gallantly through the war and he was brevetted brigadiergeneral at the close with this honor and with the wound which caused an almost imperceptible limp in his gait he won the heart of a rich new york girl and her father set him up in a business which was not long in going to pieces in his hands then the young couple went to live in paris where their daughter was born and where the mother died when the child was ten years old a little later his fatherinlaw died and triscoe returned to new york where he found the fortune which his daughter had inherited was much less than he somehow thought he had a right to expect  the income from her fortune was enough to live on and he did not go back to paris where in fact things were not so much to his mind under the republic as they had been under the second empire he was still willing to do something for his country however and he allowed his name to be used on a citizens ticket in his district but his provisionman was sent to congress instead then he retired to rhode island and attempted to convert his shore property into a wateringplace but after being attractively plotted and laid out with streets and sidewalks it allured no one to build on it except the birds and the chipmonks and he came back to new york where his daughter had remained in school  one of her maternal aunts made her a comingout tea after she left school and she entered upon a series of dinners dances theatre parties and receptions of all kinds but the tide of fairy gold pouring through her fingers left no engagementring on them she had no duties but she seldom got out of humor with her pleasures she had some odd tastes of her own and in a society where none but the most serious books were ever seriously mentioned she was rather fond of good ones and had romantic ideas of a life that she vaguely called bohemian her character was never tested by anything more trying than the fear that her father might take her abroad to live he had taken her abroad several times for the summer  the dreaded trial did not approach for several years after she had ceased to be a bud and then it came when her father was again willing to serve his country in diplomacy either at the hague or at brussels or even at berne reasons of political geography prevented his appointment anywhere but general triscoe having arranged his affairs for going abroad on the mission he had expected decided to go without it he was really very fit for both of the offices he had sought and so far as a man can deserve public place by public service he had deserved it his pessimism was uncommonly well grounded and if it did not go very deep it might well have reached the bottom of his nature  his daughter had begun to divine him at the early age when parents suppose themselves still to be mysteries to their children she did not think it necessary ever to explain him to others perhaps she would not have found it possible and now after she parted from mrs eltwin and went to sit down beside mrs march she did not refer to her father she said how sweet she had found the old lady from ohio and what sort of place did mrs march suppose it was where mrs eltwin lived they seemed to have everything there like any place she had wanted to ask mrs eltwin if they sat on their steps but she had not quite dared  burnamy came by slowly and at mrs marchs suggestion he took one of the chairs on her other side to help her and miss triscoe look at the channel islands and watch the approach of the steamer to cherbourg where the norumbia was to land again the young people talked across mrs march to each other and said how charming the islands were in their graygreen insubstantiality with valleys furrowing them far inward like airy clefts in low banks of clouds it seemed all the nicer not to know just which was which but when the ship drew nearer to cherbourg he suggested that they could see better by going round to the other side of the ship miss triscoe as at the other times when she had gone off with burnamy marked her allegiance to mrs march by leaving a wrap with her  every one was restless in breaking with the old life at sea there had been an equal unrest when the ship first sailed people had first come aboard in the demoralization of severing their ties with home and they shrank from forming others then the charm of the idle eventless life grew upon them and united them in a fond reluctance from the inevitable end  now that the beginning of the end had come the pangs of disintegration were felt in all the oncemorerepellant particles burnamy and miss triscoe as they hung upon the rail owned to each other that they hated to have the voyage over they had liked leaving plymouth and being at sea again they wished that they need not be reminded of another debarkation by the energy of the crane in hoisting the cherbourg baggage from the hold  they approved of the picturesqueness of three french vessels of war that passed dragging their kraken shapes low through the level water at cherbourg an emotional french tender came out to the ship very different in her clamorous voices and excited figures from the steady selfcontrol of the english tender at plymouth and they thought the french fortifications much more on show than the english had been nothing marked their youthful date so much to the marches who presently joined them as their failure to realize that in this peaceful sea the great battle between the kearsarge and the alabama was fought the elder couple tried to affect their imaginations with the fact which reanimated the spectre of a dreadful war for themselves but they had to pass on and leave the young people unmoved  mrs march wondered if they noticed the debarkation of the pivotal girl whom she saw standing on the deck of the tender with her hands at her waist and giving now this side and now that side of her face to the young men waving their hats to her from the rail of the ship burnamy was not of their number and he seemed not to know that the girl was leaving him finally to miss triscoe if miss triscoe knew it she did nothing the whole of that long last afternoon to profit by the fact burnamy spent a great part of it in the chair beside mrs march and he showed an intolerable resignation to the girls absence  yes said march taking the place burnamy left at last that terrible patience of youth  patience folly stupidity they ought to be together every instant do they suppose that life is full of such chances do they think that fate has nothing to do but  she stopped for a fit climax and he suggested hang round and wait on them  yes its their one chance in a lifetime probably  then youve quite decided that theyre in love he sank comfortably back and put up his weary legs on the chairs extension with the conviction that love had no such joy as that to offer  ive decided that theyre intensely interested in each other  then what more can we ask of them and why do you care what they do or dont do with their chance why do you wish their love well if its that is marriage such a very certain good  it isnt all that it might be but its all that there is what would our lives have been without it she retorted  oh we should have got on its such a tremendous risk that we ought to go round begging people to think twice to count a hundred or a nonillion before they fall in love to the marryingpoint i dont mind their flirting that amuses them but marrying is a different thing i doubt if papa triscoe would take kindly to the notion of a soninlaw he hadnt selected himself and his daughter doesnt strike me as a young lady who has any wisdom to throw away on a choice she has her little charm her little gift of beauty of grace of spirit and the other things that go with her age and sex but what could she do for a fellow like burnamy who has his way to make who has the ladder of fame to climb with an old mother at the bottom of it to look after you wouldnt want him to have an eye on miss triscoes money even if she had money and i doubt if she has much its all very pretty to have a girl like her fascinated with a youth of his simple traditions though burnamy isnt altogether pastoral in his ideals and he looks forward to a place in the very world she belongs to i dont think its for us to promote the affair  well perhaps youre right she sighed i will let them alone from this out thank goodness i shall not have them under my eyes very long  oh i dont think theres any harm done yet said her husband with a laugh  at dinner there seemed so little harm of the kind he meant that she suffered from an illogical disappointment the young people got through the meal with no talk that seemed inductive burnamy left the table first and miss triscoe bore his going without apparent discouragement she kept on chatting with march till his wife took him away to their chairs on deck  there were a few more ships in sight than there were in midocean but the late twilight thickened over the north sea quite like the night after they left new york except that it was colder and their hearts turned to their children who had been in abeyance for the week past with a remorseful pang well she said i wish we were going to be in new york tomorrow instead of hamburg  oh no oh no he protested not so bad as that my dear this is the last night and its hard to manage as the last night always is i suppose the last night on earth  basil she implored  well i wont then but what i want is to see a dutch lugger ive never seen a dutch lugger and  she suddenly pressed his arm and in obedience to the signal he was silent though it seemed afterwards that he ought to have gone on talking as if he did not see burnamy and miss triscoe swinging slowly by they were walking close together and she was leaning forward and looking up into his face while he talked  now mrs march whispered long after they were out of hearing let us go instantly i wouldnt for worlds have them see us here when they get found again they would feel that they had to stop and speak and that would spoil everything come     xvii  burnamy paused in a flow of autobiography and modestly waited for miss triscoes prompting he had not to wait long  and then how soon did you think of printing your things in a book  oh about as soon as they began to take with the public  how could you tell that they weretaking  they were copied into other papers and people talked about them  and that was what made mr stoller want you to be his secretary  i dont believe it was the theory in the office was that he didnt think much of them but he knows i can write shorthand and put things into shape  what things  ohideas he has a notion of trying to come forward in politics he owns shares in everything but the united states senategas electricity railroads aldermen newspapersand now he would like some senate thats what i think  she did not quite understand and she was far from knowing that this cynic humor expressed a deadlier pessimism than her fathers fiercest accusals of the country how fascinating it is she said innocently  and i suppose they all envy your coming out  in the office  yes i should envy themstaying  burnamy laughed i dont believe they envy me it wont be all roses for methey know that but they know that i can take care of myself if it isnt he remembered something one of his friends in the office had said of the painful surprise the bird of prey would feel if he ever tried his beak on him in the belief that he was soft  she abruptly left the mere personal question and which would you rather write poems or those kind of sketches  i dont know said burnamy willing to talk of himself on any terms i suppose that prose is the thing for our time rather more but there are things you cant say in prose i used to write a great deal of verse in college but i didnt have much luck with editors till mr march took this little piece for every other week  little i thought it was a long poem  burnamy laughed at the notion its only eight lines  oh said the girl what is it about  he yielded to the temptation with a weakness which he found incredible in a person of his make i can repeat it if you wont give me away to mrs march  oh no indeed he said the lines over to her very simply and well they are beautifulbeautiful  do you think so he gasped in his joy at her praise  yes lovely do you know you are the first literary manthe only literary mani ever talked with they must go outsomewhere papa must meet them at his clubs but i never do and so im making the most of you  you cant make too much of me miss triscoe said burnamy  she would not mind his mocking that day you spoke about the maiden knight dont you know i had never heard any talk about books in that way i didnt know you were an author then  well im not much of an author now he said cynically to retrieve his folly in repeating his poem to her  oh that will do for you to say but i know what mrs march thinks  he wished very much to know what mrs march thought too every other week was such a very good place that he could not conscientiously neglect any means of having his work favorably considered there if mrs marchs interest in it would act upon her husband ought not he to know just how much she thought of him as a writer did she like the poem  miss triscoe could not recall that mrs march had said anything about the poem but she launched herself upon the general current of mrs marchs liking for burnamy but it wouldnt do to tell you all she said this was not what he hoped but he was richly content when she returned to his personal history and you didnt know any one when you went up to chicago from  tippecanoe not exactly that i wasnt acquainted with any one in the office but they had printed somethings of mine and they were willing to let me try my hand that was all i could ask  of course you knew you could do the rest well it is like a romance a woman couldnt have such an adventure as that sighed the girl  but women do burnamy retorted there is a girl writing on the paper nowshes going to do the literary notices while im gonewho came to chicago from ann arbor with no more chance than i had and whos made her way singlehanded from interviewing up  oh said miss triscoe with a distinct drop in her enthusiasm is she nice  shes mighty clever and shes nice enough too though the kind of journalism that women do isnt the most dignified and shes one of the best girls i know with lots of sense  it must be very interesting said miss triscoe with little interest in the way she said it i suppose youre quite a little community by yourselves  on the paper  yes  well some of us know one another in the office but most of us dont theres quite a regiment of people on a big paper if youd like to come out burnamy ventured perhaps you could get the womans page to do  whats that  oh fashion and personal gossip about society leaders and recipes for dishes and diseases and correspondence on points of etiquette  he expected her to shudder at the notion but she merely asked do women write it  he laughed reminiscently well not always we had one man who used to do it beautifullywhen he was sober the department hasnt had any permanent head since  he was sorry he had said this but it did not seem to shock her and no doubt she had not taken it in fully she abruptly left the subject do you know what time we really get in tomorrow  about one i believetheres a consensus of stewards to that effect anyway after a pause he asked are you likely to be in carlsbad  we are going to dresden first i believe then we may go on down to vienna but nothing is settled yet  are you going direct to dresden  i dont know we may stay in hamburg a day or two  ive got to go straight to carlsbad theres a sleepingcar that will get me there by morning mr stoller likes zeal but i hope youll let me be of use to you any way i can before we part tomorrow  youre very kind youve been very good alreadyto papa he protested that he had not been at all good but hes used to taking care of himself on the other side oh its this side now  so it is how strange that seems its actually europe but as long as were at sea we cant realize it dont you hate to have experiences slip through your fingers  i dont know a girl doesnt have many experiences of her own theyre always other peoples  this affected burnamy as so profound that he did not question its truth he only suggested well sometimes they make other people have the experiences  whether miss triscoe decided that this was too intimate or not she left the question do you understand german  a little i studied it at college and ive cultivated a sort of beergarden german in chicago i can ask for things  i cant except in french and thats worse than english in germany i hear  then you must let me be your interpreter up to the last moment will you  she did not answer it must be rather late isnt it she asked he let her see his watch and she said yes its very late and led the way within i must look after my packing papas always so prompt and i must justify myself for making him let me give up my maid when we left home we expect to get one in dresden goodnight  burnamy looked after her drifting down their corridor and wondered whether it would have been a fit return for her expression of a sense of novelty in him as a literary man if he had told her that she was the first young lady he had known who had a maid the fact awed him miss triscoe herself did not awe him so much     xviii  the next morning was merely a transitional period full of turmoil and disorder between the broken life of the sea and the untried life of the shore no one attempted to resume the routine of the voyage people went and came between their rooms and the saloons and the decks and were no longer careful to take their own steamer chairs when they sat down for a moment  in the cabins the berths were not made up and those who remained below had to sit on their hard edges or on the sofas which were cumbered with handbags and rolls of shawls at an early hour after breakfast the bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile them in the corridors the servants all became more caressingly attentive and people who had left off settling the amount of the fees they were going to give anxiously conferred together the question whether you ought ever to give the head steward anything pressed crucially at the early lunch and kenby brought only a partial relief by saying that he always regarded the head steward as an officer of the ship march made the experiment of offering him six marks and the head steward took them quite as if he were not an officer of the ship he also collected a handsome fee for the music which is the tax levied on all german ships beyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations  after lunch the flat shore at cuxhaven was so near that the summer cottages of the little wateringplace showed through the warm drizzle much like the summer cottages of our own shore and if it had not been for the strange low sky the americans might easily have fancied themselves at home again  every one waited on foot while the tender came out into the stream where the norumbia had dropped anchor people who had brought their handbaggage with them from their rooms looked so much safer with it that people who had left theirs to their stewards had to go back and pledge them afresh not to forget it the tender came alongside and the transfer of the heavy trunks began but it seemed such an endless work that every one sat down in some others chair at last the trunks were all on the tender and the bareheaded stewards began to run down the gangways with the handbaggage is this hoboken march murmured in his wifes ear with a bewildered sense of something in the scene like the reversed action of the kinematograph  on the deck of the tender there was a brief moment of reunion among the companions of the voyage the more intimate for their being crowded together under cover from the drizzle which now turned into a dashing rain burnamys smile appeared and then mrs march recognized miss triscoe and her father in their travel dress they were not far from burnamys smile but he seemed rather to have charge of the eltwins whom he was helping look after their bags and bundles rose adding was talking with kenby and apparently asking his opinion of something mrs adding sat near them tranquilly enjoying her son  mrs march made her husband identify their baggage large and small and after he had satisfied her he furtively satisfied himself by a fresh count that it was all there but he need not have taken the trouble their long calm bedroomsteward was keeping guard over it his eyes expressed a contemptuous pity for their anxiety whose like he must have been very tired of he brought their handbags into the customsroom at the station where they landed and there took a last leave and a last fee with unexpected cordiality  again their companionship suffered eclipse in the distraction which the customs inspectors of all countries bring to travellers and again they were united during the long delay in the waitingroom which was also the restaurant it was full of strange noises and figures and odorsthe shuffling of feet the clash of crockery the explosion of nervous german voices mixed with the smell of beer and ham and the smoke of cigars through it all pierced the wail of a postman standing at the door with a letter in his hand and calling out at regular intervals krahnay krahnay when march could bear it no longer he went up to him and shouted crane crane and the man bowed gratefully and began to cry kren kren but whether mr crane got his letter or not he never knew  people were swarming at the window of the telegraphoffice and sending home cablegrams to announce their safe arrival march could not forbear cabling to his son though he felt it absurd there was a great deal of talking but no laughing except among the americans and the girls behind the bar who tried to understand what they wanted and then served them with what they chose for them otherwise the germans though voluble were unsmiling and here on the threshold of their empire the travellers had their first hint of the anxious mood which seems habitual with these amiable people  mrs adding came screaming with glee to march where he sat with his wife and leaned over her son to ask do you know what lesemajesty is rose is afraid ive committed it  no i dont said march but its the unpardonable sin what have you been doing  i asked the official at the door when our train would start and when he said at half past three i said how tiresome rose says the railroads belong to the state here and that if i find fault with the timetable its constructive censure of the emperor and thats lesemajesty she gave way to her mirth while the boy studied marchs face with an appealing smile  well i dont think youll be arrested this time mrs adding but i hope it will be a warning to mrs march shes been complaining of the coffee  indeed i shall say what i like said mrs march im an american  well youll find youre a german if you like to say anything disagreeable about the coffee in the restaurant of the emperors railroad station the first thing you know i shall be given three months on your account  mrs adding asked then they wont punish ladies there rose im safe you see and youre still a minor though you are so wise for your years  she went back to her table where kenby came and sat down by her  i dont know that i quite like her playing on that sensitive child said mrs march and youve joined with her in her joking go and speak to him  the boy was slowly following his mother with his head fallen march overtook him and he started nervously at the touch of a hand on his shoulder and then looked gratefully up into the mans face march tried to tell him what the crime of lesemajesty was and he said oh yes i understood that but i got to thinking and i dont want my mother to take any risks  i dont believe she will really rose but ill speak to her and tell her she cant be too cautious  not now please the boy entreated  well ill find another chance march assented he looked round and caught a smiling nod from burnamy who was still with the eltwins the triscoes were at a table by themselves miss triseoe nodded too but her father appeared not to see march its all right with rose he said when he sat down again by his wife but i guess its all over with burnamy and he told her what he had seen do you think it came to any displeasure between them last night do you suppose he offered himself and she  what nonsense said mrs march but she was not at peace its her father whos keeping her away from him  i shouldnt mind that hes keeping her away from us too but at that moment miss triscoe as if she had followed his return from afar came over to speak to his wife she said they were going on to dresden that evening and she was afraid they might have no chance to see each other on the train or in hamburg march at this advance went to speak with her father he found him no more reconciled to europe than america  theyre goths he said of the germans i could hardly get that stupid brute in the telegraphoffice to take my despatch  on his way back to his wife march met miss triscoe he was not altogether surprised to meet burnamy with her now the young fellow asked if he could be of any use to him and then he said he would look him up in the train he seemed in a hurry but when he walked away with miss triscoe he did not seem in a hurry  march remarked upon the change to his wife and she sighed yes you can see that as far as theyre concerned  its a great pity that there should be parents to complicate these affairs he said how simple it would be if there were no parties to them but the lovers but nature is always insisting upon fathers and mothers and families on both sides     xix  the long train which they took at last was for the norumbias people alone and it was of several transitional and tentative types of cars some were still the old coachbody carriages but most were of a strange corridor arrangement with the aide at the aide and the seats crossing from it with compartments sometimes rising to the roof and sometimes rising halfway no two cars seemed quite alike but all were very comfortable and when the train began to run out through the little seaside town into the country the old delight of foreign travel began most of the houses were little and low and gray with ivy or flowering vines covering their walls to their browntiled roofs there was here and there a touch of northern gothic in the architecture but usually where it was pretentious it was in the mansard taste which was so bad with us a generation ago and is still very bad in cuxhaven  the fields flat and wide were dotted with familiar shapes of holstein cattle herded by little girls with their hair in yellow pigtails the gray stormy sky hung low and broke in fitful rains but perhaps for the inclement season of midsummer it was not very cold flowers were blooming along the embankments and in the rank green fields with a dogged energy in the various distances were groups of trees embowering cottages and even villages and always along the ditches and watercourses were double lines of low willows at the first stop the train made the passengers flocked to the refreshmentbooth prettily arranged beside the station where the abundance of the cherries and strawberries gave proof that vegetation was in other respects superior to the elements but it was not of the profusion of the sausages and the ham which openly in slices or covertly in sandwiches claimed its primacy in the german affections every form of this was flanked by tall glasses of beer  a number of the natives stood by and stared unsmiling at the train which had broken out in a rash of little american flags at every window this boyish display which must have made the americans themselves laugh if their sense of humor had not been lost in their impassioned patriotism was the last expression of unity among the norumbias passengers and they met no more in their seasolidarity of their table acquaintance the marches saw no one except burnamy who came through the train looking for them he said he was in one of the rear cars with the eltwins and was going to carlsbad with them in the sleepingcar train leaving hamburg at seven he owned to having seen the triscoes since they had left cuxhaven mrs march would not suffer herself to ask him whether they were in the same carriage with the eltwins he had got a letter from mr stoller at cuxhaven and he begged the marches to let him engage rooms for them at the hotel where he was going to stay with him  after they reached hamburg they had flying glimpses of him and of others in the odious rivalry to get their baggage examined first which seized upon all and in which they no longer knew one another but selfishly struggled for the goodwill of porters and inspectors there was really no such haste but none could govern themselves against the general frenzy with the porter he secured march conspired and perspired to win the attention of a cold but not unkindly inspector the officer opened one trunk and after a glance at it marked all as passed and then there ensued a heroic strife with the porter as to the pieces which were to go to the berlin station for their journey next day and the pieces which were to go to the hotel overnight at last the division was made the marches got into a cab of the first class and the porter crimson and steaming at every pore from the physical and intellectual strain went back into the station  they had got the number of their cab from the policeman who stands at the door of all large german stations and supplies the traveller with a metallic check for the sort of vehicle he demands they were not proud but it seemed best not to risk a secondclass cab in a strange city and when their firstclass cab came creaking and limping out of the rank they saw how wise they had been if one of the second class could have been worse  as they rattled away from the station they saw yet another kind of turnout which they were destined to see more and more in the german lands it was that team of a woman harnessed with a dog to a cart which the women of no other country can see without a sense of personal insult march tried to take the humorous view and complained that they had not been offered the choice of such an equipage by the policeman but his wife would not be amused she said that no country which suffered such a thing could be truly civilized though he made her observe that no city in the world except boston or brooklyn was probably so thoroughly trolleyed as hamburg the hum of the electric car was everywhere and everywhere the shriek of the wires overhead batlike flights of connecting plates traversed all the perspectives through which they drove to the pleasant little hotel they had chosen     xx  on one hand their windows looked toward a basin of the elbe where stately white swans were sailing and on the other to the new rathhaus over the trees that deeply shaded the perennial mud of a cold dim public garden where waterproof old women and impervious nurses sat and children played in the long twilight of the sour rainsoaked summer of the fatherland it was all picturesque and withindoors there was the novelty of the meagre carpets and stalwart furniture of the germans and their beds which after so many ages of anglosaxon satire remain immutably preposterous they are apparently imagined for the stature of sleepers who have shortened as they broadened their pillows are triangularly shaped to bring the chin tight upon the breast under the bloated feather bulk which is meant for covering and which rises over the sleeper from a thick substratum of cotton coverlet neatly buttoned into the upper sheet with the effect of a portly waistcoat  the hotel was illumined by the kindly splendor of the uniformed portier who had met the travellers at the door like a glowing vision of the past and a friendly air diffused itself through the whole house at the dinner which if not so cheap as they had somehow hoped was by no means bad they took counsel with the englishspeaking waiter as to what entertainment hamburg could offer for the evening and by the time they had drunk their coffee they had courage for the circus renz which seemed to be all there was  the conductor of the trolleycar which they hailed at the street corner stopped it and got off the platform and stood in the street until they were safely aboard without telling them to step lively or pulling them up the steps or knuckling them in the back to make them move forward he let them get fairly seated before he started the car and so lost the fun of seeing them lurch and stagger violently and wildly clutch each other for support the germans have so little sense of humor that probably no one in the car would have been amused to see the strangers flung upon the floor no one apparently found it droll that the conductor should touch his cap to them when he asked for their fare no one smiled at their efforts to make him understand where they wished to go and he did not wink at the other passengers in trying to find out whenever the car stopped he descended first and did not remount till the dismounting passenger had taken time to get well away from it when the marches got into the wrong car in coming home and were carried beyond their street the conductor would not take their fare  the kindly civility which environed them went far to alleviate the inclemency of the climate it began to rain as soon as they left the shelter of the car but a citizen of whom they asked the nearest way to the circus renz was so anxious to have them go aright that they did not mind the wet and the thought of his goodness embittered marchs selfreproach for undertipping the sort of gorgeous heyduk with a staff like a drummajors who left his place at the circus door to get their tickets he brought them back with a magnificent bow and was then as visibly disappointed with the share of the change returned to him as a child would have been  they went to their places with the sting of his disappointment rankling in their hearts one ought always to overpay them march sighed and i will do it from this time forth we shall not be much the poorer for it that heyduk is not going to get off with less than a mark when we come out as an earnest of his good faith he gave the old man who showed them to their box a tip that made him bow double and he bought every conceivable libretto and playbill offered him at prices fixed by his remorse  one ought to do it he said we are of the quality of good geniuses to these poor souls we are fortune in disguise we are money found in the road it is an accursed system but they are more its victims than we his wife quite agreed with him and with the same good conscience between them they gave themselves up to the pure joy which the circus of all modern entertainments seems alone to inspire the house was full from floor to roof when they came ins and every one was intent upon the two spanish clowns luilui and soltamontes whose drolleries spoke the universal language of circus humor and needed no translation into either german or english they had missed by an event or two the more patriotic attraction of miss darlings the american star as she was billed in english but they were in time for one of those equestrian performances which leave the spectator almost exanimate from their prolixity and the pantomimic piece which closed the evening  this was not given until nearly the whole house had gone out and stayed itself with beer and cheese and ham and sausage in the restaurant which purveys these light refreshments in the summer theatres all over germany when the people came back gorged to the throat they sat down in the right mood to enjoy the allegory of the enchanted mountains fantasy the mountain episodes the highinteresting sledgescourses on the steep acclivities the amazinguprush of the thence plungingfour trains which arrive with lightningsswiftness at the top of the over40feethigh mountainthe highest triumph of the todays circusart the sledgejourney in the wizardmountain and the fairy ballet in the realm of the ghostprince with gold and silver jewel bloomghosts gnomes gnomesses and dwarfs in nevertillnowseen splendor of costume the marches were happy in this allegory and happier in the ballet which is everywhere delightfully innocent and which here appealed with the large flat feet and the plain good faces of the coryphees to all that was simplest and sweetest in their natures they could not have resisted if they had wished that environment of goodwill and if it had not been for the disappointed heyduk they would have got home from their evening at the circus renz without a pang  they looked for him everywhere when they came out but he had vanished and they were left with a regret which if unavailing was not too poignant in spite of it they had still an exhilaration in their release from the companionship of their fellowvoyagers which they analyzed as the psychical revulsion from the strain of too great interest in them mrs march declared that for the present at least she wanted europe quite to themselves and she said that not even for the pleasure of seeing burnamy and miss triscoe come into their box together world she have suffered an american trespass upon their exclusive possession of the circus renz  in the audience she had seen german officers for the first time in hamburg and she meant if unremitting question could bring out the truth to know why she had not met any others she had read much of the prevalence and prepotence of the german officers who would try to push her off the sidewalk till they realized that she was an american woman and would then submit to her inflexible purpose of holding it but she had been some seven or eight hours in hamburg and nothing of the kind had happened to her perhaps because she had hardly yet walked a block in the city streets but perhaps also because there seemed to be very few officers or military of any kind in hamburg     xxi  their absence was plausibly explained the next morning by the young german friend who came in to see the marches at breakfast he said hamburg had been so long a free republic that the presence of a large imperial garrison was distasteful to the people and as a matter of fact there were very few soldiers quartered there whether the authorities chose to indulge the popular grudge or not he was himself in a joyful flutter of spirits for he had just the day before got his release from military service he gave them a notion of what the rapture of a man reprieved from death might be and he was as radiantly happy in the ill health which had got him his release as if it had been the greatest blessing of heaven he bubbled over with smiling regrets that he should be leaving his home for the first stage of the journey which he was to take in search of strength just as they had come and he pressed them to say if there were not something that he could do for them  yes said mrs march with a promptness surprising to her husband who could think of nothing tell us where heinrich heine lived when he was in hamburg my husband has always had a great passion for him and wants to look him up everywhere  march had forgotten that heine ever lived in hamburg and the young man had apparently never known it his face fell he wished to make mrs march believe that it was only heines uncle who had lived there but she was firm and when he had asked among the hotel people he came back gladly owning that he was wrong and that the poet used to live in konigstrasse which was very near by and where they could easily know the house by his bust set in its front the portier and the head waiter shared his ecstasy in so easily obliging the friendly american pair and joined him in minutely instructing the driver when they shut them into their carriage  they did not know that his was almost the only laughing face they should see in the serious german empire just as they did not know that it rained there every day as they drove off in the gray drizzle with the unfounded hope that sooner or later the weather would be fine they bade their driver be very slow in taking them through konigstrasse so that he should by no means miss heines dwelling and he duly stopped in front of a house bearing the promised bust they dismounted in order to revere it more at their ease but the bust proved by an irony bitterer than the sick heartbreaking brilliant jew could have imagined in his cruelest moment to be that of the german milton the respectable poet klopstock whom heine abhorred and mocked so pitilessly  in fact it was here that the good muchforgotten klopstock dwelt when he came home to live with a comfortable pension from the danish government and the pilgrims to the mistaken shrine went asking about among the neighbors in konigstrasse for some manner of house where heine might have lived they would have been willing to accept a flat or any sort of twopair back the neighbors were somewhat moved by the anxiety of the strangers but they were not so much moved as neighbors in italy would have been there was no eager and smiling sympathy in the little crowd that gathered to see what was going on they were patient of question and kind in their helpless response but they were not gay to a man they had not heard of heine even the owner of a sausage and bloodpudding shop across the way had not heard of him the clerk of a stationerandbooksellers next to the butchers had heard of him but he had never heard that he lived in konigstrasse he never had heard where he lived in hamburg  the pilgrims to the fraudulent shrine got back into their carriage and drove sadly away instructing their driver with the rigidity which their limited german favored not to let any house with a bust in its front escape him he promised and took his course out through konigstrasse and suddenly they found themselves in a world of such eld and quaintness that they forgot heine as completely as any of his countrymen had done they were in steep and narrow streets that crooked and turned with no apparent purpose of leading anywhere among houses that looked down upon them with an astonished stare from the leadensashed windows of their timberlaced gables the facades with their lattices stretching in bands quite across them and with their steep roofs climbing high in successions of blinking dormers were more richly mediaeval than anything the travellers had ever dreamt of before and they feasted themselves upon the unimagined picturesqueness with a leisurely minuteness which brought responsive gazers everywhere to the windows windows were set ajar shop doors were darkened by curious figures from within and the traffic of the tortuous alleys was interrupted by their progress they could not have said which delighted them morethe houses in the immediate foreground or the sharp high gables in the perspectives and the background but all were like the painted scenes of the stage and they had a pleasant difficulty in realizing that they were not persons in some romantic drama  the illusion remained with them and qualified the impression which hamburg made by her muchtrolleyed bostonian effect by the decorous activity and parisian architecture of her business streets by the turmoil of her quays and the innumerable masts and chimneys of her shipping at the heart of all was that quaintness that picturesqueness of the past which embodied the spirit of the old hanseatic city and seemed the expression of the homeside of her history the sense of this gained strength from such slight study of her annals as they afterwards made and assisted the digestion of some morsels of tough statistics in the shadow of those gothic houses the fact that hamburg was one of the greatest coffee marts and money marts of the world had a romantic glamour and the fact that in the four years from 1870 till 1874 a quarter of a million emigrants sailed on her ships for the united states seemed to stretch a nerve of kindred feeling from those mediaeval streets through the whole shabby length of third avenue  it was perhaps in this glamour or this feeling of commercial solidarity that march went to have a look at the hamburg bourse in the beautiful new rathhaus it was not undergoing repairs it was too new for that but it was in construction and so it fulfilled the function of a public edifice in withholding its entire interest from the stranger he could not get into the senate chamber but the bourse was free to him and when he stepped within it rose at him with a roar of voices and of feet like the new york stock exchange the spectacle was not so frantic people were not shaking their fists or fingers in each others noses but they were all wild in the tamer german way and he was glad to mount from the bourse to the poor little art gallery upstairs and to shut out its clamor he was not so glad when he looked round on these his first examples of modern german art the custodian led him gently about and said which things were for sale and it made his heart ache to see how bad they were and to think that bad as they were he could not buy any of them     xxii  in the start from cuxhaven the passengers had the irresponsible ease of people ticketed through and the steamship company had still the charge of their baggage but when the marches left hamburg for leipsic where they had decided to break the long pull to carlsbad all the anxieties of european travel dimly remembered from former european days offered themselves for recognition a porter vanished with their handbaggage before they could note any trait in him for identification other porters made away with their trunks and the interpreter who helped march buy his tickets with a vocabulary of strictly railroad english had to help him find the pieces in the baggageroom curiously estranged in a mountain of alien boxes one official weighed them another obliged him to pay as much in freight as for a third passenger and gave him an illegible scrap of paper which recorded their number and destination the interpreter and the porters took their fees with a professional effect of dissatisfaction and he went to wait with his wife amidst the smoking and eating and drinking in the restaurant they burst through with the rest when the doors were opened to the train and followed a glimpse of the porter with their handbags as he ran down the platform still bent upon escaping them and brought him to bay at last in a car where he had got very good seats for them and sank into their places hot and humiliated by their needless tumult  as they cooled they recovered their selfrespect and renewed a youthful joy in some of the longestranged facts the road was rougher than the roads at home but for much less money they had the comfort without the unavailing splendor of a pullman in their secondclass carriage mrs march had expected to be used with the severity on the imperial railroads which she had failed to experience from the military on the hamburg sidewalks but nothing could be kindlier than the whole management toward her her fellowtravellers were not lavish of their rights as americans are what they got that they kept and in the run from hamburg to leipsic she had several occasions to observe that no german however young or robust dreams of offering a better place if he has one to a lady in grace to her sex or age if they got into a carriage too late to secure a forwardlooking seat she rode backward to the end of that stage but if they appealed to their fellowtravellers for information about changes or stops or any of the little facts that they wished to make sure of they were enlightened past possibility of error at the point where they might have gone wrong the explanations were renewed with a thoughtfulness which showed that their anxieties had not been forgotten she said she could not see how any people could be both so selfish and so sweet and her husband seized the advantage of saying something offensive  you women are so pampered in america that you are astonished when you are treated in europe like the mere human beings you are  she answered with unexpected reasonableness  yes theres something in that but when the germans have taught us how despicable we are as women why do they treat us so well as human beings  this was at ten oclock after she had ridden backward a long way and at last within an hour of leipsic had got a seat confronting him the darkness had now hidden the landscape but the impression of its few simple elements lingered pleasantly in their sense long levels densely wooded with the precise severely disciplined german forests and checkered with fields of grain and grass soaking under the thin rain that from time to time varied the thin sunshine  the villages and peasants cottages were notably few but there was here and there a classic or a gothic villa which at one point an englishspeaking young lady turned from her tauchnitz novel to explain as the seat of some country gentleman the land was in large holdings and this accounted for the sparsity of villages and cottages  she then said that she was a german teacher of english in hamburg and was going home to potsdam for a visit she seemed like a german girl out of the initials and in return for this favor mrs march tried to invest herself with some romantic interest as an american she failed to move the girls fancy even after she had bestowed on her an immense bunch of roses which the young german friend in hamburg had sent to them just before they left their hotel she failed later on the same ground with the pleasantlooking english woman who got into their carriage at magdeburg and talked over the london illustrated news with an englishspeaking fraulein in her company she readily accepted the fact of mrs marchs nationality but found nothing wonderful in it apparently and when she left the train she left mrs march to recall with fond regret the old days in italy when she first came abroad and could make a whole carriage full of italians break into ohs and ahs by saying that she was an american and telling how far she had come across the sea  yes march assented but that was a great while ago and americans were much rarer than they are now in europe the italians are so much more sympathetic than the germans and english and they saw that you wanted to impress them heaven knows how little they cared and then you were a very pretty young girl in those days or at least i thought so  yes she sighed and now im a plain old woman  oh not quite so bad as that  yes i am do you think they would have cared more if it had been miss triscoe  not so much as if it had been the pivotal girl they would have found her much more their ideal of the american woman and even she would have had to have been here thirty years ago  she laughed a little ruefully well at any rate i should like to know how miss triscoe would have affected them  i should much rather know what sort of life that english woman is living here with her german husband i fancied she had married rank i could imagine how dull it must be in her little saxon town from the way she clung to her illustrated news and explained the pictures of the royalties to her friend there is romance for you  they arrived at leipsic fresh and cheerful after their five hours journey and as in a spell of their travelled youth they drove up through the academic old town asleep under its dimly clouded sky and silent except for the trolleycars that prowled its streets with their feline purr and broke at times into a long shrill caterwaul a sense of the past imparted itself to the wellknown encounter with the portier and the head waiter at the hotel door to the payment of the driver to the endeavor of the secretary to have them take the most expensive rooms in the house and to his compromise upon the next most where they found themselves in great comfort with electric lights and bells and a quick succession of feetaking callboys in dresscoats too large for them the spell was deepened by the fact which march kept at the bottom of his consciousness for the present that one of their trunks was missing this linked him more closely to the travel of other days and he spent the next forenoon in a telegraphic search for the estray with emotions tinged by the melancholy of recollection but in the security that since it was somewhere in the keeping of the state railway it would be finally restored to him     xxiii  their windows as they saw in the morning looked into a large square of aristocratic physiognomy and of a parisian effect in architecture which afterwards proved characteristic of the town if not quite so characteristic as to justify the passion of leipsic for calling itself little paris the prevailing tone was of a gray tending to the pale yellow of the tauchnitz editions with which the place is more familiarly associated in the minds of englishspeaking travellers it was rather more sombre than it might have been if the weather had been fair but a quiet rain was falling dreamily that morning and the square was provided with a fountain which continued to dribble in the rare moments when the rain forgot itself the place was better shaded than need be in that sunless land by the german elms that look like ours and it was sufficiently stocked with german statues that look like no others it had a monument too of the sort with which german art has everywhere disfigured the kindly fatherland since the war with france these monuments though they are so very ugly have a sort of pathos as records of the only war in which germany unaided has triumphed against a foreign foe but they are as tiresome as all such memorial pomps must be it is not for the victories of a people that any other people can care the wars come and go in blood and tears but whether they are bad wars or what are comically called good wars they are of one effect in death and sorrow and their fame is an offence to all men not concerned in them till time has softened it to a memory    of old unhappy faroff things    and battles long ago  it was for some such reason that while the marches turned with instant satiety from the swelling and strutting sculpture which celebrated the leipsic heroes of the war of 1870 they had heart for those of the war of 1813 and after their noonday dinner they drove willingly in a pause of the rain out between yellowing harvests of wheat and oats to the field where napoleon was beaten by the russians austrians and prussians it always took at least three nations to beat the little wretch fourscore years before yet even there mrs march was really more concerned for the sparsity of cornflowers in the grain which in their modern character of kaiserblumen she found strangely absent from their loyal function and march was more taken with the notion of the little gardens which his guide told him the citizens could have in the suburbs of leipsic and enjoy at any trolleycar distance from their homes he saw certain of these gardens in groups divided by low unenvious fences and sometimes furnished with summerhouses where the tenant could take his pleasure in the evening air with his family the guide said he had such a garden himself at a rent of seven dollars a year where he raised vegetables and flowers and spent his peaceful leisure and march fancied that on the simple domestic side of their life which this fact gave him a glimpse of the germans were much more engaging than in their character of victors over either the first or the third napoleon but probably they would not have agreed with him and probably nations will go on making themselves cruel and tiresome till humanity at last prevails over nationality  he could have put the case to the guide himself but though the guide was imaginably liberated to a cosmopolitan conception of things by three years service as waiter in english hotels where he learned the language he might not have risen to this he would have tried for he was a willing and kindly soul though he was not a valet de place by profession there seemed in fact but one of that useless and amusing race which is everywhere falling into decay through the rivalry of the perfected baedeker left in leipsic and this one was engaged so that the marches had to devolve upon their exwaiter who was now the keeper of a small restaurant he gladly abandoned his business to the care of his wife in order to drive handsomely about in his best clothes with strangers who did not exact too much knowledge from him in his zeal to do something he possessed himself of marchs overcoat when they dismounted at their first gallery and let fall from its pocket his prophylactic flask of brandy which broke with a loud crash on the marble floor in the presence of several masterpieces and perfumed the whole place the masterpieces were some excellent works of luke kranach who seemed the only german painter worth looking at when there were any dutch or italian pictures near but the travellers forgot the name and nature of the kranachs and remembered afterwards only the shattered fragments of the brandyflask just how they looked on the floor and the fumes how they smelt that rose from the ruin  it might have been a warning protest of the veracities against what they were doing but the madness of sightseeing which spoils travel was on them and they delivered themselves up to it as they used in their ignorant youth though now they knew its futility so well they spared themselves nothing that they had time for that day and they felt falsely guilty for their omissions as if they really had been duties to art and history which must be discharged like obligations to ones maker and ones neighbor  they had a touch of genuine joy in the presence of the beautiful old rathhaus and they were sensible of something like a genuine emotion in passing the famous and venerable university the very air of leipsic is redolent of printing and publication which appealed to march in his quality of editor and they could not fail of an impression of the quiet beauty of the town with its regular streets of houses breaking into suburban villas of an american sort and intersected with many canals which in the intervals of the rain were eagerly navigated by pleasure boats and contributed to the general picturesqueness by their frequent bridges even during the drizzle there seemed to be no churches to do and as it was a sunday the galleries were so early closed against them that they were making a virtue as well as a pleasure of the famous scene of napoleons first great defeat  by a concert between their guide and driver their carriage drew up at the little inn by the roadside which is also a museum stocked with relics from the battlefield and with objects of interest relating to it old muskets old swords old shoes and old coats trumpets drums guncarriages wheels helmets cannon balls grapeshot and all the murderous rubbish which battles come to at last with proclamations autographs caricatures and likenesses of napoleon and effigies of all the other generals engaged and miniatures and jewels of their womenkind filled room after room through which their owner vaunted his way with a loud pounding voice and a bad breath when he wished them to enjoy some gross british satire or clumsy german gibe at bonapartes expense and put his face close to begin the laugh he was something so terrible that march left the place with a profound if not a reasoned regret that the french had not won the battle of leipsic he walked away musing pensively upon the travellers inadequacy to the ethics of history when a breath could so sway him against his convictions but even after he had cleansed his lungs with some deep respirations he found himself still a bonapartist in the presence of that stone on the rising ground where napoleon sat to watch the struggle on the vast plain and see his empire slipping through his bloodstained fingers it was with difficulty that he could keep from revering the hat and coat which are sculptured on the stone but it was well that he succeeded for he could not make out then or afterwards whether the habiliments represented were really napoleons or not and they might have turned out to be barclay de tollys  while he stood trying to solve this question of clothes he was startled by the apparition of a man climbing the little slope from the opposite quarter and advancing toward them he wore the imperial crossed by the pointed mustache once so familiar to a world much the worse for them and march had the shiver of a fine moment in which he fancied the third napoleon rising to view the scene where the first had looked his coming ruin in the face  why its miss triscoe cried his wife and before march had noticed the approach of another figure the elder and the younger lady had rushed upon each other and encountered with a kiss at the same time the visage of the last emperor resolved itself into the face of general triscoe who gave march his hand in a more tempered greeting  the ladies began asking each other of their lives since their parting two days before and the men strolled a few paces away toward the distant prospect of leipsic which at that point silhouettes itself in a noble stretch of roofs and spires and towers against the horizon  general triscoe seemed no better satisfied with germany than he had been on first stepping ashore at cuxhaven he might still have been in a pout with his own country but as yet he had not made up with any other and he said what a pity napoleon didnt thrash the whole dunderheaded lot his empire would have been a blessing to them and they would have had some chance of being civilized under the french all this unification of nationalities is the great humbug of the century every stupid race thinks its happy because its united and civilization has been set back a hundred years by the wars that were fought to bring the unions about and more wars will have to be fought to keep them up what a farce it is whats become of the nationality of the danes in schleswigholstein or the french in the rhine provinces or the italians in savoy  march had thought something like this himself but to have it put by general triscoe made it offensive i dont know isnt it rather quarrelling with the course of human events to oppose accomplished facts the unifications were bound to be just as the separations before them were and so far they have made for peace in europe at least and peace is civilization perhaps after a great many ages people will come together through their real interests the human interests but at present it seems as if nothing but a romantic sentiment of patriotism can unite them byandby they may find that there is nothing in it  perhaps said the general discontentedly i dont see much promise of any kind in the future  well i dont know when you think of the solid militarism of germany you seem remanded to the most hopeless moment of the roman empire you think nothing can break such a force but my guide says that even in leipsic the socialists outnumber all the other parties and the army is the great field of the socialist propaganda the army itself may be shaped into the means of democracyeven of peace  youre very optimistic said triscoe curtly as i read the signs we are not far from universal war in less than a year we shall make the break ourselves in a war with spain he looked very fierce as he prophesied and he dotted march over with his staccato glances  well ill allow that if tammany comes in this year we shall have war with spain you cant ask more than that general triscoe  mrs march and miss triscoe had not said a word of the battle of leipsic or of the impersonal interests which it suggested to the men for all these they might still have been sitting in their steamer chairs on the promenade of the norumbia at a period which seemed now of geological remoteness the girl accounted for not being in dresden by her fathers having decided not to go through berlin but to come by way of leipsic which he thought they had better see they had come without stopping in hamburg they had not enjoyed leipsic much it had rained the whole day before and they had not gone out she asked when mrs march was going on to carlsbad and mrs march answered the next morning her husband wished to begin his cure at once  then miss triscoe pensively wondered if carlsbad would do her father any good and mrs march discreetly inquired general triscoes symptoms  oh he hasnt any but i know he cant be wellwith his gloomy opinions  they may come from his liver said mrs march nearly everything of that kind does i know that mr march has been terribly depressed at times and the doctor said it was nothing but his liver and carlsbad is the great place for that you know  perhaps i can get papa to run over some day if he doesnt like dresden it isnt very far is it  they referred to mrs marchs baedeker together and found that it was five hours  yes that is what i thought said miss triscoe with a carelessness which convinced mrs march she had looked up the fact already  if you decide to come you must let us get rooms for you at our hotel were going to pupps most of the english and americans go to the hotels on the hill but pupps is in the thick of it in the lower town and its very gay mr kenby says hes been there often mr burnamy is to get our rooms  i dont suppose i can get papa to go said miss triscoe so insincerely that mrs march was sure she had talked over the different routes to carlsbad with burnamyprobably on the way from cuxhaven she looked up from digging the point of her umbrella in the ground you didnt meet him here this morning  mrs march governed herself to a calm which she respected in asking has mr burnamy been here  he came on with mr and mrs eltwin when we did and they all decided to stop over a day they left on the twelveoclock train today  mrs march perceived that the girl had decided not to let the facts betray themselves by chance and she treated them as of no significance  no we didnt see him she said carelessly  the two men came walking slowly towards them and miss triscoe said were going to dresden this evening but i hope we shall meet somewhere mrs march  oh people never lose sight of each other in europe they cant its so little  agatha said the girls father mr march tells me that the museum over there is worth seeing  well the girl assented and she took a winning leave of the marches and moved gracefully away with her father  i should have thought it was agnes said mrs march following them with her eyes before she turned upon her husband did he tell you burnamy had been here well he has he has just gone on to carlsbad he made those poor old eltwins stop over with him so he could be with her  did she say that  no but of course he did  then its all settled  no it isnt settled its at the most interesting point  well dont read ahead you always want to look at the last page  you were trying to look at the last page yourself she retorted and she would have liked to punish him for his complex dishonesty toward the affair but upon the whole she kept her temper with him and she made him agree that miss triscoes getting her father to carlsbad was only a question of time  they parted heartsfriends with their ineffectual guide who was affectionately grateful for the few marks they gave him at the hotel door and they were in just the mood to hear men singing in a farther room when they went down to supper the waiter much distracted from their own service by his duties to it told them it was the breakfast party of students which they had heard beginning there about noon the revellers had now been some six hours at table and he said they might not rise before midnight they had just got to the toasts which were apparently set to music  the students of right remained a vivid color in the impression of the university town they pervaded the place and decorated it with their fantastic personal taste in coats and trousers as well as their corps caps of green white red and blue but above all blue they were not easily distinguishable from the bicyclers who were holding one of the dull festivals of their kind in leipsic that day and perhaps they were sometimes both students and bicyclers as bicyclers they kept about in the rain which they seemed not to mind so far from being disheartened they had spirits enough to take one another by the waist at times and waltz in the square before the hotel at one moment of the holiday some chiefs among them drove away in carriages at supper a winner of prizes sat covered with badges and medals another who went by the hotel streamed with ribbons and an elderly man at his side was bespattered with small knots and ends of them as if he had been in an explosion of ribbons somewhere it seemed all to be as exciting for them and it was as tedious for the witnesses as any gala of students and bicyclers at home  mrs march remained with an unrequited curiosity concerning their different colors and different caps and she tried to make her husband find out what they severally meant he pretended a superior interest in the nature of a people who had such a passion for uniforms that they were not content with its gratification in their immense army but indulged it in every pleasure and employment of civil life he estimated perhaps not very accurately that only one man out of ten in germany wore citizens dress and of all functionaries he found that the dogs of the womenanddog teams alone had no distinctive dress even the women had their peasant costume  there was an industrial fair open at leipsic which they went out of the city to see after supper along with a throng of leipsickers whom an hours interval of fine weather tempted forth on the trolley and with the help of a little corporal who took a fee for his service with the eagerness of a civilian they got wheeled chairs and renewed their associations with the great chicago fair in seeing the exposition from them this was not march said quite the same as being drawn by a womananddog team which would have been the right means of doing a german fair but it was something to have his chair pushed by a slender young girl whose stalwart brother applied his strength to the chair of the lighter traveller and it was fit that the girl should reckon the common hire while the man took the common tip they made haste to leave the useful aspects of the fair and had themselves trundled away to the colonial exhibit where they vaguely expected something like the agreeable corruptions of the midway plaisance the idea of her colonial progress with which germany is trying to affect the homekeeping imagination of her people was illustrated by an encampment of savages from her centralafrican possessions they were getting their supper at the moment the marches saw them and were crouching half naked around the fires under the kettles and shivering from the cold but they were not very characteristic of the imperial expansion unless perhaps when an old man in a red blanket suddenly sprang up with a knife in his hand and began to chase a boy round the camp the boy was lighterfooted and easily outran the sage who tripped at times on his blanket none of the other central africans seemed to care for the race and without waiting for the event the american spectators ordered themselves trundled away to another idle feature of the fair where they hoped to amuse themselves with the image of old leipsic  this was so faithfully studied from the past in its narrow streets and gothic houses that it was almost as picturesque as the present epoch in the old streets of hamburg a drama had just begun to be represented on a platform of the public square in front of a fourteenthcentury beerhouse with people talking from the windows round and revellers in the costume of the period drinking beer and eating sausages at tables in the open air their eating and drinking were genuine and in the midst of it a real rain began to pour down upon them without affecting them any more than if they had been germans of the nineteenth century but it drove the americans to a shelter from which they could not see the play and when it held up they made their way back to their hotel  their car was full of returning pleasurers some of whom were happy beyond the sober wont of the fatherland the conductor took a special interest in his tipsy passengers trying to keep them in order and genially entreating them to be quiet when they were too obstreperous from time to time he got some of them off and then when he remounted the car he appealed to the remaining passengers for their sympathy with an innocent smile which the americans still strange to the unjoyous physiognomy of the german empire failed to value at its rare worth  before he slept that night march tried to assemble from the experiences and impressions of the day some facts which he would not be ashamed of as a serious observer of life in leipsic and he remembered that their guide had said houserent was very low he generalized from the guides content with his fee that the germans were not very rapacious and he became quite irrelevantly aware that in germany no mans clothes fitted him or seemed expected to fit him that the women dressed somewhat better and were rather pretty sometimes and that they had feet as large as the kind hearts of the germans of every age and sex he was able to note rather more freshly that with all their kindness the germans were a very nervous people if not irritable and at the least cause gave way to an agitation which indeed quickly passed but was violent while it lasted several times that day he had seen encounters between the portier and guests at the hotel which promised violence but which ended peacefully as soon as some simple question of traintime was solved the encounters always left the portier purple and perspiring as any agitation must with a man so tight in his livery he bemoaned himself after one of them as the victim of an unhappy calling in which he could take no exercise it is a life of excitements but not of movements he explained to march and when he learned where he was going he regretted that he could not go to carlsbad too for sugar he asked as if there were overmuch of it in his own make  march felt the tribute but he had to say no liver  ah said the portier with the air of failing to get on common ground with him     xxv  the next morning was so fine that it would have been a fine morning in america its beauty was scarcely sullied even subjectively by the telegram which the portier sent after the marches from the hotel saying that their missing trunk had not yet been found and their spirits were as light as the gay little clouds which blew about in the sky when their train drew out in the sunshine brilliant on the charming landscape all the way to carlsbad a fatherly traeger had done his best to get them the worst places in a nonsmoking compartment but had succeeded so poorly that they were very comfortable with no companions but a mother and daughter who spoke german in soft low tones together their compartment was pervaded by tobacco fumes from the smokers but as these were twice as many as the nonsmokers it was only fair and after march had got a window open it did not matter really  he asked leave of the strangers in his german and they consented in theirs but he could not master the secret of the windowcatch and the elder lady said in english let me show you and came to his help  the occasion for explaining that they were americans and accustomed to different car windows was so tempting that mrs march could not forbear and the other ladies were affected as deeply as she could wish perhaps they were the more affected because it presently appeared that they had cousins in new york whom she knew of and that they were acquainted with an american family that had passed the winter in berlin life likes to do these things handsomely and it easily turned out that this was a family of intimate friendship with the marches the names familiarly spoken abolished all strangeness between the travellers and they entered into a comparison of tastes opinions and experiences from which it seemed that the objects and interests of cultivated people in berlin were quite the same as those of cultivated people in new york each of the parties to the discovery disclaimed any superiority for their respective civilizations they wished rather to ascribe a greater charm and virtue to the alien conditions and they acquired such merit with one another that when the german ladies got out of the train at franzensbad the mother offered mrs march an ingenious folding footstool which she had admired in fact she left her with it clasped to her breast and bowing speechless toward the giver in a vain wish to express her gratitude  that was very pretty of her my dear said march you couldnt have done that  no she confessed i shouldnt have had the courage the courage of my emotions she added thoughtfully  ah thats the difference a berliner could do it and a bostonian couldnt do you think it so much better to have the courage of your convictions  i dont know it seems to me that im less and less certain of everything that i used to be sure of  he laughed and then he said i was thinking how on our wedding journey long ago that gray sister at the hotel dieu in quebec offered you a rose  well  that was to your pretty youth now the gracious stranger gives you a folding stool  to rest my poor old feet well i would rather have it than a rose now  you bent toward her at just the slant you had when you took the flower that time i noticed it i didnt see that you looked so very different to be sure the roses in your cheeks have turned into rosettes but rosettes are very nice and theyre much more permanent i prefer them they will keep in any climate  she suffered his mockery with an appreciative sigh yes our age caricatures our youth doesnt it  i dont think it gets much fun out of it he assented  no but it cant help it i used to rebel against it when it first began i did enjoy being young  you did my dear he said taking her hand tenderly she withdrew it because though she could bear his sympathy her new england nature could not bear its expression and so did i and we were both young a long time travelling brings the past back dont you think there at that restaurant where we stopped for dinner  yes it was charming just as it used to be with that white cloth and those tall shining bottles of wine and the fruit in the centre and the dinner in courses and that young waiter who spoke english and was so nice im never going home you may if you like  you bragged to those ladies about our diningcars and you said that our railroad restaurants were quite as good as the european  i had to do that but i knew better they dont begin to be  perhaps not but ive been thinking that travel is a good deal alike everywhere its the expression of the common civilization of the world when i came out of that restaurant and ran the train down and then found that it didnt start for fifteen minutes i wasnt sure whether i was at home or abroad and when we changed cars at eger and got into this train which had been baking in the sun for us outside the station i didnt know but i was back in the good old fitchburg depot to be sure wallenstein wasnt assassinated at boston but i forgot his murder at eger and so that came to the same thing its these confounded fiftyodd years i used to recollect everything  he had got up and was looking out of the window at the landscape which had not grown less amiable in growing rather more slovenly since they had crossed the saxon bolder into bohemia all the morning and early afternoon they had run through lovely levels of harvest where men were cradling the wheat and women were binding it into sheaves in the narrow fields between black spaces of forest after they left eger there was something more picturesque and less thrifty in the farming among the low hills which they gradually mounted to uplands where they tasted a mountain quality in the thin pure air the railroad stations were shabbier there was an indefinable touch of something southern in the scenery and the people lilies were rocking on the sluggish reaches of the streams and where the current quickened tall wheels were lifting water for the fields in circles of brimming and spilling pockets along the embankments where a new track was being laid barefooted women were at work with pick and spade and barrow and little yellowhaired girls were lugging large whiteheaded babies and watching the train go by at an up grade where it slowed in the ascent he began to throw out to the children the pfennigs which had been left over from the passage in germany and he pleased himself with his bounty till the question whether the children could spend the money forced itself upon him he sat down feeling less like a good genius than a cruel magician who had tricked them with false wealth but he kept his remorse to himself and tried to interest his wife in the difference of social and civic ideal expressed in the change of the inhibitory notices at the car windows which in germany had strongliest forbidden him to outlean himself and now in austria entreated him not to outbow himself she refused to share in the speculation or to debate the yet nicer problem involved by the placarded prayer in the washroom to the messrs travellers not to take away the soap and suddenly he felt himself as tired as she looked with that sense of the futility of travel which lies in wait for every one who profits by travel     pg editors bookmarks      bad wars or what are comically called good wars     calm of those who have logic on their side     decided not to let the facts betray themselves by chance     explained perhaps too fully     futility of travel     humanity may at last prevail over nationality     impertinent prophecies of their enjoying it so much     less certain of everything that i used to be sure of     life of the ship like the life of the sea a sodden monotony     life was like the life at a seaside hotel but more monotonous     madness of sightseeing which spoils travel     night so bad that it was worse than no night at all     our age caricatures our youth     prices fixed by his remorse     recipes for dishes and diseases     reckless and culpable optimism     repeated the nothings they had said already     she cares for him that she was so cold shows that     she could bear his sympathy but not its expression     suffering under the dripdrip of his innocent egotism     they were so near in age though they were ten years apart     unfounded hope that sooner or later the weather would be fine     wilful sufferers     woman harnessed with a dog to a cart     wooded with the precise severely disciplined german forests     work he was so fond of and so weary of     their silver wedding journey    part ii   xxvi  they found burnamy expecting them at the station in carlsbad and she scolded him like a mother for taking the trouble to meet them while she kept back for the present any sign of knowing that he had staid over a day with the triscoes in leipsic he was as affectionately glad to see her and her husband as she could have wished but she would have liked it better if he had owned up at once about leipsic he did not and it seemed to her that he was holding her at armslength in his answers about his employer he would not say how he liked his work or how he liked mr stoller he merely said that they were at pupps together and that he had got in a good days work already and since he would say no more she contented herself with that  the long drive from the station to the hotel was by streets that wound down the hillside like those of an italian mountain town between gay stuccoed houses of southern rather than of northern architecture and the impression of a latin country was heightened at a turn of the road which brought into view a colossal crucifix planted against a curtain of dark green foliage on the brow of one of the wooded heights that surrounded carlsbad when they reached the level of the tepl the hillfed torrent that brawls through the little city under pretty bridges within walls of solid masonry they found themselves in almost the only vehicle on a brilliant promenade thronged with a cosmopolitan world germans in every manner of misfit polish jews in long black gabardines with tight corkscrew curls on their temples under their black velvet derbys austrian officers in tight corsets greek priests in flowing robes and brimless high hats russians in caftans and cossacks in astrakhan caps accented the more homogeneous masses of western europeans in which it would have been hard to say which were english french or italians among the vividly dressed ladies some were imaginably parisian from their chic costumes but they might easily have been hungarians or levantines of taste some americans who might have passed unknown in the perfection of their dress gave their nationality away in the flat wooden tones of their voices which made themselves heard above the low hum of talk and the whisper of the innumerable feet  the omnibus worked its way at a slow walk among the promenaders going and coming between the rows of pollard locusts on one side and the bright walls of the houses on the other under the trees were tables served by pretty bareheaded girls who ran to and from the restaurants across the way on both sides flashed and glittered the little shops full of silver glass jewelry terracotta figurines woodcarvings and all the idle frippery of wateringplace traffic they suggested paris and they suggested saratoga and then they were of carlsbad and of no place else in the world as the crowd which might have been that of other cities at certain moments could only have been of carlsbad in its habitual effect  do you like it asked burnamy as if he owned the place and mrs march saw how simplehearted he was in his reticence after all she was ready to bless him when they reached the hotel and found that his interest had got them the only rooms left in the house this satisfied in her the passion for size which is at the bottom of every american heart and which perhaps above all else marks us the youngest of the peoples we pride ourselves on the bigness of our own things but we are not ungenerous and when we go to europe and find things bigger than ours we are magnanimously happy in them pupps in its altogether different way was larger than any hotel at saratoga or at niagara and when burnamy told her that it sometimes fed fifteen thousand people a day in the height of the season she was personally proud of it  she waited with him in the rotunda of the hotel while the secretary led march off to look at the rooms reserved for them and burnamy hospitably turned the revolving octagonal case in the centre of the rotunda where the names of the guests were put up they were of all nations but there were so many new yorkers whose names ended in berg and thal and stern and baum that she seemed to be gazing upon a cyclorama of the signs on broadway a large man of unmistakable american make but with so little that was of new england or new york in his presence that she might not at once have thought him american lounged toward them with a quill toothpick in the corner of his mouth he had a jealous blue eye into which he seemed trying to put a friendly light his straight mouth stretched into an involuntary smile above his tawny chinbeard and he wore his soft hat so far back from his high forehead it showed to the crown when he took his hat off that he had the effect of being uncovered  at his approach burnamy turned and with a flush said oh let me introduce mr stoller mrs march  stoller took his toothpick out of his mouth and bowed then he seemed to remember and took off his hat you see jews enough here to make you feel at home he asked and he added well we got some of em in chicago too i guess this young manhe twisted his head toward burnamyfound you easy enough  it was very good of him to meet us mrs march began we didnt expect  oh thats all right said stoller putting his toothpick back and his hat on wed got through for the day my doctor wont let me work all i want to here your husbands going to take the cure they tell me well he wants to go to a good doctor first you cant go and drink these waters hit or miss i found that out before i came  oh no said mrs march and she wished to explain how they had been advised but he said to burnamy  i shant want you again till ten tomorrow morning dont let me interrupt you he added patronizingly to mrs march he put his hand up toward his hat and sauntered away out of the door  burnamy did not speak and she only asked at last to relieve the silence is mr stoller an american  why i suppose so he answered with an uneasy laugh his people were german emigrants who settled in southern indiana that makes him as much american as any of us doesnt it  burnamy spoke with his mind on his frenchcanadian grandfather who had come down through detroit when their name was bonami but mrs march answered from her eight generations of new england ancestry oh for the west yes perhaps and they neither of them said anything more about stoller  in their room where she found march waiting for her amidst their arriving baggage she was so full of her pentup opinions of burnamys patron that she would scarcely speak of the view from their windows of the wooded hills up and down the tepl yes yes very nice and i know i shall enjoy it ever so much but i dont know what you will think of that poor young burnamy  why whats happened to him  happened stollers happened  oh have you seen him already well  well if you had been going to pick out that type of man youd have rejected him because youd have said he was too pat hes like an actor made up for a western millionaire do you remember that american in letranger which bernhardt did in boston when she first came he looks exactly like that and he has the worst manners he stood talking to me with his hat on and a toothpick in his mouth and he made me feel as if he had bought me along with burnamy and had paid too much if you dont give him a setting down basil i shall never speak to you thats all im sure burnamy is in some trouble with him hes got some sort of hold upon him what it could be in such a short time i cant imagine but if ever a man seemed to be in a mans power he does in his  now said march your pronouns have got so far beyond me that i think wed better let it all go till after supper perhaps i shall see stoller myself by that time  she had been deeply stirred by her encounter with stoller but she entered with impartial intensity into the fact that the elevator at pupps had the characteristic of always coming up and never going down with passengers it was locked into its closet with a solid door and there was no bell to summon it or any place to take it except on the groundfloor but the stairs by which she could descend were abundant and stately and on one landing there was the lithograph of one of the largest and ugliest hotels in new york how ugly it was she said she should never have known if she had not seen it there  the diningroom was divided into the grand saloon where they supped amid rococo sculptures and frescoes and the glazed veranda opening by vast windows on a spread of tables without which were already filling up for the evening concert around them at the different tables there were groups of faces and figures fascinating in their strangeness with that distinction which abashes our american level in the presence of european inequality  how simple and unimpressive we are basil she said beside all these people i used to feel it in europe when i was young and now im certain that we must seem like two fadedin old village photographs we dont even look intellectual i hope we look good  i know i do said march the waiter went for their supper and they joined in guessing the different nationalities in the room a french party was easy enough a spanish mother and daughter were not difficult though whether they were not southamerican remained uncertain two elderly maiden ladies were unmistakably of central massachusetts and were obviously of a bookclub culture that had left no leaf unturned some triestines gave themselves away by their venetian accent but a large group at a farther table were unassignable in the strange language which they clattered loudly together with bursts of laughter they were a family party of old and young they were having a good time with a freedom which she called baronial the ladies wore white satin or black lace but the men were in sackcoats she chose to attribute them for no reason but their outlandishness to transylvania march pretended to prefer a table full of germans who were unmistakably bourgeois and yet of intellectual effect he chose as his favorite a middleaged man of learned aspect and they both decided to think of him as the herr professor but they did not imagine how perfectly the title fitted him till he drew a long comb from his waistcoat pocket and combed his hair and beard with it above the table  the wine wrought with the transylvanians and they all jargoned together at once and laughed at the jokes passing among them one old gentleman had a peculiar fascination from the infantile innocence of his gums when he threw his head back to laugh and showed an upper jaw toothless except for two incisors standing guard over the chasm between suddenly he choked coughed to relieve himself hawked held his napkin up before him and  noblesse oblige said march with the tone of irony which he reserved for his wifes preoccupations with aristocracies of all sorts i think i prefer my hair professor bourgeois as he is  the ladies attributively of central massachusetts had risen from their table and were making for the door without having paid for their supper the head waiter ran after them with a real delicacy for their mistake he explained that though in most places the meals were charged in the bill it was the custom in carlsbad to pay for them at the table one could see that he was making their error a pleasant adventure to them which they could laugh over together and write home about without a pang  and i said mrs march shamelessly abandoning the party of the aristocracy prefer the manners of the lower classes  oh yes he admitted the only manners we have at home are black ones but you mustnt lose courage perhaps the nobility are not always so baronial  i dont know whether we have manners at home she said and i dont believe i care at least we have decencies  dont be a jingo said her husband     xxvii  though stoller had formally discharged burnamy from duty for the day he was not so full of resources in himself and he had not so general an acquaintance in the hotel but he was glad to have the young fellow make up to him in the readingroom that night he laid down a new york paper ten days old in despair of having left any american news in it and pushed several continental angloamerican papers aside with his elbow as he gave a contemptuous glance at the foreign journals in bohemian hungarian german french and italian which littered the large table  i wonder he said how long itll takeem over here to catch on to our way of having pictures  burnamy had come to his newspaper work since illustrated journalism was established and he had never had any shock from it at home but so sensitive is youth to environment that after four days in europe the new york paper stoller had laid down was already hideous to him from the politic side of his nature however he temporized with stollers preference i suppose it will be some time yet  i wish said stoller with a savage disregard of expressed sequences and relevancies i could ha got some pictures to send home with that letter this afternoon something to show how they do things here and be a kind of objectlesson this term had come up in a recent campaign when some employers by shutting down their works were showing their employees what would happen if the employees voted their political opinions into effect and stoller had then mastered its meaning and was fond of using it id like em to see the woods around here that the city owns and the springs and the donkeycarts and the theatre and everything and give em some practical ideas  burnamy made an uneasy movement  id a liked to put em alongside of some of our improvements and show how a town can be carried on when its managed on business principles  why didnt you think of it  really i dont know said burnamy with a touch of impatience  they had not met the evening before on the best of terms stoller had expected burnamy twentyfour hours earlier and had shown his displeasure with him for loitering a day at leipsic which he might have spent at carlsbad and burnamy had been unsatisfactory in accounting for the delay but he had taken hold so promptly and so intelligently that by working far into the night and through the whole forenoon he had got stollers crude mass of notes into shape and had sent off in time for the first steamer the letter which was to appear over the proprietors name in his paper it was a sort of rough but very full study of the carlsbad city government the methods of taxation the municipal ownership of the springs and the lands and the public control in everything it condemned the aristocratic constitution of the municipality but it charged heavily in favor of the purity beneficence and wisdom of the administration under which there was no poverty and no idleness and which was managed like any large business  stoller had sulkily recurred to his displeasure once or twice and burnamy suffered it submissively until now but now at the change in burnamys tone he changed his manner a little  seen your friends since supper he asked  only a moment they are rather tired and theyve gone to bed  that the fellow that edits that book you write for  yes he owns it too  the notion of any sort of ownership moved stollers respect and he asked more deferentially makin a good thing out of it  a living i suppose some of the highclass weeklies feel the competition of the tencent monthlies but every other week is about the best thing weve got in the literary way and i guess its holding its own  have to to let the editor come to carlsbad stoller said with a return to the sourness of his earlier mood i dont know as i care much for his looks i seen him when he came in with you no snap to him he clicked shut the penknife he had been paring his nails with and started up with the abruptness which marked all his motions mental and physical as he walked heavily out of the room he said without looking at burnamy you want to be ready by half past ten at the latest  stollers father and mother were poor emigrants who made their way to the west with the instinct for sordid prosperity native to their race and class and they set up a small butcher shop in the little indiana town where their son was born and throve in it from the start he could remember his mother helping his father make the sausage and headcheese and pickle the pigs feet which they took turns in selling at as great a price as they could extort from the townspeople she was a good and tender mother and when her little yawcup as the boys called jacob in mimicry after her had grown to the schoolgoing age she taught him to fight the americans who stoned him when he came out of his gate and mobbed his homecoming and mocked and tormented him at playtime till they wore themselves into a kindlier mind toward him through the exhaustion of their invention no one so far as the gloomy stocky rather dense little boy could make out ever interfered in his behalf and he grew up in bitter shame for his german origin which entailed upon him the hard fate of being dutch among the americans he hated his native speech so much that he cried when he was forced to use it with his father and mother at home he furiously denied it with the boys who proposed to parley with him in it on such terms as nix come arouce in de dytchmans house he disused it so thoroughly that after his father took him out of school when he was old enough to help in the shop he could not get back to it he regarded his fathers business as part of his national disgrace and at the cost of leaving his home he broke away from it and informally apprenticed himself to the village blacksmith and wagonmaker when it came to his setting up for himself in the business he had chosen he had no help from his father who had gone on adding dollar to dollar till he was one of the richest men in the place  jacob prospered too his old playmates who had used him so cruelly had many of them come to like him but as a dutchman they never dreamt of asking him to their houses when they were young people any more than when they were children he was long deeply in love with an american girl whom he had never spoken to and the dream of his life was to marry an american he ended by marrying the daughter of pferd the brewer who had been at an american school in indianapolis and had come home as fragilely and nasally american as anybody she made him a good sickly fretful wife and bore him five children of whom two survived with no visible taint of their german origin  in the mean time jacobs father had died and left his money to his son with the understanding that he was to provide for his mother who would gladly have given every cent to him and been no burden to him if she could he took her home and cared tenderly for her as long as she lived and she meekly did her best to abolish herself in a household trying so hard to be american she could not help her native accent but she kept silence when her sons wife had company and when her eldest granddaughter began very early to have american callers she went out of the room they would not have noticed her if she had staid  before this jacob had come forward publicly in proportion to his financial importance in the community he first commended himself to the better element by crushing out a strike in his buggy works which were now the largest business interest of the place and he rose on a wave of municipal reform to such a height of favor with the respectable classes that he was elected on a citizens ticket to the legislature in the reaction which followed he was barely defeated for congress and was talked of as a dark horse who might be put up for the governorship some day but those who knew him best predicted that he would not get far in politics where his bullheaded business ways would bring him to ruin sooner or later they said you cant swing a bolt like you can a strike  when his mother died he surprised his old neighbors by going to live in chicago though he kept his works in the place where he and they had grown up together his wife died shortly after and within four years he lost his three eldest children his son it was said had begun to go wrong first but the rumor of his increasing wealth drifted back from chicago he was heard of in different enterprises and speculations at last it was said that he had bought a newspaper and then his boyhood friends decided that jake was going into politics again  in the wider horizons and opener atmosphere of the great city he came to understand better that to be an american in all respects was not the best his mounting sense of importance began to be retroactive in the direction of his ancestral home he wrote back to the little town near wurzburg which his people had come from and found that he had relatives still living there some of whom had become people of substance and about the time his health gave way from lifelong gluttony and he was ordered to carlsbad he had pretty much made up his mind to take his younger daughters and put them in school for a year or two in wurzburg for a little discipline if not education he had now left them there to learn the language which he had forgotten with such heartburning and shame and music for which they had some taste  the twins loudly lamented their fate and they parted from their father with open threats of running away and in his heart he did not altogether blame them he came away from wurzburg raging at the disrespect for his money and his standing in business which had brought him a more galling humiliation there than anything he had suffered in his boyhood at des vaches it intensified him in his dearbought americanism to the point of wishing to commit lese majesty in the teeth of some local dignitaries who had snubbed him and who seemed to enjoy putting our eagle to shame in his person there was something like the bird of his stepcountry in stollers pale eyes and huge beak     xxviii  march sat with a company of other patients in the anteroom of the doctor and when it came his turn to be prodded and kneaded he was ashamed at being told he was not so bad a case as he had dreaded the doctor wrote out a careful dietary for him with a prescription of a certain number of glasses of water at a certain spring and a certain number of baths and a rule for the walks he was to take before and after eating then the doctor patted him on the shoulder and pushed him caressingly out of his inner office it was too late to begin his treatment that day but he went with his wife to buy a cup with a strap for hanging it over his shoulder and he put it on so as to be an invalid with the others at once he came near forgetting the small napkin of turkish towelling which they stuffed into their cups but happily the shopman called him back in time to sell it to him  at five the next morning he rose and on his way to the street exchanged with the servants cleaning the hotel stairs the first of the gloomy guten morgens which usher in the day at carlsbad they cannot be so finally hopeless as they sound they are probably expressive only of the popular despair of getting through with them before night but march heard the salutations sorrowfully groaned out on every hand as he joined the straggling current of invalids which swelled on the way past the silent shops and cafes in the alte wiese till it filled the street and poured its thousands upon the promenade before the classic colonnade of the muhlbrunn on the other bank of the tepl the sprudel flings its steaming waters by irregular impulses into the air under a pavilion of iron and glass but the muhlbrunn is the source of most resort there is an instrumental concert somewhere in carlsbad from early rising till bedtime and now at the muhlbrunn there was an orchestra already playing and under the pillared porch as well as before it the multitude shuffled up and down draining their cups by slow sips and then taking each his place in the interminable line moving on to replenish them at the spring  a picturesque majority of polish jews whom some vice of their climate is said peculiarly to fit for the healing effects of carlsbad most took his eye in their long gabardines of rusty black and their derby hats of plush or velvet with their corkscrew curls coming down before their ears they were old and young they were grizzled and red and black but they seemed all welltodo and what impresses one first and last at carlsbad is that its waters are mainly for the healing of the rich after the polish jews the greek priests of russian race were the most striking figures there were types of latin ecclesiastics who were striking in their way too and the uniforms of certain austrian officers and soldiers brightened the picture here and there a southern face italian or spanish or levantine looked passionately out of the mass of dull german visages for at carlsbad the germans more than any other gentile nation are to the fore their misfits their absence of style imparted the prevalent effect though now and then among the women a hungarian or pole or parisian or american relieved the eye which seeks beauty and grace rather than the domestic virtues there were certain faces types of discomfort and disease which appealed from the beginning to the end a young austrian yellow as gold and a livid southamerican were of a lasting fascination to march  what most troubled him in his scrutiny of the crowd was the difficulty of assigning people to their respective nations and he accused his years of having dulled his perceptions but perhaps it was from their long disuse in his homogeneous american world the americans themselves fused with the european races who were often so hard to make out his fellowcitizens would not be identified till their bad voices gave them away he thought the womens voices the worst  at the springs a line of young girls with a steady mechanical action dipped the cups into the steaming source and passed them impersonally up to their owners with the patients at the muhlbrunn it was often a halfhour before ones turn came and at all a strict etiquette forbade any attempt to anticipate it the water was merely warm and flat and after the first repulsion one could forget it march formed a childish habit of counting ten between the sips and of finishing the cup with a gulp which ended it quickly he varied his walks between cups by going sometimes to a bridge at the end of the colonnade where a group of triestines were talking venetian and sometimes to the little park beyond the kurhaus where some old women were sweeping up from the close sward the yellow leaves which the trees had untidily dropped overnight he liked to sit there and look at the city beyond the tepl where it climbed the wooded heights in terraces till it lost its houses in the skirts and folds of the forest most mornings it rained quietly absentmindedly and this with the chili in the air deepened a pleasant illusion of quebec offered by the upper town across the stream but there were sunny mornings when the mountains shone softly through a lustrous mist and the air was almost warm  once in his walk he found himself the companion of burnamys employer whom he had sometimes noted in the line at the muhlbrunn waiting his turn cup in hand with a face of sullen impatience stoller explained that though you could have the water brought to you at your hotel he chose to go to the spring for the sake of the air it was something you had got to live through before he had that young burnamy to help him he did not know what to do with his time but now every minute he was not eating or sleeping he was working his cure did not oblige him to walk much he examined march with a certain mixture of respect and contempt upon the nature of the literary life and how it differed from the life of a journalist he asked if he thought burnamy would amount to anything as a literary man he so far assented to marchs faith in him as to say hes smart he told of leaving his daughters in school at wurzburg and upon the whole he moved march with a sense of his pathetic loneliness without moving his liking as he passed lumberingly on dangling his cup  march gave his own cup to the little maid at his spring and while she gave it to a second who dipped it and handed it to a third for its return to him he heard an unmistakable fellowcountryman saying good morning to them all in english are you going to teach them united states he asked of a face with which he knew such an appeal would not fail  well the man admitted i try to teach them that much they like it you are an american i am glad of it i have most lost the use of my lungs here im a great talker and i talk to my wife till shes about dead then im out of it for the rest of the day i cant speak german  his manner was the free friendly manner of the west he must be that sort of untravelled american whom march had so seldom met but he was afraid to ask him if this was his first time at carlsbad lest it should prove the third or fourth are you taking the cure he asked instead  oh no my wife is shell be along directly i come down here and drink the waters to encourage her doctor said to that gets me in for the diet too ive et more cooked fruit since i been here than i ever did in my life before prunes my lord im full o prunes well it does me good to see an american to know him i couldnt a told you it you hadnt have spoken  well said march i shouldnt have been so sure of you either by your looks  yes we cant always tell ourselves from these dutch but they know us and they dont want us except just for one thing and thats our money i tell you the americans are the chumps over here soons they got all our money or think they have they say here you americans this is my country you get off and we got to get ever been over before  a great while ago so long that i can hardly believe it  its my first time my names otterson im from out in iowa  march gave him his name and added that he was from new york  yes i thought you was eastern but that wasnt an eastern man you was just with  no hes from chicago hes a mr stoller  not the buggy man  i believe he makes buggies  well you do meet everybody here the iowan was silent for a moment as if hushed by the weighty thought i wish my wife could have seen him i just want her to see the man that made our buggy i dont know whats keeping her this morning he added apologetically look at that fellow will you tryin to get away from those women a young officer was doing his best to take leave of two ladies who seemed to be mother and daughter they detained him by their united arts and clung to him with caressing words and looks he was red in the face with his polite struggles when he broke from them at last how they do hang on to a man over here the iowa man continued and the americans are as bad as any why theres one ratty little englishman up at our place and our girls just swarm after him their mothers are worse well its so jenny he said to the lady who had joined them and whom march turned round to see when he spoke to her if i wanted a foreigner i should go in for a man and these officers put their mustaches up at night in curlpapers they tell me introduce you to mrs otterson mr march well had your first glass yet jenny im just going for my second tumbler  he took his wife back to the spring and began to tell her about stoller she made no sign of caring for him and march felt inculpated she relented a little toward him as they drank together when he said he must be going to breakfast with his wife she asked where he breakfasted and said why we go to the posthof too he answered that then they should be sure some time to meet there he did not venture further he reflected that mrs march had her reluctances too she distrusted people who had amused or interested him before she met them     xxix  burnamy had found the posthof for them as he had found most of the other agreeable things in carlsbad which he brought to their knowledge one by one with such forethought that march said he hoped he should be cared for in his declining years as an editor rather than as a father there was no tenderness like a young contributors  many people from the hotels on the hill found at pupps just the time and space between their last cup of water and their first cup of coffee which are prescribed at carlsbad but the marches were aware somehow from the beginning that pupps had not the hold upon the world at breakfast which it had at the midday dinner or at supper on the evenings when the concert was there still it was amusing and they were patient of burnamys delay till he could get a morning off from stoller and go with them to the posthof he met mrs march in the readingroom where march was to join them on his way from the springs with his bag of bread the earlier usage of buying the delicate pink slices of westphalia ham which form the chief motive of a carlsbad breakfast at a certain shop in the town and carrying them to the cafe with you is no longer of such binding force as the custom of getting your bread at the swiss bakery you choose it yourself at the counter which begins to be crowded by half past seven and when you have collected the prescribed loaves into the basket of metallic filigree given you by one of the bakers maids she puts it into a tissuepaper bag of a gay red color and you join the other invalids streaming away from the bakery their paper bags making a festive rustling as they go  two roads lead out of the town into the lovely meadowlands a good mile up the brawling tepl before they join on the right side of the torrent where the posthof lurks nestled under trees whose boughs let the sun and rain impartially through upon its army of little tables by this time the slow omnibus plying between carlsbad and some villages in the valley beyond has crossed from the left bank to the right and keeps on past half a dozen other cafes where patients whose prescriptions marshal them beyond the posthof drop off by the dozens and scores  the road on the left bank of the tepl is wild and overhung at points with wooded steeps when it leaves the town but on the right it is bordered with shops and restaurants a great part of its length in leafy nooks between these uphill walks begin their climb of the mountains from the foot of votive shrines set round with tablets commemorating in german french russian hebrew magyar and czech the cure of highwellborns of all those races and languages booths glittering with the lapidarys work in the cheaper gems or full of the ingenious figures of the toymakers alternate with the shrines and the cafes on the way to the posthof and with their shoulders against the overhanging cliff spread for the passing crowd a lure of viennese jewelry in garnets opals amethysts and the like and of such bohemian playthings as carroteating rabbits worstedworking cats dancingbears and peacocks that strut about the feet of the passers and expand their iridescent tails in mimic pride  burnamy got his charges with difficulty by the shrines in which they felt the farreflected charm of the crucifixes of the whitehot italian highways of their early travel and by the toyshops where they had a mechanical outdated impulse to get something for the children ending in a pang for the fact that they were children no longer he waited politely while mrs march made up her mind that she would not buy any laces of the motherly old women who showed them under pentroofs on wayside tables and he waited patiently at the gate of the flowergardens beyond the shops where march bought lavishly of sweetpease from the businesslike flowerwoman and feigned a grateful joy in her because she knew no english and gave him a chance of speaking his german  youll find he said as they crossed the road again that its well to trifle a good deal it makes the time pass i should still be lagging along in my thirties if it hadnt been for fooling and here i am well on in my fifties and mrs march is younger than ever  they were at the gate of the garden and grounds of the cafe at last and a turn of the path brought them to the prospect of its tables under the trees between the two long glazed galleries where the breakfasters take refuge at other tables when it rains it rains nearly always and the trunks of the trees are as green with damp as if painted but that morning the sun was shining at the verge of the open space a group of pretty servingmaids each with her name on a silver band pinned upon her breast met them and bade them a guten morgen of almost cheerful note but gave way to an eager little smiling blonde who came pushing down the path at sight of burnamy and claimed him for her own  ah lili we want an extra good table this morning these are some american excellencies and you must do your best for them  oh yes the girl answered in english after a radiant salutation of the marches i get you one  you are a little more formerly today and i didnt had one already  she ran among the tables along the edge of the western edge of the gallery and was far beyond hearing his protest that he was not earlier than usual when she beckoned him to the table she had found she had crowded it in between two belonging to other girls and by the time her breakfasters came up she was ready for their order with the pouting pretence that the girls always tried to rob her of the best places burnamy explained proudly when she went that none of the other girls ever got an advantage of her she had more custom than any three of them and she had hired a man to help her carry her orders the girls were all from the neighboring villages he said and they lived at home in the winter on their summer tips their wages were nothing or less for sometimes they paid for their places  what a mass of information said march how did you come by it  newspaper habit of interviewing the universe  its not a bad habit if one doesnt carry it too far how did lili learn her english  she takes lessons in the winter shes a perfect little electric motor i dont believe any yankee girl could equal her  she would expect to marry a millionaire if she did what astonishes one over here is to see how contentedly people prosper along on their own level and the women do twice the work of the men without expecting to equal them in any other way at pupps if we go to one end of the outdoor restaurant it takes three men to wait on us one to bring our coffee or tea another to bring our bread and meat and another to make out our bill and i have to tip all three of them if we go to the other end one girl serves us and i have to give only one fee i make it less than the least i give any three of the men waiters  you ought to be ashamed of that said his wife  im not im simply proud of your sex my dear  women do nearly everything here said burnamy impartially they built that big new kaiserbad building mixed the mortar carried the hods and laid the stone  that makes me prouder of the sex than ever but come mr burnamy isnt there anybody of polite interest that you know of in this crowd  well i cant say burnamy hesitated  the breakfasters had been thronging into the grove and the galleries the tables were already filled and men were bringing other tables on their heads and making places for them with entreaties for pardon everywhere the proprietor was anxiously directing them the pretty servinggirls were running to and from the kitchen in a building apart with shrill sweet promises of haste the morning sun fell broken through the leaves on the gay hats and dresses of the ladies and dappled the figures of the men with harlequin patches of light and shade a tall woman with a sort of sharpened beauty and an artificial permanency of tint in her cheeks and yellow hair came trailing herself up the sunshot path and found with hardy insistence upon the publicity places for the surlylooking downfaced young man behind her and for her maid and her black poodle the dog was like the black poodle out of faust burnamy had heard her history in fact he had already roughed out a poem on it which he called europa not after the old fable but because it seemed to him that she expressed europe on one side of its civilization and had an authorized place in its order as she would not have had in ours she was where she was by a toleration of certain social facts which corresponds in europe to our reverence for the vested interests in her history there had been officers and bankers even foreign dignitaries now there was this sullen young fellow     burnamy had wondered if it would do to offer his poem to march but the presence of the original abashed him and in his mind he had torn the poem up with a heartache for its aptness  i dont believe he said that i recognizeany celebrities here  im sorry said march mrs march would have been glad of some hoheits some grafs and grafins or a few excellenzes or even some mere wellborns but we must try to get along with the picturesqueness  im satisfied with the picturesqueness said his wife dont worry about me mr burnamy  why cant we have this sort of thing at home  were getting something like it in the roofgardens said march we couldnt have it naturally because the climate is against it with us at this time in the morning over there the sun would be burning the life out of the air and the flies would be swarming on every table at nine a m the mosquitoes would be eating us up in such a grove as this so we have to use artifice and lift our posthof above the flyline and the mosquitoline into the night air i havent seen a fly since i came to europe i really miss them it makes me homesick  there are plenty in italy his wife suggested  we must get down there before we go home  but why did nobody ever tell us that there were no flies in germany why did no traveller ever put it in his book when your stewardess said so on the steamer i remember that you regarded it as a bluff he turned to burnamy who was listening with the deference of a contributor isnt lili rather long i mean for such a very prompt person oh no  but burnamy got to his feet and shouted fraulein to lili with her hireling at her heels she was flying down a distant aisle between the tables she called back with a face laughing over her shoulder in a minute and vanished in the crowd  does that mean anything in particular theres really no hurry  oh i think shell come now said burnamy march protested that he had only been amused at lilis delay but his wife scolded him for his impatience she begged burnamys pardon and repeated civilities passed between them she asked if he did not think some of the young ladies were pretty beyond the european average a very few had style the mothers were mostly fat and not stylish it was well not to regard the fathers too closely several old gentlemen were clearing their throats behind their newspapers with noises that made her quail there was no one so effective as the austrian officers who put themselves a good deal on show bowing from their hips to favored groups with the sun glinting from their eyeglasses and their hands pressing their swordhilts they moved between the tables with the gait of tightlaced women  they all wear corsets burnamy explained  how much you know already said mrs march i can see that europe wont be lost on you in anything oh whos that a lady whose costume expressed saris at every point glided up the middle aisle of the grove with a graceful tilt burnamy was silent she must be an american do you know who she is  yes he hesitated a little to name a woman whose tragedy had once filled the newspapers  mrs march gazed after her with the fascination which such tragedies inspire what grace is she beautiful  very burnamy had not obtruded his knowledge but somehow mrs march did not like his knowing who she was and how beautiful she asked march to look but he refused  those things are too squalid he said and she liked him for saying it she hoped it would not be lost upon burnamy  one of the waitresses tripped on the steps near them and flung the burden off her tray on the stone floor before her some of the dishes broke and the breakfast was lost tears came into the girls eyes and rolled down her hot cheeks there that is what i call tragedy said march shell have to pay for those things  oh give her the money dearest  how can i  the girl had just got away with the ruin when lili and her hireling behind her came bearing down upon them with their three substantial breakfasts on two wellladen trays she forestalled burnamys reproaches for her delay laughing and bridling while she set down the dishes of ham and tongue and egg and the little pots of coffee and frothed milk  i could not so soon i wanted because i was to serve an american princess  mrs march started with proud conjecture of one of those noble international marriages which fill our women with vainglory for such of their compatriots as make them  oh come now lili said burnamy we have queens in america but nothing so low as princesses this was a queen wasnt it  she referred the case to her hireling who confirmed her all people say it is princess she insisted  well if shes a princess we must look her up after breakfast said burnamy where is she sitting  she pointed at a corner so far off on the other side that no one could be distinguished and then was gone with a smile flashed over her shoulder and her hireling trying to keep up with her  were all very proud of lilis having a hired man said burnamy we think it reflects credit on her customers  march had begun his breakfast withthe voracious appetite of an earlyrising invalid what coffee  he drew a long sigh after the first draught  its said to be made of burnt figs said burnamy from the inexhaustible advantage of his few days priority in carlsbad  then lets have burnt figs introduced at home as soon as possible but why burnt figs that seems one of those doubts which are much more difficult than faith  its not only burnt figs said burnamy with amiable superiority if it is burnt figs but its made after a formula invented by a consensus of physicians and enforced by the municipality every cafe in carlsbad makes the same kind of coffee and charges the same price  you are leaving us very little to find out for ourselves sighed march  oh i know a lot more things are you fond of fishing  not very  you can get a permit to catch trout in the tepl but they send an official with you who keeps count and when you have had your sport the trout belong to the municipality just as they did before you caught them  i dont see why that isnt a good notion the last thing i should want to do would be to eat a fish that i had caught and that i was personally acquainted with well im never going away from carlsbad i dont wonder people get their doctors to tell them to come back  burnamy told them a number of facts he said stoller had got together about the place and had given him to put in shape it was run in the interest of people who had got out of order so that they would keep coming to get themselves in order again you could hardly buy an unwholesome meal in the town all the cooking was kurgemass he won such favor with his facts that he could not stop in time he said to march but if you ever should have a fancy for a fish of your personal acquaintance theres a restaurant up the tepl where they let you pick out your trout in the water then they catch him and broil him for you and you know what you are eating  is it a municipal restaurant  semimunicipal said burnamy laughing  well take mrs march said her husband and in her gravity burnamy felt the limitations of a womans sense of humor which always define themselves for men so unexpectedly  he did what he could to get back into her good graces by telling her what he knew about distinctions and dignities that he now saw among the breakfasters the crowd had now grown denser till the tables were set together in such labyrinths that any one who left the central aisle was lost in them the servinggirls ran more swiftly to and fro responding with a more nervous shrillness to the calls of fraulein fraulein that followed them the proprietor in his bare head stood like one paralyzed by his prosperity which sent up all round him the clash of knives and crockery and the confusion of tongues it was more than an hour before burnamy caught lilis eye and three times she promised to come and be paid before she came then she said it is so nice when you stay a little and when he told her of the poor fraulein who had broken the dishes in her fall near them she almost wept with tenderness she almost winked with wickedness when he asked if the american princess was still in her place  do go and see who it can be mrs march entreated well wait here and he obeyed i am not sure that i like him she said as soon as he was out of hearing i dont know but hes coarse after all do you approve of his knowing so many peoples taches already  would it be any better later he asked in tern he seemed to find you interested  its very different with us were not young she urged only half seriously  her husband laughed i see you want me to defend him oh hello he cried and she saw burnamy coming toward them with a young lady who was nodding to them from as far as she could see them this is the easy kind of thing that makes you blush for the author if you find it in a novel     xxx  mrs march fairly took miss triscoe in her arms to kiss her do you know i felt it must be you all the time when did you come where is your father what hotel are you staying at  it appeared while miss triscoe was shaking hands with march that it was last night and her father was finishing his breakfast and it was one of the hotels on the hill on the way back to her father it appeared that he wished to consult marchs doctor not that there was anything the matter  the general himself was not much softened by the reunion with his fellowamericans he confided to them that his coffee was poisonous but he seemed standing up with the parisnew york chronicle folded in his hand to have drunk it all was march going off on his forenoon tramp he believed that was part of the treatment which was probably all humbug though he thought of trying it now he was there he was told the walks were fine he looked at burnamy as if he had been praising them and burnamy said he had been wondering if march would not like to try a mountain path back to his hotel he said not so sincerely that he thought mrs march would like it  i shall like your account of it she answered but ill walk back on a level if you please  oh yes miss triscoe pleaded come with us  she played a little comedy of meaning to go back with her father so gracefully that mrs march herself could scarcely have told just where the girls real purpose of going with burnamy began to be evident or just how she managed to make general triscoe beg to have the pleasure of seeing mrs march back to her hotel  march went with the young people across the meadow behind the posthof and up into the forest which began at the base of the mountain at first they tried to keep him in the range of their talk but he fell behind more and more and as the talk narrowed to themselves it was less and less possible to include him in it when it began to concern their common appreciation of the marches they even tried to get out of his hearing  theyre so young in their thoughts said burnamy and they seem as much interested in everything as they could have been thirty years ago they belong to a time when the world was a good deal fresher than it is now dont you think i mean in the eighteensixties  oh yes i can see that  i dont know why we shouldnt be born older in each generation than people were in the last perhaps we are he suggested  i dont know how you mean said the girl keeping vigorously up with him she let him take the jacket she threw off but she would not have his hand at the little steeps where he wanted to give it  i dont believe i can quite make it out myself but fancy a man that began to act at twenty quite unconsciously of course from the past experience of the whole race  he would be rather a dreadful person wouldnt he  rather monstrous yes he owned with a laugh but thats where the psychological interest would come in  as if she did not feel the notion quite pleasant she turned from it i suppose youve been writing all sorts of things since you came here  well it hasnt been such a great while as its seemed and ive had mr stollers psychological interests to look after  oh yes do you like him  i dont know hes a lump of honest selfishness he isnt bad you know where to have him hes simple too  you mean like mr march  i didnt mean that but why not theyre not of the same generation but stoller isnt modern  im very curious to see him said the girl  do you want me to introduce him  you can introduce him to papa  they stopped and looked across the curve of the mounting path down on march who had sunk on a wayside seat and was mopping his forehead he saw them and called up dont wait for me ill join you gradually  i dont want to lose you burnamy called back but he kept on with miss triscoe i want to get the hirschensprung in he explained its the cliff where a hunted deer leaped down several hundred feet to get away from an emperor who was after him  oh yes they have them everywhere  do they well anyway theres a noble view up there  there was no view on the way up the germans notion of a woodland is everywhere that of a dense forest such as their barbarous tribes primevally herded in it means the closeset stems of trees with their tops interwoven in a roof of boughs and leaves so densely that you may walk dry through it almost as long as a german shower lasts when the sun shines there is a pleasant greenish light in the aisles shot here and there with the gold that trickles through there is nothing of the accident of an american wood in these forests which have been watched and weeded by man ever since they burst the soil they remain nurseries but they have the charm which no human care can alienate the smell of their bark and their leaves and of the moist flowerless earth about their roots came to march where he sat rich with the memories of his countrybred youth and drugged all consciousness of his long life in cities since and made him a part of nature with dulled interests and dimmed perspectives so that for the moment he had the enjoyment of exemption from care there was no wild life to penetrate his isolation no birds not a squirrel not an insect an old man who had bidden him goodmorning as he came up kept fumbling at the path with his hoe and was less intrusive than if he had not been there  march thought of the impassioned existence of these young people playing the inevitable comedy of hide and seek which the youth of the race has played from the beginning of time the other invalids who haunted the forest and passed up and down before him in fulfilment of their several prescriptions had a thin unreality in spite of the physical bulk that prevailed among them and they heightened the relief that the forestspirit brought him from the strenuous contact of that young drama he had been almost painfully aware that the persons in it had met however little they knew it with an eagerness intensified by their brief separation and he fancied it was the girl who had unconsciously operated their reunion in response to the young mans longing her will making itself electrically felt through space by that sort of wireless telegraphy which love has long employed and science has just begun to imagine  he would have been willing that they should get home alone but he knew that his wife would require an account of them from him and though he could have invented something of the kind if it came to the worst he was aware that it would not do for him to arrive without them the thought goaded him from his seat and he joined the upward procession of his fellowsick as it met another procession straggling downward the ways branched in all directions with people on them everywhere bent upon building up in a month the health which they would spend the rest of the year in demolishing  he came upon his charges unexpectedly at a turn of the path and miss triscoe told him that he ought to have been with them for the view from the hirschensprung it was magnificent she said and she made burnamy corroborate her praise of it and agree with her that it was worth the climb a thousand times he modestly accepted the credit she appeared willing to give him of inventing the hirschensprung     xxxi  between his work for stoller and what sometimes seemed the obstructiveness of general triscoe burnamy was not very much with miss triscoe he was not devout but he went every sunday to the pretty english church on the hill where he contributed beyond his means to the support of the english clergy on the continent for the sake of looking at her back hair during the service and losing himself in the graceful lines which defined the girls figure from the slant of her flowery hat to the point where the pewtop crossed her elastic waist one happy morning the general did not come to church and he had the fortune to walk home with her to her pension where she lingered with him a moment and almost made him believe she might be going to ask him to come in  the next evening when he was sauntering down the row of glittering shops beside the tepl with mrs march they overtook the general and his daughter at a place where the girl was admiring some storkscissors in the window she said she wished she were still little so that she could get them they walked home with the triscoes and then he hurried mrs march back to the shop the man had already put up his shutters and was just closing his door but burnamy pushed in and asked to look at the storkscissors they had seen in the window the gas was out and the shopman lighted a very dim candle to show them  i knew you wanted to get them for her after what she said mrs march he laughed nervously and you must let me lend you the money  why of course she answered joyfully humoring his feint shall i put my card in for the man to send home to her with them  wellno no not your cardexactly or yes yes you must i suppose  they made the hushing street gay with their laughter the next evening miss triscoe came upon the marches and burnamy where they sat after supper listening to the concert at pupps and thanked mrs march for the scissors then she and burnamy had their laugh again and miss triscoe joined them to her fathers frowning mystification he stared round for a table they were all taken and he could not refuse the interest burnamy made with the waiters to bring them one and crowd it in he had to ask him to sup with them and burnamy sat down and heard the concert through beside miss triscoe  what is so tremendously amusing in a pair of storkscissors march demanded when his wife and he were alone  why i was wanting to tell you dearest she began in a tone which he felt to be wheedling and she told the story of the scissors  look here my dear didnt you promise to let this loveaffair alone  that was on the ship and besides what would you have done i should like to know would you have refused to let him buy them for her she added carelessly he wants us to go to the kurhaus ball with him  oh does he  yes he says he knows that she can get her father to let her go if we will chaperon them and i promised that you would  that i would  it will do just as well if you go and it will be very amusing you can see something of carlsbad society  but im not going he declared it would interfere with my cure the sitting up late would be bad enough but i should get very hungry and i should eat potato salad and sausages and drink beer and do all sorts of unwholesome things  nonsense the refreshments will be kurgemass of course  you can go yourself he said  a ball is not the same thing for a woman after fifty as it is before twenty but still it has claims upon the imagination and the novel circumstance of a ball in the kurhaus in carlsbad enhanced these for mrs march it was the annual reunion which is given by municipal authority in the large hall above the bathrooms it is frequented with safety and pleasure by curious strangers and now upon reflection it began to have for mrs march the charm of duty she believed that she could finally have made march go in her place but she felt that she ought really to go in his and save him from the late hours and the late supper  very well then she said at last i will go  it appeared that any civil person might go to the reunion who chose to pay two florins and a half there must have been some sort of restriction and the ladies of burnamys party went with a good deal of amused curiosity to see what the distinctions were but they saw none unless it was the advantages which the military had the long hall over the bathrooms shaped itself into a space for the dancing at one end and all the rest of it was filled with tables which at half past eight were crowded with people eating drinking and smoking the military enjoyed the monopoly of a table next the rail dividing the dancing from the dining space there the tightlaced herr hauptmanns and herr lieutenants sat at their sausage and beer and cigars in the intervals of the waltzes and strengthened themselves for a foray among the gracious fraus and frauleins on the benches lining three sides of the dancingspace from the gallery above many civilian spectators looked down upon the gayety and the dresscoats of a few citizens figured among the uniforms  as the evening wore on some ladies of greater fashion found their way to the dancingfloor and toward ten oclock it became rather crowded a party of american girls showed their paris dresses in the transatlantic versions of the waltz at first they danced with the young men who came with them but after a while they yielded to the custom of the place and danced with any of the officers who asked them  i know its the custom said mrs march to miss triscoe who was at her side in one of the waltzes she had decided to sit out so as not to be dancing all the time with burnamy but i never can like it without an introduction  no said the girl with the air of putting temptation decidedly away i dont believe papa would either  a young officer came up and drooped in mute supplication before her she glanced at mrs march who turned her face away and she excused herself with the pretence that she had promised the dance and by good fortune burnamy who had been unscrupulously waltzing with a lady he did not know came up at the moment she rose and put her hand on his arm and they both bowed to the officer before they whirled away the officer looked after them with amiable admiration then he turned to mrs march with a light of banter in his friendly eyes and was unmistakably asking her to dance she liked his ironical daring she liked it so much that she forgot her objection to partners without introductions she forgot her fiftyodd years she forgot that she was a mother of grown children and even a motherinlaw she remembered only the step of her outdated waltz  it seemed to be modern enough for the cheerful young officer and they were suddenly revolving with the rest   a tide of longforgotten girlhood welled up in her heart and she laughed as she floated off on it past the astonished eyes of miss triscoe and burnamy she saw them falter as if they had lost their step in their astonishment then they seemed both to vanish and her partner had released her and was helping miss triscoe up from the floor burnamy was brushing the dust from his knees and the citizen who had bowled them over was boisterously apologizing and incessantly bowing  oh are you hurt mrs march implored im sure you must be killed and i did it i dont know what i was thinking of  the girl laughed im not hurt a bit  they had one impulse to escape from the place and from the sympathy and congratulation in the dressingroom she declared again that she was all right how beautifully you waltz mrs march she said and she laughed again and would not agree with her that she had been ridiculous but im glad those american girls didnt see me and i cant be too thankful papa didnt come  mrs marchs heart sank at the thought of what general triscoe would think of her you must tell him i did it i can never lift up my head  no i shall not no one did it said the girl magnanimously she looked down sidelong at her draperies i was so afraid i had torn my dress i certainly heard something rip  it was one of the skirts of burnamys coat which he had caught into his hand and held in place till he could escape to the mens dressingroom where he had it pinned up so skillfully that the damage was not suspected by the ladies he had banged his knee abominably too but they did not suspect that either as he limped home on the air beside them first to miss triscoes pension and then to mrs marchs hotel  it was quite eleven oclock which at carlsbad is as late as three in the morning anywhere else when she let herself into her room she decided not to tell her husband then and even at breakfast which they had at the posthof she had not got to her confession though she had told him everything else about the ball when the young officer with whom she had danced passed between the tables near her he caught her eye and bowed with a smile of so much meaning that march asked whos your pretty young friend  oh that she answered carelessly that was one of the officers at the ball and she laughed  you seem to be in the joke too he said what is it  oh something ill tell you some time or perhaps youll find out  im afraid you wont let me wait  no i wont and now she told him she had expected teasing ridicule sarcasm anything but the psychological interest mixed with a sort of retrospective tenderness which he showed i wish i could have seen you i always thought you danced well he added it seems that you need a chaperon too  the next morning after march and general triscoe had started off upon one of the hill climbs the young people made her go with them for a walk up the tepl as far as the cafe of the freundschaftsaal in the grounds an artist in silhouettes was cutting out the likenesses of people who supposed themselves to have profiles and they begged mrs march to sit for hers it was so good that she insisted on miss triscoes sitting in turn and then burnamy then he had the inspiration to propose that they should all three sit together and it appeared that such a group was within the scope of the silhouettists art he posed them in his little bower and while he was mounting the picture they took turns at five kreutzers each in listening to american tunes played by his edison phonograph  mrs march felt that all this was weakening her moral fibre but she tried to draw the line at letting burnamy keep the group why not he pleaded  you oughtnt to ask she returned youve no business to have miss triscoes picture if you must know  but youre there to chaperon us he persisted  he began to laugh and they all laughed when she said you need a chaperon who doesnt lose her head in a silhouette but it seemed useless to hold out after that and she heard herself asking shall we let him keep it miss triscoe  burnamy went off to his work with stoller carrying the silhouette with him and she kept on with miss triscoe to her hotel in turning from the gate after she parted with the girl she found herself confronted with mrs adding and rose the ladies exclaimed at each other in an astonishment from which they had to recover before they could begin to talk but from the first moment mrs march perceived that mrs adding had something to say the more freely to say it she asked mrs march into her hotel which was in the same street with the pension of the triscoes and she let her boy go off about the exploration of carlsbad he promised to be back in an hour  well now what scrape are you in march asked when his wife came home and began to put off her things with signs of excitement which he could not fail to note he was lying down after a long tramp and he seemed very comfortable  his question suggested something of anterior import and she told him about the silhouettes and the advantage the young people had taken of their power over her through their knowledge of her foolish behavior at the ball  he said lazily they seem to be working you for all youre worth is that it  no there is something worse somethings happened which throws all that quite in the shade mrs adding is here  mrs adding he repeated with a dimness for names which she would not allow was growing on him  dont be stupid dear mrs adding who sat opposite mr kenby on the norumbia the mother of the nice boy  oh yes well thats good  no it isnt dont say such a thingtill you know she cried with a certain shrillness which warned him of an unfathomed seriousness in the fact he sat up as if better to confront the mystery i have been at her hotel and she has been telling me that shes just come from berlin and that mr kenbys been there andnow i wont have you making a joke of it or breaking out about it as if it were not a thing to be looked for though of course with the others on our hands youre not to blame for not thinking of it but you can see yourself that shes young and goodlooking she did speak beautifully of her son and if it were not for him i dont believe she would hesitate  for heavens sake what are you driving at march broke in and she answered him as vehemently  hes asked her to marry him  kenby mrs adding  yes  well now isabel this wont do they ought to be ashamed of themselves with that morbid sensitive boy its shocking  will you listen or do you want me to stop he arrested himself at her threat and she resumed after giving her contempt of his turbulence time to sink in she refused him of course  oh all right then  you take it in such a way that ive a great mind not to tell you anything more about it  i know you have he said stretching himself out again but youll do it all the same youd have been awfully disappointed if i had been calm and collected  she refused him she began again although she respects him because she feels that she ought to devote herself to her son of course shes very young still she was married when she was only nineteen to a man twice her age and shes not thirtyfive yet i dont think she ever cared much for her husband and she wants you to find out something about him  i never heard of him i  mrs march made a tchck that would have recalled the most consequent of men from the most logical and coherent interpretation to the true intent of her words he perceived his mistake and said resolutely well i wont do it if shes refused him thats the end of it she neednt know anything about him and she has no right to  now i think differently said mrs march with an inductive air of course she has to know about him now she stopped and march turned his head and looked expectantly at her he said he would not consider her answer final but would hope to see her again andshes afraid he may follow herwhat are you looking at me so for  is he coming here  am i to blame if he is he said he was going to write to her  march burst into a laugh well they havent been beating about the bush when i think how miss triscoe has been pursuing burnamy from the first moment she set eyes on him with the settled belief that she was running from him and he imagines that he has been boldly following her without the least hope from her i cant help admiring the simple directness of these elders  and if kenby wants to talk with you what will you say she cut in eagerly  ill say i dont like the subject what am i in carlsbad for i came for the cure and im spending time and money on it i might as well go and take my three cups of felsenquelle on a full stomach as to listen to kenby  i know its bad for you and i wish we had never seen those people said mrs march i dont believe hell want to talk with you but if  is mrs adding in this hotel im not going to have them round in my breadtrough  she isnt shes at one of the hotels on the hill  very well let her stay there then they can manage their loveaffairs in their own way the only one i care the least for is the boy  yes it is forlorn for him but he likes mr kenby andno its horrid and you cant make it anything else  well im not trying to he turned his face away i must get my nap now after she thought he must have fallen asleep he said the first thing you know those old eltwins will be coming round and telling us that theyre going to get divorced then he really slept     xxxii  the midday dinner at pupps was the time to see the carlsbad world and the marches had the habit of sitting long at table to watch it  there was one family in whom they fancied a sort of literary quality as if they had come out of some pleasant german story but they never knew anything about them the father by his dress must have been a protestant clergyman the mother had been a beauty and was still very handsome the daughter was goodlooking and of a goodbreeding which was both girlish and ladylike they commended themselves by always taking the table dhote dinner as the marches did and eating through from the soup and the rank freshwater fish to the sweet upon the same principle the husband ate all the compote and gave the others his dessert which was not good for him a young girl of a different fascination remained as much a mystery she was small and of an extreme tenuity which became more bewildering as she advanced through her meal especially at supper which she made of a long cucumber pickle a frankfort sausage of twice the pickles length and a towering goblet of beer in her lap she held a shivering little hound she was in the decorous keeping of an elderly maid and had every effect of being a gracious fraulein a curious contrast to her teutonic voracity was the temperance of a young latin swell imaginably from trieste who sat long over his small coffee and cigarette and tranquilly mused upon the pages of an italian newspaper at another table there was a very noisy lady short and fat in flowing draperies of white who commanded a sallow family of southamericans and loudly harangued them in southamerican spanish she flared out in a picture which nowhere lacked strong effects and in her background lurked a mysterious black face and figure ironically subservient to the old man the mild boy and the pretty young girl in the middle distance of the family group  amidst the shows of a hardened worldliness there were touching glimpses of domesticity and heart a young bride fed her husband soup from her own plate with her spoon unabashed by the publicity a mother and her two pretty daughters hung about a handsome officer who must have been newly betrothed to one of the girls and the whole family showed a helpless fondness for him which he did not despise though he held it in check the girls dressed alike and seemed to have for their whole change of costume a difference from time to time in the color of their sleeves the marches believed they had seen the growth of the romance which had eventuated so happily and they saw other romances which did not in any wise eventuate carlsbad was evidently one of the great marriage marts of middle europe where mothers brought their daughters to be admired and everywhere the flower of life was blooming for the hand of love it blew by on all the promenades in dresses and hats as pretty as they could be bought or imagined but it was chiefly at pupps that it flourished for the most part it seemed to flourish in vain and to be destined to be put by for another season to dream bulblike of the coming summer in the quiet of moldavian and transylvanian homes  perhaps it was oftener of fortunate effect than the spectators knew but for their own pleasure they would not have had their pang for it less and march objected to having a more explicit demand upon his sympathy we could have managed he said at the close of their dinner as he looked compassionately round upon the parterre of young girls we could have managed with burnamy and miss triscoe but to have mrs adding and kenby launched upon us is too much of course i like kenby and if the widow alone were concerned i would give him my blessing a wife more or a widow less is not going to disturb the equilibrium of the universe but he stopped and then he went on men and women are well enough they complement each other very agreeably and they have very good times together but why should they get in loveit is sure to make them uncomfortable to themselves and annoying to others he broke off and stared about him my dear this is really charmingalmost as charming as the posthof the crowd spread from the open vestibule of the hotel and the shelter of its branching pavilion roofs until it was dimmed in the obscurity of the low grove across the way in an ultimate depth where the musicians were giving the afternoon concert between its two stationary divisions moved a current of promenaders with some such effect as if the colors of a lovely garden should have liquefied and flowed in mingled rose and lilac pink and yellow and white and orange and all the middle tints of modern millinery above on one side were the agreeable bulks of architecture in the buff and gray of carlsbad and far beyond on the other were the upland slopes with villas and long curves of country roads belted in with miles of wall it would be about as offensive to have a loveinterest that one personally knew about intruded here he said as to have a twospanner carriage driven through this crowd it ought to be forbidden by the municipality  mrs march listened with her ears but not with her eyes and she answered see that handsome young greek priest isnt he an archimandrite the portier said he was  then let him pass for an archimandrite now he recurred to his grievance again dreamily i have got to take papa triscoe in hand and poison his mind against burnamy and i shall have to instil a few drops of venomous suspicion against kenby into the heart of poor little rose adding oh he broke out they will spoil everything theyll be with us morning noon and night and he went on to work the joke of repining at his lot the worst thing he said would be the lovers pretence of being interested in something besides themselves which they were no more capable of than so many lunatics how could they care for pretty girls playing tennis on an upland level in the waning afternoon or a cartful of peasant women stopping to cross themselves at a wayside shrine or a whistling boy with holes in his trousers pausing from some wayside raspberries to touch his hat and say goodmorning or those preposterous maidens sprinkling linen on the grass from wateringpots while the skies were full of rain or that blacksmith shop where peter the great made a horseshoe or the monument of the young warriorpoet koerner with a gentlelooking girl and her mother reading and knitting on a bench before it these simple pleasures sufficed them but what could lovers really care for them a peasant girl flung down on the grassy roadside fast asleep while her yokefellow the gray old dog lay in his harness near her with one drowsy eye half open for her and the other for the contents of their cart a boy chasing a red squirrel in the old upper town beyond the tepl and enlisting the interest of all the neighbors the negro doorkeeper at the golden shield who ought to have spoken our southern english but who spoke bad german and was from cairo the sweet afternoon stillness in the woods the good german mothers crocheting at the posthof concerts burnamy as a young poet might hate felt the precious quality of these things if his senses had not been holden by miss triscoe and she might have felt it if only he had done so but as it was it would be lost upon their preoccupation with mrs adding and kenby it would be hopeless  a day or two after mrs march had met mrs adding she went with her husband to revere a certain magnificent blackamoor whom he had discovered at the entrance of one of the aristocratic hotels on the schlossberg where he performed the function of a kind of caryatid and looked in the black of his skin and the white of his flowing costume like a colossal figure carved in ebony and ivory they took a roundabout way through a street entirely of villapensions every house in carlsbad but one is a pension if it is not an hotel but these were of a sort of sentimental prettiness with each a little garden before it and a bower with an iron table in it for breakfasting and supping outdoors and he said that they would be the very places for bridal couples who wished to spend the honeymoon in getting well of the wedding surfeit she denounced him for saying such a thing as that and for his inconsistency in complaining of lovers while he was willing to think of young married people he contended that there was a great difference in the sort of demand that young married people made upon the interest of witnesses and that they were at least on their way to sanity and before they agreed they had come to the hotel with the blackamoor at the door while they lingered sharing the splendid creatures hospitable pleasure in the spectacle he formed they were aware of a carriage with liveried coachman and footman at the steps of the hotel the liveries were very quiet and distinguished and they learned that the equipage was waiting for the prince of coburg or the princess of montenegro or prince henry of prussia there were differing opinions among the twenty or thirty bystanders mrs march said she did not care which it was and she was patient of the denouement which began to postpone itself with delicate delays after repeated agitations at the door among portiers proprietors and waiters whose fluttered spirits imparted their thrill to the spectators while the coachman and footman remained sculpturesquely impassive in their places the carriage moved aside and let an energetic american lady and her family drive up to the steps the hotel people paid her a tempered devotion but she marred the effect by rushing out and sitting on a balcony to wait for the delaying royalties there began to be more promises of their early appearance a footman got down and placed himself at the carriage door the coachman stiffened himself on his box then he relaxed the footman drooped and even wandered aside there came a moment when at some signal the carriage drove quite away from the portal and waited near the gate of the stableyard it drove back and the spectators redoubled their attention nothing happened and some of them dropped off at last an indescribable significance expressed itself in the official group at the door a man in a high hat and dresscoat hurried out a footman hurried to meet him they spoke inaudibly together the footman mounted to his place the coachman gathered up his reins and drove rapidly out of the hotelyard down the street round the corner out of sight the man in the tall hat and dresscoat went in the official group at the threshold dissolved the statue in ivory and ebony resumed its place evidently the hoheit of coburg or montenegro or prussia was not going to take the air  my dear this is humiliating  not at all i wouldnt have missed it for anything think how near we came to seeing them  i shouldnt feel so shabby if we had seen them but to hang round here in this plebeian abeyance and then to be defeated and defrauded at last i wonder how long this sort of thing is going on  what thing  this base subjection of the imagination to the tom foolery of the ages  i dont know what you mean im sure its very natural to want to see a prince  only too natural its so deeply founded in nature that after denying royalty by word and deed for a hundred years we americans are hungrier for it than anybody else perhaps we may come back to it  nonsense  they looked up at the austrian flag on the tower of the hotel languidly curling and uncurling in the bland evening air as it had over a thousand years of stupid and selfish monarchy while all the generous republics of the middle ages had perished and the commonwealths of later times had passed like fever dreams that dull inglorious empire had antedated or outlived venice and genoa florence and siena the england of cromwell the holland of the stadtholders and the france of many revolutions and all the fleeting democracies which sprang from these  march began to ask himself how his curiosity differed from that of the europeans about him then he became aware that these had detached themselves and left him exposed to the presence of a fellow countryman it was otterson with mrs otterson he turned upon march with hilarious recognition hello most of the americans in carlsbad seem to be hanging round here for a sight of these kings well we dont have a great many of em and its natural we shouldnt want to miss any but now you eastern fellows you go to europe every summer and yet you dont seem to get enough of em think its human nature or did it get so ground into us in the old times that we cant get it out no difference what we say  thats very much what ive been asking myself said march perhaps its any kind of show wed wait nearly as long for the president to come out wouldnt we  i reckon we would but we wouldnt for his nephew or his second cousin  well they wouldnt be in the way of the succession  i guess youre right the iowan seemed better satisfied with marchs philosophy than march felt himself and he could not forbear adding  but i dont deny that we should wait for the president because hes a kind of king too i dont know that we shall ever get over wanting to see kings of some kind or at least my wife wont may i present you to mrs march  happy to meet you mrs march said the iowan introduce you to mrs otterson im the fool in my family and i know just how you feel about a chance like this i dont mean that youre  they all laughed at the hopeless case and mrs march said with one of her unexpected likings i understand mr otterson and i would rather be our kind of fool than the kind that pretends not to care for the sight of a king  like you and me mrs otterson said march  indeed indeed said the lady id like to see a king too if it didnt take all night goodevening she said turning her husband about with her as if she suspected a purpose of patronage in mrs march and was not going to have it  otterson looked over his shoulder to explain despairingly the trouble with me is that when i do get a chance to talk english theres such a flow of language it carries me away and i dont know just where im landing     xxxiii  there were several kings and their kindred at carlsbad that summer one day the duchess of orleans drove over from marienbad attended by the duke on his bicycle after luncheon they reappeared for a moment before mounting to her carriage with their secretaries two young french gentlemen whose dress and bearing better satisfied mrs marchs exacting passion for an aristocratic air in their order the duke was fat and fair as a bourbon should be and the duchess fatter though not so fair as became a hapsburg but they were both more plebeianlooking than their retainers who were slender as well as young and as perfectly appointed as english tailors could imagine them  it wouldnt do for the very highest sort of highhotes march declared to look their own consequence personally they have to leave that like everything else to their inferiors  by a happy heterophemy of mrs marchs the german hoheit had now become highhote which was so much more descriptive that they had permanently adopted it and found comfort to their republican pride in the mockery which it poured upon the feudal structure of society they applied it with a certain compunction however to the king of servia who came a few days after the duke and duchess he was such a young king and of such a little country they watched for him from the windows of the readingroom while the crowd outside stood six deep on the three sides of the square before the hotel and the two plain public carriages which brought the king and his suite drew tamely up at the portal where the proprietor and some civic dignitaries received him his moderated approach so little like that of royalty on the stage to which americans are used allowed mrs march to make sure of the pale slight insignificant amiablelooking youth in spectacles as the sovereign she was ambuscading then no appeal to her principles could keep her from peeping through the readingroom door into the rotunda where the king graciously but speedily dismissed the civic gentlemen and the proprietor and vanished into the elevator she was destined to see him so often afterwards that she scarcely took the trouble to time her dining and supping by that of the simple potentate who had his meals in one of the public rooms with three gentlemen of his suite in sackcoats like himself after the informal manner of the place  still another potentate who happened that summer to be sojourning abroad in the interval of a successful rebellion was at the opera one night with some of his faithful followers burnamy had offered mrs march who supposed that he merely wanted her and her husband with him places in a box but after she eagerly accepted it seemed that he wished her to advise him whether it would do to ask miss triscoe and her father to join them  why not she returned with an arching of the eyebrows  why he said perhaps i had better make a clean breast of it  perhaps you had she said and they both laughed though he laughed with a knot between his eyes  the fact is you know this isnt my treat exactly its mr stollers at the surprise in her face he hurried on hes got back his first letter in the paper and hes so much pleased with the way he reads in print that he wants to celebrate  yes said mrs march noncommittally  burnamy laughed again but hes bashful and he isnt sure that you would all take it in the right way he wants you as friends of mine and he hasnt quite the courage to ask you himself  this seemed to mrs march so far from bad that she said thats very nice of him then hes satisfied withwith your help im glad of that  thank you hes met the triscoes and he thought it would be pleasant to you if they went too  oh certainly  he thought burnamy went on with the air of feeling his way that we might all go to the opera and thenthen go for a little supper afterwards at schwarzkopfs  he named the only place in carlsbad where you can sup so late as ten oclock as the opera begins at six and is over at half past eight none but the wildest roisterers frequent the place  oh said mrs march i dont know how a late supper would agree with my husbands cure i should have to ask him  we could make it very hygienic burnamy explained  in repeating his invitation she blamed burnamys uncandor so much that march took his part as perhaps she intended and said oh nonsense and that he should like to go in for the whole thing and general triscoe accepted as promptly for himself and his daughter that made six people burnamy counted up and he feigned a decent regret that there was not room for mrs adding and her son he would have liked to ask them  mrs march did not enjoy it so much as coming with her husband alone when they took two florin seats in the orchestra for the comedy the comedy always began half an hour earlier than the opera and they had a fiveoclock supper at the theatrecafe before they went and they got to sleep by nine oclock now they would be up till half past ten at least and that orgy at schwarzkopfs might not be at all good for him but still she liked being there and miss triscoe made her take the best seat burnamy and stoller made the older men take the other seats beside the ladies while they sat behind or stood up when they wished to see as people do in the back of a box stoller was not much at ease in evening dress but he bore himself with a dignity which was not perhaps so gloomy as it looked mrs march thought him handsome in his way and required miss triscoe to admire him as for burnamys beauty it was not necessary to insist upon that he had the distinction of slender youth and she liked to think that no highhote there was of a more patrician presence than this yet unprinted contributor to every other week he and stoller seemed on perfect terms or else in his joy he was able to hide the uneasiness which she had fancied in him from the first time she saw them together and which had never been quite absent from his manner in stollers presence her husband always denied that it existed or if it did that it was anything but burnamys effort to get on common ground with an inferior whom fortune had put over him  the young fellow talked with stoller and tried to bring him into the range of the general conversation he leaned over the ladies from time to time and pointed out the notables whom he saw in the house she was glad for his sake that he did not lean less over her than over miss triscoe he explained certain military figures in the boxes opposite and certain ladies of rank who did not look their rank miss triscoe to mrs marchs thinking looked their united ranks and more her dress was very simple but of a touch which saved it from being insipidly girlish her beauty was dazzling  do you see that old fellow in the corner chair just behind the orchestra asked burnamy hes ninetysix years old and he comes to the theatre every night and falls asleep as soon as the curtain rises and sleeps through till the end of the act  how dear said the girl leaning forward to fix the nonagenarian with her glasses while many other glasses converged upon her oh wouldnt you like to know him mr march  i should consider it a liberal education they have brought these things to a perfect system in europe there is nothing to make life pass smoothly like inflexible constancy to an entirely simple custom my dear he added to his wife i wish wed seen this sage before hed have helped us through a good many hours of unintelligible comedy im always coming as burnamys guest after this  the young fellow swelled with pleasure in his triumph and casting an eye about the theatre to cap it he caught sight of that other potentate he whispered joyfully ah weve got two kings here tonight and he indicated in a box of their tier just across from that where the king of servia sat the wellknown face of the king of new york  he isnt badlooking said march handing his glass to general triscoe ive not seen many kings in exile a matter of a few carlist princes and exsovereign dukes and the good henry v of france once when i was staying a month in venice but i dont think they any of them looked the part better i suppose he has his dream of recurring power like the rest  dream said general triscoe with the glass at his eyes hes dead sure of it  oh you dont really mean that  i dont know why i should have changed my mind  then its as if we were in the presence of charles ii just before he was called back to england or napoleon in the last moments of elba its better than that the thing is almost unique its a new situation in history heres a sovereign who has no recognized function no legal status no objective existence he has no sort of public being except in the affection of his subjects it took an upheaval little short of an earthquake to unseat him his rule as we understand it was bad for all classes the poor suffered more than the rich the people have now had three years of selfgovernment and yet this wonderful man has such a hold upon the masses that he is going home to win the cause of oppression at the head of the oppressed when hes in power again he will be as subjective as ever with the power of civic life and death and an idolatrous following perfectly ruthless in the execution of his will  weve only begun said the general this kind of king is municipal now but hes going to be national and then goodby republic  the only thing like it march resumed too incredulous of the evil future to deny himself the aesthetic pleasure of the parallel is the rise of the medici in florence but even the medici were not mere manipulators of pulls they had some sort of public office with some sort of legislated tenure of it the king of new york is sovereign by force of will alone and he will reign in the voluntary submission of the majority is our national dictator to be of the same nature and quality  it would be the scientific evolution wouldnt it  the ladies listened with the perfunctory attention which women pay to any sort of inquiry which is not personal stoller had scarcely spoken yet he now startled them all by demanding with a sort of vindictive force why shouldnt he have the power if theyre willing to let him  yes said general triscoe with a tilt of his head towards march thats what we must ask ourselves more and more  march leaned back in his chair and looked up over his shoulder at stoller well i dont know do you think its quite right for a man to use an unjust power even if others are willing that he should  stoller stopped with an air of bewilderment as if surprised on the point of saying that he thought just this he asked instead whats wrong about it  well thats one of those things that have to be felt i suppose but if a man came to you and offered to be your slave for a certain considerationsay a comfortable house and a steady job that wasnt too hardshould you feel it morally right to accept the offer i dont say think it right for there might be a kind of logic for it  stoller seemed about to answer he hesitated and before he had made any response the curtain rose     xxxiv  there are few prettier things than carlsbad by night from one of the many bridges which span the tepl in its course through the town if it is a starry night the torrent glides swiftly away with an inverted firmament in its bosom to which the lamps along its shores and in the houses on either side contribute a planetary splendor of their own by nine oclock everything is hushed not a wheel is heard at that dead hour the few feet shuffling stealthily through the alte wiese whisper a caution of silence to those issuing with a less guarded tread from the opera the little bowers that overhang the stream are as dark and mute as the restaurants across the way which serve meals in them by day the whole place is as forsaken as other cities at midnight people get quickly home to bed or if they have a mind to snatch a belated joy they slip into the theatercafe where the sleepy frauleins serve them in an exemplary drowse with plates of cold ham and bottles of the gently gaseous waters of giesshubl few are of the bold badness which delights in a supper at schwarzkopfs and even these are glad of the drawn curtains which hide their orgy from the chance passer  the invalids of burnamys party kept together strengthening themselves in a mutual purpose not to be tempted to eat anything which was not strictly kurgemass mrs march played upon the interest which each of them felt in his own case so artfully that she kept them talking of their cure and left burnamy and miss triscoe to a moment on the bridge by which they profited while the others strolled on to lean against the parapet and watch the lights in the skies and the water and be alone together the stream shone above and below and found its way out of and into the darkness under the successive bridges the town climbed into the night with lamplit windows here and there till the woods of the hillsides darkened down to meet it and fold it in an embrace from which some white edifice showed palely in the farthest gloom  he tried to make her think they could see that great iron crucifix which watches over it day and night from its piny cliff he had a fancy for a poem very impressionistic which should convey the notion of the crucifixs vigil he submitted it to her and they remained talking till the others had got out of sight and hearing and she was letting him keep the hand on her arm which he had put there to hold her from falling over the parapet when they were both startled by approaching steps and a voice calling look here whos running this supper party anyway  his wife had detached march from her group for the mission as soon as she felt that the young people were abusing her kindness they answered him with hysterical laughter and burnamy said why its mr stollers treat you know  at the restaurant where the proprietor obsequiously met the party on the threshold and bowed them into a pretty inner room with a table set for their supper stoller had gained courage to play the host openly he appointed general triscoe to the chief seat he would have put his daughter next to him if the girl had not insisted upon mrs marchs having the place and going herself to sit next to march whom she said she had not been able to speak a word to the whole evening but she did not talk a great deal to him he smiled to find how soon he dropped out of the conversation and burnamy from his greater remoteness across the table dropped into it he really preferred the study of stoller whose instinct of a greater worldly quality in the triscoes interested him he could see him listening now to what general triscoe was saying to mrs march and now to what burnamy was saying to miss triscoe his strong selfish face as he turned it on the young people expressed a mingled grudge and greed that was very curious  stollers courage which had come and gone at moments throughout rose at the end and while they lingered at the table well on to the hour of ten he said in the sort of helpless offence he had with burnamy whats the reason we cant all go out tomorrow to that old castle you was talking about  to engelhaus i dont know any reason as far as im concerned answered burnamy but he refused the initiative offered him and stoller was obliged to ask march  you heard about it  yes general triscoe was listening and march added for him it was the hold of an old robber baron gustavus adolphus knocked it down and its very picturesque i believe  it sounds promising said the general where is it  isnt tomorrow our mineral bath mrs march interposed between her husband and temptation  no the day after why its about ten or twelve miles out on the old postroad that napoleon took for prague  napoleon knew a good road when he saw it said the general and he alone of the company lighted a cigar he was decidedly in favor of the excursion and he arranged for it with stoller whom he had the effect of using for his pleasure as if he were doing him a favor they were six and two carriages would take them a twospanner for four and a onespanner for two they could start directly after dinners and get home in time for supper  stoller asserted himself to say thats all right then i want you to be my guests and ill see about the carriages he turned to burnamy will you order them  oh said the young fellow with a sort of dryness the portier will get them  i dont understand why general triscoe was so willing to accept surely he cant like that man said mrs march to her husband in their own room  oh i fancy that wouldnt be essential the general seems to me capable of letting even an enemy serve his turn why didnt you speak if you didnt want to go  why didnt you  i wanted to go  and i knew it wouldnt do to let miss triscoe go alone i could see that she wished to go  do you think burnamy did  he seemed rather indifferent and yet he must have realized that he would be with miss triscoe the whole afternoon     xxxv  if burnamy and miss triscoe took the lead in the onespanner and the others followed in the twospanner it was not from want of politeness on the part of the young people in offering to give up their places to each of their elders in turn it would have been grotesque for either march or stoller to drive with the girl for her father it was apparently no question after a glance at the more rigid uprightness of the seat in the onespanner and he accepted the place beside mrs march on the back seat of the twospanner without demur he asked her leave to smoke and then he scarcely spoke to her but he talked to the two men in front of him almost incessantly haranguing them upon the inferiority of our conditions and the futility of our hopes as a people with the effect of bewildering the cruder arrogance of stoller who could have got on with triscoes contempt for the worthlessness of our workingclasses but did not know what to do with his scorn of the vulgarity and venality of their employers he accused some of stollers most honored and envied capitalists of being the source of our worst corruptions and guiltier than the votingcattle whom they bought and sold  i think we can get rid of the whole trouble if we go at it the right way stoller said diverging for the sake of the point he wished to bring in i believe in having the government run on business principles theyve got it here in carlsbad already just the right sort of thing and it works i been lookin into it and i got this young man yonderhe twisted his hand in the direction of the onespanner to help me put it in shape i believe its going to make our folks think the best ones among them here he drew a newspaper out of his pocket folded to show two columns in their full length and handed it to triscoe who took it with no great eagerness and began to run his eye over it you tell me what you think of that ive put it out for a kind of a feeler i got some money in that paper and i just thought id let our people see how a city can be managed on business principles  he kept his eye eagerly upon triscoe as if to follow his thought while he read and keep him up to the work and he ignored the marches so entirely that they began in selfdefence to talk with each other  their carriage had climbed from carlsbad in long irregular curves to the breezy upland where the great highroad to prague ran through fields of harvest they had come by heights and slopes of forest where the serried stems of the tall firs showed brown and whitishblue and grew straight as stalks of grain and now on either side the farms opened under a sky of unwonted cloudlessness narrow strips of wheat and rye which the men were cutting with sickles and the women in red bodices were binding alternated with ribands of yellowing oats and grass and breadths of beets and turnips with now and then lengths of ploughed land in the meadows the peasants were piling their carts with heavy rowen the girls lifting the hay on the forks and the men giving themselves the lighter labor of ordering the load from the upturned earth where there ought to have been troops of strutting crows a few sombre ravens rose but they could not rob the scene of its gayety it smiled in the sunshine with colors which vividly followed the slope of the land till they were dimmed in the forests on the faroff mountains nearer and farther the cottages and villages shone in the valleys or glimmered through the veils of the distant haze over all breathed the keen pure air of the hills with a sentiment of changeless eld which charmed march back to his boyhood where he lost the sense of his wifes presence and answered her vaguely she talked contentedly on in the monologue to which the wives of absentminded men learn to resign themselves they were both roused from their vagary by the voice of general triscoe he was handing back the folded newspaper to stoller and saying with a queer look at him over his glasses i should like to see what your contemporaries have to say to all that  well sir stoller returned maybe ill have the chance to show you they got my instructions over there to send everything to me  burnamy and miss triscoe gave little heed to the landscape as landscape they agreed that the human interest was the great thing on a landscape after all but they ignored the peasants in the fields and meadows who were no more to them than the driver on the box or the people in the twospanner behind they were talking of the hero and heroine of a novel they had both read and he was saying i suppose you think he was justly punished  punished she repeated why they got married after all  yes but you could see that they were not going to be happy  then it seems to me that she was punished too  well yes you might say that the author couldnt help that  miss triscoe was silent a moment before she said  i always thought the author was rather hard on the hero the girl was very exacting  why said burnamy i supposed that women hated anything like deception in men too much to tolerate it at all of course in this case he didnt deceive her he let her deceive herself but wasnt that worse  yes that was worse she could have forgiven him for deceiving her  oh  he might have had to do that she wouldnt have minded his fibbing outright so much for then it wouldnt have seemed to come from his nature but if he just let her believe what wasnt true and didnt say a word to prevent her of course it was worse it showed something weak something cowardly in him  burnamy gave a little cynical laugh i suppose it did but dont you think its rather rough expecting us to have all the kinds of courage  yes it is she assented that is why i say she was too exacting but a man oughnt to defend him  burnamys laugh had more pleasure in it now another woman might  no she might excuse him  he turned to look back at the twospanner it was rather far behind and he spoke to their driver bidding him go slowly till it caught up with them by the time it did so they were so close to it that they could distinguish the lines of its wandering and broken walls ever since they had climbed from the wooded depths of the hills above carlsbad to the open plateau it had shown itself in greater and greater detail the detached mound of rock on which it stood rose like an island in the midst of the plain and commanded the highways in every direction  i believe burnamy broke out with a bitterness apparently relevant to the ruin alone that if you hadnt required any quarterings of nobility from him stoller would have made a good sort of robber baron hes a robber baron by nature now and he wouldnt have any scruple in levying tribute on us here in our onespanner if his castle was in good repair and his crossbowmen were not on a strike but they would be on a strike probably and then he would lock them out and employ none but nonunion crossbowmen  if miss triscoe understood that he arraigned the morality as well as the civility of his employer she did not take him more seriously than he meant apparently for she smiled as she said i dont see how you can have anything to do with him if you feel so about him  oh burnamy replied in kind he buys my poverty and not my will and perhaps if i thought better of myself i should respect him more  have you been doing something very wicked  what should you have to say to me if i had he bantered  oh i should have nothing at all to say to you she mocked back  they turned a corner of the highway and drove rattling through a village street up a long slope to the rounded hill which it crowned a church at its base looked out upon an irregular square  a gaunt figure of a man with a staring mask which seemed to hide a darkling mind within came out of the church and locked it behind him he proved to be the sacristan and the keeper of all the villages claims upon the visitors interest he mastered after a moment their wishes in respect to the castle and showed the path that led to it at the top he said they would find a custodian of the ruins who would admit them     xxxvi  the path to the castle slanted upward across the shoulder of the hill to a certain point and there some rude stone steps mounted more directly wilding lilacbushes as if from some forgotten garden bordered the ascent the chickory opened its blue flower the clean bitter odor of vermouth rose from the trodden turf but nature spreads no such lavish feast in wood or field in the old world as she spoils us with in the new a few kinds repeated again and again seem to be all her store and man must make the most of them miss triscoe seemed to find flowers enough in the simple bouquet which burnamy put together for her she took it and then gave it back to him that she might have both hands for her skirt and so did him two favors  a superannuated forester of the nobleman who owns the ruin opened a gate for the party at the top and levied a tax of thirty kreutzers each upon them for its maintenance the castle by his story had descended from robber sire to robber son till gustavus knocked it to pieces in the sixteenth century three hundred years later the present owner restored it and now its broken walls and arches built of rubble mixed with brick and neatly pointed up with cement form a ruin satisfyingly permanent the walls were not of great extent but such as they were they enclosed several dungeons and a chapel all underground and a cistern which once enabled the barons and their retainers to water their wine in time of siege  from that height they could overlook the neighboring highways in every direction and could bring a merchant train to with a shaft from a crossbow or a shot from an arquebuse at pleasure with general triscoes leave march praised the strategic strength of the unique position which he found expressive of the past and yet suggestive of the present it was more a difference in method than anything else that distinguished the levy of customs by the authorities then and now what was the essential difference between taking tribute of travellers passing on horseback and collecting dues from travellers arriving by steamer they did not pay voluntarily in either case but it might be proof of progress that they no longer fought the customs officials  then you believe in free trade said stoller severely  no i am just inquiring which is the best way of enforcing the tariff laws  i saw in the paris chronicle last night said miss triscoe that people are kept on the docks now for hours and ladies cry at the way their things are tumbled over by the inspectors  its shocking said mrs march magisterially  it seems to be a return to the scenes of feudal times her husband resumed but im glad the travellers make no resistance im opposed to private war as much as i am to free trade  it all comes round to the same thing at last said general triscoe your precious humanity  oh i dont claim it exclusively march protested  well then our precious humanity is like a man that has lost his road he thinks he is finding his way out but he is merely rounding on his course and coming back to where he started  stoller said i think we ought to make it so rough for them over here that they will come to america and set up if they cant stand the duties  oh we ought to make it rough for them anyway march consented  if stoller felt his irony he did not know what to answer he followed with his eyes the manoeuvre by which burnamy and miss triscoe eliminated themselves from the discussion and strayed off to another corner of the ruin where they sat down on the turf in the shadow of the wall a thin upland breeze drew across them but the sun was hot the land fell away from the height and then rose again on every side in carpetlike fields and in long curving bands whose parallel colors passed unblended into the distance i dont suppose burnamy said that life ever does much better than this do you i feel like knocking on a piece of wood and saying unberufen i might knock on your bouquet thats wood  it would spoil the flowers she said looking down at them in her belt she looked up and their eyes met  i wonder he said presently what makes us always have a feeling of dread when we are happy  do you have that too she asked  yes perhaps its because we know that change must come and it must be for the worse  that must be it i never thought of it before though  if we had got so far in science that we could predict psychological weather and could know twentyfour hours ahead when a warm wave of bliss or a cold wave of misery was coming and prepare for smiles and tears beforehandit may come to that  i hope it wont id rather not know when i was to be happy it would spoil the pleasure and wouldnt be any compensation when it was the other way  a shadow fell across them and burnamy glanced round to see stoller looking down at them with a slant of the face that brought his aquiline profile into relief oh have a turf mr stoller he called gayly up to him  i guess weve seen about all there is he answered hadnt we better be going he probably did not mean to be mandatory  all right said burnamy and he turned to speak to miss triscoe again without further notice of him  they all descended to the church at the foot of the hill where the weird sacristan was waiting to show them the cold bare interior and to account for its newness with the fact that the old church had been burnt and this one built only a few years before then he locked the doors after them and ran forward to open against their coming the chapel of the village cemetery which they were to visit after they had fortified themselves for it at the village cafe  they were served by a little hunchback maid and she told them who lived in the chief house of the village it was uncommonly pretty where all the houses were picturesque and she spoke of it with respect as the dwelling of a rich magistrate who was clearly the great man of the place march admired the cat which rubbed against her skirt while she stood and talked and she took his praises modestly for the cat but they wrought upon the envy of her brother so that he ran off to the garden and came back with two fat sleepyeyed puppies which he held up with an arm across each of their stomachs for the acclaim of the spectators  oh give him something mrs march entreated hes such a dear  no no i am not going to have my little hunchback and her cat outdone he refused and then he was about to yield  hold on said stoller assuming the host i got the change  he gave the boy a few kreutzers when mrs march had meant her husband to reward his naivete with half a florin at least but he seemed to feel that he had now ingratiated himself with the ladies and he put himself in charge of them for the walk to the cemetery chapel he made miss triscoe let him carry her jacket when she found it warm  the chapel is dedicated to the holy trinity and the jesuit brother who designed it two or three centuries ago indulged a devotional fancy in the triangular form of the structure and the decorative details everything is threecornered the whole chapel to begin with and then the ark of the high altar in the middle of it and each of the three sidealtars the clumsy baroque taste of the architecture is a german version of the impulse that was making italy fantastic at the time the carving is coarse and the color harsh and unsoftened by years though it is broken and obliterated in places  the sacristan said that the chapel was never used for anything but funeral services and he led the way out into the cemetery where he wished to display the sepultural devices the graves here were planted with flowers and some were in a mourning of black pansies but a space fenced apart from the rest held a few neglected mounds overgrown with weeds and brambles this space he said was for suicides but to march it was not so ghastly as the dapper grief of certain tombs in consecrated ground where the stones had photographs of the dead on porcelain let into them one was the picture of a beautiful young woman who had been the wife of the local magnate an eternal love was vowed to her in the inscription but now the sacristan said with nothing of irony the magnate was married again and lived in that prettiest house of the village he seemed proud of the monument as the thing worthiest the attention of the strangers and he led them with less apparent hopefulness to the unfinished chapel representing a gethsemane with the figure of christ praying and his apostles sleeping it is a subject much celebrated in terracotta about carlsbad and it was not a novelty to his party still from its surroundings it had a fresh pathos and march tried to make him understand that they appreciated it he knew that his wife wished the poor man to think he had done them a great favor in showing it he had been touched with all the vain shows of grief in the poor ugly little place most of all he had felt the exile of those who had taken their own lives and were parted in death from the more patient sufferers who had waited for god to take them with a curious unpainful selfanalysis he noted that the older members of the party who in the course of nature were so much nearer death did not shrink from its shows but the young girl and the young man had not borne to look on them and had quickly escaped from the place somewhere outside the gate was it the beginning the promise of that reconciliation with death which nature brings to life at last or was it merely the effect or defect of ossified sensibilities of toughened nerves  that is all he asked of the spectral sacristan  that is all the man said and march felt in his pocket for a coin commensurate to the service he had done them it ought to be something handsome  no no said stoller detecting his gesture your money ant good  he put twenty or thirty kreutzers into the hand of the man who regarded them with a disappointment none the less cruel because it was so patient in france he would have been insolent in italy he would have frankly said it was too little here he merely looked at the money and whispered a sad danke  burnamy and miss triscoe rose from the grassy bank outside where they were sitting and waited for the elders to get into their twospanner  oh have i lost my glove in there said mrs march looking at her hands and such parts of her dress as a glove might cling to  let me go and find it for you burnamy entreated  well she consented and she added if the sacristan has found it give him something for me something really handsome poor fellow  as burnamy passed her she let him see that she had both her gloves and her heart yearned upon him for his instant smile of intelligence some men would have blundered out that she had the lost glove in her hand he came back directly saying no he didnt find it  she laughed and held both gloves up no wonder i had it all the time thank you ever so much  how are we going to ride back asked stoller  burnamy almost turned pale miss triscoe smiled impenetrably no one else spoke and mrs march said with placid authority oh i think the way we came is best  did that absurd creature she apostrophized her husband as soon as she got him alone after their arrival at pupps think i was going to let him drive back with agatha  i wonder said march if thats what burnamy calls her now  i shall despise him if it isnt     xxxvii  burnamy took up his mail to stoller after the supper which they had eaten in a silence natural with two men who have been off on a picnic together he did not rise from his writingdesk when burnamy came in and the young man did not sit down after putting his letters before him he said with an effort of forcing himself to speak at once i have looked through the papers and there is something that i think you ought to see  what do you mean said stoller  burnamy laid down three or four papers opened to pages where certain articles were strongly circumscribed in ink the papers varied but their editorials did not in purport at least some were grave and some were gay one indignantly denounced another affected an ironical bewilderment the third simply had fun with the hon jacob stoller they all however treated his letter on the city government of carlsbad as the praise of municipal socialism and the paper which had fun with him gleefully congratulated the dangerous classes on the accession of the honorable jacob to their ranks  stoller read the articles one after another with parted lips and gathering drops of perspiration on his upper lip while burnamy waited on foot he flung the papers all down at last why theyre a pack of fools they dont know what theyre talking about i want city government carried on on business principles by the people for the people i dont care what they say i know im right and im going ahead on this line if it takes all the note of defiance died out of his voice at the sight of burnamys pale face whats the matter with you  theres nothing the matter with me  do you mean to tell me it ishe could not bring himself to use the wordwhat they say  i suppose said burnamy with a dry mouth its what you may call municipal socialism  stoller jumped from his seat and you knew it when you let me do it  i supposed you knew what you were about  its a lie stoller advanced upon him wildly and burnamy took a step backward  look out shouted burnamy you never asked me anything about it you told me what you wanted done and i did it how could i believe you were such an ignoramus as not to know the a b c of the thing you were talking about he added in cynical contempt but you neednt worry you can make it right with the managers by spending a little more money than you expected to spend  stoller started as if the word money reminded him of something i can take care of myself young man how much do i owe you  nothing said burnamy with an effort for grandeur which failed him  the next morning as the marches sat over their coffee at the posthof he came dragging himself toward them with such a haggard air that mrs march called before he reached their table why mr burnamy whats the matter  he smiled miserably oh i havent slept very well may i have my coffee with you i want to tell you something i want you to make me but i cant speak till the coffee comes fraulein he besought a waitress going off with a tray near them tell lili please to bring me some coffeeonly coffee  he tried to make some talk about the weather which was rainy and the marches helped him but the poor endeavor lagged wretchedly in the interval between the ordering and the coming of the coffee ah thank you lili he said with a humility which confirmed mrs march in her instant belief that he had been offering himself to miss triscoe and been rejected after gulping his coffee he turned to her i want to say goodby im going away  from carlsbad asked mrs march with a keen distress  the water came into his eyes dont dont be good to me mrs march i cant stand it but you wont when you know  he began to speak of stoller first to her but addressing himself more and more to the intelligence of march who let him go on without question and laid a restraining hand upon his wife when he saw her about to prompt him at the end thats all he said huskily and then he seemed to be waiting for marchs comment he made none and the young fellow was forced to ask well what do you think mr march  what do you think yourself  i think i behaved badly said burnamy and a movement of protest from mrs march nerved him to add i could make out that it was not my business to tell him what he was doing but i guess it was i guess i ought to have stopped him or given him a chance to stop himself i suppose i might have done it if he had treated me decently when i turned up a day late here or hadnt acted toward me as if i were a hand in his buggyworks that had come in an hour after the whistle sounded  he set his teeth and an indignant sympathy shone in mrs marchs eyes but her husband only looked the more serious  he asked gently do you offer that fact as an explanation or as a justification  burnamy laughed forlornly it certainly wouldnt justify me you might say that it made the case all the worse for me march forbore to say and burnamy went on but i didnt suppose they would be onto him so quick or perhaps at all i thoughtif i thought anythingthat it would amuse some of the fellows in the office who know about those things he paused and in marchs continued silence he went on the chance was one in a hundred that anybody else would know where he had brought up  but you let him take that chance march suggested  yes i let him take it oh you know how mixed all these things are  yes  of course i didnt think it out at the time but i dont deny that i had a satisfaction in the notion of the hornets nest he was poking his thick head into it makes me sick now to think i had i oughtnt to have let him he was perfectly innocent in it after the letter went i wanted to tell him but i couldnt and then i took the chances too i dont believe he could have ever got forward in politics hes too honestor he isnt dishonest in the right way but that doesnt let me out i dont defend myself i did wrong i behaved badly but ive suffered for it  ive had a foreboding all the time that it would come to the worst and felt like a murderer with his victim when ive been alone with stoller when i could get away from him i could shake it off and even believe that it hadnt happened you cant think what a nightmare its been well ive ruined stoller politically but ive ruined myself too ive spoiled my own life ive done what i can never explain toto the people i want to have believe in me ive got to steal away like the thief i am goodby he jumped to his feet and put out his hand to march and then to mrs march  why youre not going away now she cried in a daze  yes i am i shall leave carlsbad on the elevenoclock train i dont think i shall see you again he clung to her hand if you see general triscoei wish youd tell them i couldntthat i had tothat i was called away suddenlygoodby he pressed her hand and dropped it and mixed with the crowd then he came suddenly back with a final appeal to march should youdo you think i ought to see stoller andand tell him i dont think i used him fairly  you ought to know march began  but before he could say more burnamy said youre right and was off again  oh how hard you were with him my dear mrs march lamented  i wish he said if our boy ever went wrong that some one would be as true to him as i was to that poor fellow he condemned himself and he was right he has behaved very badly  you always overdo things so when you act righteously  now isabel  oh yes i know what you will say but i should have tempered justice with mercy  her nerves tingled with pity for burnamy but in her heart she was glad that her husband had had strength to side with him against himself and she was proud of the forbearance with which he had done it in their earlier married life she would have confidently taken the initiative on all moral questions she still believed that she was better fitted for their decision by her puritan tradition and her new england birth but once in a great crisis when it seemed a question of their living she had weakened before it and he with no such advantages had somehow met the issue with courage and conscience she could not believe he did so by inspiration but she had since let him take the brunt of all such issues and the responsibility he made no reply and she said i suppose youll admit now there was always something peculiar in the poor boys manner to stoller  he would confess no more than that there ought to have been i dont see how he could stagger through with that load on his conscience im not sure i like his being able to do so  she was silent in the misgiving which she shared with him but she said i wonder how far it has gone with him and miss triscoe  well from his wanting you to give his message to the general in the plural  dont laugh its wicked to laugh its heartless she cried hysterically what will he do poor fellow  ive an idea that he will light on his feet somehow but at any rate hes doing the right thing in going to own up to stoller  oh stoller i care nothing for stoller dont speak to me of stoller  burnamy fond the bird of prey as he no longer had the heart to call him walking up and down in his room like an eagle caught in a trap he erected his crest fiercely enough though when the young fellow came in at his loudly shouted herein  what do you want he demanded brutally  this simplified burnamys task while it made it more loathsome he answered not much less brutally i want to tell you that i think i used you badly that i let you betray yourself that i feel myself to blame he could have added curse you without change of tone  stoller sneered in a derision that showed his lower teeth like a dogs when he snarls you want to get back  no said burnamy mildly and with increasing sadness as he spoke i dont want to get back nothing would induce me im going away on the first train  well youre not shouted stoller youve lied me into this  look out burnamy turned white  didnt you lie me into it if you let me fool myself as you say stoller pursued and burnamy felt himself weaken through his wrath well then you got to lie me out of it i been going over the damn thing all nightand you can do it for me i know you can do it he gave way in a plea that was almost a whimper look here you see if you cant ill make it all right with you ill pay you whatever you think is rightwhatever you say  oh said burnamy in otherwise unutterable disgust  you kin stoller went on breaking down more and more into his adopted hoosier in the stress of his anxiety i know you kin mr burnamy he pushed the paper containing his letter into burnamys hands and pointed out a succession of marked passages there and here and this place dont you see how you could make out that it meant something else or was just ironical he went on to prove how the text might be given the complexion he wished and burnamy saw that he had really thought it not impossibly out i cant put it in writing as well as you but ive done all the work and all youve got to do is to give it some of them turns of yours ill cable the fellows in our office to say ive been misrepresented and that my correction is coming well get it into shape here together and then ill cable that i dont care for the money and ill get our countingroom to see this scoundrelhe picked up the paper that had had fun with himand fix him all right so that hell ask for a suspension of public opinion andyou see dont you  the thing did appeal to burnamy if it could be done it would enable him to make stoller the reparation he longed to make him more than anything else in the world but he heard himself saying very gently almost tenderly it might be done mr stoller but i couldnt do it it wouldnt be honestfor me  yah yelled stoller and he crushed the paper into a wad and flung it into burnamys face honest you damn humbug you let me in for this when you knew i didnt mean it and now you wont help me out because it ant honest get out of my room and get out quick before i  he hurled himself toward burnamy who straightened himself with if you dare he knew that he was right in refusing but he knew that stoller was right too and that he had not meant the logic of what he had said in his letter and of what burnamy had let him imply he braved stollers onset and he left his presence untouched but feeling as little a moral hero as he well could     xxxviii  general triscoe woke in the bad humor of an elderly man after a days pleasure and in the selfreproach of a pessimist who has lost his point of view for a time and has to work back to it he began at the belated breakfast with his daughter when she said after kissing him gayly in the small twoseated bower where they breakfasted at their hotel when they did not go to the posthof didnt you have a nice time yesterday papa  she sank into the chair opposite and beamed at him across the little iron table as she lifted the pot to pour out his coffee  what do you call a nice time he temporized not quite able to resist her gayety  well the kind of time i had  did you get rheumatism from sitting on the grass i took cold in that old church and the tea at that restaurant must have been brewed in a brass kettle i suffered all night from it and that ass from illinois  oh poor papa i couldnt go with mr stoller alone but i might have gone in the twospanner with him and let you have mr or mrs march in the onespanner  i dont know their interest in each other isnt so interesting to other people as they seem to think  do you feel that way really papa dont you like their being so much in love still  at their time of life thank you its bad enough in young people  the girl did not answer she appeared altogether occupied in pouring out her fathers coffee  he tasted it and then he drank pretty well all of it but he said as he put his cup down i dont know what they make this stuff of i wish i had a cup of good honest american coffee  oh theres nothing like american food said his daughter with so much conciliation that he looked up sharply  but whatever he might have been going to say was at least postponed by the approach of a servingmaid who brought a note to his daughter she blushed a little at sight of it and then tore it open and read  i am going away from carlsbad for a fault of my own which forbids me to look you in the face if you wish to know the worst of me ask mrs march i have no heart to tell you  agatha read these mystifying words of burnamys several times over in a silent absorption with them which left her father to look after himself and he had poured out a second cup of coffee with his own hand and was reaching for the bread beside her before she came slowly back to a sense of his presence  oh excuse me papa she said and she gave him the butter heres a very strange letter from mr burnamy which i think youd better see she held the note across the table to him and watched his face as he read it  after he had read it twice he turned the sheet over as people do with letters that puzzle them in the vain hope of something explanatory on the back then he looked up and asked what do you suppose hes been doing  i dont believe hes been doing anything its something that mr stollers been doing to him  i shouldnt infer that from his own words what makes you think the trouble is with stoller  he saidhe said yesterdaysomething about being glad to be through with him because he disliked him so much he was always afraid of wronging him and that proves that now mr stoller has made him believe that hes done wrong and has worked upon him till he does believe it  it proves nothing of the kind said the general recurring to the note after reading it again he looked keenly at her am i to understand that you have given him the right to suppose you would want to know the worstor the best of him  the girls eyes fell and she pushed her knife against her plate she began no  then confound his impudence the general broke out what business has he to write to you at all about this  because he couldnt go away without it she returned and she met her fathers eye courageously he had a right to think we were his friends and if he has done wrong or is in disgrace any way isnt it manly of him to wish to tell us first himself  her father could not say that it was not but he could and did say very sceptically stuff now see here agatha what are you going to do  im going to see mrs march and then  you mustnt do anything of the kind my dear said her father gently youve no right to give yourself away to that romantic old goose he put up his hand to interrupt her protest this thing has got to be gone to the bottom of but youre not to do it i will see march myself we must consider your dignity in this matterand mine and you may as well understand that im not going to have any nonsense its got to be managed so that it cant be supposed were anxious about it one way or the other or that he was authorized to write to you in this way  no no he oughtnt to have done so he was to blame he couldnt have written to you though papa  well i dont know why but thats no reason why we should let it be understood that he has written to you i will see march and i will manage to see his wife too i shall probably find them in the readingroom at pupps and  the marches were in fact just coming in from their breakfast at the posthof and he met them at the door of pupps where they all sat down on one of the iron settees of the piazza and began to ask one another questions of their minds about the pleasure of the day before and to beat about the bush where burnamy lurked in their common consciousness  mrs march was not able to keep long from starting him you knew she said that mr burnamy had left us  left why asked the general  she was a woman of resource but in a case like this she found it best to trust her husbands poverty of invention she looked at him and he answered for her with a promptness that made her quake at first but finally seemed the only thing if not the best thing hes had some trouble with stoller he went on to tell the general just what the trouble was  at the end the general grunted as from an uncertain mind you think hes behaved badly  i think hes behaved foolishlyyouthfully but i can understand how strongly he was tempted he could say that he was not authorized to stop stoller in his mad career  at this mrs march put her hand through her husbands arm  im not so sure about that said the general  march added since i saw him this morning ive heard something that disposes me to look at his performance in a friendlier light its something that stoller told me himself to heighten my sense of burnamys wickedness he seems to have felt that i ought to know what a serpent i was cherishing in my bosom and he gave triscoe the facts of burnamys injurious refusal to help stoller put a false complexion on the opinions he had allowed him ignorantly to express  the general grunted again of course he had to refuse and he has behaved like a gentleman so far but that doesnt justify him in having let stoller get himself into the scrape  no said march its a tough nut for the casuist to try his tooth on and i must say i feel sorry for stoller  mrs march plucked her hand from his arm i dont one bit he was thoroughly selfish from first to last he has got just what he deserved  ah very likely said her husband the question is about burnamys part in giving him his deserts he had to leave him to them of course  the general fixed her with the impenetrable glitter of his eyeglasses and left the subject as of no concern to him i believe he said rising ill have a look at some of your papers and he went into the readingroom  now said mrs march he will go home and poison that poor girls mind and you will have yourself to thank for prejudicing him against burnamy  then why didnt you do it yourself my dear he teased but he was really too sorry for the whole affair which he nevertheless enjoyed as an ethical problem  the general looked so little at the papers that before march went off for his morning walk he saw him come out of the readingroom and take his way down the alte wiese he went directly back to his daughter and reported burnamys behavior with entire exactness he dwelt upon his making the best of a bad business in refusing to help stoller out of it dishonorably and mendaciously but he did not conceal that it was a bad business  now you know all about it he said at the end and i leave the whole thing to you if you prefer you can see mrs march i dont know but id rather youd satisfy yourself  i will not see mrs march do you think i would go back of you in that way i am satisfied now     xxxix  instead of burnamy mrs adding and her son now breakfasted with the marches at the posthof and the boy was with march throughout the day a good deal he rectified his impressions of life in carlsbad by marchs greater wisdom and experience and did his best to anticipate his opinions and conform to his conclusions this was not easy for sometimes he could not conceal from himself that marchs opinions were whimsical and his conclusions fantastic and he could not always conceal from march that he was matching them with kenbys on some points and suffering from their divergence he came to join the sage in his early visit to the springs and they walked up and down talking and they went off together on long strolls in which rose was proud to bear him company he was patient of the absences from which he was often answered and he learned to distinguish between the earnest and the irony of which marchs replies seemed to be mixed he examined him upon many features of german civilization but chiefly upon the treatment of women in it and upon this his philosopher was less satisfactory than he could have wished him to be he tried to excuse his trifling as an escape from the painful stress of questions which he found so afflicting himself but in the matter of the womananddog teams this was not easy march owned that the notion of their being yokemates was shocking but he urged that it was a stage of evolution and a distinct advance upon the time when women dragged the carts without the help of the dogs and that the time might not be far distant when the dogs would drag the carts without the help of the women  rose surmised a joke and he tried to enjoy it but inwardly he was troubled by his friends apparent acceptance of unjust things on their picturesque side once as they were sauntering homeward by the brink of the turbid eger they came to a man lying on the grass with a pipe in his mouth and lazily watching from under his fallen lids the cows grazing by the riverside while in a field of scraggy wheat a file of women were reaping a belated harvest with sickles bending wearily over to clutch the stems together and cut them with their hooked blades ah delightful march took off his hat as if to salute the pleasant sight  but dont you think mr march the boy ventured that the man had better be cutting the wheat and letting the women watch the cows  well i dont know there are more of them and he wouldnt be half so graceful as they are with that flow of their garments and the sway of their aching backs the boy smiled sadly and march put his hand on his shoulder as they walked on you find a lot of things in europe that need putting right dont you rose  yes i know its silly  well im not sure but im afraid its useless you see these old customs go such a way back and are so grounded in conditions we think they might be changed if those who rule could be got to see how cruel and ugly they are but probably they couldnt im afraid that the emperor of austria himself couldnt change them in his sovereign plenitude of power the emperor is only an old custom too and hes as much grounded in the conditions as any this was the serious way rose felt that march ought always to talk and he was too much grieved to laugh when he went on the women have so much of the hard work to do over here because the emperors need the men for their armies they couldnt let their men cut wheat unless it was for their officers horses in the field of some peasant whom it would ruin  if mrs march was by she would not allow him to work these paradoxes for the boys confusion she said the child adored him and it was a sacrilege to play with his veneration she always interfered to save him but with so little logic though so much justice that rose suffered a humiliation from her championship and was obliged from a sense of selfrespect to side with the mocker she understood this and magnanimously urged it as another reason why her husband should not trifle with roses ideal of him to make his mother laugh at him was wicked  oh im not his only ideal march protested he adores kenby too and every now and then he brings me to book with a text from kenbys gospel  mrs march caught her breath kenby do you really think then that she  oh hold on now it isnt a question of mrs adding and i dont say rose had an eye on poor old kenby as a stepfather i merely want you to understand that im the object of a divided worship and that when im off duty as an ideal i dont see why i shouldnt have the fun of making mrs adding laugh you cant pretend she isnt wrapped up in the boy youve said that yourself  yes shes wrapped up in him shed give her life for him but she is so light i didnt suppose she was so light but its borne in upon me more and more  they were constantly seeing rose and his mother in the sort of abeyance the triscoes had fallen into one afternoon the addings came to mrs marchs room to look from her windows at a parade of bicyclers clubs from the neighboring towns the spectacle prospered through its first halfhour with the charm which german sentiment and ingenuity are able to lend even a bicycle parade the wheelmen and wheelwomen filed by on machines wreathed with flowers and ribbons and decked with streaming banners here and there one sat under a moving arch of blossoms or in a bower of leaves and petals and they were all gay with their club costumes and insignia in the height of the display a sudden mountain shower gathered and broke upon them they braved it till it became a drenching downpour then they leaped from their machines and fled to any shelter they could find under trees and in doorways the men used their greater agility to get the best places and kept them the women made no appeal for them by word or look but took the rain in the open as if they expected nothing else  rose watched the scene with a silent intensity which march interpreted theres your chance rose why dont you go down and rebuke those fellows  rose blushed and shrank away without answer and mrs march promptly attacked her husband in his behalf why dont you go and rebuke them yourself  well for one thing there isnt any conversation in my phrasebook between an indignant american herr and a party of german wheelmen who have taken shelter from the rain and are keeping the wheelwomen out in the wet mrs adding shrieked her delight and he was flattered into going on for another thing i think its very well for you ladies to realize from an objectlesson of this sort what spoiled children of our civilization you are it ought to make you grateful for your privileges  there is something in that mrs adding joyfully consented  oh there is no civilization but ours said mrs march in a burst of vindictive patriotism i am more and more convinced of it the longer i stay in europe  perhaps thats why we like to stay so long in europe it strengthens us in the conviction that america is the only civilized country in the world said march  the shower passed as quickly as it had gathered and the band which it had silenced for a moment burst forth again in the music which fills the carlsbad day from dawn till dusk just now it began to play a pot pourri of american airs at the end some unseen americans under the trees below clapped and cheered  that was opportune of the band said march it must have been a telepathic impulse from our patriotism in the director but a pot pourri of american airs is like that tablet dedicating the american park up here on the schlossberg which is signed by six jews and one irishman the only thing in this medley thats the least characteristic or original is dixie and im glad the south has brought us back into the union  you dont know one note from another my dear said his wife  i know the washington post  and dont you call that american  yes if sousa is an american name i should have thought it was portuguese  now that sounds a little too much like general triscoes pessimism said mrs march and she added but whether we have any national melodies or not we dont poke women out in the rain and keep them soaking  no we certainly dont he assented with such a wellstudied effect of yielding to superior logic that mrs adding screamed for joy  the boy had stolen out of the room and he said i hope rose isnt acting on my suggestion  i hate to have you tease him dearest his wife interposed  oh no the mother said laughing still but with a note of tenderness in her laugh which dropped at last to a sigh hes too much afraid of lesemajesty for that but i dare say he couldnt stand the sight hes queer  hes beautiful said mrs march  hes good the mother admitted as good as the days long hes never given me a moments troublebut he troubles me if you can understand  oh i do understand mrs march returned by his innocence you mean that is the worst of children their innocence breaks our hearts and makes us feel ourselves such dreadful old things  his innocence yes pursued mrs adding and his ideals she began to laugh again he may have gone off for a season of meditation and prayer over the misbehavior of these bicyclers his mind is turning that way a good deal lately its only fair to tell you mr march that he seems to be giving up his notion of being an editor you mustnt be disappointed  i shall be sorry said the editor but now that you mention it i think i have noticed that rose seems rather more indifferent to periodical literature i supposed he might simply have exhausted his questionsor my answers  no it goes deeper than that i think its europe thats turned his mind in the direction of reform at any rate he thinks now he will be a reformer  really what kind of one not religious i hope  no his reform has a religious basis but its objects are social i dont make it out exactly but i shall as soon as rose does he tells me everything and sometimes i dont feel equal to it spiritually or even intellectually  dont laugh at him mrs adding mrs march entreated  oh he doesnt mind my laughing said the mother gayly rose came shyly back into the room and she said well did you rebuke those bad bicyclers and she laughed again  theyre only a custom too rose said march tenderly like the man resting while the women worked and the emperor and all the rest of it  oh yes i know the boy returned  they ride modern machines but they live in the tenth century thats what were always forgetting when we come to europe and see these barbarians enjoying all our uptodate improvements  there doesnt that console you asked his mother and she took him away with her laughing back from the door i dont believe it does a bit  i dont believe she understands the child said mrs march she is very light dont you think i dont know after all whether it wouldnt be a good thing for her to marry kenby she is very easygoing and she will be sure to marry somebody  she had fallen into a tone of musing censure and he said you might put these ideas to her     xl  with the passage of the days and weeks the strange faces which had familiarized themselves at the springs disappeared even some of those which had become the faces of acquaintance began to go in the diminishing crowd the smile of otterson was no longer to be seen the sad severe visage of major eltwin who seemed never to have quite got his bearings after his error with general triscoe seldom showed itself the triscoes themselves kept out of the marches way or they fancied so mrs adding and rose alone remained of their daily encounter  it was full summer as it is everywhere in midaugust but at carlsbad the sun was so late getting up over the hills that as people went to their breakfasts at the cafes up the valley of the tepl they found him looking very obliquely into it at eight oclock in the morning the yellow leaves were thicker about the feet of the trees and the grass was silvery gray with the belated dews the breakfasters were fewer than they had been and there were more little barefooted boys and girls with cups of red raspberries which they offered to the passers with cries of himbeeren himbeeren plaintive as the notes of birds left songless by the receding summer  march was forbidden the fruit but his wife and mrs adding bought recklessly of it and ate it under his eyes with their coffee and bread pouring over it pots of clotted cream that the schone lili brought them rose pretended an indifference to it which his mother betrayed was a sacrifice in behalf of marchs inability  lilis delays in coming to be paid had been such that the marches now tried to pay her when she brought their breakfast but they sometimes forgot and then they caught her whenever she came near them in this event she liked to coquet with their impatience she would lean against their table and say oh no you stay a little it is so nice one day after such an entreaty she said the queen is here this morning  mrs march started in the hope of highhotes the queen  yes the young lady mr burnamy was saying she was a queen she is there with her father she nodded in the direction of a distant corner and the marches knew that she meant miss triscoe and the general she is not seeming so gayly as she was being  march smiled we are none of us so gayly as we were being lili the summer is going  but mr burnamy will be returning not true the girl asked resting her tray on the corner of the table  no im afraid he wont march returned sadly  he was very good he was paying the proprietor for the dishes that augusta did break when she was falling down he was paying before he went away when he was knowing that the proprietor would make augusta to pay  ah said march and his wife said that was like him and she eagerly explained to mrs adding how good and great burnamy had been in this characteristic instance while lili waited with the tray to add some pathetic facts about augustas poverty and gratitude i think miss triscoe ought to know it there goes the wretch now she broke off dont look at him she set her husband the example of averting his face from the sight of stoller sullenly pacing up the middle aisle of the grove and looking to the right and left for a vacant table ugh i hope he wont be able to find a single place  mrs adding gave one of her pealing laughs while rose watched marchs face with grave sympathy he certainly doesnt deserve one dont let us keep you from offering miss triscoe any consolation you can they got up and the boy gathered up the gloves umbrella and handkerchief which the ladies let drop from their laps  have you been telling march asked his wife  have i told you anything she demanded of mrs adding in turn anything that you didnt as good as know already  not a syllable mrs adding replied in high delight come rose  well i suppose theres no use saying anything said march after she left them  she had guessed everything without my telling her said his wife  about stoller  wellno i did tell her that part but that was nothing it was about burnamy and agatha that she knew she saw it from the first  i should have thought she would have enough to do to look after poor old kenby  im not sure after all that she cares for him if she doesnt she oughtnt to let him write to her arent you going over to speak to the triscoes  no certainly not im going back to the hotel there ought to be some steamer letters this morning here we are worrying about these strangers all the time and we never give a thought to our own children on the other side of the ocean  i worry about them too said the mother fondly though there is nothing to worry about she added  its our duty to worry he insisted  at the hotel the portier gave them four letters there was one from each of their children one very buoyant not to say boisterous from the daughter celebrating her happiness in her husband and the loveliness of chicago as a summer city you would think she was born out there sighed her mother and one from the son boasting his wellbeing in spite of the heat they were having and just think how cool it is here his mother upbraided herself and the prosperity of every other week there was a line from fulkerson praising the boys editorial instinct and ironically proposing marchs resignation in his favor  i do believe we could stay all winter just as well as not said mrs march proudly what does burnamy say  how do you know its from him  because youve been keeping your hand on it give it here  when ive read it  the letter was dated at ansbach in germany and dealt except for some messages of affection to mrs march with a scheme for a paper which burnamy wished to write on kaspar hauser if march thought he could use it in every other week he had come upon a book about that hapless foundling in nuremberg and after looking up all his traces there he had gone on to ansbach where kaspar hauser met his death so pathetically burnamy said he could not give any notion of the enchantment of nuremberg but he besought march if he was going to the tyrol for his aftercure not to fail staying a day or so in the wonderful place he thought march would enjoy ansbach too in its way  and not a wordnot a syllableabout miss triscoe cried mrs march shall you take his paper  it would be serving him right if i refused it wouldnt it  they never knew what it cost burnamy to keep her name out of his letter or by what an effort of the will he forbade himself even to tell of his parting interview with stoller he had recovered from his remorse for letting stoller give himself away he was still sorry for that but he no longer suffered yet he had not reached the psychological moment when he could celebrate his final virtue in the matter he was glad he had been able to hold out against the temptation to retrieve himself by another wrong but he was humbly glad and he felt that until happier chance brought him and his friends together he must leave them to their merciful conjectures he was young and he took the chance with an aching heart if he had been older he might not have taken it     xli  the birthday of the emperor comes conveniently in late august in the good weather which is pretty sure to fall then if ever in the austrian summer for a week past at carlsbad the workmen had been building a scaffolding for the illumination in the woods on a height overlooking the town and making unobtrusive preparations at points within it  the day was important as the last of marchs cure and its pleasures began for him by a renewal of his acquaintance in its first kindliness with the eltwins he had met them so seldom that at one time he thought they must have gone away but now after his first cup he saw the quiet sad old pair sitting together on a bench in the stadt park and he asked leave to sit down with them till it was time for the next eltwin said that this was their last day too and explained that his wife always came with him to the springs while he took the waters  well he apologized were all thats left and i suppose we like to keep together he paused and at the look in marchs face he suddenly went on i havent been well for three or four years but i always fought against coming out here when the doctors wanted me to i said i couldnt leave home and i dont suppose i ever should but my home left me  as he spoke his wife shrank tenderly near him and march saw her steal her withered hand into his  wed had a large family but theyd all died off with one thing or another and here in the spring we lost our last daughter seemed perfectly well and all at once she died heartfailure they called it it broke me up and mother here got at me to go and so were here his voice trembled and his eyes softened then they flashed up and march heard him add in a tone that astonished him less when he looked round and saw general triscoe advancing toward them i dont know what it is always makes me want to kick that man  the general lifted his hat to their group and hoped that mrs eltwin was well and major eltwin better he did not notice their replies but said to march the ladies are waiting for you in pupps readingroom to go with them to the posthof for breakfast  arent you going too asked march  no thank you said the general as if it were much finer not i shall breakfast at our pension he strolled off with the air of a man who has done more than his duty  i dont suppose i ought to feel that way said eltwin with a remorse which march suspected a reproachful pressure of his wifes hand had prompted in him i reckon he means well  well i dont know march said with a candor he could not wholly excuse  on his way to the hotel he fancied mocking his wife for her interest in the romantic woes of her lovers in a world where there was such real pathos as these poor old peoples but in the company of miss triscoe he could not give himself this pleasure he tried to amuse her on the way from pupps with the doubt he always felt in passing the cafe sanssouci whether he should live to reach the posthof where he meant to breakfast she said poor mr march and laughed inattentively when he went on to philosophize the commonness of the sparse company always observable at the sanssouci as a just effect of its laodicean situation between pupps and the posthof the girl sighed absently and his wife frowned at him  the flowerwoman at the gate of her garden had now only autumnal blooms for sale in the vases which flanked the entrance the windrows of the rowen left steeping in the dews overnight exhaled a faint fragrance a poor remnant of the midsummer multitudes trailed itself along to the various cafes of the valley its pink paper bags of bread rustling like sere foliage as it moved  at the posthof the schone lili alone was as gay as in the prime of july she played archly about the guests she welcomed to a table in a sunny spot in the gallery you are tired of carlsbad she said caressingly to miss triscoe as she put her breakfast before her  not of the posthof said the girl listlessly  posthof and very little lili she showed with one forefinger on another how very little she was  miss triscoe laughed not cheerily and lili said to mrs march with abrupt seriousness augusta was finding a handkerchief under the table and she was washing it and ironing it before she did bring it i have scolded her and i have made her give it to me  she took from under her apron a mans handkerchief which she offered to mrs march it bore as she saw miss triscoe saw the initials l j b but whose can it be they asked each other  why burnamys said march and lilis eyes danced give it here  his wife caught it farther away no im going to see whose it is first if its his ill send it to him myself  she tried to put it into the pocket which was not in her dress by sliding it down her lap then she handed it to the girl who took it with a careless air but kept it after a like failure to pocket it  mrs march had come out in her indiarubber sandals but for once in carlsbad the weather was too dry for them and she had taken them off and was holding them in her lap they fell to the ground when she now rose from breakfast and she stooped to pick them up miss triscoe was too quick for her  oh let me carry them for you she entreated and after a tender struggle she succeed in enslaving herself to them and went away wearing them through the heelbands like manacles on her wrist she was not the kind of girl to offer such pretty devotions and mrs march was not the kind of woman to suffer them but they played the comedy through and let march go off for his last hillclimb with the promise to meet him in the stadt park when he came to the kurhaus for his last mineral bath  mrs march in the mean time went about some final shopping and invited the girls advice with a fondness which did not prevent her rejecting it in every case with miss triscoes eager approval in the stadt park they sat down and talked from time to time mrs march made polite feints of recovering her sandals but the girl kept them with increased effusion  when they rose and strolled away from the bench where they had been sitting they seemed to be followed they looked round and saw no one more alarming than a very severelooking old gentleman whose hat brim in spite of his severity was limp with much lifting as all austrian hat brims are he touched it and saying haughtily in german something left lying passed on  they stared at each other then as women do they glanced down at their skirts to see if there was anything amiss with them and miss triscoe perceived her hands empty of mrs marchs sandals and of burnamys handkerchief  oh i put it in one of the toes she lamented and she fled back to their bench alarming in her course the fears of a gendarme for the public security and putting a baby in its nurses arms into such doubts of its personal safety that it burst into a desolate cry she laughed breathlessly as she rejoined mrs march that comes of having no pocket i didnt suppose i could forget your sandals mrs march wasnt it absurd  its one of those things mrs march said to her husband afterwards that they can always laugh over together  they and what about burnamys behavior to stoller  oh i dont call that anything but what will come right of course he can make it up to him somehow and i regard his refusal to do wrong when stoller wanted him to as quite wiping out the first offence  well my dear you have burnt your ships behind you my only hope is that when we leave here tomorrow her pessimistic papas poison will neutralize yours somehow     xlii  one of the pleasantest incidents of marchs sojourn in carlsbad was his introduction to the manager of the municipal theatre by a common friend who explained the editor in such terms to the manager that he conceived of him as a brother artist this led to much bowing and smiling from the manager when the marches met him in the street or in their frequent visits to the theatre with which march felt that it might well have ended and still been far beyond his desert he had not thought of going to the opera on the emperors birthnight but after dinner a box came from the manager and mrs march agreed with him that they could not in decency accept so great a favor at the same time she argued that they could not in decency refuse it and that to show their sense of the pleasure done them they must adorn their box with all the beauty and distinction possible in other words she said they must ask miss triscoe and her father  and why not major eltwin and his wife or mrs adding and rose  she begged him simply in his own interest not to be foolish and they went early so as to be in their box when their guests came the foyer of the theatre was banked with flowers and against a curtain of evergreens stood a highpedestalled bust of the paternal caesar with whose sidewhiskers a laurel crown comported itself as well as it could at the foot of the grand staircase leading to the boxes the manager stood in evening dress receiving his friends and their felicitations upon the honor which the theatre was sure to do itself on an occasion so august the marches were so cordial in their prophecies that the manager yielded to an artists impulse and begged his fellowartist to do him the pleasure of coming behind the scenes between the acts of the opera he bowed a heartfelt regret to mrs march that he could not make the invitation include her and hoped that she would not be too lonely while her husband was gone  she explained that they had asked friends and she should not be alone and then he entreated march to bring any gentleman who was his guest with him on the way up to their box she pressed his arm as she used in their young married days and asked him if it was not perfect i wish we were going to have it all to ourselves no one else can appreciate the whole situation do you think we have made a mistake in having the triscoes  we he retorted oh thats good im going to shirk him when it comes to going behind the scenes  no no dearest she entreated snubbing will only make it worse we must stand it to the bitter end now  the curtain rose upon another laurelled bust of the emperor with a chorus of men formed on either side who broke into the grave and noble strains of the austrian hymn while every one stood then the curtain fell again and in the interval before the opera could begin general triscoe and his daughter came in  mrs march took the splendor in which the girl appeared as a tribute to her hospitality she had hitherto been a little disappointed of the open homage to american girlhood which her readings of international romance had taught her to expect in europe but now her patriotic vanity feasted full fat highhotes of her own sex levelled their lorgnettes at miss triscoe all around the horseshoe with critical glances which fell blunted from her complexion and costume the house was brilliant with the military uniforms which we have not yet to mingle with our unrivalled millinery and the ardent gaze of the young officers dwelt on the perfect mould of her girlish arms and neck and the winning lines of her face the girls eyes shone with a joyful excitement and her little head defined by its dark hair trembled as she slowly turned it from side to side after she removed the airy scarf which had covered it her father in evening dress looked the third emperor complaisant to a civil occasion and took a chair in the front of the box without resistance and the ladies disputed which should yield the best place to the other till miss triscoe forced mrs march fondly into it for the first act at least  the piece had to be cut a good deal to give people time for the illuminations afterwards but as it was it gave scope to the actress who als gast from a viennese theatre was the chief figure in it she merited the distinction by the art which still lingered deeply embedded in her massive balk but never wholly obscured  that is grand isnt it said march following one of the tremendous strokes by which she overcame her physical disadvantages its fine to see how her art can undo for one splendid instant the work of all those steins of beer those illimitable licks of sausage those boundless fields of cabbage but its rather pathetic  its disgusting said his wife and at this general triscoe who had been watching the actress through his lorgnette said as if his contrarymindedness were irresistibly invoked  well i dont know its amusing do you suppose we shall see her when we go behind march  he still professed a desire to do so when the curtain fell and they hurried to the rear door of the theatre it was slightly ajar and they pulled it wide open with the eagerness of their age and nation and began to mount the stairs leading up from it between rows of painted dancinggirls who had come out for a breath of air and who pressed themselves against the walls to make room for the intruders with their rouged faces and the stare of their glassy eyes intensified by the coloring of their brows and lashes they were like painted statues as they stood there with their crimsoned lips parted in astonished smiles  this is rather weird said march faltering at the sight i wonder if we might ask these young ladies where to go general triscoe made no answer and was apparently no more prepared than himself to accost the files of danseuses when they were themselves accosted by an angry voice from the head of the stairs with a demand for their business the voice belonged to a gendarme who descended toward them and seemed as deeply scandalized at their appearance as they could have been at that of the young ladies  march explained in his ineffective german with every effect of improbability that they were there by appointment of the manager and wished to find his room  the gendarme would not or could not make anything out of it he pressed down upon them and laying a rude hand on a shoulder of either began to force them back to the door the mild nature of the editor might have yielded to his violence but the martial spirit of general triscoe was roused he shrugged the gendarmes hand from his shoulder and with a voice as furious as his own required him in english to say what the devil he meant the gendarme rejoined with equal heat in german the generals tone rose in anger the dancinggirls emitted some little shrieks of alarm and fled noisily up the stairs from time to time march interposed with a word of the german which had mostly deserted him in his hour of need but if it had been a flow of intelligible expostulation it would have had no effect upon the disputants they grew more outrageous till the manager himself appeared at the head of the stairs and extended an arresting hand over the hubbub as soon as the situation clarified itself he hurried down to his visitors with a polite roar of apology and rescued them from the gendarme and led them up to his room and forced them into armchairs with a rapidity of reparation which did not exhaust itself till he had entreated them with every circumstance of civility to excuse an incident so mortifying to him but with all his haste he lost so much time in this that he had little left to show them through the theatre and their presentation to the prima donna was reduced to the obeisances with which they met and parted as she went upon the stage at the lifting of the curtain in the lack of a common language this was perhaps as well as a longer interview and nothing could have been more honorable than their dismissal at the hands of the gendarme who had received them so stormily he opened the door for them and stood with his fingers to his cap saluting in the effect of being a whole file of grenadiers     xliii  at the same moment burnamy bowed himself out of the box where he had been sitting with the ladies during the absence of the gentlemen he had knocked at the door almost as soon as they disappeared and if he did not fully share the consternation which his presence caused he looked so frightened that mrs march reserved the censure which the sight of him inspired and in default of other inspiration treated his coming simply as a surprise she shook hands with him and then she asked him to sit down and listened to his explanation that he had come back to carlsbad to write up the birthnight festivities on an order from the parisnew york chronicle that he had seen them in the box and had ventured to took in he was pale and so discomposed that the heart of justice was softened more and more in mrs marchs breast and she left him to the talk that sprang up by an admirable effect of tact in the young lady between him and miss triscoe  after all she decided there was nothing criminal in his being in carlsbad and possibly in the last analysis there was nothing so very wicked in his being in her box one might say that it was not very nice of him after he had gone away under such a cloud but on the other hand it was nice though in a different way if he longed so much to see miss triscoe that he could not help coming it was altogether in his favor that he was so agitated though he was momently becoming less agitated the young people were beginning to laugh at the notion of mr march and general triscoe going behind the scenes burnamy said he envied them the chance and added not very relevantly that he had come from baireuth where he had seen the last of the wagner performances he said he was going back to baireuth but not to ansbach again where he had finished looking up that kaspar hauser business he seemed to think mrs march would know about it and she could not help saying oh yes mr march was so much interested she wondered if she ought to tell him about his handkerchief but she remembered in time that she had left it in miss triscoes keeping she wondered if the girl realized how handsome he was he was extremely handsome in his black evening dress with his tuxedo and the pallor of his face repeated in his expanse of shirt front  at the bell for the rising of the curtain he rose too and took their offered hands in offering hers mrs march asked if he would not stay and speak with mr march and the general and now for the first time he recognized anything clandestine in his visit he laughed nervously and said no thank you and shut himself out  we must tell them said mrs march rather interrogatively and she was glad that the girl answered with a note of indignation  why certainly mrs march  they could not tell them at once for the second act had begun when march and the general came back and after the opera was over and they got out into the crowded street there was no chance for the general was obliged to offer his arm to mrs march while her husband followed with his daughter  the facades of the theatre and of the hotels were outlined with thickly set little lamps which beaded the arches of the bridges spanning the tepl and lighted the casements and portals of the shops high above all against the curtain of black woodland on the mountain where its skeleton had been growing for days glittered the colossal effigy of the doubleheaded eagle of austria crowned with the tiara of the holy roman empire in the reflected splendor of its myriad lamps the pale christ looked down from the mountain opposite upon the surging multitudes in the streets and on the bridges  they were most amiable multitudes march thought and they responded docilely to the entreaties of the policemen who stood on the steps of the bridges and divided their encountering currents with patient appeals of bitte schon bitte schon he laughed to think of a new york cop saying please prettily please prettily to a new york crowd which he wished to have go this way or that and then he burned with shame to think how far our manners were from civilization wherever our heads and hearts might be when he heard a voice at his elbow  a punch with a club would start some of these fellows along quicker  it was stoller and march turned from him to lose his disgust in the sudden terror of perceiving that miss triscoe was no longer at his side neither could he see his wife and general triscoe and he began to push frantically about in the crowd looking for the girl he had an interminable five or ten minutes in his vain search and he was going to call out to her by name when burnamy saved him from the hopeless absurdity by elbowing his way to him with miss triscoe on his arm  here she is mr march he said as if there were nothing strange in his having been there to find her in fact he had followed them all from the theatre and at the moment he saw the party separated and miss triscoe carried off helpless in the human stream had plunged in and rescued her before march could formulate any question in his bewilderment burnamy was gone again the girl offered no explanation for him and march had not yet decided to ask any when he caught sight of his wife and general triscoe standing tiptoe in a doorway and craning their necks upward and forward to scan the crowd in search of him and his charge then he looked round at her and opened his lips to express the astonishment that filled him when he was aware of an ominous shining of her eyes and trembling of her hand on his arm  she pressed his arm nervously and he understood her to beg him to forbear at once all question of her and all comment on burnamys presence to her father  it would not have been just the time for either not only mrs march was with the general but mrs adding also she had called to them from that place where she was safe with rose when she saw them eddying about in the crowd the general was still expressing a gratitude which became more pressing the more it was disclaimed he said casually at sight of his daughter ah youve found us have you and went on talking to mrs adding who nodded to them laughingly and asked did you see me beckoning  look here my dear march said to his wife as soon as they parted from the rest the general gallantly promising that his daughter and he would see mrs adding safe to her hotel and were making their way slowly home alone did you know that burnamy was in carlsbad  hes going away on the twelveoclock train tonight she answered firmly  what has that got to do with it where did you see him  in the box while you were behind the scenes  she told him all about it and he listened in silent endeavor for the ground of censure from which a sense of his own guilt forced him she asked suddenly where did you see him and he told her in turn  he added severely her father ought to know why didnt you tell him  why didnt you she retorted with great reason  because i didnt think he was just in the humor for it he began to laugh as he sketched their encounter with the gendarme but she did not seem to think it amusing and he became serious again besides i was afraid she was going to blubber any way  she wouldnt have blubbered as you call it i dont know why you need be so disgusting it would have given her just the moral support she needed now she will have to tell him herself and he will blame us you ought to have spoken you could have done it easily and naturally when you came up with her you will have yourself to thank for all the trouble that comes of it now my dear  he shouted in admiration of her skill in shifting the blame on him all right i should have had to stand it even if you hadnt behaved with angelic wisdom  why she said after reflection i dont see what either of us has done we didnt get burnamy to come here or connive at his presence in any way  oh make triscoe believe that he knows youve done all you could to help the affair on  well what if i have he began making up to mrs adding himself as soon as he saw her tonight she looked very pretty  well thank heaven were off tomorrow morning and i hope weve seen the last of them theyve done what they could to spoil my cure but im not going to have them spoil my aftercure     xliv  mrs march had decided not to go to the posthof for breakfast where they had already taken a lavish leave of the schone lili with a sense of being promptly superseded in her affections they found a place in the redtablecloth end of the pavilion at pupps and were served by the pretty girl with the rosebud mouth whom they had known only as einundzwanzig and whose promise of komm gleich bitte schon was like a birds note never had the coffee been so good the bread so aerially light the westphalian ham so tenderly pink a young married couple whom they knew came by arm in arm in their morning walk and sat down with them like their own youth for a moment  if you had told them we were going dear said mrs march when the couple were themselves gone we should have been as old as ever dont let us tell anybody this morning that were going i couldnt bear it  they had been obliged to take the secretary of the hotel into their confidence in the process of paying their bill he put on his high hat and came out to see them off the portier was already there standing at the step of the lordly twospanner which they had ordered for the long drive to the station the swiss elevatorman came to the door to offer them a fellowrepublicans good wishes for their journey herr pupp himself appeared at the last moment to hope for their return another summer mrs march bent a last look of interest upon the proprietor as their twospanner whirled away  they say that he is going to be made a count  well i dont object said march a man who can feed fourteen thousand people mostly germans in a day ought to be made an archduke  at the station something happened which touched them even more than these last attentions of the hotel they were in their compartment and were in the act of possessing themselves of the best places by putting their bundles and bags on them when they heard mrs marchs name called  they turned and saw rose adding at the door his thin face flushed with excitement and his eyes glowing i was afraid i shouldnt get here in time he panted and he held up to her a huge bunch of flowers  why rose from your mother  from me he said timidly and he was slipping out into the corridor when she caught him and his flowers to her in one embrace i want to kiss you she said and presently when he had waved his hand to them from the platform outside and the train had started she fumbled for her handkerchief i suppose you call it blubbering but he is the sweetest child  hes about the only one of our carlsbad compatriots that im sorry to leave behind march assented hes the only unmarried one that wasnt in danger of turning up a lover on my hands if there had been some rather old girl or some rather light matron in our acquaintance im not sure that i should have been safe even from rose carlsbad has been an interruption to our silver wedding journey my dear but i hope now that it will begin again  yes said his wife now we can have each other all to ourselves  yes its been very different from our first wedding journey in that it isnt that were not so young now as we were but that we dont seem so much our own property we used to be the sole proprietors and now we seem to be mere tenants at will and any interloping lover may come in and set our dearest interests on the sidewalk the disadvantage of living along is that we get too much into the hands of other people  yes it is i shall be glad to be rid of them all too  i dont know that the drawback is serious enough to make us wish we had died youngor younger he suggested  no i dont know that it is she assented she added from an absence where he was sufficiently able to locate her meaning i hope shell write and tell me what her father says and does when she tells him that he was there  there were many things in the weather the landscape their sole occupancy of an unsmoking compartment while all the smoking compartments round overflowed with smokers which conspired to offer them a pleasing illusion of the past it was sometimes so perfect that they almost held each others hands in later life there are such moments when the youthful emotions come back as certain birds do in winter and the elderly heart chirps and twitters to itself as if it were young but it is best to discourage this fondness and mrs march joined her husband in mocking it when he made her observe how fit it was that their silver wedding journey should be resumed as part of his aftercure if he had found the fountain of youth in the warm flat faintly nauseous water of the felsenquelle he was not going to call himself twentyeight again till his second month of the carlsbad regimen was out and he had got back to salad and fruit  at eger they had a memorable dinner with so much leisure for it that they could form a lifelong friendship for the old englishspeaking waiter who served them and would not suffer them to hurry themselves the hills had already fallen away and they ran along through a cheerful country with tracts of forest under white clouds blowing about in a blue sky and gayly flinging their shadows down upon the brown ploughed land and upon the yellow oatfields where women were cutting the leisurely harvest with sickles and where once a great girl with swarthy bare arms unbent herself from her toil and rose a statue of rude vigor and beauty to watch them go by hedges of evergreen enclosed the yellow oatfields where slow wagons paused to gather the sheaves of the week before and then loitered away with them flocks of geese waddled in sculpturesque relief against the closecropt pastures herded by little girls with flaxen pigtails whose eyes blue as cornflowers followed the flying train there were stretches of wild thyme purpling long barren acreages and growing up the railroad banks almost to the rails themselves from the meadows the rowen tossed in long loose windrows sent into their car a sad autumnal fragrance which mingled with the tobacco smoke when two fat smokers emerged into the narrow corridor outside their compartments and tried to pass each other their vast stomachs beat together in a vain encounter  zu enge said one and ja zu enge said the other and they laughed innocently in each others faces with a joy in their recognition of the corridors narrowness as great as if it had been a stroke of the finest wit  all the way the land was lovely and as they drew near nuremberg it grew enchanting with a fairy quaintness the scenery was alpine but the scale was toylike as befitted the region and the mimic peaks and valleys with green brooks gushing between them and strange rock forms recurring in endless caprice seemed the home of childrens story all the gnomes and elves might have dwelt there in peaceful fellowship with the peasants who ploughed the little fields and gathered the garlanded hops and lived in the farmsteads and village houses with those high timberlaced gables  we ought to have come here long ago with the children when they were children said march  no his wife returned it would have been too much for them nobody but grown people could bear it  the spell which began here was not really broken by anything that afterwards happened in nuremberg though the old toycapital was trolleywired through all its quaintness and they were lodged in a hotel lighted by electricity and heated by steam and equipped with an elevator which was so modern that it came down with them as well as went up all the things that assumed to be of recent structure or invention were as nothing against the dense past which overwhelmed them with the sense of a world elsewhere outlived in nuremberg it is not the quaint or the picturesque that is exceptional it is the matteroffact and the commonplace here more than anywhere else you are steeped in the gothic spirit which expresses itself in a teutonic dialect of homely sweetness of endearing caprice of rude grotesqueness but of positive grace and beauty almost never it is the architectural speech of a strenuous gross kindly honest peoples fancy such as it is it was inexhaustible and such as it is it was bewitching for the travellers  they could hardly wait till they had supper before plunging into the ancient town and they took the first tramcar at a venture it was a sort of transfer drawn by horses which delivered them a little inside of the city gate to a trolleycar the conductor with their fare demanded their destination march frankly owned that they did not know where they wanted to go they wanted to go anywhere the conductor chose and the conductor after reflection decided to put them down at the public garden which as one of the newest things in the city would make the most favorable impression upon strangers it was in fact so like all other city gardens with the foliage of its trimly planted alleys that it sheltered them effectually from the picturesqueness of nuremberg and they had a long peaceful hour on one of its benches where they rested from their journey and repented their hasty attempt to appropriate the charm of the city  the next morning it rained according to a custom which the elevatorboy flown with the insolent recollection of a sunny summer in milan said was invariable in nuremberg but after the oneoclock table dhote they took a noble twospanner carriage and drove all round the city everywhere the ancient moat thickly turfed and planted with trees and shrubs stretched a girdle of garden between their course and the wall beautifully old with knots of dead ivy clinging to its crevices or broad meshes of the shining foliage mantling its blackened masonry a tileroofed open gallery ran along the top where so many centuries of sentries had paced and arched the massive gates with heavily moulded piers where so countlessly the fierce burgher troops had sallied forth against their besiegers and so often the leaguer hosts had dashed themselves in assault the blood shed in forgotten battles would have flooded the moat where now the grass and flowers grew or here and there a peaceful stretch of water stagnated  the drive ended in a visit to the old burg where the hapsburg kaisers dwelt when they visited their faithful imperial city from its ramparts the incredible picturesqueness of nuremberg best shows itself and if one has any love for the distinctive quality of teutonic architecture it is here that more than anywhere else one may feast it the prospect of tower and spire and gable is of such a mediaeval richness of such an abounding fulness that all incidents are lost in it the multitudinous roofs of redbrown tiles blinking browsily from their low dormers press upon one another in endless succession they cluster together on a rise of ground and sink away where the street falls but they nowhere disperse or scatter and they end abruptly at the other rim of the city beyond which looms the green country merging in the remoter blue of misty uplands  a pretty young girl waited at the door of the tower for the visitors to gather in sufficient number and then led them through the terrible museum discanting in the same gay voice and with the same smiling air on all the murderous engines and implements of torture first in german and then in english she explained the fearful uses of the iron maiden she winningly illustrated the action of the racks and wheels on which men had been stretched and broken and she sweetly vaunted a sword which had beheaded eight hundred persons when she took the established fee from march she suggested with a demure glance and what more you please for saying it in english  can you say it in russian demanded a young man whose eyes he had seen dwelling on her from the beginning she laughed archly and responded with some slavic words and then delivered her train of sightseers over to the custodian who was to show them through the halls and chambers of the burg these were undergoing the repairs which the monuments of the past are perpetually suffering in the present and there was some special painting and varnishing for the reception of the kaiser who was coming to nuremberg for the military manoeuvres then at hand but if they had been in the unmolested discomfort of their unlivable magnificence their splendor was such as might well reconcile the witness to the superior comfort of a private station in our snugger day the marches came out owning that the youth which might once have found the romantic glories of the place enough was gone from them but so much of it was left to her that she wished to make him stop and look at the flirtation which had blossomed out between that pretty young girl and the russian whom they had scarcely missed from their party in the burg he had apparently never parted from the girl and now as they sat together on the threshold of the gloomy tower he most have been teaching her more slavic words for they were both laughing as if they understood each other perfectly  in his security from having the affair in any wise on his hands march would have willingly lingered to see how her education got on but it began to rain the rain did not disturb the lovers but it obliged the elderly spectators to take refuge in their carriage and they drove off to find the famous little goose man this is what every one does at nuremberg it would be difficult to say why when they found the little goose man he was only a mediaeval fancy in bronze who stood on his pedestal in the marketplace and contributed from the bill of the goose under his arm a small stream to the rainfall drenching the wet wares of the wet marketwomen round the fountain and soaking their cauliflowers and lettuce their grapes and pears their carrots and turnips to the watery flavor of all fruits and vegetables in germany  the air was very raw and chill but after supper the clouds cleared away and a pleasant evening tempted the travellers out the portier dissembled any slight which their eagerness for the only amusement he could think of inspired and directed them to a popular theatre which was giving a summer season at low prices to the lower classes and which they surprised after some search trying to hide itself in a sort of back square they got the best places at a price which ought to have been mortifyingly cheap and found themselves with a thousand other harmless bourgeois folk in a sort of spacious agreeable barn of a decoration by no means ugly and of a certain artless comfort each seat fronted a shelf at the back of the seat before it where the spectator could put his hat there was a smaller shelf for his stein of the beer passed constantly throughout the evening and there was a buffet where he could stay himself with cold ham and other robust german refreshments  it was the wedding journey to nuremberg upon which they had oddly chanced and they accepted as a national tribute the character of an american girl in it she was an american girl of the advanced pattern and she came and went at a picnic on the arm of a head waiter she seemed to have no office in the drama except to illustrate a german conception of american girlhood but even in this simple function she seemed rather to puzzle the german audience perhaps because of the occasional english words which she used  to the astonishment of her compatriots when they came out of the theatre it was not raining the night was as brilliantly starlit as a night could be in germany and they sauntered home richly content through the narrow streets and through the beautiful old damenthor beyond which their hotel lay how pretty they said to call that charming port the ladies gate they promised each other to find out why and they never did so but satisfied themselves by assigning it to the exclusive use of the slim maidens and massive matrons of the old nuremberg patriciate whom they imagined trailing their silken splendors under its arch in perpetual procession     xlv  the life of the nuremberg patriciate now extinct in the control of the city which it builded so strenuously and maintained so heroically is still insistent in all its art this expresses their pride at once and their simplicity with a childish literality at its best it is never so good as the good italian art whose influence is always present in its best the coloring of the great canvases is venetian but there is no such democracy of greatness as in the painting at venice in decoration the art of nuremberg is at best quaint and at the worst puerile wherever it had obeyed an academic intention it seemed to march poor and coarse as in the bronze fountain beside the church of st lawrence the water spins from the pouted breasts of the beautiful figures in streams that cross and interlace after a fancy trivial and gross but in the base of the church there is a timeworn gethsemane exquisitely affecting in its simplehearted truth the long ages have made it even more affecting than the sculptor imagined it they have blurred the faces and figures in passing till their features are scarcely distinguishable and the sleeping apostles seem to have dreamed themselves back into the mothermarble it is of the same tradition and impulse with that supreme glory of the native sculpture the ineffable tabernacle of adam krafft which climbs a column of the church within a miracle of richly carven story and no doubt if there were a nuremberg sculptor doing great things today his work would be of kindred inspiration  the descendants of the old patrician who ordered the tabernacle at rather a hard bargain from the artist still worship on the floor below and the descendants of his neighbor patricians have their seats in the pews about and their names cut in the proprietary plates on the pewtops the vergeress who showed the marches through the church was devout in the praise of these aristocratic fellowcitizens of hers so simple and yet so noble she said she was a very romantic vergeress and she told them at unsparing length the legend of the tabernacle how the artist fell asleep in despair of winning his patrons daughter and saw in a vision the masterwork with the lilylike droop at top which gained him her hand they did not realize till too late that it was all out of a novel of georg eberss but added to the regular fee for the church a gift worthy of an inedited legend  even then they had a pleasure in her enthusiasm rarely imparted by the nuremberg manner they missed there the constant sweet civility of carlsbad and found themselves falling flat in their endeavors for a little cordiality they indeed inspired with some kindness the old woman who showed them through that cemetery where albert durer and hans sachs and many other illustrious citizens lie buried under monumental brasses of such beauty     that kings to have the like might wish to die  but this must have been because they abandoned themselves so willingly to the fascination of the bronze skull on the tomb of a fourteenthcentury patrician which had the uncommon advantage of a lower jaw hinged to the upper she proudly clapped it up and down for their astonishment and waited with a toothless smile to let them discover the bead of a nail artfully figured in the skull then she gave a shrill cackle of joy and gleefully explained that the wife of this patrician had killed him by driving a nail into his temple and had been fitly beheaded for the murder  she cared so much for nothing else in the cemetery but she consented to let them wonder at the richness of the sculpture in the level tombs with their escutcheons and memorial tablets overrun by the long grass and the matted ivy she even consented to share their indignation at the destruction of some of the brasses and the theft of others she suffered more reluctantly their tenderness for the old old crucifixion figured in sculpture at one corner of the cemetery where the anguish of the christ had long since faded into the stone from which it had been evoked and the thieves were no longer distinguishable in their penitence or impenitence but she parted friends with them when she saw how much they seemed taken with the votive chapel of the noble holzschuh family where a line of wooden shoes puns upon the name in the frieze like the line of dogs which chase one another with bones in their mouths around the canossa palace at verona a sense of the beautiful house by the adige was part of the pleasing confusion which possessed them in nuremberg whenever they came upon the expression of the gothic spirit common both to the german and northern italian art they knew that it was an effect which had passed from germany into italy but in the liberal air of the older land it had come to so much more beauty that now when they found it in its home it seemed something fetched from over the alps and coarsened in the attempt to naturalize it to an alien air  in the germanic museum they fled to the italian painters from the german pictures they had inspired in the great hall of the rathhaus the noble processional of durer was the more precious because his triumph of maximilian somehow suggested mantegnas triumph of caesar there was to be a banquet in the hall under the mighty fresco to welcome the german emperor coming the next week and the rathhaus was full of workpeople furbishing it up against his arrival and making it difficult for the custodian who had it in charge to show it properly to strangers she was of the same enthusiastic sisterhood as the vergeress of st lawrence and the guardian of the old cemetery and by a mighty effort she prevailed over the workmen so far as to lead her charges out through the corridor where the literal conscience of the brothers kuhn has wrought in the roof to an exact image of a tournament as it was in nuremberg four hundred years ago in this relief thronged with men and horses the galalife of the past survives in unexampled fulness and march blamed himself after enjoying it for having felt in it that toyfigure quality which seems the final effect of the german gothicism in sculpture     xlvi  on sunday mrs march partially conformed to an earlier new england ideal of the day by ceasing from sightseeing she could not have understood the sermon if she had gone to church but she appeased the lingering conscience she had on this point by not going out till afternoon then she found nothing of the gayety which sunday afternoon wears in catholic lands the people were resting from their weekday labors but they were not playing and the old churches long since converted to lutheran uses were locked against tourist curiosity  it was as it should be it was as it would be at home and yet in this ancient city where the past was so much alive in the perpetual picturesqueness the marches felt an incongruity in it and they were fain to escape from the protestant silence and seriousness of the streets to the shade of the public garden they had involuntarily visited the evening of their arrival  on a bench sat a quiet rather dejected man whom march asked some question of their way he answered in english and in the parley that followed they discovered that they were all americans the stranger proved to be an american of the sort commonest in germany and he said he had returned to his native country to get rid of the ague which he had taken on staten island he had been seventeen years in new york and now a talk of tammany and its chances in the next election of pulls and deals of bosses and heelers grew up between the civic stepbrothers and joined them is a common interest the germanamerican said he was bookkeeper in some glassworks which had been closed by our tariff and he confessed that he did not mean to return to us though he spoke of german affairs with the impartiality of an outsider he said that the socialist party was increasing faster than any other and that this tacitly meant the suppression of rank and the abolition of monarchy he warned march against the appearance of industrial prosperity in germany beggary was severely repressed and if poverty was better clad than with us it was as hungry and as hopeless in nuremberg as in new york the working classes were kindly and peaceable they only knifed each other quietly on sunday evenings after having too much beer  presently the stranger rose and bowed to the marches for goodby and as he walked down the aisle of trees in which they had been fitting together he seemed to be retreating farther and farther from such americanism as they had in common he had reverted to an entirely german effect of dress and figure his walk was slow and teutonic he must be a type of thousands who have returned to the fatherland without wishing to own themselves its children again and yet out of heart with the only country left them  he was rather pathetic my dear said march in the discomfort he knew his wife must be feeling as well as himself how odd to have the lid lifted here and see the same old problems seething and bubbling in the witchs caldron we call civilization as we left simmering away at home and how hard to have our tariff reach out and snatch the bread from the mouths of those poor glassworkers  i thought that was hard she sighed it must have been his bread too  lets hope it was not his cake anyway i suppose he added dreamily that what we used to like in italy was the absence of all the modern activities the italians didnt repel us by assuming to be of our epoch in the presence of their monuments they knew how to behave as pensive memories i wonder if theyre still as charming  oh no she returned nothing is as charming as it used to be and now we need the charm more than ever  he laughed at her despair in the tacit understanding they had lived into that only one of them was to be desperate at a time and that they were to take turns in cheering each other up well perhaps we dont deserve it and im not sure that we need it so much as we did when we were young weve got tougher we can stand the cold facts better now they made me shiver once but now they give me a sort of agreeable thrill besides if life kept up its pretty illusions if it insisted upon being as charming as it used to be how could we ever bear to die weve got that to consider he yielded to the temptation of his paradox but he did not fail altogether of the purpose with which he began and they took the trolley back to their hotel cheerful in the intrepid fancy that they had confronted fate when they had only had the hardihood to face a phrase  they agreed that now he ought really to find out something about the contemporary life of nuremberg and the next morning he went out before breakfast and strolled through some of the simpler streets in the hope of intimate impressions the peasant women serving portions of milk from house to house out of the cans in the little wagons which they drew themselves were a touch of pleasing domestic comedy a certain effect of tragedy imparted itself from the lamentations of the suckingpigs jolted over the pavements in handcarts a certain majesty from the long procession of yellow mailwagons with drivers in the royal bavarian blue trooping by in the cold small rain impassibly dripping from their glazed hatbrims upon their uniforms but he could not feel that these things were any of them very poignantly significant and he covered his retreat from the actualities of nuremberg by visiting the chief bookstore and buying more photographs of the architecture than he wanted and more local histories than he should ever read he made a last effort for the contemporaneous life by asking the englishspeaking clerk if there were any literary men of distinction living in nuremberg and the clerk said there was not one  he went home to breakfast wondering if he should be able to make his meagre facts serve with his wife but he found her far from any wish to listen to them she was intent upon a pair of young lovers at a table near her own who were so absorbed in each other that they were proof against an interest that must otherwise have pierced them through the bridegroom as he would have called himself was a pretty little bavarian lieutenant very dark and regular and the bride was as pretty and as little but delicately blond nature had admirably mated them and if art had helped to bring them together through the genius of the brides mother who was breakfasting with them it had wrought almost as fitly mrs march queried impartially who they were where they met and how and just when they were going to be married and march consented in his personal immunity from their romance to let it go on under his eyes without protest but later when they met the lovers in the street walking arm in arm with the brides mother behind them gloating upon their bliss he said the woman ought at her time of life to be ashamed of such folly she must know that this affair by nine chances out of ten could not fail to eventuate at the best in a marriage as tiresome as most other marriages and yet she was abandoning herself with those ignorant young people to the illusion that it was the finest and sweetest thing in life  well isnt it his wife asked  yes thats the worst of it it shows how povertystricken life really is we want somehow to believe that each pair of lovers will find the good we have missed and be as happy as we expected to be  i think we have been happy enough and that weve had as much good as was wholesome for us she returned hurt  youre always so concrete i meant us in the abstract but if you will be personal ill say that youve been as happy as you deserve and got more good than you had any right to  she laughed with him and then they laughed again to perceive that they were walking arm in arm too like the lovers whom they were insensibly following  he proposed that while they were in the mood they should go again to the old cemetery and see the hinged jaw of the murdered paumgartner wagging in eternal accusation of his murderess its rather hard on her that he should be having the last word that way he said she was a woman no matter what mistakes she had committed  thats what i call banale said mrs march  it is rather he confessed it makes me feel as if i must go to see the house of durer after all  well i knew we should have to sooner or later  it was the thing that they had said would not do in nuremberg because everybody did it but now they hailed a fiacre and ordered it driven to durers house which they found in a remote part of the town near a stretch of the city wall varied in its picturesqueness by the interposition of a dripping grove it was raining again by the time they reached it the quarter had lapsed from earlier dignity and without being squalid it looked worn and hard worked otherwise it could hardly have been different in durers time his dwelling in no way impressive outside amidst the environing quaintness stood at the corner of a narrow sidehill street that sloped cityward and within it was stripped bare of all the furniture of life belowstairs and above was none the cozier for the stiff appointment of a showhouse it was cavernous and cold but if there had been a fire in the kitchen and a table laid in the diningroom and beds equipped for nightmare after the german fashion in the empty chambers one could have imagined a kindly simple neighborly existence there it in no wise suggested the calling of an artist perhaps because artists had not begun in durers time to take themselves so objectively as they do now but it implied the life of a prosperous citizen and it expressed the period  the marches wrote their names in the visitors book and paid the visitors fee which also bought them tickets in an annual lottery for a reproduction of one of durers pictures and then they came away by no means dissatisfied with his house by its association with his sojourns in italy it recalled visits to other shrines and they had to own that it was really no worse than ariostos house at ferrara or petrarchs at arqua or michelangelos at florence but what i admire he said is our futility in going to see it we expected to surprise some quality of the man left lying about in the house because he lived and died in it and because his wife kept him up so close there and worked him so hard to save his widow from coming to want  who said she did that  a friend of his who hated her but he had to allow that she was a godfearing woman and had a new england conscience  well i dare say durer was easygoing  yes but i dont like her laying her plans to survive him though women always do that  they were going away the next day and they sat down that evening to a final supper in such goodhumor with themselves that they were willing to include a young couple who came to take places at their table though they would rather have been alone they lifted their eyes for their expected salutation and recognized mr and mrs leffers of the norumbia  the ladies fell upon each other as if they had been mother and daughter march and the young man shook hands in the feeling of passengers mutually endeared by the memories of a pleasant voyage they arrived at the fact that mr leffers had received letters in england from his partners which allowed him to prolong his wedding journey in a tour of the continent while their wives were still exclaiming at their encounter in the same hotel at nuremberg and then they all sat down to have as the bride said a real norumbia time  she was one of those young wives who talk always with their eyes submissively on their husbands no matter whom they are speaking to but she was already unconsciously ruling him in her abeyance no doubt she was ruling him for his good she had a livelier mind than he and she knew more as the american wives of young american business men always do and she was planning wisely for their travels she recognized her merit in this devotion with an artless candor which was typical rather than personal march was glad to go out with leffers for a little stroll and to leave mrs march to listen to mrs leffers who did not let them go without making her husband promise to wrap up well and not get his feet wet she made march promise not to take him far and to bring him back early which he found himself very willing to do after an exchange of ideas with mr leffers the young man began to talk about his wife in her providential her almost miraculous adaptation to the sort of man he was and when he had once begun to explain what sort of man he was there was no end to it till they rejoined the ladies in the readingroom     xlvii  the young couple came to the station to see the marches off after dinner the next day and the wife left a bank of flowers on the seat beside mrs march who said as soon as they were gone i believe i would rather meet people of our own age after this i used to think that you could keep young by being with young people but i dont now there world is very different from ours our world doesnt really exist any more but as long as we keep away from theirs we neednt realize it young people she went on are more practicalminded than we used to be theyre quite as sentimental but i dont think they care so much for the higher things theyre not so much brought up on poetry as we were she pursued that little mrs leffers would have read longfellow in our time but now she didnt know of his poem on nuremberg she was intelligent enough about the place but you could see that its quaintness was not so precious as it was to us not so sacred her tone entreated him to find more meaning in her words than she had put into them they couldnt have felt as we did about that old ivied wall and that grassy flowery moat under it and the beautiful damenthor and that pileup of the roofs from the burg and those winding streets with their gothic facades all cobwebbed with trolley wires and that yellow aguishlooking river drowsing through the town under the windows of those overhanging houses and the marketplace and the squares before the churches with their queer shops in the nooks and corners round them  i see what you mean but do you think its as sacred to us as it would have been twentyfive years ago i had an irreverent feeling now and then that nuremberg was overdoing nuremberg  oh yes so had i were that modern if were not so young as we were  we were very simple in those days  well if we were simple we knew it  yes we used to like taking our unconsciousness to pieces and looking at it  we had a good time  too good sometimes it seems as if it would have lasted longer if it had not been so good we might have our cake now if we hadnt eaten it  it would be mouldy though  i wonder he said recurring to the lefferses how we really struck them  well i dont believe they thought we ought to be travelling about alone quite at our age  oh not so bad as that after a moment he said i dare say they dont go round quarrelling on their wedding journey as we did  indeed they do they had an awful quarrel just before they got to nuremberg about his wanting to send some of the baggage to liverpool by express that she wanted to keep with them but she said it had been a lesson and they were never going to quarrel again the elders looked at each other in the light of experience and laughed well she ended thats one thing were through with i suppose weve come to feel more alike than we used to  or not to feel at all how did they settle it about the baggage  oh he insisted on her keeping it with her march laughed again but this time he laughed alone and after a while she said well they gave just the right relief to nuremberg with their good clean american philistinism i dont mind their thinking us queer they must have thought nuremberg was queer  yes we oldsters are always queer to the young were either ridiculously lively and chirpy or were ridiculously stiff and grim they never expect to be like us and wouldnt for the world the worst of it is we elderly people are absurd to one another we dont at the bottom of our hearts believe were like that when we meet i suppose that arrogant old ass of a triscoe looks upon me as a grinning dotard  i wonder said mrs march if shes told him yet and march perceived that she was now suddenly far from the mood of philosophic introspection but he had no difficulty in following her  shes had time enough but it was an awkward task burnamy left to her  yes when i think of that i can hardly forgive him for coming back in that way i know she is dead in love with him but she could only have accepted him conditionally  conditionally to his making it all right with stoller  stoller no to her fathers liking it  ah thats quite as hard what makes you think she accepted him at all  what do you think she was crying about  well i have supposed that ladies occasionally shed tears of pity if she accepted him conditionally she would have to tell her father about it mrs march gave him a glance of silent contempt and he hastened to atone for his stupidity perhaps shes told him on the instalment plan she may have begun by confessing that burnamy had been in carlsbad poor old fellow i wish we were going to find him in ansbach he could make things very smooth for us  well you neednt flatter yourself that youll find him in ansbach im sure i dont know where he is  you might write to miss triscoe and ask  i think i shall wait for miss triscoe to write to me she said with dignity  yes she certainly owes you that much after all your suffering for her ive asked the banker in nuremberg to forward our letters to the poste restante in ansbach isnt it good to see the crows again after those ravens around carlsbad  she joined him in looking at the mild autumnal landscape through the open window the afternoon was fair and warm and in the level fields bodies of soldiers were at work with picks and spades getting the ground ready for the military manoeuvres they disturbed among the stubble foraging parties of crows which rose from time to time with cries of indignant protest she said with a smile for the crows yes and im thankful that ive got nothing on my conscience whatever happens she added in dismissal of the subject of burnamy  im thankful too my dear id much rather have things on my own im more used to that and i believe i feel less remorse than when youre to blame  they might have been carried near this point by those telepathic influences which have as yet been so imperfectly studied it was only that morning after the lapse of a week since burnamys furtive reappearance in carlsbad that miss triscoe spoke to her father about it and she had at that moment a longing for support and counsel that might well have made its mystical appeal to mrs march  she spoke at last because she could put it off no longer rather than because the right time had come she began as they sat at breakfast papa there is something that i have got to tell you it is something that you ought to know but i have put off telling you because  she hesitated for the reason and well said her father looking up at her from his second cup of coffee what is it  then she answered mr burnamy has been here  in carlsbad when was he here  the night of the emperors birthday he came into the box when you were behind the scenes with mr march afterwards i met him in the crowd  well  i thought you ought to know mrs march said i ought to tell you  did she say you ought to wait a week he gave way to an irascibility which he tried to check and to ask with indifference why did he come back  he was going to write about it for that paper in paris the girl had the effect of gathering her courage up for a bold plunge she looked steadily at her father and added he said he came back because he couldnt help it hewished to speak with me he said he knew he had no right to suppose i cared anything about what had happened with him and mr stoller he wanted to come back and tell methat  her father waited for her to go on but apparently she was going to leave the word to him now he hesitated to take it but he asked at last with a mildness that seemed to surprise her have you heard anything from him since  no  where is he  i dont know i told him i could not say what he wished that i must tell you about it  the case was less simple than it would once have been for general triscoe there was still his affection for his daughter his wish for her happiness but this had always been subordinate to his sense of his own interest and comfort and a question had recently arisen which put his paternal love and duty in a new light he was no more explicit with himself than other men are and the most which could ever be said of him without injustice was that in his dependence upon her he would rather have kept his daughter to himself if she could not have been very prosperously married on the other hand if he disliked the man for whom she now hardly hid her liking he was not just then ready to go to extremes concerning him  he was very anxious she went on that you should know just how it was he thinks everything of your judgment andandopinion the general made a consenting noise in his throat he said that he did not wish me to whitewash him to you he didnt think he had done right he didnt excuse himself or ask you to excuse him unless you could from the standpoint of a gentleman  the general made a less consenting noise in his throat and asked how do you look at it yourself agatha  i dont believe i quite understand it but mrs march  oh mrs march the general snorted  says that mr march does not think so badly of it as mr burnamy does  i doubt it at any rate i understood march quite differently  she says that he thinks he behaved very nobly afterwards when mr stoller wanted him to help him put a false complexion on it that it was all the more difficult for him to do right then because of his remorse for what he had done before as she spoke on she had become more eager  theres something in that the general admitted with a candor that he made the most of both to himself and to her but i should like to know what stoller had to say of it all is there anything he inquired any reason why i need be more explicit about it just now  nno only i thoughthe thinks so much of your opinion thatif  oh he can very well afford to wait if he values my opinion so highly he can give me time to make up my mind  of course  and im not responsible the general continued significantly for the delay altogether if you had told me this beforenow i dont know whether stoller is still in town  he was not behaving openly with her but she had not behaved openly with him she owned that to herself and she got what comfort she could from his making the affair a question of what burnamy had done to stoller rather than of what burnamy had said to her and what she had answered him if she was not perfectly clear as to what she wanted to do or wished to have happen there was now time and place in which she could delay and make sure the accepted theory of such matters is that people know their minds from the beginning and that they do not change them but experience seems to contradict this theory or else people often act contrary to their convictions and impulses if the statistics were accessible it might be found that many potential engagements hovered in a doubtful air and before they touched the earth in actual promise were dissipated by the play of meteorological chances  when general triscoe put down his napkin in rising he said that he would step round to pupps and see if stoller were still there but on the way he stepped up to mrs addings hotel on the hill and he came back after an interval which he seemed not to have found long to report rather casually that stoller had left carlsbad the day before by this time the fact seemed not to concern agatha herself very vitally  he asked if the marches had left any address with her and she answered that they had not they were going to spend a few days in nuremberg and then push on to holland for mr marchs aftercure there was no relevance in his question unless it intimated his belief that she was in confidential correspondence with mrs march and she met this by saying that she was going to write her in care of their bankers she asked whether he wished to send any word  no i understand he intimated that there is nothing at all in the nature of aaan understanding then with  no nothing  hm the general waited a moment then he ventured do you care to saydo you wish me to knowhow he took it  the tears came into the girls eyes but she governed herself to say hehe was disappointed  he had no right to be disappointed  it was a question and she answered he thought he had he saidthat he wouldnttrouble me any more  the general did not ask at once and you dont know where he is nowyou havent heard anything from him since  agatha flashed through her tears papa  oh i beg your pardon i think you told me     pg editors bookmarks      americans are hungrier for royalty than anybody else     effort to get on common ground with an inferior     he buys my poverty and not my will     honest selfishness     intrepid fancy that they had confronted

nature brings to life at last     votingcattle whom they bought and sold     we dont seem so much our own property     we get too much into the hands of other people     their silver wedding journey    part iii   xlviii  at the first station where the train stopped a young german bowed himself into the compartment with the marches and so visibly resisted an impulse to smoke that march begged him to light his cigarette in the talk which this friendly overture led to between them he explained that he was a railway architect employed by the government on that line of road and was travelling officially march spoke of nuremberg he owned the sort of surfeit he had suffered from its excessive mediaevalism and the young man said it was part of the new imperial patriotism to cherish the gothic throughout germany no other sort of architecture was permitted in nuremberg but they would find enough classicism at ansbach he promised them and he entered with sympathetic intelligence into their wish to see this former capital when march told him they were going to stop there in hopes of something typical of the old disjointed germany of the petty principalities the little paternal despotisms now extinct  as they talked on partly in german and partly in english their purpose in visiting ansbach appeared to the marches more meditated than it was in fact it was somewhat accidental ansbach was near nuremberg it was not much out of the way to holland they took more and more credit to themselves for a reasoned and definite motive in the light of their companions enthusiasm for the place and its charm began for them with the drive from the station through streets whose sentiment was both italian and french and where there was a yellowish cast in the gray of the architecture which was almost mantuan they rested their sensibilities so bruised and fretted by gothic angles and points against the smooth surfaces of the prevailing classicistic facades of the houses as they passed and when they arrived at their hotel an old mansion of versailles type fronting on a long irregular square planted with pollard sycamores they said that it might as well have been lucca  the archway and stairway of the hotel were draped with the bavarian colors and they were obscurely flattered to learn that prince leopold the brother of the princeregent of the kingdom had taken rooms there on his way to the manoeuvres at nuremberg and was momently expected with his suite they realized that they were not of the princely party however when they were told that he had sole possession of the diningroom and they went out to another hotel and had their supper in keeping delightfully native people seemed to come there to write their letters and make up their accounts as well as to eat their suppers they called for stationery like characters in old comedy and the clatter of crockery and the scratching of pens went on together and fortune offered the marches a delicate reparation for their exclusion from their own hotel in the cold popular reception of the prince which they got back just in time to witness a very small group of people mostly women and boys had gathered to see him arrive but there was no cheering or any sign of public interest perhaps he personally merited none he looked a dull sad man with his plain stubbed features and after he had mounted to his apartment the officers of his staff stood quite across the landing and barred the passage of the americans ignoring even mrs marchs presence as they talked together  well my dear said her husband here you have it at last this is what youve been living for ever since we came to germany its a great moment  yes what are you going to do  who i oh nothing this is your affair its for you to act  if she had been young she might have withered them with a glance she doubted now if her dim eyes would have any such power but she advanced steadily upon them and then the officers seemed aware of her and stood aside  march always insisted that they stood aside apologetically but she held as firmly that they stood aside impertinently or at least indifferently and that the insult to her american womanhood was perfectly ideal it is true that nothing of the kind happened again during their stay at the hotel the princes officers were afterwards about in the corridors and on the stairs but they offered no shadow of obstruction to her going and coming and the landlord himself was not so preoccupied with his highhotes but he had time to express his grief that she had been obliged to go out for supper  they satisfied the passion for the little obsolete capital which had been growing upon them by strolling past the old resident at an hour so favorable for a first impression it loomed in the gathering dusk even vaster than it was and it was really vast enough for the pride of a king of france much more a margrave of ansbach time had blackened and blotched its coarse limestone walls to one complexion with the statues swelling and strutting in the figure of roman legionaries before it and standing out against the evening sky along its balustraded roof and had softened to the right tint the stretch of half a dozen houses with mansard roofs and renaissance facades obsequiously in keeping with the versailles ideal of a resident in the rear and elsewhere at fit distance from its courts a native architecture prevailed and at no great remove the marches found themselves in a simple german town again there they stumbled upon a little booksellers shop blinking in a quiet corner and bought three or four guides and small histories of ansbach which they carried home and studied between drowsing and waking the wonderful german syntax seems at its most enigmatical in this sort of literature and sometimes they lost themselves in its labyrinths completely and only made their way perilously out with the help of cumulative declensions past articles and adjectives blindly seeking their nouns to longprocrastinated verbs dancing like swampfires in the distance they emerged a little less ignorant than they went in and better qualified than they would otherwise have been for their second visit to the schloss which they paid early the next morning  they were so early indeed that when they mounted from the great inner court much too big for ansbach if not for the building and rung the custodians bell a smiling maid who let them into an anteroom where she kept on picking over vegetables for her dinner said the custodian was busy and could not be seen till ten oclock she seemed in her nook of the pretentious pile as innocently unconscious of its history as any hensparrow who had built her nest in some coign of its architecture and her friendly peaceful domesticity remained a wholesome human background to the tragedies and comedies of the past and held them in a picturesque relief in which they were alike tolerable and even charming  the history of ansbach strikes its roots in the soil of fable and above ground is a gnarled and twisted growth of good and bad from the time of the great charles to the time of the great frederick between these times she had her various rulers ecclesiastical and secular in various forms of vassalage to the empire but for nearly four centuries her sovereignty was in the hands of the margraves who reigned in a constantly increasing splendor till the last sold her outright to the king of prussia in 1791 and went to live in england on the proceeds she had taken her part in the miseries and glories of the wars that desolated germany but after the reformation when she turned from the ancient faith to which she owed her cloistered origin under st gumpertus her people had peace except when their last prince sold them to fight the battles of others it is in this last transaction that her history almost in the moment when she ceased to have a history of her own links to that of the modern world and that it came home to the marches in their national character for two thousand of those poor ansbach mercenaries were bought up by england and sent to put down a rebellion in her american colonies  humanly they were more concerned for the last margrave because of certain qualities which made him the best margrave in spite of the defects of his qualities he was the son of the wild margrave equally known in the ansbach annals who may not have been the worst margrave but who had certainly a bad trick of putting his subjects to death without trial and in cases where there was special haste with his own hand he sent his son to the university at utrecht because he believed that the republican influences in holland would be wholesome for him and then he sent him to travel in italy but when the boy came home looking frail and sick the wild margrave charged his official travelling companion with neglect and had the unhappy hofrath meyer hanged without process for this crime one of the gentlemen of his realm for a pasquinade on the margrave was brought to the scaffold he had at various times twentytwo of his soldiers shot with arrows and bullets or hanged for desertion besides many whose penalties his clemency commuted to the loss of an ear or a nose a hungarian who killed his huntingdog he had broken alive on the wheel a soldiers wife was hanged for complicity in a case of desertion a young soldier who eloped with the girl he loved was brought to ansbach from a neighboring town and hanged with her on the same gallows a sentry at the door of one of the margraves castles amiably complied with the margraves request to let him take his gun for a moment on the pretence of wishing to look at it for this breach of discipline the prince covered him with abuse and gave him over to his hussars who bound him to a horses tail and dragged him through the streets he died of his injuries the kennelmaster who had charge of the margraves dogs was accused of neglecting them without further inquiry the margrave rode to the mans house and shot him down on his own threshold a shepherd who met the margrave on a shying horse did not get his flock out of the way quickly enough the margrave demanded the pistols of a gentleman in his company but he answered that they were not loaded and the shepherds life was saved as they returned home the gentleman fired them off what does that mean cried the margrave furiously it means gracious lord that you will sleep sweeter tonight for not having heard my pistols an hour sooner  from this it appears that the gracious lord had his moments of regret but perhaps it is not altogether strange that when he died the whole population stormed through the streets to meet his funeral train not in awestricken silence to meditate on the fall of human grandeur but to unite in an eager tumult of rejoicing as if some cruel brigand who had long held the city in terror were delivered over to them bound and in chains for nearly thirty years this bloodstained miscreant had reigned over his hapless people in a sovereign plenitude of power which by the theory of german imperialism in our day is still a divine right  they called him the wild margrave in their instinctive revolt from the belief that any man not untamably savage could be guilty of his atrocities and they called his son the last margrave with a touch of the poetry which perhaps records a regret for their extinction as a state he did not harry them as his father had done his mild rule was the effect partly of the indifference and distaste for his country bred by his long sojourns abroad but doubtless also it was the effect of a kindly nature even in the matter of selling a few thousands of them to fight the battles of a bad cause on the other side of the world he had the best of motives and faithfully applied the proceeds to the payment of the state debt and the embellishment of the capital  his mother was a younger sister of frederick the great and was so constantly at war with her husband that probably she had nothing to do with the marriage which the wild margrave forced upon their son love certainly had nothing to do with it and the last margrave early escaped from it to the society of mlle clairon the great french tragedienne whom he met in paris and whom he persuaded to come and make her home with him in ansbach she lived there seventeen years and though always an alien she bore herself with kindness to all classes and is still remembered there by the roll of butter which calls itself a klarungswecke in its imperfect french  no roll of butter records in faltering accents the name of the brilliant and disdainful english lady who replaced this poor tragic muse in the margraves heart though the lady herself lived to be the last margravine of ansbach where everybody seems to have hated her with a passion which she doubtless knew how to return she was the daughter of the earl of berkeley and the wife of lord craven a sufficiently unfaithful and unworthy nobleman by her account from whom she was living apart when the margrave asked her to his capital there she set herself to oust mlle clairon with sneers and jests for the theatrical style which the actress could not outlive lady craven said she was sure clairons nightcap must be a crown of gilt paper and when clairon threatened to kill herself and the margrave was alarmed you forget said lady craven that actresses only stab themselves under their sleeves  she drove clairon from ansbach and the great tragedienne returned to paris where she remained true to her false friend and from time to time wrote him letters full of magnanimous counsel and generous tenderness but she could not have been so good company as lady craven who was a very gifted person and knew how to compose songs and sing them and write comedies and play them and who could keep the margrave amused in many ways when his loveless and childless wife died he married the english woman but he grew more and more weary of his dull little court and his dull little country and after a while considering the uncertain tenure sovereigns had of their heads since the french king had lost his and the fact that he had no heirs to follow him in his principality he resolved to cede it for a certain sum to prussia to this end his new wifes urgence was perhaps not wanting they went to england where she outlived him ten years and wrote her memoirs  the custodian of the schloss came at last and the marches saw instantly that he was worth waiting for he was as vainglorious of the palace as any grandmonarching margrave of them all he could not have been more personally superb in showing their different effigies if they had been his own family portraits and he would not spare the strangers a single splendor of the twenty vast handsome tiresome versailleslike rooms he led them through the rooms were fatiguing physically but so poignantly interesting that mrs march would not have missed though she perished of her pleasure one of the things she saw she had for once a surfeit of highhoting in the pictures the porcelains the thrones and canopies the tapestries the historical associations with the margraves and their marriages with the great frederick and the great napoleon the great napoleons man bernadotte made the schloss his headquarters when he occupied ansbach after austerlitz and here he completed his arrangements for taking her bargain from prussia and handing it over to bavaria with whom it still remains twice the great frederick had sojourned in the palace visiting his sister louise the wife of the wild margrave and more than once it had welcomed her next neighbor and sister wilhelmina the margravine of baireuth whose autobiographic voice piercingly plaintive and reproachful seemed to quiver in the air here oddly enough the spell of the wild margrave weakened in the presence of his portrait which signally failed to justify his fame of furious tyrant that seems indeed to have been rather the popular and historical conception of him than the impression he made upon his exalted contemporaries the margravine of baireuth at any rate could so far excuse her poor bloodstained brotherinlaw as to say the margrave of ansbach    was a young prince who had been very badly educated he continually illtreated my sister they led the life of cat and dog my sister it is true was sometimes in fault     her education had been very bad   she was married at fourteen  at parting the custodian told the marches that he would easily have known them for americans by the handsome fee they gave him they came away flown with his praise and their national vanity was again flattered when they got out into the principal square of ansbach there in a booksellers window they found among the pamphlets teaching different languages without a master one devoted to the amerikanische sprache as distinguished from the englische sprache that there could be no mistake the cover was printed with colors in a german ideal of the starspangled banner and march said he always knew that we had a language of our own and that now he was going in to buy that pamphlet and find out what it was like he asked the young shopwoman how it differed from english which she spoke fairly well from having lived eight years in chicago she said that it differed from the english mainly in emphasis and pronunciation for instance the english say half past and the americans half past the english say laht and the americans say late  the weather had now been clear quite long enough and it was raining again a fine bitter piercing drizzle they asked the girl if it always rained in ansbach and she owned that it nearly always did she said that sometimes she longed for a little american summer that it was never quite warm in ansbach and when they had got out into the rain march said it was very nice to stumble on chicago in an ansbach bookstore you ought to have told her you had a married daughter in chicago dont miss another such chance  we shall need another bag if we keep on buying books at this rate said his wife with tranquil irrelevance and not to give him time for protest she pushed him into a shop where the valises in the window perhaps suggested her thought march made haste to forestall her there by saying they were americans but the mistress of the shop seemed to have her misgivings and born americans perhaps she ventured she had probably never met any but the naturalized sort and supposed these were the only sort march reassured her and then she said she had a son living in jersey city and she made march take his address that he might tell him he had seen his mother she had apparently no conception what a great way jersey city is from new york  mrs march would not take his arm when they came out now that is what i never can get used to in you basil and ive tried to palliate it for twentyseven years you know you wont look up that poor womans son why did you let her think you would  how could i tell her i wouldnt perhaps i shall  no no you never will i know youre good and kind and thats why i cant understand your being so cruel when we get back how will you ever find time to go over to jersey city  he could not tell but at last he said ill tell you what you must keep me up to it you know how much you enjoy making me do my duty and this will be such a pleasure  she laughed forlornly but after a moment she took his arm and he began from the example of this good mother to philosophize the continuous simplicity and sanity of the people of ansbach under all their civic changes saints and soldiers knights and barons margraves princes kings emperors had come and gone and left their singlehearted friendly subjectfolk pretty much what they found them the people had suffered and survived through a thousand wars and apparently prospered on under all governments and misgovernments when the court was most french most artificial most vicious the citizen life must have remained immutably german dull and kind after all he said humanity seemed everywhere to be pretty safe and pretty much the same  yes that is all very well she returned and you can theorize interestingly enough but im afraid that poor mother there had no more reality for you than those people in the past you appreciate her as a type and you dont care for her as a human being youre nothing but a dreamer after all i dont blame you she went on its your temperament and you cant change now  i may change for the worse he threatened i think i have already i dont believe i could stand up to dryfoos now as i did for poor old lindau when i risked your bread and butter for his i look back in wonder and admiration at myself ive steadily lost touch with life since then im a trifler a dilettante and an amateur of the right and the good as i used to be when i was young oh i have the grace to be troubled at times now and once i never was it never occurred to me then that the world wasnt made to interest me or at the best to instruct me but it does now at times  she always came to his defence when he accused himself it was the best ground he could take with her i think you behaved very well with burnamy you did your duty then  did i im not so sure at any rate its the last time i shall do it ive served my term i think i should tell him that he was all right in that business with stoller if i were to meet him now  isnt it strange she said provisionally that we dont come upon a trace of him anywhere in ansbach  ah youve been hoping he would turn up  yes i dont deny it i feel very unhappy about him  i dont hes too much like me he would have been quite capable of promising that poor woman to look up her son in jersey city when i think of that i have no patience with burnamy  i am going to ask the landlord about him now hes got rid of his highhotes said mrs march     xlix  they went home to their hotel for their midday dinner and to the comfort of having it nearly all to themselves prince leopold had risen early like all the hardworking potentates of the continent and got away to the manoeuvres somewhere at six oclock the decorations had been removed and the courtyard where the hired coach and pair of the prince had rolled in the evening before had only a few majestic ducks waddling about in it and quacking together indifferent to the presence of a yellow mailwagon on which the driver had been apparently dozing till the hour of noon should sound he sat there immovable but at the last stroke of the clock he woke up and drove vigorously away to the station  the diningroom which they had been kept out of by the prince the night before was not such as to embitter the sense of their wrong by its splendor after all the tastes of royalty must be simple if the prince might have gone to the schloss and had chosen rather to stay at this modest hotel but perhaps the schloss was reserved for more immediate royalty than the brothers of princeregents and in that case he could not have done better than dine at the golden star if he paid no more than two marks he dined as cheaply as a prince could wish and as abundantly the wine at ansbach was rather thin and sour but the bread march declared was the best bread in the whole world not excepting the bread of carlsbad  after dinner the marches had some of the local pastry not so incomparable as the bread with their coffee which they had served them in a pavilion of the beautiful garden remaining to the hotel from the time when it was a patrician mansion the garden had roses in it and several sorts of late summer flowers as well as ripe cherries currants grapes and a virginiacreeper red with autumn all harmoniously contemporaneous as they might easily be in a climate where no one of the seasons can very well know itself from the others it had not been raining for half an hour and the sun was scalding hot so that the shelter of their roof was very grateful and the puddles of the paths were drying up with the haste which puddles have to make in germany between rains if they are ever going to dry up at all  the landlord came out to see if they were well served and he was sincerely obliging in the english he had learned as a waiter in london mrs march made haste to ask him if a young american of the name of burnamy had been staying with him a few weeks before and she described burnamys beauty and amiability so vividly that the landlord if he had been a woman could not have failed to remember him but he failed with a real grief apparently and certainly a real politeness to recall either his name or his person the landlord was an intelligent goodlooking young fellow he told them that he was lately married and they liked him so much that they were sorry to see him afterwards privately boxing the ears of the piccolo the waiters little understudy perhaps the piccolo deserved it but they would rather not have witnessed his punishment his being in a dresscoat seemed to make it also an indignity  in the late afternoon they went to the cafe in the old orangery of the schloss for a cup of tea and found themselves in the company of several ansbach ladies who had brought their work in the evident habit of coming there every afternoon for their coffee and for a dish of gossip they were kind uncomely motherlylooking bodies one of them combed her hair at the table and they all sat outside of the cafe with their feet on the borders of the puddles which had not dried up there in the shade of the building  a deep lawn darkened at its farther edge by the long shadows of trees stretched before them with the sunset light on it and it was all very quiet and friendly the tea brought to the marches was brewed from some herb apparently of native growth with bits of what looked like willow leaves in it but it was flavored with a clove in each cup and they sat contentedly over it and tried to make out what the ansbach ladies were talking about these had recognized the strangers for americans and one of them explained that americans spoke the same language as the english and yet were not quite the same people  she differs from the girl in the bookstore said march translating to his wife let us get away before she says that we are not so nice as the english and they made off toward the avenue of trees beyond the lawn  there were a few people walking up and down in the alley making the most of the moment of dry weather they saluted one another like acquaintances and three cleanshaven walnutfaced old peasants bowed in response to marchs stare with a selfrespectful civility they were yeomen of the region of ansbach where the country round about is dotted with their cottages and not held in vast homeless tracts by the nobles as in north germany  the bavarian who had imparted this fact to march at breakfast not without a certain tacit pride in it to the disadvantage of the prussians was at the supper table and was disposed to more talk which he managed in a stout slow english of his own he said he had never really spoken english with an englishspeaking person before or at all since he studied it in school at munich  i should be afraid to put my schoolboy german against your english march said and when he had understood the other laughed for pleasure and reported the compliment to his wife in their own parlance you germans certainly beat us in languages  oh well he retaliated the americans beat us in some other things and mrs march felt that this was but just she would have liked to mention a few but not ungraciously she and the german lady kept smiling across the table and trying detached vocables of their respective tongues upon each other  the bavarian said he lived in munich still but was in ansbach on an affair of business he asked march if he were not going to see the manoeuvres somewhere till now the manoeuvres had merely been the interesting background of their travel but now hearing that the emperor of germany the king of saxony the regent of bavaria and the king of wurtemberg the granddukes of weimar and baden with visiting potentates of all sorts and innumerable lesser highhotes foreign and domestic were to be present mrs march resolved that they must go to at least one of the reviews  if you go to frankfort you can see the king of italy too said the bavarian but he owned that they probably could not get into a hotel there and he asked why they should not go to wurzburg where they could see all the sovereigns except the king of italy  wurzburg wurzburg march queried of his wife where did we hear of that place  isnt it where burnamy said mr stoller had left his daughters at school  so it is and is that on the way to the rhine he asked the bavarian  no no wurzburg is on the main about five hours from ansbach and it is a very interesting place it is where the good wine comes from  oh yes said march and in their rooms his wife got out all their guides and maps and began to inform herself and to inform him about wurzburg but first she said it was very cold and he must order some fire made in the tall german stove in their parlor the maid who came said gleich but she did not come back and about the time they were getting furious at her neglect they began getting warm he put his hand on the stove and found it hot then he looked down for a door in the stove where he might shut a damper there was no door  good heavens he shouted its like something in a dream and he ran to pull the bell for help  no no dont ring it will make us ridiculous theyll think americans dont know anything there must be some way of dampening the stove and if there isnt id rather suffocate than give myself away mrs march ran and opened the window while her husband carefully examined the stove at every point and explored the pipe for the damper in vain cant you find it the night wind came in raw and damp and threatened to blow their lamp out and she was obliged to shut the window  not a sign of it i will go down and ask the landlord in strict confidence how they dampen their stoves in ansbach  well if you must its getting hotter every moment she followed him timorously into the corridor lit by a hanging lamp turned low for the night  he looked at his watch it was eleven oclock im afraid theyre all in bed  yes you mustnt go we must try to find out for ourselves what can that door be for  it was a low iron door half the height of a man in the wall near their room and it yielded to his pull get a candle he whispered and when she brought it he stooped to enter the doorway  oh do you think youd better she hesitated  you can come too if youre afraid youve always said you wanted to die with me  well but you go first  he disappeared within and then came back to the doorway just come in here a moment she found herself in a sort of antechamber half the height of her own room and following his gesture she looked down where in one corner some crouching monster seemed showing its fiery teeth in a grin of derision this grin was the damper of their stove and this was where the maid had kindled the fire which had been roasting them alive and was still joyously chuckling to itself i think that munich man was wrong i dont believe we beat the germans in anything there isnt a hotel in the united states where the stoves have no front doors and every one of them has the space of a goodsized flat given up to the convenience of kindling a fire in it     l  after a red sunset of shameless duplicity march was awakened to a rainy morning by the clinking of cavalry hoofs on the pavement of the longirregular square before the hotel and he hurried out to see the passing of the soldiers on their way to the manoeuvres they were troops of all arms but mainly infantry and as they stumped heavily through the groups of apathetic citizens in their mudsplashed boots they took the steady downpour on their dripping helmets some of them were smoking but none smiling except one gay fellow who made a joke to a servingmaid on the sidewalk an old officer halted his staff to scold a citizen who had given him a mistaken direction the shame of the erring man was great and the pride of a fellowcitizen who corrected him was not less though the arrogant brute before whom they both cringed used them with equal scorn the younger officers listened indifferently round on horseback behind the glitter of their eyeglasses and one of them amused himself by turning the silver bangles on his wrist  then the files of soldier slaves passed on and march crossed the bridge spanning the gardens in what had been the city moat and found his way to the marketplace under the walls of the old gothic church of st gumpertus the market which spread pretty well over the square seemed to be also a fair with peasants clothes and local pottery for sale as well as fruits and vegetables and large baskets of flowers with old women squatting before them it was all as picturesque as the markets used to be in montreal and quebec and in a cloudy memory of his wedding journey long before he bought so lavishly of the flowers to carry back to his wife that a little girl who saw his armload from her window as he returned laughed at him and then drew shyly back her laugh reminded him how many happy children he had seen in germany and how freely they seemed to play everywhere with no one to make them afraid when they grow up the women laugh as little as the men whose rude toil the soldiering leaves them to  he got home with his flowers and his wife took them absently and made him join her in watching the sight which had fascinated her in the street under their windows a slender girl with a waist as slim as a corseted officers from time to time came out of the house across the way to the firewood which had been thrown from a wagon upon the sidewalk there each time she embraced several of the heavy fourfoot logs and disappeared with them indoors once she paused from her work to joke with a welldressed man who came by and seemed to find nothing odd in her work some gentlemen lounging at the window over head watched her with no apparent sense of anomaly  what do you think of that asked mrs march i think its good exercise for the girl and i should like to recommend it to those fat fellows at the window i suppose shell saw the wood in the cellar and then lug it up stairs and pile it up in the stoves dressingrooms  dont laugh its too disgraceful  well i dont know if you like ill offer these gentlemen across the way your opinion of it in the language of goethe and schiller  i wish youd offer my opinion of them theyve been staring in here with an operaglass  ah thats a different affair there isnt much going on in ansbach and they have to make the most of it  the lower casements of the houses were furnished with mirrors set at right angles with them and nothing which went on in the streets was lost some of the streets were long and straight and at rare moments they lay full of sun at such times the marches were puzzled by the sight of citizens carrying open umbrellas and they wondered if they had forgotten to put them down or thought it not worth while in the brief respites from the rain or were profiting by such rare occasions to dry them and some other sights remained baffling to the last once a man with his hands pinioned before him and a gendarme marching stolidly after him with his musket on his shoulder passed under their windows but who he was or what he had done or was to suffer they never knew another time a pair went by on the way to the railway station a young man carrying an umbrella under his arm and a very decentlooking old woman lugging a heavy carpet bag who left them to the lasting question whether she was the young mans servant in her best clothes or merely his mother  women do not do everything in ansbach however the sacristans being men as the marches found when they went to complete their impression of the courtly past of the city by visiting the funeral chapel of the margraves in the crypt of st johannis church in the little exmargravely capital there was something of the neighborly interest in the curiosity of strangers which endears italian witness the whitehaired streetsweeper of ansbach who willingly left his broom to guide them to the house of the sacristan might have been a streetsweeper in vicenza and the old sacristan when he put his velvet skullcap out of an upper window and professed his willingness to show them the chapel disappointed them by saying gleich instead of subito the architecture of the houses was a party to the illusion st johannis like the older church of st gumpertus is gothic with the two unequal towers which seem distinctive of ansbach at the st gumpertus end of the place where they both stand the dwellings are gothic too and might be in hamburg but at the st johannis end they seem to have felt the exotic spirit of the court and are of a sort of teutonized renaissance  the rococo margraves and margravines used of course to worship in st johannis church now they all such as did not marry abroad lie in the crypt of the church in caskets of bronze and copper and marble with draperies of black samite more and more funereally vainglorious to the last their courtly coffins are ranged in a kind of hemicycle with the little coffins of the children that died before they came to the knowledge of their greatness on one of these a kneeling figurine in bronze holds up the effigy of the child within on another the epitaph plays tenderly with the fate of a little princess who died in her first year       in the rosemonth was this sweet rose taken      for the rosekind hath she earth forsaken      the princess is the rose that here no longer blows      from the stem by deaths hand rudely shaken      then rest in the rosehouse      little princessrosebud dear      there lifes rose shall bloom again      in heavens sunshine clear  while march struggled to get this into english words two german ladies who had made themselves of his party passed reverently away and left him to pay the sacristan alone  that is all right he said when he came out i think we got the most value and they didnt look as if they could afford it so well though you never can tell here these ladies may be the highest kind of highhotes practising a praiseworthy economy i hope the lesson wont be lost on us they have saved enough by us for their coffee at the orangery let us go and have a little willowleaf tea  the orangery perpetually lured them by what it had kept of the days when an orangery was essential to the selfrespect of every sovereign prince and of so many private gentlemen on their way they always passed the statue of count platen the dull poet whom heines hate would have delivered so cruelly over to an immortality of contempt but who stands there near the schloss in a grassplot prettily planted with flowers and ignores his brilliant enemy in the comfortable durability of bronze and there always awaited them in the old pleasaunce the pathos of kaspar hausers fate which his murder affixes to it with a red stain  after their cups of willow leaves at the cafe they went up into that nook of the plantation where the simple shaft of churchwardens gothic commemorates the assassination on the spot where it befell here the hapless youth whose mystery will never be fathomed on earth used to come for a little respite from his harsh guardian in ansbach homesick for the kindness of his nuremberg friends and here his murderer found him and dealt him the mortal blow  march lingered upon the last sad circumstance of the tragedy in which the wounded boy dragged himself home to suffer the suspicion and neglect of his guardian till death attested his good faith beyond cavil he said this was the hardest thing to bear in all his story and that he would like to have a look into the soul of the dull unkind wretch who had so misread his charge he was going on with an inquiry that pleased him much when his wife pulled him abruptly away  now i see you are yielding to the fascination of it and you are wanting to take the material from burnamy  oh well let him have the material he will spoil it and i can always reject it if he offers it to every other week  i could believe after your behavior to that poor woman about her son in jersey city youre really capable of it  what comprehensive inculpation i had forgotten about that poor woman     li  the letters which march had asked his nuremberg banker to send them came just as they were leaving ansbach the landlord sent them down to the station and mrs march opened them in the train and read them first so that she could prepare him if there were anything annoying in them as well as indulge her livelier curiosity  theyre from both the children she said without waiting for him to ask you can look at them later theres a very nice letter from mrs adding to me and one from dear little rose for you then she hesitated with her hand on a letter faced down in her lap and theres one from agatha triscoe which i wonder what youll think of she delayed again and then flashed it open before him and waited with a sort of impassioned patience while he read it  he read it and gave it back to her there doesnt seem to be very much in it  thats it dont you think i had a right to there being something in it after all i did for her  i always hoped you hadnt done anything for her but if you have why should she give herself away on paper its a very proper letter  its a little too proper and its the last i shall have to do with her she knew that i should be on pins and needles till i heard how her father had taken burnamys being there that night and she doesnt say a word about it  the general may have had a tantrum that she couldnt describe perhaps she hasnt told him yet  she would tell him instantly cried mrs march who began to find reason in the supposition as well as comfort for the hurt which the girls reticence had given her or if she wouldnt it would be because she was waiting for the best chance  that would be like the wise daughter of a difficult father she may be waiting for the best chance to say how he took it no im all for miss triscoe and i hope that now if shes taken herself off our hands shell keep off  its altogether likely that hes made her promise not to tell me anything about it mrs march mused aloud  that would be unjust to a person who had behaved so discreetly as you have said her husband  they were on their way to wurzburg and at the first station which was a junction a lady mounted to their compartment just before the train began to move she was stout and middleaged and had never been pretty but she bore herself with a kind of authority in spite of her thread gloves her dowdy gray travellingdress and a hat of lower middleclass english tastelessness she took the only seat vacant a backwardriding place beside a sleeping passenger who looked like a commercial traveller but she seemed ill at ease in it and march offered her his seat she accepted it very promptly and thanked him for it in the english of a german and mrs march now classed her as a governess who had been teaching in england and had acquired the national feeling for dress but in this character she found her interesting and even a little pathetic and she made her some overtures of talk which the other met eagerly enough they were now running among low hills not so picturesque as those between eger and nuremberg but of much the same toylike quaintness in the villages dropped here and there in their valleys one small town completely walled with its gray houses and red roofs showed through the green of its trees and gardens so like a colored print in a childs storybook that mrs march cried out for joy in it and then accounted for her rapture by explaining to the stranger that they were americans and had never been in germany before the lady was not visibly affected by the fact she said casually that she had often been in that little town which she named her uncle had a castle in the country back of it and she came with her husband for the shooting in the autumn by a natural transition she spoke of her children for whom she had an english governess she said she had never been in england but had learnt the language from a governess in her own childhood and through it all mrs march perceived that she was trying to impress them with her consequence to humor her pose she said they had been looking up the scene of kaspar hausers death at ansbach and at this the stranger launched into such intimate particulars concerning him and was so familiar at first hands with the facts of his life that mrs march let her run on too much amused with her pretensions to betray any doubt of her she wondered if march were enjoying it all as much and from time to time she tried to catch his eye while the lady talked constantly and rather loudly helping herself out with words from them both when her english failed her in the safety of her perfect understanding of the case mrs march now submitted farther and even suffered some patronage from her which in another mood she would have met with a decided snub  as they drew in among the broad vinewebbed slopes of the wurzburg hills the stranger said she was going to change there and take a train on to berlin mrs march wondered whether she would be able to keep up the comedy to the last and she had to own that she carried it off very easily when the friends whom she was expecting did not meet her on the arrival of their train she refused marchs offers of help and remained quietly seated while he got out their wraps and bags she returned with a hardy smile the cold leave mrs march took of her and when a porter came to the door and forced his way by the marches to ask with anxious servility if she were the baroness von she bade the man get them a traeger and then come back for her she waved them a complacent adieu before they mixed with the crowd and lost sight of her  well my dear said march addressing the snobbishness in his wife which he knew to be so wholly impersonal youve mingled with one highhote anyway i must say she didnt look it any more than the duke and duchess of orleans and yet shes only a baroness think of our being three hours in the same compartment and she doing all she could to impress us and our getting no good of it i hoped you were feeling her quality so that we should have it in the family anyway and always know what it was like but so far the highhotes have all been terribly disappointing  he teased on as they followed the traeger with their baggage out of the station and in the omnibus on the way to their hotel he recurred to the loss they had suffered in the baronesss failure to dramatize her nobility effectually after all perhaps she was as much disappointed in us i dont suppose we looked any more like democrats than she looked like an aristocrat  but theres a great difference mrs march returned at last it isnt at all a parallel case we were not real democrats and she was a real aristocrat  to be sure there is that way of looking at it thats rather novel i wish i had thought of that myself she was certainly more to blame than we were     lii  the square in front of the station was planted with flagpoles wreathed in evergreens a triumphal arch was nearly finished and a colossal allegory in imitation bronze was well on the way to completion in honor of the majesties who were coming for the manoeuvres the streets which the omnibus passed through to the swan inn were draped with the imperial german and the royal bavarian colors and the standards of the visiting nationalities decked the fronts of the houses where their military attaches were lodged but the marches failed to see our own banner and were spared for the moment the ignominy of finding it over an apothecary shop in a retired avenue the sun had come out the sky overhead was of a smiling blue and they felt the galaday glow and thrill in the depths of their inextinguishable youth  the swan inn sits on one of the long quays bordering the main and its windows look down upon the bridges and shipping of the river but the traveller reaches it by a door in the rear through an archway into a back street where an odor dating back to the foundation of the city is waiting to welcome him  the landlord was there too and he greeted the marches so cordially that they fully partook his grief in being able to offer them rooms on the front of the house for two nights only they reconciled themselves to the necessity of then turning out for the staff of the king of saxony the more readily because they knew that there was no hope of better things at any other hotel  the rooms which they could have for the time were charming and they came down to supper in a glazed gallery looking out on the river picturesque with craft of all fashions with rowboats sailboats and little steamers but mainly with long black barges built up into houses in the middle and defended each by a little nervous german dog long rafts of logs weltered in the sunset red which painted the swift current and mantled the immeasurable vineyards of the hills around like the color of their ripening grapes directly in face rose a castled steep which kept the ranging walls and the bastions and battlements of the time when such a stronghold could have defended the city from foes without or from tumult within the arches of a stately bridge spanned the river sunsetward and lifted a succession of colossal figures against the crimson sky  i guess we have been wasting our time my dear said march as they turned from this beauty to the question of supper i wish we had always been here  their waiter had put them at a table in a division of the gallery beyond that which they entered where some groups of officers were noisily supping there was no one in their room but a man whose face was indistinguishable against the light and two young girls who glanced at them with looks at once quelled and defiant and then after a stare at the officers in the gallery beyond whispered together with suppressed giggling the man fed on without noticing them except now and then to utter a growl that silenced the whispering and giggling for a moment the marches from no positive evidence of any sense decided that they were americans  i dont know that i feel responsible for them as their fellowcountryman i should once he said  it isnt that its the worry of trying to make out why they are just what they are his wife returned  the girls drew the mans attention to them and he looked at them for the first time then after a sort of hesitation he went on with his supper they had only begun theirs when he rose with the two girls whom mrs march now saw to be of the same size and dressed alike and came heavily toward them  i thought you was in carlsbad he said bluntly to march with a nod at mrs march he added with a twist of his head toward the two girls my daughters and then left them to her while he talked on with her husband come to see this foolery i suppose im on my way to the woods for my aftercure but i thought i might as well stop and give the girls a chance they got a weeks vacation anyway stoller glanced at them with a sort of troubled tenderness in his strong dull face  oh yes i understood they were at school here said march and he heard one of them saying in a sweet high pipe to his wife  aint it just splendid i hant seen anything equal to it since the worrlds fairr she spoke with a strong contortion of the western r and her sister hastened to put in  i dont think its to be compared with the worrlds fairr but these german girls here just think its great it just does me good to laff at em about it i like to tell em about the electric fountain and the courrt of lionorr when they get to talkin about the illuminations theyre goun to have you goun out to the parade you better engage your carriage right away if you arre the carrsll be a perfect jam fathers engaged ourrs he had to pay sixty marrks forr it  they chattered on without shyness and on as easy terms with a woman of three times their years as if she had been a girl of their own age they willingly took the whole talk to themselves and had left her quite outside of it before stoller turned to her  i been telling mr march here that you better both come to the parade with us i guess my twospanner will hold five or if it wont well make it i dont believe theres a carriage left in wurzburg and if you go in the cars youll have to walk three or four miles before you get to the paradeground you think it over he said to march nobody else is going to have the places anyway and you can say yes at the last minute just as well as now  he moved off with his girls who looked over their shoulders at the officers as they passed on through the adjoining room  my dear cried mrs march didnt you suppose he classed us with burnamy in that business why should he be polite to us  perhaps he wants you to chaperon his daughters hes probably heard of your performance at the kurhaus ball but he knows that i thought burnamy in the wrong this may be stollers way of wiping out an obligation wouldnt you like to go with him  the mere thought of his being in the same town is prostrating id far rather he hated us then he would avoid us  well he doesnt own the town and if it comes to the worst perhaps we can avoid him let us go out anyway and see if we cant  no no im too tired but you go and get all the maps and guides you can theres so very little in baedeker and almost nothing in that great hulking bradshaw of yours and im sure there must be the most interesting history of wurzburg isnt it strange that we havent the slightest association with the name  ive been rummaging in my mind and ive got hold of an association at last said march its beer a sign in a sixth avenue saloon window wurzburger hofbrau  no matter if it is beer find some sketch of the history and well try to get away from the stollers in it i pitied those wild girls too what crazy images of the world must fill their empty minds how their ignorant thoughts must go whirling out into the unknown i dont envy their father do hurry back i shall be thinking about them every instant till you come  she said this but in their own rooms it was so soothing to sit looking through the long twilight at the lovely landscape that the sort of bruise given by their encounter with the stollers had left her consciousness before march returned she made him admire first the convent church on a hill further up the river which exactly balanced the fortress in front of them and then she seized upon the little books he had brought and set him to exploring the labyrinths of their german with a mounting exultation in his discoveries there was a general guide to the city and a special guide with plans and personal details of the approaching manoeuvres and the princes who were to figure in them and there was a sketch of the local history a kind of thing that the germans know how to write particularly well with little gleams of pleasant humor blinking through it for the study of this mrs march realized more and more passionately that they were in the very most central and convenient point for the history of wurzburg might be said to have begun with her princebishops whose rule had begun in the twelfth century and who had built on a forgotten roman work the fortress of the marienburg on that vineyarded hill over against the swan inn there had of course been history before that but nothing so clear nothing so peculiarly swell nothing that so united the glory of this world and the next as that of the princebishops they had made the marienburg their home and kept it against foreign and domestic foes for five hundred years shut within its wellarmed walls they had awed the oftenturbulent city across the main they had held it against the embattled farmers in the peasants war and had splendidly lost it to gustavus adolphus and then got it back again and held it till napoleon took it from them he gave it with their flock to the bavarians who in turn briefly yielded it to the prussians in 1866 and were now in apparently final possession of it  before the princebishops charlemagne and barbarossa had come and gone and since the princebishops there had been visiting thrones and kingdoms enough in the ancient city which was soon to be illustrated by the presence of imperial germany royal wirtemberg and saxony grandducal baden and weimar and a surfeit of all the minor potentates among those who speak the beautiful language of the ja  but none of these could dislodge the princebishops from that supreme place which they had at once taken in mrs marchs fancy the potentates were all going to be housed in the vast palace which the princebishops had built themselves in wurzburg as soon as they found it safe to come down from their stronghold of marienburg and begin to adorn their city and to confirm it in its intense fidelity to the church tiepolo had come up out of italy to fresco their palace where he wrought year after year in that worldly taste which has somehow come to express the most sovereign moment of ecclesiasticism it prevailed so universally in wurzburg that it left her with the name of the rococo city intrenched in a period of time equally remote from early christianity and modern protestantism out of her sixty thousand souls only ten thousand are now of the reformed religion and these bear about the same relation to the catholic spirit of the place that the gothic architecture bears to the baroque  as long as the princebishops lasted the wurzburgers got on very well with but one newspaper and perhaps the smallest amount of merrymaking known outside of the colony of massachusetts bay at the same epoch the princebishops had their finger in everybodys pie and they portioned out the cakes and ale which were made according to formulas of their own the distractions were all of a religious character churches convents monasteries abounded ecclesiastical processions and solemnities were the spectacles that edified if they did not amuse the devout population  it seemed to march an ironical outcome of all this spiritual severity that one of the greatest modern scientific discoveries should have been made in wurzburg and that the roentgen rays should now be giving her name a splendor destined to eclipse the glories of her past  mrs march could not allow that they would do so or at least that the name of roentgen would ever lend more lustre to his city than that of longfellows walther von der vogelweide she was no less surprised than pleased to realize that this friend of the birds was a wurzburger and she said that their first pilgrimage in the morning should be to the church where he lies buried     liii  march went down to breakfast not quite so early as his wife had planned and left her to have her coffee in her room he got a pleasant table in the gallery overlooking the river and he decided that the landscape though it now seemed to be rather too much studied from a dropcertain had certainly lost nothing of its charm in the clear morning light the waiter brought his breakfast and after a little delay came back with a card which he insisted was for march it was not till he put on his glasses and read the name of mr r m kenby that he was able at all to agree with the waiter who stood passive at his elbow  well he said why wasnt this card sent up last night  the waiter explained that the gentleman had just given him his card after asking marchs nationality and was then breakfasting in the next room march caught up his napkin and ran round the partition wall and kenby rose with his napkin and hurried to meet him  i thought it must be you he called out joyfully as they struck their extended hands together but so many people look alike nowadays that i dont trust my eyes any more  kenby said he had spent the time since they last met partly in leipsic and partly in gotha where he had amused himself in rubbing up his rusty german as soon as he realized that wurzburg was so near he had slipped down from gotha for a glimpse of the manoeuvres he added that he supposed march was there to see them and he asked with a quite unembarrassed smile if they had met mr adding in carlsbad and without heeding marchs answer he laughed and added of course i know she must have told mrs march all about it  march could not deny this he laughed too though in his wifes absence he felt bound to forbid himself anything more explicit  i dont give it up you know kenby went on with perfect ease im not a young fellow if you call thirtynine old  at my age i dont march put in and they roared together in mens security from the encroachments of time  but she happens to be the only woman ive ever really wanted to marry for more than a few days at a stretch you know how it is with us  oh yes i know said march and they shouted again  were in love and were out of love twenty times but this isnt a mere fancy its a conviction and theres no reason why she shouldnt marry me  march smiled gravely and his smile was not lost upon kenby you mean the boy he said well i like rose and now march really felt swept from his feet she doesnt deny that she likes me but she seems to think that her marrying again will take her from him the fact is it will only give me to him as for devoting her whole life to him she couldnt do a worse thing for him what the boy needs is a mans care and a mans willgood heavens you dont think i could ever be unkind to the little soul kenby threw himself forward over the table  my dear fellow march protested  id rather cut off my right hand kenby pursued excitedly and then he said with a humorous drop the fact is i dont believe i should want her so much if i couldnt have rose too i want to have them both so far ive only got no for an answer but im not going to keep it i had a letter from rose at carlsbad the other day and  the waiter came forward with a folded scrap of paper on his salver which march knew must be from his wife what is keeping you so she wrote i am all ready its from mrs march he explained to kenby i am going out with her on some errands im awfully glad to see you again we must talk it all over and you mustyou mustntmrs march will want to see you lateriare you in the hotel  oh yes ill see you at the oneoclock table dhote i suppose  march went away with his head whirling in the question whether he should tell his wife at once of kenbys presence or leave her free for the pleasures of wurzburg till he could shape the fact into some safe and acceptable form she met him at the door with her guidebooks wraps and umbrellas and would hardly give him time to get on his hat and coat  now i want you to avoid the stollers as far as you can see them this is to be a real weddingjourney day with no extraneous acquaintance to bother the more strangers the better wurzburg is richer than anything i imagined ive looked it all up ive got the plan of the city so that we can easily find the way well walk first and take carriages whenever we get tired well go to the cathedral at once i want a good gulp of rococo to begin with there wasnt half enough of it at ansbach isnt it strange how weve come round to it  she referred to that passion for the gothic which they had obediently imbibed from ruskin in the days of their early italian travel and courtship when all the englishspeaking world bowed down to him in devout aversion from the renaissance and pious abhorrence of the rococo  what biddable little things we were she went on while march was struggling to keep kenby in the background of his consciousness the rococo must have always had a sneaking charm for us when we were pinning our faith to pointed arches and yet i suppose we were perfectly sincere oh look at that divinely ridiculous madonna they were now making their way out of the crooked footway behind their hotel toward the street leading to the cathedral and she pointed to the blessed virgin over the door of some religious house her drapery billowing about her feet her body twisting to show the sculptors mastery of anatomy and the halo held on her tossing head with the help of stout gilt rays in fact the virgins whole figure was gilded and so was that of the child in her arms isnt she delightful  i see what you mean said march with a dubious glance at the statue but im not sure now that i wouldnt like something quieter in my madonnas  the thoroughfare which they emerged upon with the cathedral ending the prospective was full of the holiday so near at hand the narrow sidewalks were thronged with people both soldiers and civilians and up the middle of the street detachments of military came and went halting the little horsecars and the huge beerwagons which otherwise seemed to have the sole right to the streets of wurzburg they came jingling or thundering out of the aide streets and hurled themselves round the corners reckless of the passers who escaped alive by flattening themselves like posters against the house walls there were peasants men and women in the costume which the unbroken course of their country life had kept as quaint as it was a hundred years before there were citizens in the misfits of the latest german fashions there were soldiers of all arms in their vivid uniforms and from time to time there were pretty young girls in white dresses with low necks and bare arms gloved to the elbows who were following a holiday custom of the place in going about the streets in ball costume the shop windows were filled with portraits of the emperor and the empress and the princeregent and the ladies of his family the german and bavarian colors draped the facades of the houses and festooned the fantastic madonnas posing above so many portals the modern patriotism included the ancient piety without disturbing it the rococo city remained ecclesiastical through its new imperialism and kept the stamp given it by the long rule of the princebishops under the sovereignty of its king and the suzerainty of its kaiser  the marches escaped from the present when they entered the cathedral as wholly as if they had taken hold of the horns of the altar though they were far from literally doing this in an interior so grandiose there area few rococo churches in italy and perhaps more in spain which approach the perfection achieved by the wurzburg cathedral in the baroque style for once one sees what that style can do in architecture and sculpture and whatever one may say of the details one cannot deny that there is a prodigiously effective keeping in it all this interior came together as the decorators say with a harmony that the travellers had felt nowhere in their earlier experience of the rococo it was unimpeachably perfect in its way just march murmured to his wife as the social and political and scientific scheme of the eighteenth century was perfected in certain times and places but the odd thing is to find the apotheosis of the rococo away up here in germany i wonder how much the princebishops really liked it but they had become rococo too look at that row of their statues on both sides of the nave what magnificent swell how they abash this poor plain christ here he would like to get behind the pillar he knows that he could never lend himself to the baroque style it expresses the eighteenth century though but how you long for some little hint of the thirteenth or even the nineteenth  i dont she whispered back im perfectly wild with wurzburg i like to have a thing go as far as it can at nuremberg i wanted all the gothic i could get and in wurzburg i want all the baroque i can get i am consistent  she kept on praising herself to his disadvantage as women do all the way to the neumunster church where they were going to revere the tomb of walther von der vogelweide not so much for his own sake as for longfellows the older poet lies buried within but his monument is outside the church perhaps for the greater convenience of the sparrows which now represent the birds he loved the cenotaph is surmounted by a broad vase and around this are thickly perched the effigies of the meistersingers feathered friends from whom the canons of the church as mrs march read aloud from her baedeker long ago directed his bequest to themselves in revenge for their lawless greed the defrauded beneficiaries choose to burlesque the affair by looking like the fourandtwenty blackbirds when the pie was opened  she consented to go for a moment to the gothic marienkapelle with her husband in the revival of his mediaeval taste and she was rewarded amidst its thirteenthcentury sincerity by his recantation you are right baroque is the thing for wurzburg one cant enjoy gothic here any more than one could enjoy baroque in nuremberg  reconciled in the rococo they now called a carriage and went to visit the palace of the princebishops who had so well known how to make the heavenly take the image and superscription of the worldly and they were jointly indignant to find it shut against the public in preparation for the imperialities and royalties coming to occupy it they were in time for the noon guardmounting however and mrs march said that the way the retiring squad kicked their legs out in the high martial step of the german soldiers was a perfect expression of the insolent militarism of their empire and was of itself enough to make one thank heaven that one was an american and a republican she softened a little toward their system when it proved that the garden of the palace was still open and yet more when she sank down upon a bench between two marble groups representing the rape of proserpine and the rape of europa they stood each in a gravelled plot thickly overrun by a growth of ivy and the vine climbed the white naked limbs of the nymphs who were present on a pretence of gathering flowers but really to pose at the spectators and clad them to the waist and shoulders with an effect of modesty never meant by the sculptor but not displeasing there was an old fountain near its stone rim and centre of rockwork green with immemorial mould and its basin quivering between its waterplants under the soft fall of spray at a waft of fitful breeze some leaves of early autumn fell from the trees overhead upon the elderly pair where they sat and a little company of sparrows came and hopped about their feet though the square without was so all astir with festive expectation there were few people in the garden three or four peasant women in densely fluted white skirts and red aprons and shawls wandered by and stared at the europa and at the proserpine  it was a precious moment in which the charm of the citys past seemed to culminate and they were loath to break it by speech  why didnt we have something like all this on our first wedding journey she sighed at last to think of our battening from boston to niagara and back and how hard we tried to make something of rochester and buffalo of montreal and quebec  niagara wasnt so bad he said and i will never go back on quebec  ah but if we could have had hamburg and leipsic and carlsbad and nuremberg and ansbach and wurzburg perhaps this is meant as a compensation for our lost youth but i cant enjoy it as i could when i was young its wasted on my sere and yellow leaf i wish burnamy and miss triscoe were here i should like to try this garden on them  they wouldnt care for it he replied and upon a daring impulse he added kenby and mrs adding might if she took this suggestion in good part he could tell her that kenby was in wurzburg  dont speak of them theyre in just that besotted early middleage when life has settled into a selfsatisfied present with no past and no future the most philistine the most bourgeois moment of existence better be elderly at once as far as appreciation of all this goes she rose and put her hand on his arm and pushed him away in the impulsive fashion of her youth across alleys of old trees toward a balustraded terrace in the background which had tempted her  it isnt so bad being elderly he said by that time we have accumulated enough past to sit down and really enjoy its associations we have got all sorts of perspectives and points of view we know where we are at  i dont mind being elderly the worlds just as amusing as ever and lots of disagreeable things have dropped out its the getting more than elderly its the getting old and then  they shrank a little closer together and walked on in silence till he said perhaps theres something else something bettersomewhere  they had reached the balustraded terrace and were pausing for pleasure in the garden tops below with the flowery spaces and the statued fountains all coming together she put her hand on one of the fat little urchingroups on the stone coping i dont want cherubs when i can have these putti and those old princebishops didnt either  i dont suppose they kept a new england conscience he said with a vague smile it would be difficult in the presence of the rococo  they left the garden through the beautiful gate which the old court ironsmith oegg hammered out in lovely forms of leaves and flowers and shaped laterally upward as lightly as if with a waft of his hand in gracious louis quinze curves and they looked back at it in the kind of despair which any perfection inspires they said how feminine it was how exotic how expressive of a luxurious ideal of life which art had purified and left eternally charming they remembered their ruskinian youth and the confidence with which they would once have condemned it and they had a sense of recreance in now admiring it but they certainly admired it and it remained for them the supreme expression of that timesoul mundane courtly aristocratic flattering which once influenced the art of the whole world and which had here so curiously found its apotheosis in a city remote from its native place and under a rule sacerdotally vowed to austerity the vast superb palace of the prince bishops which was now to house a whole troop of sovereigns imperial royal grand ducal and ducal swelled aloft in superb amplitude but it did not realize their historic pride so effectively as this exquisite work of the court ironsmith it related itself in its aerial beauty to that of the tiepolo frescoes which the travellers knew were swimming and soaring on the ceilings within and from which it seemed to accent their exclusion with a delicate irony march said or ironmongery he corrected himself upon reflection     liv  he had forgotten kenby in these aesthetic interests but he remembered him again when he called a carriage and ordered it driven to their hotel it was the hour of the german midday table dhote and they would be sure to meet him there the question now was how march should own his presence in time to prevent his wife from showing her ignorance of it to kenby himself and he was still turning the question hopelessly over in his mind when the sight of the hotel seemed to remind her of a fact which she announced  now my dear i am tired to death and i am not going to sit through a long table dhote i want you to send me up a simple beefsteak and a cup of tea to our rooms and i dont want you to come near for hours because i intend to take a whole afternoon nap you can keep all the maps and plans and guides and you had better go and see what the volksfest is like it will give you some notion of the part the people are really taking in all this official celebration and you know i dont care dont come up after dinner to see how i am getting along i shall get along and if you should happen to wake me after i had dropped off  kenby had seen them arrive from where he sat at the readingroom window waiting for the dinner hour and had meant to rush out and greet mrs march as they passed up the corridor but she looked so tired that he had decided to spare her till she came down to dinner and as he sat with march at their soup he asked if she were not well  march explained and he provisionally invented some regrets from her that she should not see kenby till supper  kenby ordered a bottle of one of the famous wurzburg wines for their mutual consolation in her absence and in the friendliness which its promoted they agreed to spend the afternoon together no man is so inveterate a husband as not to take kindly an occasional release to bachelor companionship and before the dinner was over they agreed that they would go to the volksfest and get some notion of the popular life and amusements of wurzburg which was one of the few places where kenby had never been before and they agreed that they would walk  their way was partly up the quay of the main past a barrack full of soldiers they met detachments of soldiers everywhere infantry artillery cavalry  this is going to be a great show kenby said meaning the manoeuvres and he added as if now he had kept away from the subject long enough and had a right to recur to it at least indirectly i should like to have rose see it and get his impressions  ive an idea he wouldnt approve of it his mother says his mind is turning more and more to philanthropy  kenby could not forego such a chance to speak of mrs adding its one of the prettiest things to see how she understands rose its charming to see them together she wouldnt have half the attraction without him  oh yes march assented he had often wondered how a man wishing to marry a widow managed with the idea of her children by another marriage but if kenby was honest it was much simpler than he had supposed he could not say this to him however and in a certain embarrassment he had with the conjecture in his presence he attempted a diversion were promised something at the volksfest which will be a great novelty to us as americans our driver told us this morning that one of the houses there was built entirely of wood  when they reached the grounds of the volksfest this civil feature of the great military event at hand which the marches had found largely set forth in the programme of the parade did not fully keep the glowing promises made for it in fact it could not easily have done so it was in a pleasant neighborhood of new villas such as form the modern quarter of every german city and the volksfest was even more unfinished than its environment it was not yet enclosed by the fence which was to hide its wonders from the nonpaying public but march and kenby went in through an archway where the gatemoney was as effectually collected from them as if they were barred every other entrance  the wooden building was easily distinguishable from the other edifices because these were tents and booths still less substantial they did not make out its function but of the others four sheltered merrygorounds four were beergardens four were restaurants and the rest were devoted to amusements of the usual countryfair type apparently they had little attraction for country people the americans met few peasants in the grounds and neither at the edison kinematograph where they refreshed their patriotism with some scenes of their native life nor at the little theatre where they saw the sports of the arena revived in the wrestle of a woman with a bear did any of the people except tradesmen and artisans seem to be taking part in the festival expression of the popular pleasure  the woman who finally threw the bear whether by slight or by main strength or by a previous understanding with him was a slender creature pathetically small and not altogether plain and march as they walked away lapsed into a pensive muse upon her strange employ he wondered how she came to take it up and whether she began with the bear when they were both very young and she could easily throw him  well women have a great deal more strength than we suppose kenby began with a philosophical air that gave march the hope of some rational conversation then his eye glazed with a faroff look and a doting smile came into his face when we went through the dresden gallery together rose and i were perfectly used up at the end of an hour but his mother kept on as long as there was anything to see and came away as fresh as a peach  then march saw that it was useless to expect anything different from him and he let him talk on about mrs adding all the rest of the way back to the hotel kenby seemed only to have begun when they reached the door and wanted to continue the subject in the readingroom  march pleaded his wish to find how his wife had got through the afternoon and he escaped to her he would have told her now that kenby was in the house but he was really so sick of the fact himself that he could not speak of it at once and he let her go on celebrating all she had seen from the window since she had waked from her long nap she said she could never be glad enough that they had come just at that time soldiers had been going by the whole afternoon and that made it so feudal  yes he assented but arent you coming up to the station with me to see the princeregent arrive hes due at seven you know  i declare i had forgotten all about it no im not equal to it you must go you can tell me everything be sure to notice how the princess maria looks the last of the stuarts you know and some people consider her the rightful queen of england and ill have the supper ordered and we can go down as soon as youve got back     lv  march felt rather shabby stealing away without kenby but he had really had as much of mrs adding as he could stand for one day and he was even beginning to get sick of rose besides he had not sent back a line for every other week yet and he had made up his mind to write a sketch of the manoeuvres to this end he wished to receive an impression of the princeregents arrival which should not be blurred or clouded by other interests his wife knew the kind of thing he liked to see and would have helped him out with his observations but kenby would have got in the way and would have clogged the movement of his fancy in assigning the facts to the parts he would like them to play in the sketch  at least he made some such excuses to himself as he hurried along toward the kaiserstrasse the draught of universal interest in that direction had left the other streets almost deserted but as he approached the thoroughfare he found all the ways blocked and the horsecars ordinarily so furiously headlong arrested by the multiple ranks of spectators on the sidewalks the avenue leading from the railway station to the palace was decorated with flags and garlands and planted with the stems of young firs and birches the doorways were crowded and the windows dense with eager faces peering out of the draped bunting the carriageway was kept clear by mild policemen who now and then allowed one of the crowd to cross it  the crowd was made up mostly of women and boys and when march joined them they had already been waiting an hour for the sight of the princes who were to bless them with a vision of the faery race which kings always are to common men he thought the people looked dull and therefore able to bear the strain of expectation with patience better than a livelier race they relieved it by no attempt at joking here and there a dim smile dawned on a weary face but it seemed an effect of amiability rather than humor there was so little of this or else it was so well bridled by the solemnity of the occasion that not a man woman or child laughed when a bareheaded maidservant broke through the lines and ran down between them with a lifesize plaster bust of the emperor william in her arms she carried it like an overgrown infant and in alarm at her conspicuous part she cast frightened looks from side to side without arousing any sort of notice undeterred by her failure a young dog parted from his owner and seeking him in the crowd pursued his search in a wild flight down the guarded roadway with an air of anxiety that in america would have won him thunders of applause and all sorts of kindly encouragements to greater speed but this german crowd witnessed his progress apparently without interest and without a sign of pleasure they were there to see the princeregent arrive and they did not suffer themselves to be distracted by any preliminary excitement suddenly the indefinable emotion which expresses the fulfilment of expectation in a waiting crowd passed through the multitude and before he realized it march was looking into the friendly graybearded face of the princeregent for the moment that his carriage allowed in passing this came first preceded by four outriders and followed by other simple equipages of bavarian blue full of highnesses of all grades beside the regent sat his daughterinlaw the princess maria her silvered hair framing a face as plain and good as the regents if not so intelligent  he in virtue of having been born in wurzburg is officially supposed to be specially beloved by his fellow townsmen and they now testified their affection as he whirled through their ranks bowing right and left by what passes in germany for a cheer it is the word hoch groaned forth from abdominal depths and dismally prolonged in a hollow roar like that which the mob makes behind the scenes at the theatre before bursting in visible tumult on the stage then the crowd dispersed and march came away wondering why such a kindlylooking princeregent should not have given them a little longer sight of himself after they had waited so patiently for hours to see him but doubtless in those countries he concluded the art of keeping the sovereign precious by suffering him to be rarely and briefly seen is wisely studied  on his way home he resolved to confess kenbys presence and he did so as soon as he sat down to supper with his wife i ought to have told you the first thing after breakfast but when i found you in that mood of having the place all to ourselves i put it off  you took terrible chances my dear she said gravely  and i have been terribly punished youve no idea how much kenby has talked to me about mrs adding  she broke out laughing well perhaps youve suffered enough but you can see now cant you that it would have been awful if i had met him and let out that i didnt know he was here  terrible but if i had told it would have spoiled the whole morning for you you couldnt have thought of anything else  oh i dont know she said airily what should you think if i told you i had known he was here ever since last night she went on in delight at the start he gave i saw him come into the hotel while you were gone for the guidebooks and i determined to keep it from you as long as i could i knew it would worry you weve both been very nice and i forgive you she hurried on because ive really got something to tell you  dont tell me that burnamy is here  dont jump to conclusions no burnamy isnt here poor fellow and dont suppose that im guilty of concealment because i havent told you before i was just thinking whether i wouldnt spare you till morning but now i shall let you take the brunt of it mrs adding and rose are here she gave the fact time to sink in and then she added and miss triscoe and her father are here  what is the matter with major eltwin and his wife being here too are they in our hotel  no they are not they came to look for rooms while you were off waiting for the princeregent and i saw them they intended to go to frankfort for the manoeuvres but they heard that there was not even standingroom there and so the general telegraphed to the spanischer hof and they all came here as it is he will have to room with rose and agatha and mrs adding will room together i didnt think agatha was looking very well she looked unhappy i dont believe shes heard from burnamy yet i hadnt a chance to ask her and theres something else that im afraid will fairly make you sick  oh no go on i dont think anything can do that after an afternoon of kenbys confidences  its worse than kenby she said with a sigh you know i told you at carlsbad i thought that ridiculous old thing was making up to mrs adding  kenby why of co  dont be stupid my dear no not kenby general triscoe i wish you could have been here to see him paying her all sort of silly attentions and hear him making her compliments  thank you i think im just as well without it did she pay him silly attentions and compliments too  thats the only thing that can make me forgive her for his wanting her she was keeping him at armslength the whole time and she was doing it so as not to make him contemptible before his daughter  it must have been hard and rose  rose didnt seem very well he looks thin and pale but hes sweeter than ever shes certainly commoner clay than rose no i wont say that its really nothing but general triscoes being an old goose about her that makes her seem so and it isnt fair  march went down to his coffee in the morning with the delicate duty of telling kenby that mrs adding was in town kenby seemed to think it quite natural she should wish to see the manoeuvres and not at all strange that she should come to them with general triscoe and his daughter he asked if march would not go with him to call upon her after breakfast and as this was in the line of his own instructions from mrs march he went  they found mrs adding with the triscoes and march saw nothing that was not merely friendly or at the most fatherly in the generals behavior toward her if mrs adding or miss triscoe saw more they hid it in a guise of sisterly affection for each other at the most the general showed a gayety which one would not have expected of him under any conditions and which the fact that he and rose had kept each other awake a good deal the night before seemed so little adapted to call out he joked with rose about their room and their beds and put on a comradery with him that was not a perfect fit and that suffered by contrast with the pleasure of the boy and kenby in meeting there was a certain question in the attitude of mrs adding till march helped kenby to account for his presence then she relaxed in an effect of security so tacit that words overstate it and began to make fun of rose  march could not find that miss triscoe looked unhappy as his wife had said he thought simply that she had grown plainer but when he reported this she lost her patience with him in a girl she said plainness was unhappiness and she wished to know when he would ever learn to look an inch below the surface she was sure that agatha triscoe had not heard from burnamy since the emperors birthday that she was at swordspoints with her father and so desperate that she did not care what became of her  he had left kenby with the others and now after his wife had talked herself tired of them all he proposed going out again to look about the city where there was nothing for the moment to remind them of the presence of their friends or even of their existence she answered that she was worrying about all those people and trying to work out their problem for them he asked why she did not let them work it out themselves as they would have to do after all her worry and she said that where her sympathy had been excited she could not stop worrying whether it did any good or not and she could not respect any one who could drop things so completely out of his mind as he could she had never been able to respect that in him  i know my dear he assented but i dont think its a question of moral responsibility its a question of mental structure isnt it your consciousness isnt built in thoughttight compartments and one emotion goes all through it and sinks you but i simply close the doors and shut the emotion in and keep on  the fancy pleased him so much that he worked it out in all its implications and could not after their long experience of each other realize that she was not enjoying the joke too till she said she saw that he merely wished to tease then too late he tried to share her worry but she protested that she was not worrying at all that she cared nothing about those people that she was nervous she was tired and she wished he would leave her and go out alone  he found himself in the street again and he perceived that he must be walking fast when a voice called him by name and asked him what his hurry was the voice was stollers who got into step with him and followed the first with a second question  made up your mind to go to the manoeuvres with me  his bluntness made it easy for march to answer im afraid my wife couldnt stand the drive back and forth  come without her  thank you its very kind of you im not certain that i shall go at all if i do i shall run out by train and take my chances with the crowd  stoller insisted no further he felt no offence at the refusal of his offer or chose to show none he said with the same uncouth abruptness as before heard anything of that fellow since he left carlsbad  burnamy  mm  no  know where he is  i dont in the least  stoller let another silence elapse while they hurried on before he said i got to thinking what he done afterwards he wasnt bound to look out for me he might suppose i knew what i was about  march turned his face and stared in stollers which he was letting hang forward as he stamped heavily on had the disaster proved less than he had feared and did he still want burnamys help in patching up the broken pieces or did he really wish to do burnamy justice to his friend  in any case marchs duty was clear i think burnamy was bound to look out for you mr stoller and i am glad to know that he saw it in the same light  i know he did said stoker with a blaze as from a longsmouldering fury and damn him im not going to have it im not going to plead the baby act with him or with any man you tell him so when you get the chance you tell him i dont hold him accountable for anything i made him do that aint business i dont want him around me any more but if he wants to go back to the paper he can have his place you tell him i stand by what i done and its all right between him and me i haint done anything about it the way i wanted him to help me to ive let it lay and im agoing to i guess it aint going to do me any harm after all our people haint got very long memories but if it is let it you tell him its all right  i dont know where he is mr stoller and i dont know that i care to be the bearer of your message said march  why not  why for one thing i dont agree with you that its all right your choosing to stand by the consequences of burnamys wrong doesnt undo it as i understand you dont pardon it  stoller gulped and did not answer at once then he said i stand by what i done im not going to let him say i turned him down for doing what i told him to because i hadnt the sense to know what i was about  ah i dont think its a thing hell like to speak of in any case said march  stoller left him at the corner they had reached as abruptly as he had joined him and march hurried back to his wife and told her what had just passed between him and stoller  she broke out well i am surprised at you my dear you have always accused me of suspecting people and attributing bad motives and here youve refused even to give the poor man the benefit of the doubt he merely wanted to save his savage pride with you and thats all he wants to do with burnamy how could it hurt the poor boy to know that stoller doesnt blame him why should you refuse to give his message to burnamy i dont want you to ridicule me for my conscience any more basil youre twice as bad as i ever was dont you think that a person can ever expiate an offence ive often heard you say that if any one owned his fault he put it from him and it was the same as if it hadnt been and hasnt burnamy owned up over and over again im astonished at you dearest  march was in fact somewhat astonished at himself in the light of her reasoning but she went on with some sophistries that restored him to his selfrighteousness  i suppose you think he has interfered with stollers political ambition and injured him in that way well what if he has would it be a good thing to have a man like that succeed in politics youre always saying that the low character of our politicians is the ruin of the country and im sure she added with a prodigious leap over all the sequences that mr stoller is acting nobly and its your duty to help him relieve burnamys mind at the laugh he broke into she hastened to say or if you wont i hope youll not object to my doing so for i shall anyway  she rose as if she were going to begin at once in spite of his laughing and in fact she had already a plan for coming to stollers assistance by getting at burnamy through miss triscoe whom she suspected of knowing where he was there had been no chance for them to speak of him either that morning or the evening before and after a great deal of controversy with herself in her husbands presence she decided to wait till they came naturally together the next morning for the walk to the capuchin church on the hill beyond the river which they had agreed to take she could not keep from writing a note to miss triscoe begging her to be sure to come and hinting that she had something very important to speak of  she was not sure but she had been rather silly to do this but when they met the girl confessed that she had thought of giving up the walk and might not have come except for mrs marchs note she had come with rose and had left him below with march mrs adding was coming later with kenby and general triscoe  mrs march lost no time in telling her the great news and if she had been in doubt before of the girls feeling for burnamy she was now in none she had the pleasure of seeing her flush with hope and then the pain which was also a pleasure of seeing her blanch with dismay  i dont know where he is mrs march i havent heard a word from him since that night in carlsbad i expectedi didnt know but you  mrs march shook her head she treated the fact skillfully as something to be regretted simply because it would be such a relief to burnamy to know how mr stoller now felt of course they could reach him somehow you could always get letters to people in europe in the end and in fact it was altogether probable that he was that very instant in wurzburg for if the new yorkparis chronicle had wanted him to write up the wagner operas it would certainly want him to write up the manoeuvres she established his presence in wurzburg by such an irrefragable chain of reasoning that at a knock outside she was just able to kelp back a scream while she ran to open the door it was not burnamy as in compliance with every nerve it ought to have been but her husband who tried to justify his presence by saying that they were all waiting for her and miss triscoe and asked when they were coming  she frowned him silent and then shut herself outside with him long enough to whisper say shes got a headache or anything you please but dont stop talking here with me or i shall go wild she then shut herself in again with the effect of holding him accountable for the whole affair     lvi  general triscoe could not keep his irritation at hearing that his daughter was not coming out of the excuses he made to mrs adding he said again and again that it must seem like a discourtesy to her she gayly disclaimed any such notion she would not hear of putting off their excursion to another day it had been raining just long enough to give them a reasonable hope of a few hours drought and they might not have another dry spell for weeks she slipped off her jacket after they started and gave it to kenby but she let general triscoe hold her umbrella over her while he limped beside her she seemed to march as he followed with rose to be playing the two men off against each other with an ease which he wished his wife could be there to see and to judge aright  they crossed by the old bridge which is of the earliest years of the seventh century between rows of saints whose statues surmount the piers some are bishops as well as saints one must have been at rome in his day for he wore his long thick beard in the fashion of michelangelos moses he stretched out toward the passers two fingers of blessing and was unaware of the sparrow which had lighted on them and was giving him the effect of offering it to the public admiration squads of soldiers tramping by turned to look and smile and the dull faces of citizens lighted up at the quaint sight some children stopped and remained very quiet not to scare away the bird and a coldfaced spirituallooking priest paused among them as if doubting whether to rescue the absentminded bishop from a situation derogatory to his dignity but he passed on and then the sparrow suddenly flew off  rose adding had lingered for the incident with march but they now pushed on and came up with the others at the end of the bridge where they found them in question whether they had not better take a carriage and drive to the foot of the hill before they began their climb march thanked them but said he was keeping up the terms of his cure and was getting in all the walking he could rose begged his mother not to include him in the driving party he protested that he was feeling so well and the walk was doing him good his mother consented if he would promise not to get tired and then she mounted into the twospanner which had driven instinctively up to their party when their parley began and general triscoe took the place beside her while kenby with smiling patience seated himself in front  rose kept on talking with march about wurzburg and its history which it seemed he had been reading the night before when he could not sleep he explained we get little histories of the places wherever we go thats what mr kenby does you know  oh yes said march  i dont suppose i shall get a chance to read much here rose continued with general triscoe in the room he doesnt like the light  well well hes rather old you know and you musnt read too much rose it isnt good for you  i know but if i dont read i think and that keeps me awake worse of course i respect general triscoe for being in the war and getting wounded the boy suggested  a good many did it march was tempted to say  the boy did not notice his insinuation i suppose there were some things they did in the army and then they couldnt get over the habit but general grant says in his life that he never used a profane expletive  does general triscoe  rose answered reluctantly if anything wakes him in the night or if he cant make these german beds over to suit him  i see march turned his face to hide the smile which he would not have let the boy detect he thought best not to let rose resume his impressions of the general and in talk of weightier matters they found themselves at that point of the climb where the carriage was waiting for them from this point they followed an alley through ivied garden walls till they reached the first of the balustraded terraces which ascend to the crest of the hill where the church stands each terrace is planted with sycamores and the face of the terrace wall supports a bassrelief commemorating with the drama of its lifesize figures the stations of the cross  monks and priests were coming and going and dropped on the steps leading from terrace to terrace were women and children on their knees in prayer it was all richly reminiscent of pilgrim scenes in other catholic lands but here there was a touch of earnest in the northern face of the worshipers which the south had never imparted even in the beautiful rococo interior of the church at the top of the hill there was a sense of something deeper and truer than mere ecclesiasticism and march came out of it in a serious muse while the boy at his side did nothing to interrupt a vague regret filled his heart as he gazed silently out over the prospect of river and city and vineyard purpling together below the top where he stood and mixed with this regret was a vague resentment of his wifes absence she ought to have been there to share his pang and his pleasure they had so long enjoyed everything together that without her he felt unable to get out of either emotion all there was in it  the forgotten boy stole silently down the terraces after the rest of the party who had left him behind with march at the last terrace they stopped and waited and after a delay that began to be long to mrs adding she wondered aloud what could have become of them  kenby promptly offered to go back and see and she consented in seeming to refuse it isnt worth while rose has probably got mr march into some deep discussion and theyve forgotten all about us but if you will go mr kenby you might just remind rose of my existence she let him lay her jacket on her shoulders before he left her and then she sat down on one of the steps which general triscoe kept striking with the point of her umbrella as he stood before her  i really shall have to take it from you if you do that any more she said laughing up in his face im serious  he stopped i wish i could believe you were serious for a moment  you may if you think it will do you any good but i dont see why  the general smiled but with a kind of tremulous eagerness which might have been pathetic to any one who liked him do you know this is almost the first time i have spoken alone with you  really i hadnt noticed said mrs adding  general triscoe laughed in rather a ghastly way well thats encouraging at least to a man whos had his doubts whether it wasnt intended  intended by whom what do you mean general triscoe why in the world shouldnt you have spoken alone with me before  he was not with all his eagerness ready to say and while she smiled pleasantly she had the look in her eyes of being brought to bay and being prepared if it must come to that to have the worst over then and there she was not half his age but he was aware of her having no respect for his years compared with her average american past as he understood it his social place was much higher but she was not in the least awed by it in spite of his war record she was making him behave like a coward he was in a false position and if he had any one but himself to blame he had not her he read her equal knowledge of these facts in the clear eyes that made him flush and turn his own away  then he started with a quick hello and stood staring up at the steps from the terrace above where rose adding was staying himself weakly by a clutch of kenby on one side and march on the other  his mother looked round and caught herself up from where she sat and ran toward him oh rose  its nothing mother he called to her and as she dropped on her knees before him he sank limply against her it was like what i had in carlsbad thats all dont worry about me please  im not worrying rose she said with courage of the same texture as his own youve been walking too much you must go back in the carriage with us cant you have it come here she asked kenby  theres no road mrs adding but if rose would let me carry him  i can walk the boy protested trying to lift himself from her neck  no no you mustnt she drew away and let him fall into the arms that kenby put round him he raised the frail burden lightly to his shoulder and moved strongly away followed by the eyes of the spectators who had gathered about the little group but who dispersed now and went back to their devotions  march hurried after kenby with mrs adding whom he told he had just missed rose and was looking about for him when kenby came with her message for them they made sure that he was nowhere about the church and then started together down the terraces at the second or third station below they found the boy clinging to the barrier that protected the bassrelief from the zeal of the devotees he looked white and sick though he insisted that he was well and when he turned to come away with them he reeled and would have fallen if kenby had not caught him kenby wanted to carry him but rose would not let him and had made his way down between them  yea he has such a spirit she said and ive no doubt hes suffering now more from mr kenbys kindness than from his own sickness he had one of these giddy turns in carlsbad though and i shall certainly have a doctor to see him  i think i should mrs adding said march not too gravely for it seemed to him that it was not quite his business to alarm her further if she was herself taking the affair with that seriousness he questioned whether she was taking it quite seriously enough when she turned with a laugh and called to general triscoe who was limping down the steps of the last terrace behind them  oh poor general triscoe i thought you had gone on ahead  general triscoe could not enter into the joke of being forgotten apparently he assisted with gravity at the disposition of the party for the return when they all reached the carriage rose had the place beside his mother and kenby wished march to take his with the general and let him sit with the driver but he insisted that he would rather walk home and he did walk till they had driven out of eight then he called a passing onespanner and drove to his hotel in comfort and silence     lvii  kenby did not come to the swan before supper then he reported that the doctor had said rose was on the verge of a nervous collapse he had overworked at school but the immediate trouble was the high thin air which the doctor said he must be got out of at once into a quiet place at the seashore somewhere he had suggested ostend or some point on the french coast kenby had thought of schevleningen and the doctor had said that would do admirably  i understood from mrs adding he concluded that you were going there for your aftercure mr march and i didnt know but you might be going soon  at the mention of schevleningen the marches had looked at each other with a guilty alarm which they both tried to give the cast of affectionate sympathy but she dismissed her fear that he might be going to let his compassion prevail with him to his hurt when he said why we ought to have been there before this but ive been taking my life in my hands in trying to see a little of germany and im afraid now that mrs march has her mind too firmly fixed on berlin to let me think of going to schevleningen till weve been there  its too bad said mrs march with real regret i wish we were going but she had not the least notion of gratifying her wish and they were all silent till kenby broke out  look here you know how i feel about mrs adding ive been pretty frank with mr march myself and ive had my suspicions that shes been frank with you mrs march there isnt any doubt about my wanting to marry her and up to this time there hasnt been any doubt about her not wanting to marry me but it isnt a question of her or of me now its a question of rose i love the boy and kenbys voice shook and he faltered a moment pshaw you understand  indeed i do mr kenby said mrs march i perfectly understand you  well i dont think mrs adding is fit to make the journey with him alone or to place herself in the best way after she gets to schevleningen shes been badly shaken up she broke down before the doctor she said she didnt know what to do i suppose shes frightened  kenby stopped again and march asked when is she going  tomorrow said kenby and he added and now the question is why shouldnt i go with her  mrs march gave a little start and looked at her husband but he said nothing and kenby seemed not to have supposed that he would say anything  i know it would be very american and all that but i happen to be an american and it wouldnt be out of character for me i suppose he appealed to mrs march that its something i might offer to do if it were from new york to floridaand i happened to be going there and i did happen to be going to holland  why of course mr kenby she responded with such solemnity that march gave way in an outrageous laugh  kenby laughed and mrs march laughed too but with an inner note of protest  well kenby continued still addressing her what i want you to do is to stand by me when i propose it  mrs march gathered strength to say no mr kenby its your own affair and you must take the responsibility  do you disapprove  it isnt the same as it would be at home you see that yourself  well said kenby rising i have to arrange about their getting away tomorrow it wont be easy in this hurlyburly thats coming off  give rose our love and tell mrs adding that ill come round and see her tomorrow before she starts  oh im afraid you cant mrs march theyre to start at six in the morning  they are then we must go and see them tonight well be there almost as soon as you are  march went up to their rooms with his wife and she began on the stairs  well my dear i hope you realize that your laughing so gave us completely away and what was there to keep grinning about all through  nothing but the disingenuous hypocritical passion of love its always the most amusing thing in the world but to see it trying to pass itself off in poor old kenby as duty and humanity and disinterested affection for rose was more than i could stand i dont apologize for laughing i wanted to yell  his effrontery and his philosophy both helped to save him and she said from the point where he had sidetracked her mind i dont call it disingenuous he was brutally frank hes made it impossible to treat the affair with dignity i want you to leave the whole thing to me from this out now will you  on their way to the spanischer hof she arranged in her own mind for mrs adding to get a maid and for the doctor to send an assistant with her on the journey but she was in such despair with her scheme that she had not the courage to right herself when mrs adding met her with the appeal  oh mrs march im so glad you approve of mr kenbys plan it does seem the only thing to do i cant trust myself alone with rose and mr kenbys intending to go to schevleningen a few days later anyway though its too bad to let him give up the manoeuvres  im sure he wont mind that mrs marchs voice said mechanically while her thought was busy with the question whether this scandalous duplicity was altogether kenbys and whether mrs adding was as guiltless of any share in it as she looked she looked pitifully distracted she might not have understood his report or kenby might really have mistaken mrs marchs sympathy for favor  no he only lives to do good mrs adding returned hes with rose wont you come in and see them  rose was lying back on the pillows of a sofa from which they would not let him get up he was full of the trip to holland and had already pushed kenby as kenby owned beyond the bounds of his very general knowledge of the dutch language which rose had plans for taking up after they were settled in schevleningen the boy scoffed at the notion that he was not perfectly well and he wished to talk with march on the points where he had found kenby wanting  kenby is an encyclopaedia compared with me rose the editor protested and he amplified his ignorance for the boys good to an extent which rose saw was a joke he left holland to talk about other things which his mother thought quite as bad for him he wished to know if march did not think that the statue of the bishop with the sparrow on its finger was a subject for a poem and march said gayly that if rose would write it he would print it in every other week  the boy flushed with pleasure at his banter no i couldnt do it but i wish mr burnamy had seen it he could will you tell him about it he wanted to know if march had heard from burnamy lately and in the midst of his vivid interest he gave a weary sigh  his mother said that now he had talked enough and bade him say goodby to the marches who were coming so soon to holland anyway mrs march put her arms round him to kiss him and when she let him sink back her eyes were dim  you see how frail he is said mrs adding i shall not let him out of my sight after this till hes well again  she had a kind of authority in sending kenby away with them which was not lost upon the witnesses he asked them to come into the readingroom a moment with him and mrs march wondered if he were going to make some excuse to her for himself but he said i dont know how were to manage about the triscoes the general will have a room to himself but if mrs adding takes rose in with her it leaves miss triscoe out and there isnt a room to be had in this house for love or money do you think he appealed directly to mrs march that it would do to offer her my room at the swan  why yes she assented with a reluctance rather for the complicity in which he had already involved her and for which he was still unpunished than for what he was now proposing or she could come in with me and mr march could take it  whichever you think said kenby so submissively that she relented to ask  and what will you do  he laughed well people have been known to sleep in a chair i shall manage somehow  you might offer to go in with the general march suggested and the men apparently thought this was a joke mrs march did not laugh in her feminine worry about ways and means  where is miss triscoe she asked we havent seen them  didnt mrs adding tell you they went to supper at a restaurant the general doesnt like the cooking here they ought to have been back before this  he looked up at the clock on the wall and she said i suppose you would like us to wait  it would be very kind of you  oh its quite essential she returned with an airy freshness which kenby did not seem to feel as painfully as he ought  they all sat down and the triscoes came in after a few minutes and a cloud on the generals face lifted at the proposition kenby left mrs march to make  i thought that child ought to be in his mothers charge he said with his own comfort provided for he made no objections to mrs marchs plan and agatha went to take leave of rose and his mother bytheway the general turned to march i found stoller at the restaurant where we supped he offered me a place in his carriage for the manoeuvres how are you going  i think i shall go by train i dont fancy the long drive  well i dont know that its worse than the long walk after you leave the train said the general from the offence which any difference of taste was apt to give him are you going by train too he asked kenby with indifference  im not going at all said kenby im leaving wurzburg in the morning  oh indeed said the general  mrs march could not make out whether he knew that kenby was going with rose and mrs adding but she felt that there must be a full and open recognition of the fact among them yes she said isnt it fortunate that mr kenby should be going to holland too i should have been so unhappy about them if mrs adding had been obliged to make that long journey with poor little rose alone  yes yes very fortunate certainly said the general colorlessly  her husband gave her a glance of intelligent appreciation but kenby was too simply too densely content with the situation to know the value of what she had done she thought he must certainly explain as he walked back with her to the swan whether he had misrepresented her to mrs adding or mrs adding had misunderstood him somewhere there had been an error or a duplicity which it was now useless to punish and kenby was so apparently unconscious of it that she had not the heart to be cross with him she heard miss triscoe behind her with march laughing in the gayety which the escape from her father seemed to inspire in her she was promising march to go with him in the morning to see the emperor and empress of germany arrive at the station and he was warning her that if she laughed there like that she would subject him to fine and imprisonment she pretended that she would like to see him led off between two gendarmes but consented to be a little careful when he asked her how she expected to get back to her hotel without him if such a thing happened     lviii  after all miss triscoe did not go with march she preferred to sleep the imperial party was to arrive at half past seven but at six the crowd was already dense before the station and all along the street leading to the residenz it was a brilliant day with the promise of sunshine through which a chilly wind blew for the manoeuvres the colors of all the german states flapped in this breeze from the poles wreathed with evergreen which encircled the square the workmen putting the last touches on the bronzed allegory hurried madly to be done and they had scarcely finished their labors when two troops of dragoons rode into the place and formed before the station and waited as motionlessly as their horses would allow  these animals were not so conscious as lions at the approach of princes they tossed and stamped impatiently in the long interval before the regent and his daughterinlaw came to welcome their guests all the human beings both those who were in charge and those who were under charge were in a quiver of anxiety to play their parts well as if there were some heavy penalty for failure in the least point the policemen keeping the people in line behind the ropes which restrained them trembled with eagerness the faces of some of the troopers twitched an involuntary sigh went up from the crowd as the regents carriage appeared heralded by outriders and followed by other plain carriages of bavarian blue with liveries of blue and silver then the whistle of the kaisers train sounded a trumpeter advanced and began to blow his trumpet as they do in the theatre and exactly at the appointed moment the emperor and empress came out of the station through the brilliant human alley leading from it mounted their carriages with the stage trumpeter always blowing and whirled swiftly round half the square and flashed into the corner toward the residenz out of sight the same hollow groans of hoooch greeted and followed them from the spectators as had welcomed the regent when he first arrived among his fellowtownsmen with the same effect of being the conventional cries of a stage mob behind the scenes  the emperor was like most of his innumerable pictures with a swarthy face from which his blue eyes glanced pleasantly he looked goodhumored if not goodnatured the empress smiled amiably beneath her deeply fringed white parasol and they both bowed right and left in acknowledgment of those hollow groans but again it seemed to march that sovereignty gave the popular curiosity not to call it devotion a scantier return than it merited he had perhaps been insensibly working toward some such perception as now came to him that the great difference between europe and america was that in europe life is histrionic and dramatized and that in america except when it is trying to be european it is direct and sincere he wondered whether the innate conviction of equality the deep underlying sense of a common humanity transcending all social and civic pretences was what gave their theatrical effect to the shows of deference from low to high and of condescension from high to low if in such encounters of sovereigns and subjects the prince did not play his part so well as the people it might be that he had a harder part to play and that to support his dignity at all to keep from being found out the sham that he essentially was he had to hurry across the stage amidst the distracting thunders of the orchestra if the star staid to be scrutinized by the soldiers citizens and so forth even the poor supernumeraries and sceneshifters might see that he was a tallow candle like themselves  in the censorious mood induced by the reflection that he had waited an hour and a half for half a minutes glimpse of the imperial party march now decided not to go to the manoeuvres where he might be subjected to still greater humiliation and disappointment he had certainly come to wurzburg for the manoeuvres but wurzburg had been richly repaying in itself and why should he stifle half an hour in an overcrowded train and struggle for three miles on foot against that harsh wind to see a multitude of men give proofs of their fitness to do manifold murder he was in fact not the least curious for the sight and the only thing that really troubled him was the question of how he should justify his recreance to his wife this did alloy the pleasure with which he began after an excellent breakfast at a neighboring cafe to stroll about the streets though he had them almost to himself so many citizens had followed the soldiers to the manoeuvres  it was not till the soldiers began returning from the manoeuvres dustyfooted and in white canvas overalls drawn over their trousers to save them that he went back to mrs march and miss triscoe at the swan he had given them time enough to imagine him at the review and to wonder whether he had seen general triscoe and the stollers there and they met him with such confident inquiries that he would not undeceive them at once he let them divine from his inventive answers that he had not gone to the manoeuvres which put them in the best humor with themselves and the girl said it was so cold and rough that she wished her father had not gone either the general appeared just before dinner and frankly avowed the same wish he was rasping and wheezing from the dust which filled his lungs he looked blown and red and he was too angry with the company he had been in to have any comments on the manoeuvres he referred to the military chiefly in relation to the miss stollers ineffectual flirtations which he declared had been outrageous their father had apparently no control over them whatever or else was too ignorant to know that they were misbehaving they were without respect or reverence for any one they had talked to general triscoe as if he were a boy of their own age or a dotard whom nobody need mind they had not only kept up their foolish babble before him they had laughed and giggled they had broken into snatches of american song they had all but whistled and danced they made loud comments in illinois englishon the cuteness of the officers whom they admired and they had at one time actually got out their handkerchiefs he supposed they meant to wave them at the officers but at the look he gave them they merely put their hats together and snickered in derision of him they were american girls of the worst type they conformed to no standard of behavior their conduct was personal they ought to be taken home  mrs march said she saw what he meant and she agreed with him that they were altogether unformed and were the effect of their own ignorant caprices probably however it was too late to amend them by taking them away  it would hide them at any rate he answered they would sink back into the great mass of our vulgarity and not be noticed we behave like a parcel of peasants with our women we think that if no harm is meant or thought we may risk any sort of appearance and we do things that are scandalously improper simply because they are innocent that may be all very well at home but people who prefer that sort of thing had better stay there where our peasant manners wont make them conspicuous  as their train ran northward out of wurzburg that afternoon mrs march recurred to the generals closing words that was a slap at mrs adding for letting kenby go off with her  she took up the history of the past twentyfour hours from the time march had left her with miss triscoe when he went with her father and the addings and kenby to see that church she had had no chance to bring up these arrears until now and she atoned to herself for the delay by making the history very full and going back and adding touches at any point where she thought she had scanted it after all it consisted mainly of fragmentary intimations from miss triscoe and of halfuttered questions which her own art now built into a coherent statement  march could not find that the general had much resented burnamys clandestine visit to carlsbad when his daughter told him of it or that he had done more than make her promise that she would not keep up the acquaintance upon any terms unknown to him  probably mrs march said as long as he had any hopes of mrs adding he was a little too selfconscious to be very up and down about burnamy  then you think he was really serious about her  now my dear he was so serious that i suppose he was never so completely taken aback in his life as when he met kenby in wurzburg and saw how she received him of course that put an end to the fight  the fight  yesthat mrs adding and agatha were keeping up to prevent his offering himself  oh and how do you know that they were keeping up the fight together  how do i didnt you see yourself what friends they were did you tell him what stoller had said about burnamy  i had no chance i dont know that i should have done it anyway it wasnt my affair  well then i think you might it would have been everything for that poor child it would have completely justified her in her own eyes  perhaps your telling her will serve the same purpose  yes i did tell her and i am glad of it she had a right to know it  did she think stollers willingness to overlook burnamys performance had anything to do with its moral quality  mrs march was daunted for the moment but she said i told her you thought that if a person owned to a fault they disowned it and put it away from them just as if it had never been committed and that if a person had taken their punishment for a wrong they had done they had expiated it so far as anybody else was concerned and hasnt poor burnamy done both  as a moralist march was flattered to be hoist with his own petard but as a husband he was not going to come down at once i thought probably you had told her that you had it pat from having just been over it with me when has she heard from him  why thats the strangest thing about it she hasnt heard at all she doesnt know where he is she thought we must know she was terribly broken up  how did she show it  she didnt show it either you want to tease or youve forgotten how such things are with young peopleor at least girls  yes its all a long time ago with me and i never was a girl besides the frank and direct behavior of kenby and mrs adding has been very obliterating to my early impressions of lovemaking  it certainly hasnt been ideal said mrs march with a sigh  why hasnt it been ideal he asked kenby is tremendously in love with her and i believe shes had a fancy for him from the beginning if it hadnt been for rose she would have accepted him at once and now hes essential to them both in their helplessness as for papa triscoe and his europeanized scruples if they have any reality at all theyre the residuum of his personal resentment and kenby and mrs adding have nothing to do with their unreality his being in love with her is no reason why he shouldnt be helpful to her when she needs him and every reason why he should i call it a poem such as very few people have the luck to live out together  mrs march listened with mounting fervor and when he stopped she cried out well my dear i do believe you are right it is ideal as you say its a perfect poem and i shall always say  she stopped at the mocking light which she caught in his look and perceived that he had been amusing himself with her perennial enthusiasm for all sorts of loveaffairs but she averred that she did not care what he had said was true and she should always hold him to it  they were again in the weddingjourney sentiment in which they had left carlsbad when they found themselves alone together after their escape from the pressure of others interests the tide of travel was towards frankfort where the grand parade was to take place some days later they were going to weimar which was so few hours out of their way that they simply must not miss it and all the way to the old literary capital they were alone in their compartment with not even a stranger much less a friend to molest them the flying landscape without was of their own early autumnal mood and when the vineyards of wurzburg ceased to purple it the heavy aftermath of hay and clover which men women and children were loading on heavy wains and driving from the meadows everywhere offered a pastoral and pleasing change it was always the german landscape sometimes flat and fertile sometimes hilly and poor often clothed with dense woods but always charming with castled tops in ruin or repair and with levels where gothic villages drowsed within their walls and dreamed of the mediaeval past silent without apparent life except for some little goosegirl driving her flock before her as she sallied out into the nineteenth century in search of fresh pasturage  as their train mounted among the thuringian uplands they were aware of a finer cooler air through their open window the torrents foamed white out of the black forests of fir and pine and brawled along the valleys where the hamlets roused themselves in momentary curiosity as the train roared into them from the many tunnels the afternoon sunshine had the glister of mountain sunshine everywhere and the travellers had a pleasant bewilderment in which their memories of switzerland and the white mountains mixed with longdormant emotions from adirondack sojourns they chose this place and that in the lovely region where they lamented that they had not come at once for the aftercure and they appointed enough returns to it in future years to consume all the summers they had left to live     lix  it was falling night when they reached weimar where they found at the station a provision of omnibuses far beyond the hotel accommodations they drove first to the crownprince which was in a promising state of reparation but which for the present could only welcome them to an apartment where a canvas curtain cut them off from a freshly plastered wall the landlord deplored the fact and sent hospitably out to try and place them at the elephant but the elephant was full and the russian court was full too then the landlord of the crownprince bethought himself of a new hotel of the second class indeed but very nice where they might get rooms and after the delay of an hour they got a carriage and drove away from the crownprince where the landlord continued to the last as benevolent as if they had been a profit instead of a loss to him  the streets of the town at nine oclock were empty and quiet and they instantly felt the academic quality of the place through the pale night they could see that the architecture was of the classic sentiment which they were destined to feel more and more at one point they caught a fleeting glimpse of two figures with clasped hands and half embraced which they knew for the statues of goethe and schiller and when they mounted to their rooms at the grandduke of saxeweimar they passed under a fresco representing goethe and four other worldfamous poets shakspere milton tasso and schiller the poets all looked like germans as was just and goethe was naturally chief among them he marshalled the immortals on their way and schiller brought up the rear and kept them from going astray in an elysium where they did not speak the language for the rest the hotel was brandnew of a quite american freshness and was pervaded by a sweet smell as of straw matting and provided with steamradiators in the sense of its homelikeness the marches boasted that they were never going away from it  in the morning they discovered that their windows looked out on the grandducal museum with a gardened space before and below its classicistic bulk where in a whim of the weather the gay flowers were full of sun in a pleasant illusion of taking it unawares march strolled up through the town but weimar was as much awake at that hour as at any of the twentyfour and the tranquillity of its streets where he encountered a few passers several blocks apart was their habitual mood he came promptly upon two objects which he would willingly have shunned a denkmal of the francogerman war not so furiously bad as most german monuments but antipathetic and uninteresting as all patriotic monuments are and a womananddog team in the shock from this he was sensible that he had not seen any womananddog teams for some time and he wondered by what civic or ethnic influences their distribution was so controlled that they should have abounded in hamburg leipsic and carlsbad and wholly ceased in nuremberg ansbach and wurzburg to reappear again in weimar though they seemed as characteristic of all germany as the ugly denkmals to her victories over france  the goethe and schiller monument which he had glimpsed the night before was characteristic too but less offensively so german statues at the best are conscious and the poetpair as the inscription calls them have the air of showily confronting posterity with their clasped hands and of being only partially rapt from the spectators but they were more unconscious than any other german statues that march had seen and he quelled a desire to ask goethe as he stood with his hand on schillers shoulder and looked serenely into space far above one of the typical equipages of his country what he thought of that sort of thing but upon reflection he did not know why goethe should be held personally responsible for the existence of the womananddog team he felt that he might more reasonably attribute to his taste the prevalence of classic profiles which he began to note in the weimar populace this could be a sympathetic effect of that passion for the antique which the poet brought back with him from his sojourn in italy though many of the people especially the children were bowlegged perhaps the antique had begun in their faces and had not yet got down to their legs in any case they were charming children and as a test of their culture he had a mind to ask a little girl if she could tell him where the statue of herder was which he thought he might as well take in on his ramble and so be done with as many statues as he could she answered with a pretty regret in her tender voice that i truly cannot and he was more satisfied than if she could for he thought it better to be a child and honest than to know where any german statue was  he easily found it for himself in the place which is called the herder platz after it he went into the peter and paul church there where herder used to preach sermons sometimes not at all liked by the nobility and gentry for their revolutionary tendency the sovereign was shielded from the worst effects of his doctrine by worshipping apart from other sinners in a glazed gallery herder is buried in the church and when you ask where the sacristan lifts a wooden trapdoor in the pavement and you think you are going down into the crypt but you are only to see herders monumental stone which is kept covered so to save it from passing feet here also is the greatest picture of that great soul luke kranach who had sincerity enough in his paining to atone for all the swelling german sculptures in the world it is a crucifixion and the cross is of a white birch log such as might have been cut out of the weimar woods shaved smooth on the sides with the bark showing at the edges kranach has put himself among the spectators and a stream of blood from the side of the savior falls in baptism upon the painters head he is in the company of john the baptist and martin luther luther stands with his bible open and his finger on the line the blood of jesus cleanseth us  partly because he felt guilty at doing all these things without his wife and partly because he was now very hungry march turned from them and got back to his hotel where she was looking out for him from their open window she had the air of being long domesticated there as she laughed down at seeing him come and the continued brilliancy of the weather added to the illusion of home  it was like a day of late spring in italy or america the sun in that gardened hollow before the museum was already hot enough to make him glad of the shelter of the hotel the summer seemed to have come back to oblige them and when they learned that they were to see weimar in a festive mood because this was sedan day their curiosity if not their sympathy accepted the chance gratefully but they were almost moved to wish that the war had gone otherwise when they learned that all the public carriages were engaged and they must have one from a stable if they wished to drive after breakfast still it was offered them for such a modest number of marks and their driver proved so friendly and conversable that they assented to the course of history and were more and more reconciled as they bowled along through the grandducal park beside the waters of the classic ilm  the waters of the classic ilm are sluggish and slimy in places and in places clear and brooklike but always a dull dark green in color they flow in the shadow of pensive trees and by the brinks of sunny meadows where the aftermath wanders in heavy windrows and the children sport joyously over the smoothmown surfaces in all the freedom that there is in germany at last after immemorial appropriation the owners of the earth are everywhere expropriated and the people come into the pleasure if not the profit of it at last the prince the knight the noble finds as in his turn the plutocrat will find that his property is not for him but for all and that the nation is to enjoy what he takes from it and vainly thinks to keep from it parks pleasaunces gardens set apart for kings are the playgrounds of the landless poor in the old world and perhaps yield the sweetest joy of privilege to some statesick ruler some worldweary princess some lonely child born to the solitude of sovereignty as they each look down from their palace windows upon the leisure of overwork taking its little holiday amidst beauty vainly created for the perpetual festival of their empty lives  march smiled to think that in this very weimar where sovereignty had graced and ennobled itself as nowhere else in the world by the companionship of letters and the arts they still were not hurrying first to see the palace of a prince but were involuntarily making it second to the cottage of a poet but in fact it is goethe who is forever the prince in weimar his greatness blots out its history his name fills the city the thought of him is its chiefest imitation and largest hospitality the travellers remembered above all other facts of the grandducal park that it was there he first met christiane vulpius beautiful and young when he too was beautiful and young and took her home to be his love to the just and lasting displeasure of fran von stein who was even less reconciled when after eighteen years of due reflection the love of goethe and christiane became their marriage they wondered just where it was he saw the young girl coming to meet him as the granddukes minister with an officeseeking petition from her brother goethes brother author long famed and long forgotten for his romantic tale of rinaldo rinaldini  they had indeed no great mind in their american respectability for that rather matteroffact and deliberate liaison and little as their sympathy was for the passionless intellectual intrigue with the frau von stein it cast no halo of sentiment about the goethe cottage to suppose that there his lovelife with christiane began mrs march even resented the fact and when she learned later that it was not the fact at all she removed it from her associations with the pretty place almost indignantly  in spite of our facile and multiple divorces we americans are worshipers of marriage and if a great poet the minister of a prince is going to marry a poor girl we think he had better not wait till their son is almost of age mrs march would not accept as extenuating circumstances the granddukes godfatherhood or goethes open constancy to christiane or the tardy consecration of their union after the french sack of weimar when the girls devotion had saved him from the rudeness of the marauding soldiers for her new england soul there were no degrees in such guilt and perhaps there are really not so many as people have tried to think in their deference to goethes greatness but certainly the affair was not so simple for a grandducal minister of worldwide renown and he might well have felt its difficulties for he could not have been proof against the censorious public opinion of weimar or the yet more censorious private opinion of fran von stein  on that lovely italoamerican morning no ghost of these old dead embarrassments lingered within or without the goethe gardenhouse the trees which the poet himself planted flung a sunshot shadow upon it and about its feet basked a garden of simple flowers from which the sweet lame girl who limped through the rooms and showed them gathered a parting nosegay for her visitors the few small livingrooms were above the groundfloor with kitchen and offices below in the italian fashion in one of the little chambers was the campbed which goethe carried with him on his journeys through italy and in the larger room at the front stood the desk where he wrote with the chair before it from which he might just have risen  all was much more livingly conscious of the great man gone than the proud little palace in the town which so abounds with relics and memorials of him his library his study his study table with everything on it just as he left it when          cadde la stanca mana  are there and there is the deathchair facing the window from which he gasped for more light at last the handsome wellarranged rooms are full of souvenirs of his travel and of that passion for italy which he did so much to impart to all german hearts and whose modern waning leaves its records here of an interest pathetically almost amusingly faded they intimate the classic temper to which his mind tended more and more and amidst the multitude of sculptures pictures prints drawings gems medals autographs there is the sense of the manymindedness the universal taste for which he found room in little weimar but not in his contemporaneous germany but it is all less keenly personal less intimate than the simple gardenhouse or else with the great troop of people going through it and the custodians lecturing in various voices and languages to the attendant groups the marches had it less to themselves and so imagined him less in it     lx  all palaces have a character of tiresome unlivableness which is common to them everywhere and very probably if one could meet their proprietors in them one would as little remember them apart afterwards as the palaces themselves it will not do to lift either houses or men far out of the average they become spectacles ceremonies they cease to have charm to have character which belong to the levels of life where alone there are ease and comfort and human nature may be itself with all the little delightful differences repressed in those who represent and typify  as they followed the custodian through the grandducal residenz at weimar march felt everywhere the strong wish of the prince who was goethes friend to ally himself with literature and to be human at least in the humanities he came honestly by his passion for poets his mother had known it in her time and weimar was the home of wieland and of herder before the young grandduke came back from his travels bringing goethe with him and afterwards attracting schiller the story of that great epoch is all there in the residenz told as articulately as a palace can  there are certain poets rooms frescoed with illustrations of goethe schiller and wieland there is the room where goethe and the grandduke used to play chess together there is the conservatory opening from it where they liked to sit and chat everywhere in the pictures and sculptures the engraving and intaglios are the witnesses of the tastes they shared the love they both had for italy and for beautiful italian things the prince was not so great a prince but that he could very nearly be a man the court was perhaps the most human court that ever was the grandduke and the grand poet were first boon companions and then monarch and minister working together for the good of the country they were always friends and yet as the american saw in the light of the new world which he carried with him how far from friends at best it was makebelieve the makebelieve of superiority and inferiority the makebelieve of master and man which could only be the more painful and ghastly for the endeavor of two generous spirits to reach and rescue each other through the asphyxiating unreality but they kept up the show of equality faithfully to the end goethe was born citizen of a free republic and his youth was nurtured in the traditions of liberty he was one of the greatest souls of any time and he must have known the impossibility of the thing they pretended but he died and made no sign and the poets friendship with the prince has passed smoothly into history as one of the things that might really be they worked and played together they dined and danced they picnicked and poetized each on his own side of the impassable gulf with an air of its not being there which probably did not deceive their contemporaries so much as posterity  a part of the palace was of course undergoing repair and in the gallery beyond the conservatory a company of workmen were sitting at a table where they had spread their luncheon they were somewhat subdued by the consciousness of their august environment but the sight of them was charming they gave a kindly interest to the place which it had wanted before and which the marches felt again in another palace where the custodian showed them the little tin dishes and saucepans which the german empress augusta and her sisters played with when they were children the sight of these was more affecting even than the withered wreaths which they had left on the deathbed of their mother and which are still mouldering there  this was in the belvedere the country house on the height overlooking weimar where the grandducal family spend the month of may and where the stranger finds himself amid overwhelming associations of goethe although the place is so full of relics and memorials of the owners it seemed in fact to be a storehouse for the weddingpresents of the whole connection which were on show in every room mrs march hardly knew whether they heightened the domestic effect or took from it but they enabled her to verify with the custodians help certain royal intermarriages which she had been in doubt about before  her zeal for these made such favor with him that he did not spare them a portrait of all those which march hoped to escape he passed them over scarcely able to stand to the gardener who was to show them the openair theatre where goethe used to take part in the plays  the naturtheater was of a classic ideal realized in the trained vines and clipped trees which formed the coulisses there was a grassy space for the chorus and the commoner audience and then a few semicircular gradines cut in the turf one alcove another where the more honored spectators sat behind the seats were plinths bearing the busts of goethe schiller wieland and herder it was all very pretty and if ever the weather in weimar was dry enough to permit a performance it must have been charming to see a play in that open day to which the drama is native though in the late hours it now keeps in the thick air of modern theatres it has long forgotten the fact it would be difficult to be greek under a german sky even when it was not actually raining but march held that with goethes help it might have been done at weimar and his wife and he proved themselves such enthusiasts for the naturtheater that the walnutfaced old gardener who showed it put together a sheaf of the flowers that grew nearest it and gave them to mrs march for a souvenir  they went for a cup of tea to the cafe which looks as from another eyebrow of the hill out over lovely little weimar in the plain below in a moment of sunshine the prospect was very smiling but their spirits sank over their tea when it came they were at least sorry they had not asked for coffee most of the people about them were taking beer including the pretty girls of a young ladies school who were there with their books and needlework in the care of one of the teachers apparently for the afternoon  mrs march perceived that they were not so much engaged with their books or their needlework but they had eyes for other things and she followed the glances of the girls till they rested upon the people at a table somewhat obliquely to the left these were apparently a mother and daughter and they were listening to a young man who sat with his back to mrs march and leaned low over the table talking to them they were both smiling radiantly and as the girl smiled she kept turning herself from the waist up and slanting her face from this side to that as if to make sure that every one saw her smiling  mrs march felt her husbands gaze following her own and she had just time to press her finger firmly on his arm and reduce his cry of astonishment to the hoarse whisper in which he gasped good gracious its the pivotal girl  at the same moment the girl rose with her mother and with the young man who had risen too came directly toward the marches on their way out of the place without noticing them though burnamy passed so near that mrs march could almost have touched him  she had just strength to say well my dear that was the cut direct  she said this in order to have her husband reassure her nonsense he never saw us why didnt you speak to him  speak to him i never shall speak to him again no this is the last of mr burnamy for me i shouldnt have minded his not recognizing us for as you say i dont believe he saw us but if he could go back to such a girl as that and flirt with her after miss triscoe thats all i wish to know of him dont you try to look him up basil im gladyes im glad he doesnt know how stoller has come to feel about him he deserves to suffer and i hope hell keep on suffering you were quite right my dearand it shows how true your instinct is in such things i dont call it more than instinctnot to tell him what stoller said and i dont want you ever should  she had risen in her excitement and was making off in such haste that she would hardly give him time to pay for their tea as she pulled him impatiently to their carriage  at last he got a chance to say i dont think i can quite promise that my minds been veering round in the other direction i think i shall tell him  what after youve seen him flirting with that girl very well then you wont my dear thats all hes behaving very basely to agatha  whats his flirtation with all the girls in the universe to do with my duty to him he has a right to know what stoller thinks and as to his behaving badly toward miss triscoe how has he done it so far as you know there is nothing whatever between them she either refused him outright that last night in carlsbad or else she made impossible conditions with him burnamy is simply consoling himself and i dont blame him  consoling himself with a pivotal girl cried mrs march  yes with a pivotal girl her pivotality may be a nervous idiosyncrasy or it may be the effect of tight lacing perhaps she has to keep turning and twisting that way to get breath but attribute the worst motive say it is to make people look at her well burnamy has a right to look with the rest and i am not going to renounce him because he takes refuge with one pretty girl from another its what men have been doing from the beginning of time  oh i dare say  men he went on are very delicately constituted very peculiarly they have been known to seek the society of girls in general of any girl because some girl has made them happy and when some girl has made them unhappy they are still more susceptible burnamy may be merely amusing himself or he may be consoling himself but in either case i think the pivotal girl has as much right to him as miss triscoe she had him first and im all for her     lxi  burnamy came away from seeing the pivotal girl and her mother off on the train which they were taking that evening for frankfort and hombourg and strolled back through the weimar streets little at ease with himself while he was with the girl and near her he had felt the attraction by which youth impersonally draws youth the charm which mere maid has for mere man but once beyond the range of this he felt sick at heart and ashamed he was aware of having used her folly as an anodyne for the pain which was always gnawing at him and he had managed to forget it in her folly but now it came back and the sense that he had been reckless of her rights came with it he had done his best to make her think him in love with her by everything but words he wondered how he could be such an ass such a wicked ass as to try making her promise to write to him from frankfort he wished never to see her again and he wished still less to hear from her it was some comfort to reflect that she had not promised but it was not comfort enough to restore him to such fragmentary selfrespect as he had been enjoying since he parted with agatha triscoe in carlsbad he could not even get back to the resentment with which he had been staying himself somewhat before the pivotal girl unexpectedly appeared with her mother in weimar  it was sedan day but there was apparently no official observance of the holiday perhaps because the grandduke was away at the manoeuvres with all the other german princes burnamy had hoped for some voluntary excitement among the people at least enough to warrant him in making a paper about sedan day in weimar which he could sell somewhere but the night was falling and there was still no sign of popular rejoicing over the french humiliation twentyeight years before except in the multitude of japanese lanterns which the children were everywhere carrying at the ends of sticks babies had them in their carriages and the effect of the floating lights in the winding upanddownhill streets was charming even to burnamys lacklustre eyes he went by his hotel and on to a cafe with a garden where there was a patriotic concert promised he supped there and then sat dreamily behind his beer while the music banged and brayed round him unheeded  presently he heard a voice of friendly banter saying in english may i sit at your table and he saw an ironical face looking down on him there doesnt seem any other place  why mr march burnamy sprang up and wrung the hand held out to him but he choked with his words of recognition it was so good to see this faithful friend again though he saw him now as he had seen him last just when he had so little reason to be proud of himself  march settled his person in the chair facing burnamy and then glanced round at the joyful jam of people eating and drinking under a firmament of lanterns this is pretty he said mighty pretty i shall make mrs march sorry for not coming when i go back  is mrs marchshe iswith youin weimar burnamy asked stupidly  march forbore to take advantage of him oh yes we saw you out at belvedere this afternoon mrs march thought for a moment that you meant not to see us a woman likes to exercise her imagination in those little flights  i never dreamed of your being therei never saw burnamy began  of course not neither did mrs etkins nor miss etkins she was looking very pretty have you been here some time  not long a week or so ive been at the parade at wurzburg  at wurzburg ah how little the world is or how large wurzburg is we were there nearly a week and we pervaded the place but there was a great crowd for you to hide in from us what had i better take a waiter had come up and was standing at marchs elbow i suppose i mustnt sit here without ordering something  white wine and selters said burnamy vaguely  the very thing why didnt i think of it its a divine drink it satisfies without filling i had it a night or two before we left home in the madison square roof garden have you seen every other week lately  no said burnamy with more spirit than he had yet shown  weve just got our mail from nuremberg the last number has a poem in it that i rather like march laughed to see the young fellows face light up with joyful consciousness come round to my hotel after youre tired here and ill let you see it theres no hurry did you notice the little children with their lanterns as you came along its the gentlest effect that a warlike memory ever came to the french themselves couldnt have minded those innocents carrying those soft lights on the day of their disaster you ought to get something out of that and ive got a subject in trust for you from rose adding he and his mother were at wurzburg im sorry to say the poor little chap didnt seem very well theyve gone to holland for the sea air march had been talking for quantity in compassion of the embarrassment in which burnamy seemed bound but he questioned how far he ought to bring comfort to the young fellow merely because he liked him so far as he could make out burnamy had been doing rather less than nothing to retrieve himself since they had met and it was by an impulse that he could not have logically defended to mrs march that he resumed we found another friend of yours in wurzburg mr stoller  mr stoller burnamy faintly echoed  yes he was there to give his daughters a holiday during the manoeuvres and they made the most of it he wanted us to go to the parade with his family but we declined the twins were pretty nearly the death of general triscoe  again burnamy echoed him general triscoe  ah yes i didnt tell you general triscoe and his daughter had come on with mrs adding and rose kenbyyou remember kenby on the norumbiakenby happened to be there too we were quite a family party and stoller got the general to drive out to the manoeuvres with him and his girls  now that he was launched march rather enjoyed letting himself go he did not know what he should say to mrs march when he came to confess having told burnamy everything before she got a chance at him he pushed on recklessly upon the principle which probably will not hold in morals that one may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb i have a message for you from mr stoller  for me burnamy gasped  ive been wondering how i should put it for i hadnt expected to see you but its simply this he wants you to knowand he seemed to want me to knowthat he doesnt hold you accountable in the way he did hes thought it all over and hes decided that he had no right to expect you to save him from his own ignorance where he was making a show of knowledge as he said he doesnt choose to plead the baby act he says that youre all right and your place on the paper is open to you  burnamy had not been very prompt before but now he seemed braced for instant response i think hes wrong he said so harshly that the people at the next table looked round his feeling as he does has nothing to do with the fact and it doesnt let me out  march would have liked to take him in his arms he merely said i think youre quite right as to that but theres such a thing as forgiveness you know it doesnt change the nature of what youve done but as far as the sufferer from it is concerned it annuls it  yes i understand that but i cant accept his forgiveness if i hate him  but perhaps you wont always hate him some day you may have a chance to do him a good turn its rather banale but there doesnt seem any other way well i have given you his message are you going with me to get that poem  when march had given burnamy the paper at his hotel and burnamy had put it in his pocket the young man said he thought he would take some coffee and he asked march to join him in the diningroom where they had stood talking  no thank you said the elder i dont propose sitting up all night and youll excuse me if i go to bed now its a little informal to leave a guest  youre not leaving a guest im at home here im staying in this hotel too  march said oh and then he added abruptly goodnight and went up stairs under the fresco of the five poets  whom were you talking with below asked mrs march through the door opening into his room from hers  burnamy he answered from within hes staying in this house he let me know just as i was going to turn him out for the night its one of those little uncandors of his that throw suspicion on his honesty in great things  oh then youve been telling him she said with a mental bound high above and far beyond the point  everything  about stoller too  about stoller and his daughters and mrs adding and rose and kenby and general triscoeand agatha  very well thats what i call shabby dont ever talk to me again about the inconsistencies of women but now theres something perfectly fearful  what is it  a letter from miss triscoe came after you were gone asking us to find rooms in some hotel for her and her father tomorrow he isnt well and theyre coming and ive telegraphed them to come here now what do you say     lxii  they could see no way out of the trouble and mrs march could not resign herself to it till her husband suggested that she should consider it providential this touched the lingering superstition in which she had been ancestrally taught to regard herself as a means when in a very tight place and to leave the responsibility with the moral government of the universe as she now perceived it had been the same as ordered that they should see burnamy under such conditions in the afternoon that they could not speak to him and hear where he was staying and in an inferior degree it had been the same as ordered that march should see him in the evening and tell him everything so that she should know just how to act when she saw him in the morning if he could plausibly account for the renewal of his flirtation with miss elkins or if he seemed generally worthy apart from that she could forgive him  it was so pleasant when he came in at breakfast with his wellremembered smile that she did not require from him any explicit defence while they talked she was righting herself in an undercurrent of drama with miss triscoe and explaining to her that they could not possibly wait over for her and her father in weimar but must be off that day for berlin as they had made all their plans it was not easy even in drama where one has everything ones own way to prove that she could not without impiety so far interfere with the course of providence as to prevent miss triscoes coming with her father to the same hotel where burnamy was staying she contrived indeed to persuade her that she had not known he was staying there when she telegraphed them where to come and that in the absence of any open confidence from miss triscoe she was not obliged to suppose that his presence would be embarrassing  march proposed leaving her with burnamy while he went up into the town and interviewed the house of schiller which he had not done yet and as soon as he got himself away she came to business breaking altogether from the inner drama with miss triscoe and devoting herself to burnamy they had already got so far as to have mentioned the meeting with the triscoes in wurzburg and she said did mr march tell you they were coming here or no we hadnt heard then yes they are coming tomorrow they may be going to stay some time she talked of weimar when we first spoke of germany on the ship burnamy said nothing and she suddenly added with a sharp glance they wanted us to get them rooms and we advised their coming to this house he started very satisfactorily and do you think they would be comfortable here she pursued  oh yes very they can have my room its southeast i shall be going into other quarters she did not say anything and mrs march he began again what is the use of my beating about the bush you must know what i went back to carlsbad for that night  no one ever told  well you must have made a pretty good guess but it was a failure i ought to have failed and i did she said that unless her father liked itand apparently he hasnt liked it burnamy smiled ruefully  how do you know she didnt know where you were  she could have got word to me if she had had good news for me theyve forwarded other letters from pupps but its all right i had no business to go back to carlsbad of course you didnt know i was in this house when you told them to come and i must clear out i had better clear out of weimar too  no i dont think so i have no right to pry into your affairs but  oh theyre wide enough open  and you may have changed your mind i thought you might when i saw you yesterday at belvedere  i was only trying to make bad worse  then i think the situation has changed entirely through what mr stoller said to mr march  i cant see how it has i committed an act of shabby treachery and im as much to blame as if he still wanted to punish me for it  did mr march say that to you  no i said that to mr march and he couldnt answer it and you cant youre very good and very kind but you cant answer it  i can answer it very well she boasted but she could find nothing better to say than its your duty to her to see her and let her know  doesnt she know already  she has a right to know it from you i think you are morbid mr burnamy you know very well i didnt like your doing that to mr stoller i didnt say so at the time because you seemed to feel it enough yourself but i did like your owning up to it and here mrs march thought it time to trot out her borrowed battlehorse again my husband always says that if a person owns up to an error fully and faithfully as youve always done they make it the same in its consequences to them as if it had never been done  does mr march say that asked burnamy with a relenting smile  indeed he does  burnamy hesitated then he asked gloomily again  and what about the consequences to the other fellow  a woman said mrs march has no concern with them and besides i think youve done all you could to save mr stoller from the consequences  i havent done anything  no matter you would if you could i wonder she broke off to prevent his persistence at a point where her nerves were beginning to give way what can be keeping mr march  nothing much more important it appeared later than the pleasure of sauntering through the streets on the way to the house of schiller and looking at the pretty children going to school with books under their arms it was the day for the schools to open after the long summer vacation and there was a freshness of expectation in the shining faces which if it could not light up his own graybeard visage could at least touch his heart  when he reached the schiller house he found that it was really not the schiller house but the schiller flat of three or four rooms one flight up whose windows look out upon the street named after the poet the whole place is bare and clean in one corner of the large room fronting the street stands schillers writingtable with his chair before it with the foot extending toward this there stands in another corner the narrow bed on which he died some withered wreaths on the pillow frame a picture of his deathmask which at first glance is like his dead face lying there it is all rather tasteless and all rather touching and the place with its meagre appointments as compared with the rich goethe house suggests that personal competition with goethe in which schiller is always falling into the second place whether it will be finally so with him in literature it is too early to ask of time and upon other points eternity will not be interrogated the great goethe and the good schiller they remain and yet march reasoned there was something good in goethe and something great in schiller  he was so full of the pathos of their inequality before the world that he did not heed the warning on the door of the pastryshop near the schiller house and on opening it he bedaubed his hand with the fresh paint on it he was then in such a state that he could not bring his mind to bear upon the question of which cakes his wife would probably prefer and he stood helplessly holding up his hand till the good woman behind the counter discovered his plight and uttered a loud cry of compassion she ran and got a wet napkin which she rubbed with soap and then she instructed him by word and gesture to rub his hand upon it and she did not leave him till his rescue was complete he let her choose a variety of the cakes for him and came away with a gay paper bag full of them and with the feeling that he had been in more intimate relations with the life of weimar than travellers are often privileged to be he argued from the instant and intelligent sympathy of the pastry woman a high grade of culture in all classes and he conceived the notion of pretending to mrs march that he had got these cakes from a descendant of schiller  his deceit availed with her for the brief moment in which she always after so many years experience of his duplicity believed anything he told her they dined merrily together at their hotel and then burnamy came down to the station with them and was very comfortable to march in helping him to get their tickets and their baggage registered the train which was to take them to halle where they were to change for berlin was rather late and they had but ten minutes after it came in before it would start again mrs march was watching impatiently at the window of the waitingroom for the dismounting passengers to clear the platform and allow the doors to be opened suddenly she gave a cry and turned and ran into the passage by which the new arrivals were pouring out toward the superabundant omnibuses march and burnamy who had been talking apart mechanically rushed after her and found her kissing miss triscoe and shaking hands with the general amidst a tempest of questions and answers from which it appeared that the triscoes had got tired of staying in wurzburg and had simply come on to weimar a day sooner than they had intended  the general was rather much bundled up for a day which was mild for a german summer day and he coughed out an explanation that he had taken an abominable cold at that ridiculous parade and had not shaken it off yet he had a notion that change of air would be better for him it could not be worse  he seemed a little vague as to burnamy rather than inimical while the ladies were still talking eagerly together in proffer and acceptance of mrs marchs lamentations that she should be going away just as miss triscoe was coming he asked if the omnibus for their hotel was there he by no means resented burnamys assurance that it was and he did not refuse to let him order their baggage little and large loaded upon it by the time this was done mrs march and miss triscoe had so far detached themselves from each other that they could separate after one more formal expression of regret and forgiveness with a lament into which she poured a world of inarticulate emotions mrs march wrenched herself from the place and suffered herself to be pushed toward her train but with the last long look which she cast over her shoulder before she vanished into the waitingroom she saw miss triscoe and burnamy transacting the elaborate politenesses of amiable strangers with regard to the very small bag which the girl had in her hand he succeeded in relieving her of it and then he led the way out of the station on the left of the general while miss triscoe brought up the rear     lxiii  from the window of the train as it drew out mrs march tried for a glimpse of the omnibus in which her proteges were now rolling away together as they were quite out of sight in the omnibus which was itself out of sight she failed but as she fell back against her seat she treated the recent incident with a complexity and simultaneity of which no report can give an idea at the end one fatal conviction remained that in everything she had said she had failed to explain to miss triscoe how burnamy happened to be in weimar and how he happened to be there with them in the station she required march to say how she had overlooked the very things which she ought to have mentioned first and which she had on the point of her tongue the whole time she went over the entire ground again to see if she could discover the reason why she had made such an unaccountable break and it appeared that she was led to it by his rushing after her with burnamy before she had had a chance to say a word about him of course she could not say anything in his presence this gave her some comfort and there was consolation in the fact that she had left them together without the least intention or connivance and now no matter what happened she could not accuse herself and he could not accuse her of matchmaking  he said that his own sense of guilt was so great that he should not dream of accusing her of anything except of regret that now she could never claim the credit of bringing the lovers together under circumstances so favorable as soon as they were engaged they could join in renouncing her with a good conscience and they would probably make this the basis of their efforts to propitiate the general  she said she did not care and with the mere removal of the lovers in space her interest in them began to abate they began to be of a minor importance in the anxieties of the change of trains at halle and in the excitement of settling into the express from frankfort there were moments when they were altogether forgotten the car was of almost american length and it ran with almost american smoothness when the conductor came and collected an extra fare for their seats the marches felt that if the charge had been two dollars instead of two marks they would have had every advantage of american travel  on the way to berlin the country was now fertile and flat and now sterile and flat near the capital the level sandy waste spread almost to its gates the train ran quickly through the narrow fringe of suburbs and then they were in one of those vast continental stations which put our outdated depots to shame the good traeger who took possession of them and their handbags put their boxes on a baggagebearing drosky and then got them another drosky for their personal transportation this was a drosky of the firstclass but they would not have thought it so either from the vehicle itself or from the appearance of the driver and his horses the public carriages of germany are the shabbiest in the world at berlin the horses look like old hair trunks and the drivers like their motheaten contents  the marches got no splendor for the two prices they paid and their approach to their hotel on unter den linden was as unimpressive as the ignoble avenue itself it was a moist cold evening and the mean tiresome street slopped and splashed under its two rows of small trees to which the thinning leaves clung like wet rags between long lines of shops and hotels which had neither the grace of paris nor the grandiosity of new york march quoted in bitter derision       bees bees was it your hydromel      under the lindens  and his wife said that if commonwealth avenue in boston could be imagined with its trees and without their beauty flanked by the architecture of sixth avenue with dashes of the west side of union square that would be the famous unter den linden where she had so resolutely decided that they would stay while in berlin  they had agreed upon the hotel and neither could blame the other because it proved secondrate in everything but its charges they ate a poorish table dhote dinner in such low spirits that march had no heart to get a rise from his wife by calling her notice to the mouse which fed upon the crumbs about their feet while they dined their englishspeaking waiter said that it was a very warm evening and they never knew whether this was because he was a humorist or because he was lonely and wished to talk or because it really was a warm evening for berlin when they had finished they went out and drove about the greater part of the evening looking for another hotel whose first requisite should be that it was not on unter den linden what mainly determined mrs march in favor of the large handsome impersonal place they fixed upon was the fact that it was equipped for steamheating what determined march was the fact that it had a passengeroffice where when he wished to leave he could buy his railroad tickets and have his baggage checked without the maddening anxiety of doing it at the station but it was precisely in these points that the hotel which admirably fulfilled its other functions fell short the weather made a succession of efforts throughout their stay to clear up cold it merely grew colder without clearing up but this seemed to offer no suggestion of steam for heating their bleak apartment and the chilly corridors to the management with the help of a large lamp which they kept burning night and day they got the temperature of their rooms up to sixty there was neither stove nor fireplace the cold electric bulbs diffused a frosty glare and in the vast stately diningroom with its vaulted roof there was nothing to warm them but their plates and the handles of their knives and forks which by a mysterious inspiration were always hot when they were ready to go march experienced from the apathy of the baggage clerk and the reluctance of the porters a more piercing distress than any he had known at the railroad stations and one luckless valise which he ordered sent after him by express reached his bankers in paris a fortnight overdue with an accumulation of charges upon it outvaluing the books which it contained  but these were minor defects in an establishment which had many merits and was mainly of the temperament and intention of the large english railroad hotels they looked from their windows down into a gardened square peopled with a full share of the superabounding statues of berlin and frequented by babies and nurse maids who seemed not to mind the cold any more than the stone kings and generals the aspect of this square like the excellent cooking of the hotel and the architecture of the imperial capital suggested the superior civilization of paris even the rows of gray houses and private palaces of berlin are in the french taste which is the only taste there is in berlin the suggestion of paris is constant but it is of paris in exile and without the chic which the city wears in its native air the crowd lacks this as much as the architecture and the sculpture there is no distinction among the men except for now and then a military figure and among the women no style such as relieves the commonplace rash of the new york streets the berliners are plain and ill dressed both men and women and even the little children are plain every one is ill dressed but no one is ragged and among the undersized homely folk of the lower classes there is no such povertystricken shabbiness as shocks and insults the sight in new york that which distinctly recalls our metropolis is the lofty passage of the elevated trains intersecting the prospectives of many streets but in berlin the elevated road is carried on massive brick archways and not lifted upon gay crazy iron ladders like ours  when you look away from this and regard berlin on its aesthetic side you are again in that banished paris whose captive artsoul is made to serve so far as it may be enslaved to such an effect in the celebration of the german triumph over france berlin has never the presence of a great capital however in spite of its perpetual monumental insistence there is no streaming movement in broad vistas the dull looking population moves sluggishly there is no show of fine equipages the prevailing tone of the city and the sky is gray but under the cloudy heaven there is no responsive gothic solemnity in the architecture there are hints of the older german cities in some of the remote and observe streets but otherwise all is as new as boston which in fact the actual berlin hardly antedates  there are easily more statues in berlin than in any other city in the world but they only unite in failing to give berlin an artistic air they stand in long rows on the cornices they crowd the pediments they poise on one leg above domes and arches they shelter themselves in niches they ride about on horseback they sit or lounge on street corners or in garden walks all with a mediocrity in the older sort which fails of any impression if they were only furiously baroque they would be something and it may be from a sense of this that there is a selfassertion in the recent sculptures which are always patriotic more noisy and bragging than anything else in perennial brass this offensive art is the modern prussian avatar of the old german romantic spirit and bears the same relation to it that modern romanticism in literature bears to romance it finds its apotheosis in the monument to kaiser wilhelm i a vast incoherent group of swelling and swaggering bronze commemorating the victory of the first prussian emperor in the war with the last french emperor and avenging the vanquished upon the victors by its ugliness the ungainly and irrelevant assemblage of men and animals backs away from the imperial palace and saves itself too soon from plunging over the border of a canal behind it not far from rauchs great statue of the great frederic to come to it from the simplicity and quiet of that noble work is like passing from some exquisite masterpiece of naturalistic acting to the rant and uproar of melodrama and the marches stood stunned and bewildered by its wild explosions  when they could escape they found themselves so convenient to the imperial palace that they judged best to discharge at once the obligation to visit it which must otherwise weigh upon them they entered the court without opposition from the sentinel and joined other strangers straggling instinctively toward a waitingroom in one corner of the building where after they had increased to some thirty a custodian took charge of them and led them up a series of inclined plains of brick to the state apartments in the antechamber they found a provision of immense felt overshoes which they were expected to put on for their passage over the waxed marquetry of the halls these roomy slippers were designed for the accommodation of the native boots and upon the mixed company of foreigners the effect was in the last degree humiliating the womens skirts some what hid their disgrace but the men were openly put to shame and they shuffled forward with their bodies at a convenient incline like a company of snowshoers in the depths of his own abasement march heard a female voice behind him sighing in american accents to think i should be polishing up these imperial floors with my republican feet  the protest expressed the rebellion which he felt mounting in his own heart as they advanced through the heavily splendid rooms in the historical order of the family portraits recording the rise of the prussian sovereigns from margraves to emperors he began to realize here the fact which grew open him more and more that imperial germany is not the effect of a popular impulse but of a dynastic propensity there is nothing original in the imperial palace nothing national it embodies and proclaims a powerful personal will and in its adaptations of french art it appeals to no emotion in the german witness nobler than his pride in the german triumph over the french in war march found it tiresome beyond the tiresome wont of palaces and he gladly shook off the sense of it with his felt shoes well he confided to his wife when they were fairly outofdoors if prussia rose in the strength of silence as carlyle wants us to believe she is taking it out in talk now and tall talk  yes isnt she mrs march assented and with a passionate desire for excess in a bad thing which we all know at times she looked eagerly about her for proofs of that odious militarism of the empire which ought to have been conspicuous in the imperial capital but possibly because the troops were nearly all away at the manoeuvres there were hardly more in the streets than she had sometimes seen in washington again the german officers signally failed to offer her any rudeness when she met them on the sidewalks there were scarcely any of them and perhaps that might have been the reason why they were not more aggressive but a whole company of soldiers marching carelessly up to the palace from the brandenburg gate without music or so much style as our own militia often puts on regarded her with inoffensive eyes so far as they looked at her she declared that personally there was nothing against the prussians even when in uniform they were kindly and modestlooking men it was when they got up on pedestals in bronze or marble that they began to bully and to brag     lxiv  the dinner which the marches got at a restaurant on unter den linden almost redeemed the avenue from the disgrace it had fallen into with them it was the best meal they had yet eaten in europe and as to fact and form was a sort of compromise between a french dinner and an english dinner which they did not hesitate to pronounce prussian the waiter who served it was a friendly spirit very sensible of their intelligent appreciation of the dinner and from him they formed a more respectful opinion of berlin civilization than they had yet held after the manner of strangers everywhere they judged the country they were visiting from such of its inhabitants as chance brought them in contact with and it would really be a good thing for nations that wish to stand well with the world at large to look carefully to the behavior of its cabmen and car conductors its hotel clerks and waiters its theatreticket sellers and ushers its policemen and sacristans its landlords and salesmen for by these rather than by its society women and its statesmen and divines is it really judged in the books of travellers some attention also should be paid to the weather if the climate is to be praised in the railroad cafe at potsdam there was a waiter so rude to the marches that if they had not been people of great strength of character he would have undone the favorable impression the soldiers and civilians of berlin generally had been at such pains to produce in them and throughout the week of early september which they passed there it rained so much and so bitterly it was so wet and so cold that they might have come away thinking its the worst climate in the world if it had not been for a man whom they saw in one of the public gardens pouring a heavy stream from his garden hose upon the shrubbery already soaked and shuddering in the cold but this convinced them that they were suffering from weather and not from the climate which must really be hot and dry and they went home to their hotel and sat contentedly down in a temperature of sixty degrees the weather was not always so bad one day it was dry cold instead of wet cold with rough rusty clouds breaking a blue sky another day up to eleven in the forenoon it was like indian summer then it changed to a harsh november air and then it relented and ended so mildly that they hired chairs in the place before the imperial palace for five pfennigs each and sat watching the life before them motherly womenfolk were there knitting two american girls in chairs near them chatted together some fine equipages the only ones they saw in berlin went by a dog and a man the wife who ought to have been in harness was probably sick and the poor fellow was forced to take her place passed dragging a cart some schoolboys who had hung their satchels upon the low railing were playing about the base of the statue of king william iii in the joyous freedom of german childhood  they seemed the gayer for the brief moments of sunshine but to the americans who were southern by virtue of their sky the brightness had a sense of lurking winter in it such as they remembered feeling on a sunny day in quebec the blue heaven looked sad but they agreed that it fitly roofed the bit of old feudal berlin which forms the most ancient wing of the schloss this was timeblackened and rude but at least it did not try to be french and it overhung the spree which winds through the city and gives it the greatest charm it has in fact berlin which is otherwise so grandiose without grandeur and so severe without impressiveness is sympathetic wherever the spree opens it to the sky the stream is spanned by many bridges and bridges cannot well be unpicturesque especially if they have statues to help them out the spree abounds in bridges and it has a charming habit of slow hayladen barges at the landings of the little passengersteamers which ply upon it there are cafes and summergardens and these even in the inclement air of september suggested a friendly gayety  the marches saw it best in the tour of the elevated road in berlin which they made in an impassioned memory of the elevated road in new york the brick viaducts which carry this arch the spree again and again in their course through and around the city but with never quite such spectacular effects as our spidery tressels achieve the stations are pleasant sometimes with lunchcounters and newsstands but have not the comicoperachalet prettiness of ours and are not so frequent the road is not so smooth the cars not so smoothrunning or so swift on the other hand they are comfortably cushioned and they are never overcrowded the line is at times above at times below the houses and at times on a level with them alike in city and in suburbs the train whirled out of thickly built districts past the backs of the old houses into outskirts thinly populated with new houses springing up without order or continuity among the meadows and vegetablegardens and along the readymade elmplanted avenues where wooden fences divided the vacant lots everywhere the city was growing out over the country in blocks and detached edifices of limestone sandstone red and yellow brick larger or smaller of no more uniformity than our suburban dwellings but never of their ugliness or lawless offensiveness  in an effort for the intimate life of the country march went two successive mornings for his breakfast to the cafe bauer which has some admirable wallprintings and is the chief cafe on unter den linden but on both days there were more people in the paintings than out of them the second morning the waiter who took his order recognized him and asked wie gestern and from this he argued an affectionate constancy in the berliners and a hospitable observance of the tastes of strangers at his bankers on the other hand the cashier scrutinized his signature and remarked that it did not look like the signature in his letter of credit and then he inferred a suspicious mind in the moneyed classes of prussia as he had not been treated with such unkind doubt by hebrew bankers anywhere he made a mental note that the jews were politer than the christians in germany in starting for potsdam he asked a traeger where the potsdam train was and the man said dat train dare and in coming back he helped a fat old lady out of the car and she thanked him in english from these incidents both occurring the same day in the same place the inference of a widespread knowledge of our language in all classes of the population was inevitable  in this obvious and easy manner he studied contemporary civilization in the capital he even carried his researches farther and went one rainy afternoon to an exhibition of modern pictures in a pavilion of the thiergarten where from the small attendance he inferred an indifference to the arts which he would not ascribe to the weather one evening at a summer theatre where they gave the pantomime of the puppenfee and the operetta of hansel and gretel he observed that the greater part of the audience was composed of nice plain young girls and children and he noted that there was no sort of evening dress from the large number of americans present he imagined a numerous colony in berlin where they mast have an instinctive sense of their conationality since one of them in the stress of getting his hat and overcoat when they all came out confidently addressed him in english but he took stock of his impressions with his wife and they seemed to him so few after all that he could not resist a painful sense of isolation in the midst of the environment  they made a sunday excursion to the zoological gardens in the thiergarten with a large crowd of the lower classes but though they had a great deal of trouble in getting there by the various kinds of horsecars and electric cars they did not feel that they had got near to the popular life they endeavored for some sense of berlin society by driving home in a drosky and on the way they passed rows of beautiful houses in french and italian taste fronting the deep damp green park from the thiergartenstrasse in which they were confident cultivated and delightful people lived but they remained to the last with nothing but their unsupported conjecture     lxv  their excursion to potsdam was the cream of their sojourn in berlin they chose for it the first fair morning and they ran out over the flat sandy plains surrounding the capital and among the low hills surrounding potsdam before it actually began to rain  they wished immediately to see sans souci for the great fredericks sake and they drove through a lively shower to the palace where they waited with a horde of twentyfive other tourists in a gusty colonnade before they were led through voltaires room and fredericks death chamber  the french philosopher comes before the prussian prince at sans souci even in the palatial villa which expresses the wilful caprice of the great frederick as few edifices have embodied the whims or tastes of their owners the whole affair is eighteenthcentury french as the germans conceived it the gardened terrace from which the low onestory building thickly crusted with baroque sculptures looks down into a manycolored parterre was luxuriantly french and sentimentally french the colonnaded front opening to a perspective of artificial ruins with broken pillars lifting a conscious fragment of architrave against the sky within all again was french in the design the decoration and the furnishing at that time there was in fact no other taste and frederick who despised and disused his native tongue was resolved upon french taste even in his intimate companionship the droll story of his coquetry with the terrible free spirit which he got from france to be his guest is vividly reanimated at sans souci where one breathes the very air in which the strangely assorted companions lived and in which they parted so soon to pursue each other with brutal annoyance on one side and with merciless mockery on the other voltaire was long ago revenged upon his host for all the indignities he suffered from him in their comedy he left deeply graven upon fredericks fame the trace of those lacerating talons which he could strike to the quick and it is the singular effect of this scene of their brief friendship that one feels there the preeminence of the wit in whatever was most important to mankind  the rain had lifted a little and the sun shone out on the bloom of the lovely parterre where the marches profited by a smiling moment to wander among the statues and the roses heavy with the shower then they walked back to their carriage and drove to the new palace which expresses in differing architectural terms the same subjection to an alien ideal of beauty it is thronged without by delightfully preposterous rococco statues and within it is rich in all those curiosities and memorials of royalty with which palaces so well know how to fatigue the flesh and spirit of their visitors  the marches escaped from it all with sighs and groans of relief and before they drove off to see the great fountain of the orangeries they dedicated a moment of pathos to the temple of friendship which frederick built in memory of unhappy wilhelmina of beyreuth the sister he loved in the common sorrow of their wretched home and neglected when he came to his kingdom it is beautiful in its rococco way swept up to on its terrace by most noble staircases and swaggered over by baroque allegories of all sorts everywhere the statues outnumbered the visitors who may have been kept away by the rain the statues naturally did not mind it  sometime in the midst of their sightseeing the marches had dinner in a mildewed restaurant where a compatriotic accent caught their ear in a voice saying to the waiter we are in a hurry they looked round and saw that it proceeded from the pretty nose of a young american girl who sat with a party of young american girls at a neighboring table then they perceived that all the people in that restaurant were americans mostly young girls who all looked as if they were in a hurry but neither their beauty nor their impatience had the least effect with the waiter who prolonged the dinner at his pleasure and alarmed the marches with the misgiving that they should not have time for the final palace on their list  this was the palace where the father of frederick the mad old frederick william brought up his children with that severity which solomon urged but probably did not practise it is a vast place but they had time for it all though the custodian made the most of them as the latest comers of the day and led them through it with a prolixity as great as their waiters he was a most friendly custodian and when he found that they had some little notion of what they wanted to see he mixed zeal with his patronage and in a manner made them his honored guests they saw everything but the doorway where the faithful royal father used to lie in wait for his children and beat them princes and princesses alike with his knobby cane as they came through they might have seen this doorway without knowing it but from the window overlooking the paradeground where his family watched the manoeuvres of his gigantic grenadiers they made sure of just such puddles as frederick william forced his family to sit with their feet in while they dined alfresco on pork and cabbage and they visited the room of the smoking parliament where he ruled his convives with a rod of iron and made them the victims of his bad jokes the measuringboard against which he took the stature of his tall grenadiers is there and one room is devoted to those masterpieces which he used to paint in the agonies of gout his chef doeuvre contains a figure with two left feet and there seemed no reason why it might not have had three in another room is a small statue of carlyle who did so much to rehabilitate the house which the daughter of it wilhelmina did so much to demolish in the regard of men  the palace is now mostly kept for guests and there is a chamber where napoleon slept which is not likely to be occupied soon by any other selfinvited guest of his nation it is perhaps to keep the princes of europe humble that hardly a palace on the continent is without the chamber of this adventurer who till he stooped to be like them was easily their master another democracy had here recorded its invasion in the american stoves which the custodian pointed out in the corridor when mrs march with as little delay as possible had proclaimed their country the custodian professed an added respect for them from the fact and if he did not feel it no doubt he merited the drink money which they lavished on him at parting  their driver also was a congenial spirit and when he let them out of his carriage at the station he excused the rainy day to them he was a merry fellow beyond the wont of his nation and helaughed at the bad weather as if it had been a good joke on them  his gayety and the red sunset light which shone on the stems of the pines on the way back to berlin contributed to the content in which they reviewed their visit to potsdam they agreed that the place was perfectly charming and that it was incomparably expressive of kingly will and pride these had done there on the grand scale what all the german princes and princelings had tried to do in imitation and emulation of french splendor in potsdam the grandeur was not a historical growth as at versailles but was the effect of family genius in which there was often the curious fascination of insanity  they felt this strongly again amidst the futile monuments of the hohenzollern museum in berlin where all the portraits effigies personal belongings and memorials of that gifted eccentric race are gathered and historically disposed the princes of the mighty line who stand out from the rest are frederick the great and his infuriate father and in the waxen likeness of the son a small thin figure terribly spry and a face pitilessly alert appears something of the madness which showed in the life of the sire  they went through many rooms in which the memorials of the kings and queens the emperors and empresses were carefully ordered and felt no kindness except before the relics relating to the emperor frederick and his mother in the presence of the greatest of the dynasty they experienced a kind of terror which march expressed when they were safely away in the confession of his joy that those people were dead     lxvi  the rough weather which made berlin almost uninhabitable to mrs march had such an effect with general triscoe at weimar that under the orders of an englishspeaking doctor he retreated from it altogether and went to bed here he escaped the bronchitis which had attacked him and his convalesence left him so little to complain of that he could not always keep his temper in the absence of actual offence either from his daughter or from burnamy his sense of injury took a retroactive form it centred first in stoller and the twins then it diverged toward rose adding his mother and kenby and finally involved the marches in the same measure of inculpation for they had each and all had part directly or indirectly in the chances that brought on his cold  he owed to burnamy the comfort of the best room in the hotel and he was constantly dependent upon his kindness but he made it evident that he did not overvalue burnamys sacrifice and devotion and that it was not an unmixed pleasure however great a convenience to have him about in giving up his room burnamy had proposed going out of the hotel altogether but general triscoe heard of this with almost as great vexation as he had accepted the room he besought him not to go but so ungraciously that his daughter was ashamed and tried to atone for his manner by the kindness of her own  perhaps general triscoe would not have been without excuse if he were not eager to have her share with destitute merit the fortune which she had hitherto shared only with him he was old and certain luxuries had become habits if not necessaries with him of course he did not say this to himself and still less did he say it to her but he let her see that he did not enjoy the chance which had thrown them again in such close relations with burnamy and he did pot hide his belief that the marches were somehow to blame for it this made it impossible for her to write at once to mrs march as she had promised but she was determined that it should not make her unjust to burnamy she would not avoid him she would not let anything that had happened keep her from showing that she felt his kindness and was glad of his help  of course they knew no one else in weimar and his presence merely as a fellowcountryman would have been precious he got them a doctor against general triscoes will he went for his medicines he lent him books and papers he sat with him and tried to amuse him but with the girl he attempted no return to the situation at carlsbad there is nothing like the delicate pride of a young man who resolves to forego unfair advantage in love  the day after their arrival when her father was making up for the sleep he had lost by night she found herself alone in the little readingroom of the hotel with burnamy for the first time and she said i suppose you must have been all over weimar by this time  well ive been here off and on almost a month its an interesting place theres a good deal of the old literary quality left  and you enjoy that i sawshe added this with a little unnecessary flushyour poem in the paper you lent papa  i suppose i ought to have kept that back but i couldnt he laughed and she said  you must find a great deal of inspiration in such a literary place  it isnt lying about loose exactly even in the serious and perplexing situation in which he found himself he could not help being amused with her unliterary notions of literature her conventional and commonplace conceptions of it they had their value with him as those of a more fashionable world than his own which he believed was somehow a greater world at the same time he believed that she was now interposing them between the present and the past and forbidding with them any return to the mood of their last meeting in carlsbad he looked at her ladylike composure and unconsciousness and wondered if she could be the same person and the same person as they who lost themselves in the crowd that night and heard and said words palpitant with fate perhaps there had been no such words perhaps it was all a hallucination he must leave her to recognize that it was reality till she did so he felt bitterly that there was nothing for him but submission and patience if she never did so there was nothing for him but acquiescence  in this talk and in the talks they had afterwards she seemed willing enough to speak of what had happened since of coming on to wurzburg with the addings and of finding the marches there of roses collapse and of his mothers flight seaward with him in the care of kenby who was so fortunately going to holland too he on his side told her of going to wurzburg for the manoeuvres and they agreed that it was very strange they had not met  she did not try to keep their relations from taking the domestic character which was inevitable and it seemed to him that this in itself was significant of a determination on her part that was fatal to his hopes with a lovers indefinite power of blinding himself to what is before his eyes he believed that if she had been more diffident of him more uneasy in his presence he should have had more courage but for her to breakfast unafraid with him to meet him at lunch and dinner in the little diningroom where they were often the only guests and always the only englishspeaking guests was nothing less than prohibitive  in the hotel service there was one of those men who are porters in this world but will be angels in the next unless the perfect goodness of their looks the constant kindness of their acts belies them the marches had known and loved the man in their brief stay and he had been the fast friend of burnamy from the moment they first saw each other at the station he had tenderly taken possession of general triscoe on his arrival and had constituted himself the nurse and keeper of the irascible invalid in the intervals of going to the trains with a zeal that often relieved his daughter and burnamy the general in fact preferred him to either and a tacit custom grew up by which when august knocked at his door and offered himself in his few words of serviceable english that one of them who happened to be sitting with the general gave way and left him in charge the retiring watcher was then apt to encounter the other watcher on the stairs or in the readingroom or in the tiny whitepebbled dooryard at a little table in the shade of the woodentubbed evergreens from the habit of doing this they one day suddenly formed the habit of going across the street to that gardened hollow before and below the grandducal museum there was here a bench in the shelter of some lateflowering bush which the few other frequenters of the place soon recognized as belonging to the young strangers so that they would silently rise and leave it to them when they saw them coming apparently they yielded not only to their right but to a certain authority which resides in lovers and which all other men and especially all other women like to acknowledge and respect  in the absence of any civic documents bearing upon the affair it is difficult to establish the fact that this was the character in which agatha and burnamy were commonly regarded by the inhabitants of weimar but whatever their own notion of their relation was if it was not that of a brant and a brautigam the people of weimar would have been puzzled to say what it was it was known that the gracious young ladys father who would naturally have accompanied them was sick and in the fact that they were americans much extenuation was found for whatever was phenomenal in their unencumbered enjoyment of each others society  if their free american association was indistinguishably like the peasant informality which general triscoe despised in the relations of kenby and mrs adding it is to be said in his excuse that he could not be fully cognizant of it in the circumstances and so could do nothing to prevent it his pessimism extended to his health from the first he believed himself worse than the doctor thought him and he would have had some other physician if he had not found consolation in their difference of opinion and the consequent contempt which he was enabled to cherish for the doctor in view of the mans complete ignorance of the case in proof of his own better understanding of it he remained in bed some time after the doctor said he might get up  nearly ten days had passed before he left his room and it was not till then that he clearly saw how far affairs had gone with his daughter and burnamy though even then his observance seemed to have anticipated theirs he found them in a quiet acceptance of the fortune which had brought them together so contented that they appeared to ask nothing more of it the divine patience and confidence of their youth might sometimes have had almost the effect of indifference to a witness who had seen its evolution from the moods of the first few days of their reunion in weimar to general triscoe however it looked like an understanding which had been made without reference to his wishes and had not been directly brought to his knowledge  agatha he said after due note of a gay contest between her and burnamy over the pleasure and privilege of ordering his supper sent to his room when he had gone back to it from his first afternoon in the open air how long is that young man going to stay in weimar  why i dont know she answered startled from her work of beating the sofa pillows into shape and pausing with one of them in her hand i never asked him she looked down candidly into his face where he sat in an easychair waiting for her arrangement of the sofa what makes you ask  he answered with another question does he know that we had thought of staying here  why weve always talked of that havent we yes he knows it didnt you want him to know it papa you ought to have begun on the ship then of course ive asked him what sort of place it was im sorry if you didnt want me to  have i said that its perfectly easy to push on to paris unless  unless what agatha dropped the pillow and listened respectfully but in spite of her filial attitude she could not keep her youth and strength and courage from quelling the forces of the elderly man  he said querulously i dont see why you take that tone with me you certainly know what i mean but if you dont care to deal openly with me i wont ask you he dropped his eyes from her face and at the same time a deep blush began to tinge it growing up from her neck to her forehead you must knowyoure not a child he continued still with averted eyes that this sort of thing cant go on it must be something else or it mustnt be anything at all i dont ask you for your confidence and you know that ive never sought to control you  this was not the least true but agatha answered either absently or provisionally no  and i dont seek to do so now if you have nothing that you wish to tell me  he waited and after what seemed a long time she asked as if she had not heard him will you lie down a little before your supper papa  i will lie down when i feel like it he answered send august with the supper he can look after me  his resentful tone even more than his words dismissed her but she left him without apparent grievance saying quietly i will send august     lxvii  agatha did not come down to supper with burnamy she asked august when she gave him her fathers order to have a cup of tea sent to her room where when it came she remained thinking so long that it was rather tepid by the time she drank it  then she went to her window and looked out first above and next below above the moon was hanging over the gardened hollow before the museum with the airy lightness of an american moon below was burnamy behind the tubbed evergreens sitting tilted in his chair against the house wall with the spark of his cigar fainting and flashing like an american firefly agatha went down to the door after a little delay and seemed surprised to find him there at least she said oh in a tone of surprise  burnamy stood up and answered nice night  beautiful she breathed i didnt suppose the sky in germany could ever be so clear  it seems to be doing its best  the flowers over there look like ghosts in the light she said dreamily  theyre not dont you want to get your hat and wrap and go over and expose the fraud  oh she answered as if it were merely a question of the hat and wrap i have them  they sauntered through the garden walks for a while long enough to have ascertained that there was not a veridical phantom among the flowers if they had been looking and then when they came to their accustomed seat they sat down and she said i dont know that ive seen the moon so clear since we left carlsbad at the last word his heart gave a jump that seemed to lodge it in his throat and kept him from speaking so that she could resume without interruption ive got something of yours that you left at the posthof the girl that broke the dishes found it and lili gave it to mrs march for you this did not account for agathas having the thing whatever it was but when she took a handkerchief from her belt and put out her hand with it toward him he seemed to find that her having it had necessarily followed he tried to take it from her but his own hand trembled so that it clung to hers and he gasped cant you say now what you wouldnt say then  the logical sequence was no more obvious than be fore but she apparently felt it in her turn as he had felt it in his she whispered back yes and then she could not get out anything more till she entreated in a halfstifled voice oh dont  no no he panted i wonti oughtnt to have done iti beg your pardoni oughtnt to have spokeneveni  she returned in a far less breathless and tremulous fashion but still between laughing and crying i meant to make you and now if youre ever sorry or im ever too topping about anything you can be perfectly free to say that youd never have spoken if you hadnt seen that i wanted you to  but i didnt see any such thing he protested i spoke because i couldnt help it any longer  she laughed triumphantly of course you think so and that shows that you are only a man after all in spite of your finessing but i am going to have the credit of it i knew that you were holding back because you were too proud or thought you hadnt the right or something werent you she startled him with the sudden vehemence of her challenge if you pretend that you werent i shall never forgive you  but i was of course i was i was afraid  isnt that what i said she triumphed over him with another laugh and cowered a little closer to him if that could be  they were standing without knowing how they had got to their feet and now without any purpose of the kind they began to stroll again among the garden paths and to ask and to answer questions which touched every point of their common history and yet left it a mine of inexhaustible knowledge for all future time out of the sweet and dear delight of this encyclopedian reserve two or three facts appeared with a present distinctness one of these was that burnamy had regarded her refusal to be definite at carlsbad as definite refusal and had meant never to see her again and certainly never to speak again of love to her another point was that she had not resented his coming back that last night but had been proud and happy in it as proof of his love and had always meant somehow to let him know that she was torched by his trusting her enough to come back while he was still under that cloud with mr stoller with further logic purely of the heart she acquitted him altogether of wrong in that affair and alleged in proof what mr stoller had said of it to mr march burnamy owned that he knew what stoller had said but even in his present condition he could not accept fully her reading of that obscure passage of his life he preferred to put the question by and perhaps neither of them cared anything about it except as it related to the fact that they were now each others forever  they agreed that they must write to mr and mrs march at once or at least agatha said as soon as she had spoken to her father at her mention of her father she was aware of a doubt a fear in burnamy which expressed itself by scarcely more than a spiritual consciousness from his arm to the hands which she had clasped within it he has always appreciated you she said courageously and i know he will see it in the right light  she probably meant no more than to affirm her faith in her own ability finally to bring her father to a just mind concerning it but burnamy accepted her assurance with buoyant hopefulness and said he would see general triscoe the first thing in the morning  no i will see him she said i wish to see him first he will expect it of me we had better go in now she added but neither made any motion for the present to do so on the contrary they walked in the other direction and it was an hour after agatha declared their duty in the matter before they tried to fulfil it  then indeed after they returned to the hotel she lost no time in going to her father beyond that which must be given to a long handpressure under the fresco of the five poets on the stairs landing where her ways and burnamys parted she went into her own room and softly opened the door into her fathers and listened  well he said in a sort of challenging voice  have you been asleep she asked  ive just blown out my light what has kept you  she did not reply categorically standing there in the sheltering dark she said papa i wasnt very candid with you this afternoon i am engaged to mr burnamy  light the candle said her father or no he added before she could do so is it quite settled  quite she answered in a voice that admitted of no doubt that is as far as it can be without you  dont be a hypocrite agatha said the general and let me try to get to sleep you know i dont like it and you know i cant help it  yes the girl assented  then go to bed said the general concisely  agatha did not obey her father she thought she ought to kiss him but she decided that she had better postpone this so she merely gave him a tender goodnight to which he made no response and shut herself into her own room where she remained sitting and staring out into the moonlight with a smile that never left her lips  when the moon sank below the horizon the sky was pale with the coming day but before it was fairly dawn she saw something white not much greater than some moths moving before her window she pulled the valves open and found it a bit of paper attached to a thread dangling from above she broke it loose and in the morning twilight she read the great central truth of the universe  i love you l j b  she wrote under the tremendous inspiration  so do i dont be silly a t  she fastened the paper to the thread again and gave it a little twitch she waited for the low note of laughter which did not fail to flutter down from above then she threw herself upon the bed and fell asleep  it was not so late as she thought when she woke and it seemed at breakfast that burnamy had been up still earlier of the three involved in the anxiety of the night before general triscoe was still respited from it by sleep but he woke much more haggard than either of the young people they in fact were not at all haggard the worst was over if bringing their engagement to his knowledge was the worst the formality of asking his consent which burnamy still had to go through was unpleasant but after all it was a formality agatha told him everything that had passed between herself and her father and if it had not that cordiality on his part which they could have wished it was certainly not hopelessly discouraging  they agreed at breakfast that burnamy had better have it over as quickly as possible and he waited only till august came down with the generals tray before going up to his room the young fellow did not feel more at his ease than the elder meant he should in taking the chair to which the general waved him from where he lay in bed and there was no talk wasted upon the weather between them  i suppose i know what you have come for mr burnamy said general triscoe in a tone which was rather judicial than otherwise and i suppose you know why you have come the words certainly opened the way for burnamy but he hesitated so long to take it that the general had abundant time to add i dont pretend that this event is unexpected but i should like to know what reason you have for thinking i should wish you to marry my daughter i take it for granted that you are attached to each other and we wont waste time on that point not to beat about the bush on the next point let me ask at once what your means of supporting her are how much did you earn on that newspaper in chicago  fifteen hundred dollars burnamy answered promptly enough  did you earn anything more say within the last year  i got three hundred dollars advance copyright for a book i sold to a publisher the glory had not yet faded from the fact in burnamys mind  eighteen hundred what did you get for your poem in marchs book  thats a very trifling matter fifteen dollars  and your salary as private secretary to that man stoller  thirty dollars a week and my expenses but i wouldnt take that general triscoe said burnamy  general triscoe from his lit de justice passed this point in silence have you any one dependent on you  my mother i take care of my mother answered burnamy proudly  since you have broken with stoller what are your prospects  i have none  then you dont expect to support my daughter you expect to live upon her means  i expect to do nothing of the kind cried burnamy i should be ashamedi should feel disgracedi shouldi dont ask youi dont ask her till i have the means to support her  if you were very fortunate continued the general unmoved by the young fellows pain and unperturbed by the fact that he had himself lived upon his wifes means as long as she lived and then upon his daughters if you went back to stoller  i wouldnt go back to him i dont say hes knowingly a rascal but hes ignorantly a rascal and he proposed a rascally thing to me i behaved badly to him and id give anything to undo the wrong i let him do himself but ill never go back to him  if you went back on your old salary the general persisted pitilessly you would be very fortunate if you brought your earnings up to twentyfive hundred a year  yes  and how far do you think that would go in supporting my daughter on the scale she is used to i dont speak of your mother who has the first claim upon you  burnamy sat dumb and his head which he had lifted indignantly when the question was of stoller began to sink  the general went on you ask me to give you my daughter when you havent money enough to keep her in gowns you ask me to give her to a stranger  not quite a stranger general triscoe burnamy protested you have known me for three months at least and any one who knows me in chicago will tell you  a stranger and worse than a stranger the general continued so pleased with the logical perfection of his position that he almost smiled and certainly softened toward burnamy it isnt a question of liking you mr burnamy but of knowing you my daughter likes you so do the marches so does everybody who has met you i like you myself youve done me personally a thousand kindnesses but i know very little of you in spite of our three months acquaintance and that little isbut you shall judge for yourself you were in the confidential employ of a man who trusted you and you let him betray himself  i did i dont excuse it the thought of it burns like fire but it wasnt done maliciously it wasnt done falsely it was done inconsiderately and when it was done it seemed irrevocable but it wasnt i could have prevented i could have stooped the mischief and i didnt i can never outlive that  i know said the general relentlessly that you have never attempted any defence that has been to your credit with me it inclined me to overlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter when you told her you would never see her again what did you expect me to think after that of your coming back to see her or didnt you expect me to know it  i expected you to know it i knew she would tell you but i dont excuse that either it was acting a lie to come back all i can say is that i had to see her again for one last time  and to make sure that it was to be the last time you offered yourself to her  i couldnt help doing that  i dont say you could i dont judge the facts at all i leave them altogether to you and you shall say what a man in my position ought to say to such a man as you have shown yourself  no i will say the door into the adjoining room was flung open and agatha flashed in from it  her father looked coldly at her impassioned face have you been listening he asked  i have been hearing  oh as nearly as a man could in bed general triscoe shrugged  i suppose i had a right to be in my own room i couldnt help hearing and i was perfectly astonished at you papa the cruel way you went on after all youve said about mr stoller and his getting no more than he deserved  that doesnt justify me burnamy began but she cut him short almost as severely as shehad dealt with her father  yes it does it justifies you perfectly and his wanting you to falsify the whole thing afterwards more than justifies you  neither of the men attempted anything in reply to her casuistry they both looked equally posed by it for different reasons and agatha went on as vehemently as before addressing herself now to one and now to the other  and besides if it didnt justify you what you have done yourself would and your never denying it or trying to excuse it makes it the same as if you hadnt done it as far as you are concerned and that is all i care for burnamy started as if with the sense of having heard something like this before and with surprise at hearing it now and she flushed a little as she added tremulously and i should never never blame you for it after that its only trying to wriggle out of things which i despise and youve never done that and he simply had to come back she turned to her father and tell me himself just how it was and you said yourself papaor the same as saidthat he had no right to suppose i was interested in his affairs unless heunlessand i should never have forgiven him if he hadnt told me then that he that he had come back because hefelt the way he did i consider that that exonerated him for breaking his word completely if he hadnt broken his word i should have thought he had acted very cruelly andand strangely and ever since then he has behaved so nobly so honorably so delicately that i dont believe he would ever have said anything againif i hadnt fairly forced him yes yes i did she cried at a movement of remonstrance from burnamy and i shall always be proud of you for it her father stared steadfastly at her and he only lifted his eyebrows for change of expression when she went over to where burnamy stood and put her hand in his with a certain childlike impetuosity and as for the rest she declared everything i have is his just as everything of his would be mine if i had nothing or if he wishes to take me without anything then he can have me so and i shant be afraid but we can get along somehow she added i have managed without a maid ever since i left home and poverty has no terrors for me     lxviii  general triscoe submitted to defeat with the patience which soldiers learn he did not submit amiably that would have been out of character and perhaps out of reason but burnamy and agatha were both so amiable that they supplied goodhumor for all they flaunted their rapture in her fathers face as little as they could but he may have found their serene satisfaction their settled confidence in their fate as hard to bear as a more boisterous happiness would have been  it was agreed among them all that they were to return soon to america and burnamy was to find some sort of literary or journalistic employment in new york she was much surer than he that this could be done with perfect ease but they were of an equal mind that general triscoe was not to be disturbed in any of his habits or vexed in the tenor of his living and until burnamy was at least selfsupporting there must be no talk of their being married  the talk of their being engaged was quite enough for the time it included complete and minute autobiographies on both sides reciprocal analyses of character a scientifically exhaustive comparison of tastes ideas and opinions a profound study of their respective chins noses eyes hands heights complexions moles and freckles with some account of their several friends  in this occupation which was profitably varied by the confession of what they had each thought and felt and dreamt concerning the other at every instant since they met they passed rapidly the days which the persistent anxiety of general triscoe interposed before the date of their leaving weimar for paris where it was arranged that they should spend a month before sailing for new york burnamy had a notion which agatha approved of trying for something there on the new yorkparis chronicle and if he got it they might not go home at once his gains from that paper had eked out his copyright from his book and had almost paid his expenses in getting the material which he had contributed to it they were not so great however but that his gold reserve was reduced to less than a hundred dollars counting the silver coinages which had remained to him in crossing and recrossing frontiers he was at times dimly conscious of his finances but he buoyantly disregarded the facts as incompatible with his status as agathas betrothed if not unworthy of his character as a lover in the abstract  the afternoon before they were to leave weimar they spent mostly in the garden before the grandducal museum in a conference so important that when it came on to rain at one moment they put up burnamys umbrella and continued to sit under it rather than interrupt the proceedings even to let agatha go back to the hotel and look after her fathers packing her own had been finished before dinner so as to leave her the whole afternoon for their conference and to allow her father to remain in undisturbed possession of his room as long as possible  what chiefly remained to be put into the generals trunk were his coats and trousers hanging in the closet and august took these down and carefully folded and packed them then to make sure that nothing had been forgotten agatha put a chair into the closet when she came in and stood on it to examine the shelf which stretched above the hooks  there seemed at first to be nothing on it and then there seemed to be something in the further corner which when it was tiptoed for proved to be a bouquet of flowers not so faded as to seem very old the blue satin ribbon which they were tied up with and which hung down half a yard was of entire freshness except far the dust of the shelf where it had lain  agatha backed out into the room with her find in her hand and examined it near to and then at arms length august stood by with a pair of the generals trousers lying across his outstretched hands and as agatha absently looked round at him she caught a light of intelligence in his eyes which changed her whole psychological relation to the withered bouquet till then it had been a lifeless meaningless bunch of flowers which some one for no motive had tossed up on that dusty shelf in the closet at augusts smile it became something else still she asked lightly enough was ist loss august  his smile deepened and broadened fur die andere he explained  agatha demanded in english what do you mean by feardy ondery  oddaw lehdy  other lady august nodded rejoicing in big success and agatha closed the door into her own room where the general had been put for the time so as to be spared the annoyance of the packing then she sat down with her hands in her lap and the bouquet in her hands now august she said very calmly i want you to tell meich wunsche sie zu mir sagenwhat other ladywass andere damethese flowers belonged todiese blumen gehorte zu verstehen sie  august nodded brightly and with german carefully adjusted to agathas capacity and with now and then a word or phrase of english he conveyed that before she and her herr father had appeared there had been in weimar another american fraulein with her frau mother they had not indeed staid in that hotel but had several times supped there with the young herr bornahmee who was occupying that room before her herr father the young herr had been much about with these american damen driving and walking with them and sometimes dining or supping with them at their hotel the elephant august had sometimes carried notes to them from the young herr and he had gone for the bouquet which the gracious fraulein was holding on the morning of the day that the american damen left by the train for hanover  august was much helped and encouraged throughout by the friendly intelligence of the gracious fraulein who smiled radiantly in clearing up one dim point after another and who now and then supplied the english analogues which he sought in his effort to render his german more luminous  at the end she returned to the work of packing in which she directed him and sometimes assisted him with her own hands having put the bouquet on the mantel to leave herself free she took it up again and carried it into her own room when she went with august to summon her father back to his she bade august say to the young herr if he saw him that she was going to sup with her father and august gave her message to burnamy whom he met on the stairs coming down as he was going up with their tray  agatha usually supped with her father but that evening burnamy was less able than usual to bear her absence in the hotel diningroom and he went up to a cafe in the town for his supper he did not stay long and when he returned his heart gave a joyful lift at sight of agatha looking out from her balcony as if she were looking for him he made her a gay flourishing bow lifting his hat high and she came down to meet him at the hotel door she had her hat on and jacket over one arm and she joined him at once for the farewell walk he proposed in what they had agreed to call their garden  she moved a little ahead of him and when they reached the place where they always sat she shifted her jacket to the other arm and uncovered the hand in which she had been carrying the withered bouquet here is something i found in your closet when i was getting papas things out  why what is it he asked innocently as he took it from her  a bouquet apparently she answered as he drew the long ribbons through his fingers and looked at the flowers curiously with his head aslant  where did you get it  on the shelf  it seemed a long time before burnamy said with a long sigh as of final recollection oh yes and then he said nothing and they did not sit down but stood looking at each other  was it something you got for me and forgot to give me she asked in a voice which would not have misled a woman but which did its work with the young man  he laughed and said well hardly the general has been in the room ever since you came  oh yes then perhaps somebody left it there before you had the room  burnamy was silent again but at last he said no i flung it up there i had forgotten all about it  and you wish me to forget about it too agatha asked in a gayety of tone that still deceived him  it would only be fair you made me he rejoined and there was something so charming in his words and way that she would have been glad to do it  but she governed herself against the temptation and said women are not good at forgetting at least till they know what  oh ill tell you if you want to know he said with a laugh and at the words shesank provisionally in their accustomed seat he sat down beside her but not so near as usual and he waited so long before he began that it seemed as if he had forgotten again why its nothing miss etkins and her mother were here before you came and this is a bouquet that i meant to give her at the train when she left but i decided i wouldnt and i threw it onto the shelf in the closet  may i ask why you thought of taking a bouquet to her at the train  well she and her motheri had been with them a good deal and i thought it would be civil  and why did you decide not to be civil  i didnt want it to look like more than civility  were they here long  about a week they left just after the marches came  agatha seemed not to heed the answer she had exacted she sat reclined in the corner of the seat with her head drooping after an interval which was long to burnamy she began to pull at a ring on the third finger of her left hand absently as if she did not know what she was doing but when she had got it off she held it towards burnamy and said quietly i think you had better have this again and then she rose and moved slowly and weakly away  he had taken the ring mechanically from her and he stood a moment bewildered then he pressed after her  agatha do youyou dont mean  yes she said without looking round at his face which she knew was close to her shoulder its over it isnt what youve done its what you are i believed in you in spite of what you did to that manand your coming back when you said you wouldntandbut i see now that what you did was you it was your nature and i cant believe in you any more  agatha he implored youre not going to be so unjust there was nothing between you and me when that girl was here i had a right to  not if you really cared for me do you think i would have flirted with any one so soon if i had cared for you as you pretended you did for me that night in carlsbad oh i dont say youre false but youre fickle  but im not fickle from the first moment i saw you i never cared for any one but you  you have strange ways of showing your devotion well say you are not fickle say that im fickle i am i have changed my mind i see that it would never do i leave you free to follow all the turning and twisting of your fancy she spoke rapidly almost breathlessly and she gave him no chance to get out the words that seemed to choke him she began to run but at the door of the hotel she stopped and waited till he came stupidly up i have a favor to ask mr burnamy i beg you will not see me again if you can help it before we go tomorrow my father and i are indebted to you for too many kindnesses and you mustnt take any more trouble on our account august can see us off in the morning  she nodded quickly and was gone indoors while he was yet struggling with his doubt of the reality of what had all so swiftly happened  general triscoe was still ignorant of any change in the status to which he had reconciled himself with so much difficulty when he came down to get into the omnibus for the train till then he had been too proud to ask what had become of burnamy though he had wondered but now he looked about and said impatiently i hope that young man isnt going to keep us waiting  agatha was pale and worn with sleeplessness but she said firmly he isnt going papa i will tell you in the train august will see to the tickets and the baggage  august conspired with the traeger to get them a firstclass compartment to themselves but even with the advantages of this seclusion agathas confidences to her father were not full she told her father that her engagement was broken for reasons that did not mean anything very wrong in mr burnamy but that convinced her they could never be happy together as she did not give the reasons he found a natural difficulty in accepting them and there was something in the situation which appealed strongly to his contrarymindedness partly from this partly from his sense of injury in being obliged so soon to adjust himself to new conditions and partly from his comfortable feeling of security from an engagement to which his assent had been forced he said i hope youre not making a mistake  oh no she answered and she attested her conviction by a burst of sobbing that lasted well on the way to the first stop of the train     lxix  it would have been always twice as easy to go direct from berlin to the hague through hanover but the marches decided to go by frankfort and the rhine because they wished to revisit the famous river which they remembered from their youth and because they wished to stop at dusseldorf where heinrich heine was born without this mrs march who kept her husband up to his early passion for the poet with a feeling that she was defending him from age in it said that their silver wedding journey would not be complete and he began himself to think that it would be interesting  they took a sleepingcar for frankfort and they woke early as people do in sleepingcars everywhere march dressed and went out for a cup of the same coffee of which sleepingcar buffets have the awful secret in europe as well as america and for a glimpse of the twilight landscape one gray little town towered and steepled and redroofed within its mediaeval walls looked as if it would have been warmer in something more there was a heavy dew if not a light frost over all and in places a pale fog began to lift from the low hills then the sun rose without dispersing the cold which was afterwards so severe in their room at the russischer hof in frankfort that in spite of the steamradiators they sat shivering in all their wraps till breakfasttime  there was no steam on in the radiators of course when they implored the portier for at least a lamp to warm their hands by he turned on all the electric lights without raising the temperature in the slightest degree amidst these modern comforts they were so miserable that they vowed each other to shun as long as they were in germany or at least while the summer lasted all hotels which were steamheated and electriclighted they heated themselves somewhat with their wrath and over their breakfast they relented so far as to suffer themselves a certain interest in the troops of all arms beginning to pass the hotel they were fragments of the great parade which had ended the day before and they were now drifting back to their several quarters of the empire many of them were very picturesque and they had for the boys and girls running before and beside them the charm which armies and circus processions have for children everywhere but their passage filled with cruel anxiety a large old dog whom his master had left harnessed to a milkcart before the hotel door from time to time he lifted up his voice and called to the absentee with hoarse deep barks that almost shook him from his feet  the day continued blue and bright and cold and the marches gave the morning to a rapid survey of the city glad that it was at least not wet what afterwards chiefly remained to them was the impression of an old town as quaint almost and as gothic as old hamburg and a new town handsome and regular and in the sudden arrest of some streets apparently overbuilt the modern architectural taste was of course parisian there is no other taste for the germans but in the prevailing absence of statues there was a relief from the most oppressive characteristic of the imperial capital which was a positive delight some sort of monument to the national victory over france there must have been but it must have been unusually inoffensive for it left no record of itself in the travellers consciousness they were aware of gardened squares and avenues bordered by stately dwellings of dignified civic edifices and of a vast and splendid railroad station such as the state builds even in minor european cities but such as our paternal corporations have not yet given us anywhere in america they went to the zoological garden where they heard the customary kalmucks at their public prayers behind a high board fence and as pilgrims from the most plutrocratic country in the world march insisted that they must pay their devoirs at the shrine of the rothschilds whose natal bankinghouse they revered from the outside  it was a pity he said that the rothschilds were not on his letter of credit he would have been willing to pay tribute to the genius of finance in the percentage on at least ten pounds but he consoled himself by reflecting that he did not need the money and he consoled mrs march for their failure to penetrate to the interior of the rothschilds birthplace by taking her to see the house where goethe was born the public is apparently much more expected there and in the friendly place they were no doubt much more welcome than they would have been in the rothschild house under that roof they renewed a happy moment of weimar which after the lapse of a week seemed already so remote they wondered as they mounted the stairs from the basement opening into a clean little court how burnamy was getting on and whether it had yet come to that understanding between him and agatha which mrs march at least had meant to be inevitable then they became part of some such sightseeing retinue as followed the custodian about in the goethe horse in weimar and of an emotion indistinguishable from that of their fellow sightseers they could make sure afterwards of a personal pleasure in a certain prescient classicism of the house it somehow recalled both the goethe houses at weimar and it somehow recalled italy it is a separate house of two floors above the entrance which opens to a little court or yard and gives access by a decent stairway to the livingrooms the chief of these is a sufficiently dignified parlor or salon and the most important is the little chamber in the third story where the poet first opened his eyes to the light which he rejoiced in for so long a life and which dying he implored to be with him more it is as large as his deathchamber in weimar where he breathed this prayer and it looks down into the italianlooking court where probably he noticed the world for the first time and thought it a paved enclosure thirty or forty feet square in the birthroom they keep his puppet theatre and the place is fairly suggestive of his childhood later in his youth he could look from the parlor windows and see the house where his earliest love dwelt so much remains of goethe in the place where he was born and as such things go it is not a little the house is that of a prosperous and wellplaced citizen and speaks of the senatorial quality in his family which heine says he was fond of recalling rather than the sartorial quality of the ancestor who again as heine says mended the republics breeches  from the goethe house one drives by the goethe monument to the romer the famous townhall of the old free imperial city which frankfort once was and by this route the marches drove to it agreeing with their coachman that he was to keep as much in the sun as possible it was still so cold that when they reached the romer and he stopped in a broad blaze of the only means of heating that they have in frankfort in the summer the travellers were loath to leave it for the chill interior where the german emperors were elected for so many centuries as soon as an emperor was chosen in the great hall effigied round with the portraits of his predecessors he hurried out in the balcony ostensibly to show himself to the people but really march contended to warm up a little in the sun the balcony was undergoing repairs that day and the travellers could not go out on it but under the spell of the historic interest of the beautiful old gothic place they lingered in the interior till they were halftorpid with the cold then she abandoned to him the joint duty of viewing the cathedral and hurried to their carriage where she basked in the sun till he came to her he returned shivering after a halfhours absence and pretended that she had missed the greatest thing in the world but as he could never be got to say just what she had lost and under the closest crossexamination could not prove that this cathedral was memorably different from hundreds of other fourteenthcentury cathedrals she remained in a lasting content with the easier part she had chosen his only definite impression at the cathedral seemed to be confined to a bostonian of gloomily correct type whom he had seen doing it with his baedeker and not letting an object of interest escape and his account of her fellowtownsman reconciled mrs march more and more to not having gone  as it was warmer outdoors than indoors at frankfort and as the breadth of sunshine increased with the approach of noon they gave the rest of the morning to driving about and ignorantly enjoying the outside of many gothic churches whose names even they did not trouble themselves to learn they liked the river main whenever they came to it because it was so lately from wurzburg and because it was so beautiful with its bridges old and new and its boats of many patterns they liked the marketplace in front of the romer not only because it was full of fascinating bargains in curious crockery and woodenware but because there was scarcely any shade at all in it they read from their baedeker that until the end of the last century no jew was suffered to enter the marketplace and they rejoiced to find from all appearances that the jews had been making up for their unjust exclusion ever since they were almost as numerous there as the anglosaxons were everywhere else in frankfort these both of the english and american branches of the race prevailed in the hotel diningroom where the marches had a midday dinner so good that it almost made amends for the steamheating and electriclighting  as soon as possible after dinner they took the train for mayence and ran rhinewards through a pretty country into what seemed a milder climate it grew so much milder apparently that a lady in their compartment to whom march offered his forwardlooking seat ordered the window down when the guard came without asking their leave then the climate proved much colder and mrs march cowered under her shawls the rest of the way and would not be entreated to look at the pleasant level landscape near or the hills far off he proposed to put up the window as peremptorily as it had been put down but she stayed him with a hoarse whisper she may be another baroness at first he did not know what she meant then he remembered the lady whose claims to rank her presence had so poorly enforced on the way to wurzburg and he perceived that his wife was practising a wise forbearance with their fellowpassengers and giving her a chance to turn out any sort of highhote she chose she failed to profit by the opportunity she remained simply a selfish disagreeable woman of no more perceptible distinction than their other fellowpassenger a little commercial traveller from vienna they resolved from his appearance and the lettering on his valise that he was no other who slept with a sort of passionate intensity all the way to mayence     lxx  the main widened and swam fuller as they approached the rhine and flooded the lowlying fields inplaces with a pleasant effect under a wet sunset when they reached the station in mayence they drove interminably to the hotel they had chosen on the rivershore through a city handsomer and cleaner than any american city they could think of and great part of the way by a street of dwellings nobler mrs march owned than even commonwealth avenue in boston it was planted like that with double rows of trees but lacked its green lawns and at times the sign of weinhandlung at a corner betrayed that there was no such restriction against shops as keeps the boston street so sacred otherwise they had to confess once more that any inferior city of germany is of a more proper and dignified presence than the most parseproud metropolis in america to be sure they said the german towns had generally a thousand years start but all the same the fact galled them  it was very bleak though very beautiful when they stopped before their hotel on the rhine where all their impalpable memories of their visit to mayence thirty years earlier precipitated themselves into something tangible there were the reaches of the storied and fabled stream with its boats and bridges and wooded shores and islands there were the spires and towers and roofs of the town on either bank crowding to the rivers brink and there withindoors was the stately portier in gold braid and the smiling bowing handrubbing landlord alluring them to his most expensive rooms which so late in the season he would fain have had them take but in a little elevator that mounted slowly very slowly in the curve of the stairs they went higher to something lower and the landlord retired baked and left them to the ministrations of the servingmen who arrived with their large and small baggage all these retired in turn when they asked to have a fire lighted in the stove without which mrs march would never have taken the fine stately rooms and sent back a pretty young girl to do it she came indignant not because she had come lugging a heavy hod of coal and a great armload of wood but because her sense of fitness was outraged by the strange demand  what she cried a fire in september  yes march returned inspired to miraculous aptness in his german by the exigency yes if september is cold  the girl looked at him and then either because she thought him mad or liked him merry burst into a loud laugh and kindled the fire without a word more  he lighted all the reluctant gasjets in the vast gilt chandelier and in less than half an hour the temperature of the place rose to at least sixtyfive fahrenheit with every promise of going higher mrs march made herself comfortable in a deep chair before the stove and said she would have her supper there and she bade him send her just such a supper of chicken and honey and tea as they had all had in mayence when they supped in her aunts parlor there all those years ago he wished to compute the years but she drove him out with an imploring cry and he went down to a very gusty diningroom on the groundfloor where he found himself alone with a young english couple and their little boy they were friendly intelligent people and would have been conversable apparently but for the terrible cold of the husband which he said he had contracted at the manoeuvres in hombourg march said he was going to holland and the englishman was doubtful of the warmth which march expected to find there he seemed to be suffering from a suspense of faith as to the warmth anywhere from time to time the door of the diningroom selfopened in a silent ghostly fashion into the court without and let in a chilling draught about the legs of all till the little english boy got down from his place and shut it  he alone continued cheerful for marchs spirits certainly did not rise when some mumbling americans came in and muttered over their meat at another table he hated to own it but he had to own that wherever he had met the two branches of the anglosaxon race together in europe the elder had shown by a superior chirpiness to the disadvantage of the younger the cast clothes of the oldfashioned british offishness seemed to have fallen to the american travellers who were trying to be correct and exemplary and he would almost rather have had back the oldstyle bragging americans whom he no longer saw he asked of an agreeable fellowcountryman whom he found later in the readingroom what had become of these and this compatriot said he had travelled with one only the day before who had posed before their whole compartment in his scorn of the german landscape the german weather the german government the german railway management and then turned out an american of german birth march found his wife in great bodily comfort when he went back to her but in trouble of mind about a clock which she had discovered standing on the lacquered iron top of the stove it was a french clock of architectural pretensions in the taste of the first empire and it looked as if it had not been going since napoleon occupied mayence early in the century but mrs march now had it sorely on her conscience where in its danger from the heat of the stove it rested with the weight of the pantheon whose classic form it recalled she wondered that no one had noticed it before the fire was kindled and she required her husband to remove it at once from the top of the stove to the mantel under the mirror which was the natural habitat of such a clock he said nothing could be simpler but when he lifted it it began to fall all apart like a clock in the house of the hoodoo its marble base droppedoff its pillars tottered its pediment swayed to one side while mrs march lamented her hard fate and implored him to hurry it together before any one came he contrived to reconstruct it in its new place then they both breathed freer and returned to sit down before the stove but at the same moment they both saw ineffaceably outlined on the lacquered top the basal form of the clock the chambermaid would see it in the morning she would notice the removal of the clock and would make a merit of reporting its ruin by the heat to the landlord and in the end they would be mulcted of its value rather than suffer this wrong they agreed to restore it to its place and let it go to destruction upon its own terms march painfully rebuilt it where he had found it and they went to bed with a bad conscience to worse dreams  he remembered before he slept the hour of his youth when he was in mayence before and was so care free that he had heard with impersonal joy two young american voices speaking english in the street under his window one of them broke from the common talk with a gay burlesque of pathos in the line       oh heavens she cried my heeding country save  and then with a laughing goodnight these unseen unknown spirits of youth parted and departed who were they and in what different places with what cares or ills had their joyous voices grown old or fallen silent for evermore it was a moonlight night march remembered and he remembered how he wished he were out in it with those merry fellows  he nursed the memory and the wonder in his dreaming thought and he woke early to other voices under his window but now the voices though young were many and were german and the march of feet and the stamp of hooves kept time with their singing he drew his curtain and saw the street filled with broken squads of men some afoot and some on horseback some in uniform and some in civil dress with students caps loosely straggling on and roaring forth that song whose words he could not make out at breakfast he asked the waiter what it all meant and he said that these were conscripts whose service had expired with the late manoeuvres and who were now going home he promised march a translation of the song but he never gave it and perhaps the sense of their joyful homegoing remained the more poetic with him because its utterance remained inarticulate  march spent the rainy sunday on which they had fallen in wandering about the little city alone his wife said she was tired and would sit by the fire and hear about mayence when he came in he went to the cathedral which has its renown for beauty and antiquity and he there added to his stock of useful information the fact that the people of mayence seemed very catholic and very devout they proved it by preferring to any of the divine old gothic shrines in the cathedral an ugly baroque altar which was everywhere hung about with votive offerings a fashionably dressed young man and young girl sprinkled themselves with holy water as reverently as if they had been old and ragged some tourists strolled up and down the aisles with their red guidebooks and studied the objects of interest a resplendent beadle in a cocked hat and with along staff of authority posed before his own ecclesiastical consciousness in blue and silver at the high altar a priest was saying mass and march wondered whether his consciousness was as wholly ecclesiastical as the beadles or whether somewhere in it he felt the historical majesty the long human consecration of the place  he wandered at random in the town through streets german and quaint and old and streets french and fine and new and got back to the river which he crossed on one of the several handsome bridges the rough river looked chill under a sky of windy clouds and he felt out of season both as to the summer travel and as to the journey he was making the summer of life as well as the summer of that year was past better return to his own radiator in his flat on stuyvesant square to the great ugly brutal town which if it was not home to him was as much home to him as to any one a longing for new york welled up his heart which was perhaps really a wish to be at work again he said he must keep this from his wife who seemed not very well and whom he must try to cheer up when he returned to the hotel  but they had not a very joyous afternoon and the evening was no gayer they said that if they had not ordered their letters sent to dusseldorf they believed they should push on to holland without stopping and march would have liked to ask why not push on to america but he forbore and he was afterwards glad that he had done so  in the morning their spirits rose with the sun though the sun got up behind clouds as usual and they were further animated by the imposition which the landlord practised upon them after a distinct and repeated agreement as to the price of their rooms he charged them twice as much and then made a merit of throwing off two marks out of the twenty he had plundered them of  now i see said mrs march on their way down to the boat how fortunate it was that we baked his clock you may laugh but i believe we were the instruments of justice  do you suppose that clock was never baked before asked her husband the landlord has his own arrangement with justice when he overcharges his parting guests he says to his conscience well they baked my clock     lxxi  the morning was raw but it was something not to have it rainy and the clouds that hung upon the hills and hid their tops were at least as fine as the long board signs advertising chocolate on the river banks the smoke rising from the chimneys of the manufactories of mayence was not so bad either when one got them in the distance a little and march liked the way the river swam to the stems of the trees on the low grassy shores it was like the mississippi between st louis and cairo in that and it was yellow and thick like the mississippi though he thought he remembered it blue and clear a friendly german of those who began to come aboard more and more at all the landings after leaving mayence assured him that he was right and that the rhine was unusually turbid from the unusual rains march had his own belief that whatever the color of the rhine might be the rains were not unusual but he could not gainsay the friendly german  most of the passengers at starting were english and american but they showed no prescience of the international affinition which has since realized itself in their behavior toward one another they held silently apart and mingled only in the effect of one young man who kept the marches in perpetual question whether he was a bostonian or an englishman his look was bostonian but his accent was english and was he a bostonian who had been in england long enough to get the accent or was he an englishman who had been in boston long enough to get the look he wore a belated straw hat and a thin sackcoat and in the rush of the boat through the raw air they fancied him very cold and longed to offer him one of their superabundant wraps at times march actually lifted a shawl from his knees feeling sure that the stranger was english and that he might make so bold with him then at some glacial glint in the young mans eye or at some petrific expression of his delicate face he felt that he was a bostonian and lost courage and let the shawl sink again march tried to forget him in the wonder of seeing the germans begin to eat and drink as soon as they came on boards either from the baskets they had brought with them or from the boats provision but he prevailed with his smile that was like a sneer through all the events of the voyage and took marchs mind off the scenery with a sudden wrench when he came unexpectedly into view after a momentary disappearance at the table dhote which was served when the landscape began to be less interesting the guests were expected to hand their plates across the table to the stewards but to keep their knives and forks throughout the different courses and at each of these partial changes march felt the young mans chilly eyes upon him inculpating him for the semicivilization of the management at such times he knew that he was a bostonian  the weather cleared as they descended the river and under a sky at last cloudless the marches had moments of swift reversion to their former rhine journey when they were young and the purple light of love mantled the vineyarded hills along the shore and flushed the castled steeps the scene had lost nothing of the beauty they dimly remembered there were certain features of it which seemed even fairer and grander than they remembered the town of bingen where everybody who knows the poem was more or less born was beautiful in spite of its factory chimneys though there were no compensating castles near it and the castles seemed as good as those of the theatre here and there some of them had been restored and were occupied probably by robber barons who had gone into trade others were still ruinous and there was now and then such a mere gray snag that march at sight of it involuntarily put his tongue to the broken tooth which he was keeping for the skill of the first american dentist  for natural sublimity the rhine scenery as they recognized once more does not compare with the hudson scenery and they recalled one point on the american river where the central road tunnels a jutting cliff which might very well pass for the rock of the loreley where she dreams       solo sitting by the shores of old romance  and the trains run in and out under her knees unheeded still still you know march argued this is the loreley on the rhine and not the loreley on the hudson and i suppose that makes all the difference besides the rhine doesnt set up to be sublime it only means to be storied and dreamy and romantic and it does it and then we have really got no mouse tower we might build one to be sure  well we have got no denkmal either said his wife meaning the national monument to the german reconquest of the rhine which they had just passed and that is something in our favor  it was too far off for us to see how ugly it was he returned  the denkmal at coblenz was so near that the bronze emperor almost rode aboard the boat  he could not answer such a piece of logic as that he yielded and began to praise the orcharded levels which now replaced the vinepurpled slopes of the upper river he said they put him in mind of orchards that he had known in his boyhood and they agreed that the supreme charm of travel after all was not in seeing something new and strange but in finding something familiar and dear in the heart of the strangeness  at cologne they found this in the tumult of getting ashore with their baggage and driving from the steamboat landing to the railroad station where they were to get their train for dusseldorf an hour later the station swarmed with travellers eating and drinking and smoking but they escaped from it for a precious half of their golden hour and gave the time to the great cathedral which was built a thousand years ago just round the corner from the station and is therefore very handy to it since they saw the cathedral last it had been finished and now under a cloudless evening sky it soared and swept upward like a pale flame within it was a bit overclean a bit bare but without it was one of the great memories of the race the record of a faith which wrought miracles of beauty at least if not piety  the train gave the marches another and last view of it as they slowly drew out of the city and began to run through a level country walled with faroff hills past fields of buckwheat showing their stems like coral under their black tops past peasant houses changing their wonted shape to taller and narrower forms past sluggish streams from which the mist rose and hung over the meadows under a red sunset glassy clear till the manifold factory chimneys of dusseldorf stained it with their dun smoke  this industrial greeting seemed odd from the town where heinrich heine was born but when they had eaten their supper in the capital little hotel they found there and went out for a stroll they found nothing to remind them of the factories and much to make them think of the poet the moon beautiful and perfect as a stage moon came up over the shoulder of a church as they passed down a long street which they had all to themselves everybody seemed to have gone to bed but at a certain corner a girl opened a window above them and looked out at the moon  when they returned to their hotel they found a highwalled garden facing it full of black depths of foliage in the night march woke and saw the moon standing over the garden and silvering its leafy tops this was really as it should be in the town where the idolized poet of his youth was born the poet whom of all others he had adored and who had once seemed like a living friend who had been witness of his first love and had helped him to speak it his wife used to laugh at him for his heineworship in those days but she had since come to share it and she even more than he had insisted upon this pilgrimage he thought long thoughts of the past as he looked into the garden across the way with an ache for his perished self and the dead companionship of his youth all ghosts together in the silvered shadow the trees shuddered in the night breeze and its chill penetrated to him where he stood  his wife called to him from her room what are you doing  oh sentimentalizing he answered boldly  well you will be sick she said and he crept back into bed again  they had sat up late talking in a glad excitement but he woke early as an elderly man is apt to do after broken slumbers and left his wife still sleeping he was not so eager for the poetic interests of the town as he had been the night before he even deferred his curiosity for heines birthhouse to the instructive conference which he had with his waiter at breakfast after all was not it more important to know something of the actual life of a simple common class of men than to indulge a faded fancy for the memory of a genius which no amount of associations could feed again to its former bloom the waiter said he was a nuremberger and had learned english in london where he had served a year for nothing afterwards when he could speak three languages he got a pound a week which seemed low for so many though not so low as the one mark a day which he now received in dusseldorf in berlin he paid the hotel two marks a day march confided to him his secret trouble as to tips and they tried vainly to enlighten each other as to what a just tip was  he went to his bankers and when he came back he found his wife with her breakfast eaten and so eager for the exploration of heines birthplace that she heard with indifference of his failure to get any letters it was too soon to expect them she said and then she showed him her plan which she had been working out ever since she woke it contained every place which heine had mentioned and she was determined not one should escape them she examined him sharply upon his condition accusing him of having taken cold when he got up in the night and acquitting him with difficulty she herself was perfectly well but a little fagged and they must have a carriage  they set out in a lordly twospanner which took up half the little bolkerstrasse where heine was born when they stopped across the way from his birthhouse so that she might first take it all in from the outside before they entered it it is a simple street and not the cleanest of the streets in a town where most of them are rather dirty below the houses are shops and the first story of heines house is a butcher shop with sides of pork and mutton hanging in the windows above where the heine family must once have lived a goldbeater and a framemaker displayed their signs  but did the heine family really once live there the house looked so fresh and new that in spite of the tablet in its front affirming it the poets birthplace they doubted and they were not reassured by the people who half halted as they passed and stared at the strangers so anomalously interested in the place they dismounted and crossed to the butcher shop where the provision man corroborated the tablet but could not understand their wish to go up stairs he did not try to prevent them however and they climbed to the first floor above where a placard on the door declared it private and implored them not to knock was this the outcome of the inmates despair from the intrusion of other pilgrims who had wised to see the heine dwellingrooms they durst not knock and ask so much and they sadly descended to the groundfloor where they found a butcher boy of much greater apparent intelligence than the butcher himself who told them that the building in front was as new as it looked and the house where heine was really born was the old house in the rear he showed them this house across a little court patched with mangy grass and lilacbushes and when they wished to visit it he led the way the place was strewn both underfoot and overhead with feathers it had once been all a garden out to the street the boy said but from these feathers as well as the odor which prevailed and the anxious behavior of a few hens left in the high coop at one side it was plain that what remained of the garden was now a chicken slaughteryard there was one wellgrown tree and the boy said it was of the poets time but when he let them into the house he became vague as to the room where heine was born it was certain only that it was somewhere upstairs and that it could not be seen the room where they stood was the framemakers shop and they bought of him a small frame for a memorial they bought of the butchers boy not so commercially a branch of lilac and they came away thinking how much amused heine himself would have been with their visit how sadly how merrily he would have mocked at their effort to revere his birthplace  they were too old if not too wise to be daunted by their defeat and they drove next to the old court garden beside the rhine where the poet says he used to play with the little veronika and probably did not at any rate the garden is gone the schloss was burned down long ago and nothing remains but a detached tower in which the good elector jan wilhelm of heines time amused himself with his many mechanical inventions the tower seemed to be in process of demolition but an intelligent workman who came down out of it was interested in the strangers curiosity and directed them to a place behind the historical museum where they could find a bit of the old garden it consisted of two or three low trees and under them the statue of the elector by which heine sat with the little veronika if he really did afresh gale blowing through the trees stirred the bushes that backed the statue but not the laurel wreathing the electors head and meeting in a neat point over his forehead the laurel wreath is stone like the rest of the elector who stands there smirking in marble ermine and armor and resting his baton on the nose of a very small lion who in the exigencies of foreshortening obligingly goes to nothing but a tail under the electors robe  this was a prince who loved himself in effigy so much that he raised an equestrian statue to his own renown in the marketplace though he modestly refused the credit of it and ascribed its erection to the affection of his subjects you see him therein a fullbottomed wig mounted on a rampant charger with a tail as big round as a barrel and heavy enough to keep him from coming down on his fore legs as long as he likes to hold them up it was to this horses back that heine clambered when a small boy to see the french take formal possession of dusseldorf and he clung to the waist of the bronze elector who had just abdicated while the burgomaster made a long speech from the balcony of the rathhaus and the electoral arms were taken down from its doorway  the rathhaus is a saladdressing of german gothic and french rococo as to its architectural style and is charming in its way but the marches were in the marketplace for the sake of that moment of heines boyhood they felt that he might have been the boy who stopped as he ran before them and smacked the stomach of a large pumpkin lying at the feet of an old marketwoman and then dashed away before she could frame a protest against the indignity from this incident they philosophized that the boys of dusseldorf are as mischievous at the end of the century as they were at the beginning and they felt the fascination that such a bounteous unkempt old marketplace must have for the boys of any period there were magnificent vegetables of all sorts in it and if the fruits were meagre that was the fault of the rainy summer perhaps the marketplace was very dirty and so was the narrow street leading down from it to the rhine which ran swift as a mountain torrent along a slatternly quay a bridge of boats crossing the stream shook in the rapid current and a long procession of market carts passed slowly over while a cluster of scows waited in picturesque patience for the draw to open  they saw what a beautiful town that was for a boy to grow up in and how many privileges it offered how many dangers how many chances for hairbreadth escapes they chose that heine must often have rushed shrieking joyfully down that foul alley to the rhine with other boys and they easily found a leafstrewn stretch of the sluggish dussel in the public garden where his playmate the little wilhelm lost his life and saved the kittens they were not so sure of the avenue through which the poet saw the emperor napoleon come riding on his small white horse when he took possession of the electors dominions but if it was that where the statue of the kaiser wilhelm i comes riding on a horse led by two victories both poet and hero are avenged there on the accomplished fact defeated and humiliated france triumphs in the badness of that foolish denkmal one of the worst in all denkmalridden germany and the memory of the singer whom the hohenzollern family pride forbids honor in his native place is immortal in its presence  on the way back to their hotel march made some reflections upon the open neglect throughout germany of the greatest german lyrist by which the poet might have profited if he had been present he contended that it was not altogether an effect of hohenzollern pride which could not suffer a joke or two from the archhumorist but that heine had said things of germany herself which germans might well have found unpardonable he concluded that it would not do to be perfectly frank with ones own country though to be sure there would always be the question whether the jewborn heine had even a stepfatherland in the germany he loved so tenderly and mocked so pitilessly he had to own that if he were a negro poet he would not feel bound to measure terms in speaking of america and he would not feel that his fame was in her keeping  upon the whole he blamed heine less than germany and he accused her of taking a shabby revenge in trying to forget him in the heat of his resentment that there should be no record of heine in the city where he was born march came near ignoring himself the fact that the poet freiligrath was also born there as for the famous dusseldorf school of painting which once filled the world with the worst art he rejoiced that it was now so dead and he grudged the glance which the beauty of the new art academy extorted from him it is in the french taste and is so far a monument to the continuance in one sort of that french supremacy of which in another sort another denkmal celebrates the overthrow dusseldorf is not content with the denkmal of the kaiser on horseback with the two victories for grooms there is a second which the marches found when they strolled out again late in the afternoon it is in the lovely park which lies in the heart of the city and they felt in its presence the only emotion of sympathy which the many patriotic monuments of germany awakened in them it had dignity and repose which these never had elsewhere but it was perhaps not so much for the dying warrior and the pitying lion of the sculpture that their hearts were moved as for the gentle and mournful humanity of the inscription which dropped into equivalent english verse in marchs notebook     fame was enough for the victors and glory and verdurous laurel    tears by their mothers wept founded this image of stone  to this they could forgive the vaunting record on the reverse of the german soldiers who died heroes in the war with france the war with austria and even the war with poor little denmark  the morning had been bright and warm and it was just that the afternoon should be dim and cold with a pale sun looking through a september mist which seemed to deepen the seclusion and silence of the forest reaches for the park was really a forest of the german sort as parks are apt to be in germany but it was beautiful and they strayed through it and sometimes sat down on the benches in its damp shadows and said how much seemed to be done in germany for the peoples comfort and pleasure in what was their own explicitly as well as what was tacitly theirs they were not so restricted as we were at home and especially the children seemed made fondly and lovingly free of all public things the marches met troops of them in the forest as they strolled slowly back by the winding dussel to the gardened avenue leading to the park and they found them everywhere gay and joyful but their elders seemed subdued and were silent the strangers heard no sound of laughter in the streets of dusseldorf and they saw no smiling except on the part of a very old couple whose meeting they witnessed and who grinned and cackled at each other like two children as they shook hands perhaps they were indeed children of that sad second childhood which one would rather not blossom back into  in america life is yet a joke with us even when it is grotesque and shameful as it so often is for we think we can make it right when we choose but there is no joking in germany between the first and second childhoods unless behind closed doors even there people do not joke above their breath about kings and emperors if they joke about them in print they take out their laugh in jail for the press laws are severely enforced and the prisons are full of able editors serious as well as comic lesemajesty is a crime that searches sinners out in every walk of life and it is said that in family jars a husband sometimes has the last word of his wife by accusing her of blaspheming the sovereign and so having her silenced for three months at least behind penitential bars  think said march how simply i could adjust any differences of opinion between us in dusseldorf  dont his wife implored with a burst of feeling which surprised him i want to go home  they had been talking over their day and planning their journey to holland for the morrow when it came to this outburst from her in the last halfhour before bed which they sat prolonging beside their stove  what and not go to holland what is to become of my aftercure  oh its too late for that now weve used up the month running about and tiring ourselves to death i should like to rest a weekto get into my berth on the norumbia and rest  i guess the september gales would have something to say about that  i would risk the september gales     lxxii  in the morning march came home from his bankers gay with the days provisional sunshine in his heart and joyously expectant of his wifes pleasure in the letters he was bringing there was one from each of their children and there was one from fulkerson which march opened and read on the street so as to intercept any unpleasant news there might be in them there were two letters for mrs march which he knew without opening were from miss triscoe and mrs adding respectively mrs addings from the postmarks seemed to have been following them about for some time  theyre all right at home he said do see what those people have been doing  i believe she said taking a knife from the breakfast tray beside her bed to cut the envelopes that youve really cared more about them all along than i have  no ive only been anxious to be done with them  she got the letters open and holding one of them up in each hand she read them impartially and simultaneously then she flung them both down and turned her face into her pillow with an impulse of her inalienable girlishness well it is too silly  march felt authorized to take them up and read them consecutively when he had done so he did not differ from his wife in one case agatha had written to her dear mrs march that she and burnamy had just that evening become engaged mrs adding on her part owned a farther step and announced her marriage to mr kenby following immemorial usage in such matters kenby had added a postscript affirming his happiness in unsparing terms and in agathas letter there was an avowal of like effect from burnamy agatha hinted her belief that her father would soon come to regard burnamy as she did and mrs adding professed a certain humiliation in having realized that after all her misgiving about him rose seemed rather relieved than otherwise as if he were glad to have her off his hands  well said march with these troublesome affairs settled i dont see what there is to keep us in europe any longer unless its the consensus of opinion in tom bella and fulkerson that we ought to stay the winter  stay the winter mrs march rose from her pillow and clutched the home letters to her from the abeyance in which they had fallen on the coverlet while she was dealing with the others what do you mean  it seems to have been prompted by a hint you let drop which tom has passed to bella and fulkerson  oh but that was before we left carlsbad she protested while she devoured the letters with her eyes and continued to denounce the absurdity of the writers her son and daughter both urged that now their father and mother were over there they had better stay as long as they enjoyed it and that they certainly ought not to come home without going to italy where they had first met and revisiting the places which they had seen together when they were young engaged people without that their silver wedding journey would not be complete her son said that everything was going well with every other week and both himself and mr fulkerson thought his father ought to spend the winter in italy and get a thorough rest make a job of it march fulkerson wrote and have a sabbatical year while youre at it you may not get another  well i can tell them said mrs march indignantly we shall not do anything of the kind  then you didnt mean it  mean it she stopped herself with a look at her husband and asked gently do you want to stay  well i dont know he answered vaguely the fact was he was sick of travel and of leisure he was longing to be at home and at work again but if there was to be any selfsacrifice which could be had as it were at a bargain which could be fairly divided between them and leave him the self and her the sacrifice he was too experienced a husband not to see the advantage of it or to refuse the merit i thought you wished to stay  yes she sighed i did it has been very very pleasant and if anything i have overenjoyed myself we have gone romping through it like two young people havent we  you have he assented i have always felt the weight of my years in getting the baggage registered they have made the baggage weigh more every time  and ive forgotten mine yes i have but the years havent forgotten me basil and now i remember them im tired it doesnt seem as if i could ever get up but i dare say its only a mood it may be only a cold and if you wish to stay whywe will think it over  no we wont my dear he said with a generous shame for his hypocrisy if not with a pure generosity ive got all the good out of it that there was in it for me and i shouldnt go home any better six months hence than i should now italy will keep for another time and so for the matter of that will holland  no no she interposed we wont give up holland whatever we do i couldnt go home feeling that i had kept you out of your aftercure and when we get there no doubt the sea air will bring me up so that i shall want to go to italy too again though it seems so far off now but go and see when the afternoon train for the hague leaves and i shall be ready my minds quite made up on that point  what a bundle of energy said her husband laughing down at her  he went and asked about the train to the hague but only to satisfy a superficial conscience for now he knew that they were both of one mind about going home he also looked up the trains for london and found that they could get there by way of ostend in fourteen hours then he went back to the bankers and with the help of the parisnew york chronicle which he found there he got the sailings of the first steamers home after that he strolled about the streets for a last impression of dusseldorf but it was rather blurred by the constantly recurring pull of his thoughts toward america and he ended by turning abruptly at a certain corner and going to his hotel  he found his wife dressed but fallen again on her bed beside which her breakfast stood still untasted her smile responded wanly to his brightness im not well my dear she said i dont believe i could get off to the hague this afternoon  could you to liverpool he returned  to liverpool she gasped what do you mean  merely that the cupania is sailing on the twentieth and ive telegraphed to know if we can get a room im afraid it wont be a good one but shes the first boat out and  no indeed we wont go to liverpool and we will never go home till youve had your aftercure in holland she was very firm in this but she added we will stay another night here and go to the hague tomorrow sit down and let us talk it over where were we  she lay down on the sofa and he put a shawl over her we were just starting for liverpool  no no we werent dont say such things dearest i want you to help me sum it all up you think its been a success dont you  as a cure  no as a silver wedding journey  perfectly howling  i do think weve had a good time i never expected to enjoy myself so much again in the world i didnt suppose i should ever take so much interest in anything it shows that when we choose to get out of our rut we shall always find life as fresh and delightful as ever there is nothing to prevent our coming any year now that toms shown himself so capable and having another silver wedding journey i dont like to think of its being confined to germany quite  oh i dont know we can always talk of it as our germansilver wedding journey  thats true but nobody would understand nowadays what you meant by germansilver its perfectly gone out how ugly it was a sort of greasy yellowish stuff always getting worn through i believe it was made worn through aunt mary had a castor of it that i can remember when i was a child it went into the kitchen long before i grew up would a joke like that console you for the loss of italy  it would go far to do it and as a germansilver wedding journey its certainly been very complete  what do you mean  its given us a representative variety of german cities first we had hamburg you know a great modern commercial centre  yes go on  then we had leipsic the academic  yes  then carlsbad the supreme type of a german health resort then nuremberg the mediaeval then anspach the extinct princely capital then wurzburg the ecclesiastical rococo then weimar for the literature of a great epoch then imperial berlin then frankfort the memory of the old free city then dusseldorf the centre of the most poignant personal interest in the worldi dont see how we could have done better if wed planned it all and not acted from successive impulses  its been grand its been perfect as germansilver wedding journey its perfectit seems as if it had been ordered but i will never let you give up holland no we will go this afternoon and when i get to schevleningen ill go to bed and stay there till youve completed your aftercure  do you think that will be wildly gay for the convalescent  she suddenly began to cry oh dearest what shall we do i feel perfectly broken down im afraid im going to be sickand away from home how could you ever let me overdo so she put her handkerchief to her eyes and turned her face into the sofa pillow  this was rather hard upon him whom her vivid energy and inextinguishable interest had not permitted a moments respite from pleasure since they left carlsbad but he had been married too long not to understand that her blame of him was only a form of selfreproach for her own selfforgetfulness she had not remembered that she was no longer young till she had come to what he saw was a nervous collapse the fact had its pathos and its poetry which no one could have felt more keenly than he if it also had its inconvenience and its danger he realized these too  isabel he said we are going home  very well then it will be your doing  quite do you think you could stand it as far as cologne we get the sleepingcar there and you can lie down the rest of the way to ostend  this afternoon why im perfectly strong its merely my nerves that are gone she sat up and wiped her eyes but basil if youre doing this for me  im doing it for myself said march as he went out of the room  she stood the journey perfectly well and in the passage to dover she suffered so little from the rough weather that she was an example to many robust matrons who filled the ladies cabin with the noise of their anguish during the night she would have insisted upon taking the first train up to london if march had not represented that this would not expedite the sailing of the cupania and that she might as well stay the forenoon at the convenient railway hotel and rest it was not quite his ideal of repose that the first people they saw in the coffeeroom when they went to breakfast should be kenby and rose adding who were having their tea and toast and eggs together in the greatest apparent goodfellowship he saw his wife shrink back involuntarily from the encounter but this was only to gather force for it and the next moment she was upon them in all the joy of the surprise then march allowed himself to be as glad as the others both seemed and he shook hands with kenby while his wife kissed rose and they all talked at once in the confusion of tongues it was presently intelligible that mrs kenby was going to be down in a few minutes and kenby took march into his confidence with a smile which was almost a wink in explaining that he knew how it was with the ladies he said that rose and he usually got down to breakfast first and when he had listened inattentively to mrs marchs apology for being on her way home he told her that she was lucky not to have gone to schevleningen where she and march would have frozen to death he said that they were going to spend september at a little place on the english coast near by where he had been the day before with rose to look at lodgings and where you could bathe all through the month he was not surprised that the marches were going home and said well that was their original plan wasnt it  mrs kenby appearing upon this pretended to know better after the outburst of joyful greeting with the marches and intelligently reminded kenby that he knew the marches had intended to pass the winter in paris she was looking extremely pretty but she wished only to make them see how well rose was looking and she put her arm round his shoulders as she spoke schevleningen had done wonders for him but it was fearfully cold there and now they were expecting everything from westgate where she advised march to come too for his aftercure she recollected in time to say she forgot they were on their way home she added that she did not know when she should return she was merely a passenger now she left everything to the men of the family she had in fact the air of having thrown off every responsibility but in supremacy not submission she was always ordering kenby about she sent him for her handkerchief and her rings which she had left either in the tray of her trunk or on the pincushion or on the washstand or somewhere and forbade him to come back without them he asked for her keys and then with a joyful scream she owned that she had left the doorkey in the door and the whole bunch of trunkkeys in her trunk and kenby treated it all as the greatest joke rose too seemed to think that kenby would make everything come right and he had lost that look of anxiety which he used to have at the most he showed a friendly sympathy for kenby for whose sake he seemed mortified at her he was unable to regard his mother as the delightful joke which she appeared to kenby but that was merely temperamental and he was never distressed except when she behaved with unreasonable caprice at kenbys cost  as for kenby himself he betrayed no dissatisfaction with his fate to march he perhaps no longer regarded his wife as that strong character which he had sometimes wearied march by celebrating but she was still the most brilliant intelligence and her charm seemed only to have grown with his perception of its wilful limitations he did not want to talk about her so much he wanted rather to talk about rose his health his education his nature and what was best to do for him the two were on terms of a confidence and affection which perpetually amused mrs kenby but which left the sympathetic witness nothing to desire in their relation  they all came to the train when the marches started up to london and stood waving to them as they pulled out of the station well i cant see but thats all right he said as he sank back in his seat with a sigh of relief i never supposed we should get out of their marriage half so well and i dont feel that you quite made the match either my dear  she was forced to agree with him that the kenbys seemed happy together and that there was nothing to fear for rose in their happiness he would be as tenderly cared for by kenby as he could have been by his mother and far more judiciously she owned that she had trembled for him till she had seen them all together and now she should never tremble again  well march prompted at a certain inconclusiveness in her tone rather than her words  well you can see that it isnt ideal  why isnt it ideal i suppose you think that the marriage of burnamy and agatha triscoe will be ideal with their ignorances and inexperiences and illusions  yes its the illusions no marriage can be perfect without them and at their age the kenbys cant have them  kenby is a solid mass of illusion and i believe that people can go and get as many new illusions as they want whenever theyve lost their old ones  yes but the new illusions wont wear so well and in marriage you want illusions that will last no you neednt talk to me its all very well but it isnt ideal  march laughed ideal what is ideal  going home she said with such passion that he had not the heart to point out that they were merely returning to their old duties cares and pains with the wornout illusion that these would be altogether different when they took them up again     lxxiii  in fulfilment of another ideal mrs march took straightway to her berth when she got on board the cupania and to her husbands admiration she remained there till the day before they reached new york her theory was that the complete rest would do more than anything else to calm her shaken nerves and she did not admit into her calculations the chances of adverse weather which march would not suggest as probable in the last week in september the event justified her unconscious faith the ships run was of unparalled swiftness even for the cupania and of unparalled smoothness for days the sea was as sleek as oil the racks were never on the tables once the voyage was of the sort which those who make it no more believe in at the time than those whom they afterwards weary in boasting of it  the ship was very full but mrs march did not show the slightest curiosity to know who her fellowpassengers were she said that she wished to be let perfectly alone even by her own emotions and for this reason she forbade march to bring her a list of the passengers till after they had left queenstown lest it should be too exciting he did not take the trouble to look it up therefore and the first night out he saw no one whom he knew at dinner but the next morning at breakfast he found himself to his great satisfaction at the same table with the eltwins they were so much at ease with him that even mrs eltwin took part in the talk and told him how they had spent the time of her husbands rigorous aftercure in switzerland and now he was going home much better than they had expected she said they had rather thought of spending the winter in europe but had given it up because they were both a little homesick march confessed that this was exactly the case with his wife and himself and he had to add that mrs march was not very well otherwise and he should be glad to be at home on her account the recurrence of the word home seemed to deepen eltwins habitual gloom and mrs eltwin hastened to leave the subject of their return for inquiry into mrs marchs condition her interest did not so far overcome her shyness that she ventured to propose a visit to her and march found that the fact of the eltwins presence on board did not agitate his wife it seemed rather to comfort her and she said she hoped he would see all he could of the poor old things she asked if he had met any one else he knew and he was able to tell her that there seemed to be a good many swells on board and this cheered her very much though he did not know them she liked to be near the rose though it was not a flower that she really cared for  she did not ask who the swells were and march took no trouble to find out he took no trouble to get a passengerlist and he had the more trouble when he tried at last the lists seemed to have all vanished as they have a habit of doing after the first day the one that he made interest for with the head steward was a secondhand copy and had no one he knew in it but the eltwins the social solitude however was rather favorable to certain other impressions there seemed even more elderly people than there were on the norumbia the human atmosphere was gray and sober there was nothing of the gay expansion of the outward voyage there was little talking or laughing among those autumnal men who were going seriously and anxiously home with faces fiercely set for the coming grapple or necks meekly bowed for the yoke they had eaten their cake and it had been good but there remained a discomfort in the digestion they sat about in silence and march fancied that the flown summer was as dreamlike to each of them as it now was to him he hated to be of their dreary company but spiritually he knew that he was of it and he vainly turned to cheer himself with the younger passengers some matrons who went about clad in furs amused him for they must have been unpleasantly warm in their jackets and boas nothing but the hope of being able to tell the customs inspector with a good conscience that the things had been worn would have sustained one lady draped from head to foot in astrakhan  they were all getting themselves ready for the fray or the play of the coming winter but there seemed nothing joyous in the preparation there were many young girls as there always are everywhere but there were not many young men and such as there were kept to the smokingroom there was no sign of flirtation among them he would have given much for a moment of the pivotal girl to see whether she could have brightened those gloomy surfaces with her impartial lamp march wished that he could have brought some report from the outer world to cheer his wife as he descended to their stateroom they had taken what they could get at the eleventh hour and they had got no such ideal room as they had in the norumbia it was as mrs march graphically said a basement room it was on the north side of the ship which is a cold exposure and if there had been any sun it could not have got into their window which was half the time under water the green waves laced with foam hissed as they ran across the port and the electric fan in the corridor moaned like the wind in a gable  he felt a sinking of the heart as he pushed the stateroom door open and looked at his wife lying with her face turned to the wall and he was going to withdraw thinking her asleep when she said quietly are we going down  not that i know of he answered with a gayety he did not feel but ill ask the head steward  she put out her hand behind her for him to take and clutched his fingers convulsively if im never any better you will always remember this happy summer wont you oh its been such a happy summer it has been one long joy one continued triumph but it was too late we were too old and its broken me  the time had been when he would have attempted comfort when he would have tried mocking but that time was long past he could only pray inwardly for some sort of diversion but what it was to be in their barren circumstance he was obliged to leave altogether to providence he ventured pending an answer to his prayers upon the question dont you think id better see the doctor and get you some sort of tonic  she suddenly turned and faced him the doctor why im not sick basil if you can see the purser and get our rooms changed or do something to stop those waves from slapping against that horrible blinking oneeyed window you can save my life but no tonic is going to help me  she turned her face from him again and buried it in the bedclothes while he looked desperately at the racing waves and the port that seemed to open and shut like a weary eye  oh go away she implored i shall be better presently but if you stand there like thatgo and see if you cant get some other room where i neednt feel as if i were drowning all the way over  he obeyed so far as to go away at once and having once started he did not stop short of the pursers office he made an excuse of getting greenbacks for some english banknotes and then he said casually that he supposed there would be no chance of having his room on the lower deck changed for something a little less intimate with the sea the purser was not there to take the humorous view but he conceived that march wanted something higher up and he was able to offer him a room of those on the promenade where he had seen swells going in and out for six hundred dollars march did not blench but said he would get his wife to look at it with him and then he went out somewhat dizzily to take counsel with himself how he should put the matter to her she would be sure to ask what the price of the new room would be and he debated whether to take it and tell her some kindly lie about it or trust to the bracing effect of the sum named in helping restore the lost balance of her nerves he was not so rich that he could throw six hundred dollars away but there might be worse things and he walked up and down thinking all at once it flashed upon him that he had better see the doctor anyway and find out whether there were not some last hope in medicine before he took the desperate step before him he turned in half his course and ran into a lady who had just emerged from the door of the promenade laden with wraps and who dropped them all and clutched him to save herself from falling  why mr march she shrieked  miss triscoe he returned in the astonishment which he shared with her to the extent of letting the shawls he had knocked from her hold lie between them till she began to pick them up herself then he joined her and in the relief of their common occupation they contrived to possess each other of the reason of their presence on the same boat she had sorrowed over mrs marchs sad state and he had grieved to hear that her father was going home because he was not at all well before they found the general stretched out in his steamerchair and waiting with a grim impatience for his daughter  but how is it youre not in the passengerlist he inquired of them both and miss triscoe explained that they had taken their passage at the last moment too late she supposed to get into the list they were in london and had run down to liverpool on the chance of getting berths beyond this she was not definite and there was an absence of burnamy not only from her company but from her conversation which mystified march through all his selfish preoccupations with his wife she was a girl who had her reserves but for a girl who had so lately and rapturously written them of her engagement there was a silence concerning her betrothed that had almost positive quality with his longing to try miss triscoe upon mrs marchs malady as a remedial agent he had now the desire to try mrs march upon miss triscoes mystery as a solvent she stood talking to him and refusing to sit down and be wrapped up in the chair next her father she said that if he were going to ask mrs march to let her come to her it would not be worth while to sit down and he hurried below  did you get it asked his wife without looking round but not so apathetically as before  oh yes thats all right but now isabel theres something ive got to tell you youd find it out and youd better know it at once  she turned her face and asked sternly what is it  then he said with an almost equal severity miss triscoe is on board miss triscoeandherfather she wishes to come down and see you  mrs march sat up and began to twist her hair into shape and burnamy  there is no burnamy physically or so far as i can make out spiritually she didnt mention him and i talked at least five minutes with her  hand me my dressingsack said mrs march and poke those things on the sofa under the berth shut up that washstand and pull the curtain across that hideous window stop throw those towels into your berth put my shoes and your slippers into the shoebag on the door slip the brushes into that other bag beat the dent out of the sofa cushion that your head has made now  thenthen you will see her  see her  her voice was so terrible that he fled before it and he returned with miss triscoe in a dreamlike simultaneity he remembered as he led the way into his corridor to apologize for bringing her down into a basement room  oh were in the basement too it was all we could get she said in words that ended within the stateroom he opened to her then he went back and took her chair and wraps beside her father  he let the general himself lead the way up to his health which he was not slow in reaching and was not quick in leaving he reminded march of the state he had seen him in at wurzburg and he said it had gone from bad to worse with him at weimar he had taken to his bed and merely escaped from it with his life then they had tried schevleningen for a week where he said in a tone of some injury they had rather thought they might find them the marches the air had been poison to him and they had come over to england with some notion of bournemouth but the doctor in london had thought not and urged their going home all europe is damp you know and dark as a pocket in winter he ended  there had been nothing about burnamy and march decided that he must wait to see his wife if he wished to know anything when the general who had been silent twisted his head towards him and said without regard to the context it was complicated at weimar by that young man in the most devilish way did my daughter write to mrs march aboutwell it came to nothing after all and i dont understand how to this day i doubt if they do it was some sort of quarrel i suppose i wasnt consulted in the matter either way it appears that parents are not consulted in these trifling affairs nowadays he had married his daughters mother in open defiance of her father but in the glare of his daughters wilfulness this fact had whitened into pious obedience i dare say i shall be told byandby and shall be expected to approve of the result  a fancy possessed march that by operation of temperamental laws general triscoe was no more satisfied with burnamys final rejection than with his acceptance if the engagement was ever to be renewed it might be another thing but as it stood march divined a certain favor for the young man in the generals attitude but the affair was altogether too delicate for comment the generals aristocratic frankness in dealing with it might have gone farther if his knowledge had been greater but in any case march did not see how he could touch it he could only say he had always liked burnamy himself  he had his good qualities the general owned he did not profess to understand the young men of our time but certainly the fellow had the instincts of a gentleman he had nothing to say against him unless in that business with that manwhat was his name  stoller march prompted i dont excuse him in that but i dont blame him so much either if punishment means atonement he had the opportunity of making that right very suddenly and if pardon means expunction then i dont see why that offence hasnt been pretty well wiped out  those things are not so simple as they used to seem said the general with a seriousness beyond his wont in things that did not immediately concern his own comfort or advantage     lxxvi  in the mean time mrs march and miss triscoe were discussing another offence of burnamys  it wasnt said the girl excitedly after a plunge through all the minor facts to the heart of the matter that he hadnt a perfect right to do it if he thought i didnt care for him i had refused him at carlsbad and i had forbidden him to speak to me abouton the subject but that was merely temporary and he ought to have known it he ought to have known that i couldnt accept him on the spur of the moment that way and when he had come back after going away in disgrace before he had done anything to justify himself i couldnt have kept my selfrespect and as it was i had the greatest difficulty and he ought to have seen it of course he said afterwards that he didnt see it but whenwhen i found out that she had been in weimar and all that time while i had been suffering in carlsbad and wurzburg and longing to see himlet him know how i was really feelinghe was flirting with thatthat girl then i saw that he was a false nature and i determined to put an end to everything and that is what i did and i shall always think idid rightand  the rest was lost in agathas handkerchief which she put up to her eyes mrs march watched her from her pillow keeping the girls unoccupied hand in her own and softly pressing it till the storm was past sufficiently to allow her to be heard  then she said men are very strangethe best of them and from the very fact that he was disappointed he would be all the more apt to rush into a flirtation with somebody else  miss triscoe took down her handkerchief from a face that had certainly not been beautified by grief i didnt blame him for the flirting or not so much it was his keeping it from me afterwards he ought to have told me the very first instant we were engaged but he didnt he let it go on and if i hadnt happened on that bouquet i might never have known anything about it that is what i mean bya false nature i wouldnt have minded his deceiving me but to let me deceive myselfoh it was too much  agatha hid her face in her handkerchief again she was perching on the edge of the berth and mrs march said with a glance which she did not see toward the sofa im afraid thats rather a hard seat for you  oh no thank you im perfectly comfortablei like itif you dont mind  mrs march pressed her hand for answer and after another little delay sighed and said they are not like us and we cannot help it they are more temporizing  how do you mean agatha unmasked again  they can bear to keep things better than we can and they trust to time to bring them right or to come right of themselves  i dont think mr march would trust things to come right of themselves said agatha in indignant accusal of mrs marchs sincerity  ah thats just what he would do my dear and has done all along and i dont believe we could have lived through without it we should have quarrelled ourselves into the grave  mrs march  yes indeed i dont mean that he would ever deceive me but he would let things go on and hope that somehow they would come right without any fuss  do you mean that he would let anybody deceive themselves  im afraid he wouldif he thought it would come right it used to be a terrible trial to me and it is yet at times when i dont remember that he means nothing but good and kindness by it only the other day in ansbachhow long ago it seemshe let a poor old woman give him her sons address in jersey city and allowed her to believe he would look him up when we got back and tell him we had seen her i dont believe unless i keep right round after him as we say in new england that hell ever go near the man  agatha looked daunted but she said that is a very different thing  it isnt a different kind of thing and it shows what men arethe sweetest and best of them that is they are terribly apt to beeasygoing  then you think i was all wrong the girl asked in a tremor  no indeed you were right because you really expected perfection of him you expected the ideal and thats what makes all the trouble in married life we expect too much of each otherwe each expect more of the other than we are willing to give or can give if i had to begin over again i should not expect anything at all and then i should be sure of being radiantly happy but all this talking and all this writing about love seems to turn our brains we know that men are not perfect even at our craziest because women are not but we expect perfection of them and they seem to expect it of us poor things if we could keep on after we are in love just as we were before we were in love and take nice things as favors and surprises as we did in the beginning but we get more and more greedy and exacting  do you think i was too exacting in wanting him to tell me everything after we were engaged  no i dont say that but suppose he had put it off till you were married agatha blushed a little but not painfully would it have been so bad then you might have thought that his flirting up to the last moment in his desperation was a very good joke you would have understood better just how it was and it might even have made you fonder of him you might have seen that he had flirted with some one else because he was so heartbroken about you  then you believe that if i could have waited tilltillbut when i had found out dont you see i couldnt wait it would have been all very well if i hadnt known it till then but as i did know it dont you see  yes that certainly complicated it mrs march admitted but i dont think if hed been a false nature hed have owned up as he did you see he didnt try to deny it and thats a great point gained  yes that is true said agatha with conviction i saw that afterwards but you dont think mrs march that i was unjust oror hasty  no indeed you couldnt have done differently under the circumstances you may be sure he felt thathe is so unselfish and generous agatha began to weep into her handkerchief again mrs march caressed her hand and it will certainly come right if you feel as you do  no the girl protested he can never forgive me its all over everything is over it would make very little difference to me what happened nowif the steamer broke her shaft or anything but if i can only believe i wasnt unjust  mrs march assured her once more that she had behaved with absolute impartiality and she proved to her by a process of reasoning quite irrefragable that it was only a question of time with which place had nothing to do when she and burnamy should come together again and all should be made right between them the fact that she did not know where he was any more than mrs march herself had nothing to do with the result that was a mere detail which would settle itself she clinched her argument by confessing that her own engagement had been broken off and that it had simply renewed itself all you had to do was to keep willing it and waiting there was something very mysterious in it  and how long was it till agatha faltered  well in our ease it was two years  oh said the girl but mrs march hastened to reassure her  but our case was very peculiar i could see afterwards that it neednt have been two months if i had been willing to acknowledge at once that i was in the wrong i waited till we met  if i felt that i was in the wrong i should write said agatha i shouldnt care what he thought of my doing it  yes the great thing is to make sure that you were wrong  they remained talking so long that march and the general had exhausted all the topics of common interest and had even gone through those they did not care for at last the general said im afraid my daughter will tire mrs march  oh i dont think shell tire my wife but do you want her  well when youre going down  i think ill take a turn about the deck and start my circulation said march and he did so before he went below  he found his wife up and dressed and waiting provisionally on the sofa i thought i might as well go to lunch she said and then she told him about agatha and burnamy and the means she had employed to comfort and encourage the girl and now dearest i want you to find out where burnamy is and give him a hint you will wont you if you could have seen how unhappy she was  i dont think i should have cared and im certainly not going to meddle i think burnamy has got no more than he deserved and that hes well rid of her i cant imagine a broken engagement that would more completely meet my approval as the case stands they have my blessing  dont say that dearest you know you dont mean it  i do and i advise you to keep your hands off youve done all and more than you ought to propitiate miss triscoe youve offered yourself up and youve offered me up  no no basil i merely used you as an illustration of what men werethe best of them  and i cant observe he continued that any one else has been considered in the matter is miss triscoe the sole sufferer by burnamys flirtation what is the matter with a little compassion for the pivotal girl  now you know youre not serious said his wife and though he would not admit this he could not be seriously sorry for the new interest which she took in the affair there was no longer any question of changing their stateroom under the tonic influence of the excitement she did not go back to her berth after lunch and she was up later after dinner than he could have advised she was absorbed in agatha but in her liberation from her hypochondria she began also to make a comparative study of the american swells in the light of her late experience with the german highhotes it is true that none of the swells gave her the opportunity of examining them at close range as the highhotes had done they kept to their staterooms mostly where after he thought she could bear it march told her how near he had come to making her their equal by an outlay of six hundred dollars she now shuddered at the thought but she contended that in their magnificent exclusiveness they could give points to european princes and that this showed again how when americans did try to do a thing they beat the world agatha triscoe knew who they were but she did not know them they belonged to another kind of set she spoke of them as rich people and she seemed content to keep away from them with mrs march and with the shy silent old wife of major eltwin to whom march sometimes found her talking  he never found her father talking with major eltwin general triscoe had his own friends in the smokingroom where he held forth in a certain corner on the chances of the approaching election in new york and mocked their incredulity when he prophesied the success of tammany and the return of the king march himself much preferred major eltwin to the general and his friends he lived back in the talk of the ohioan into his own younger years in indiana and he was amused and touched to find how much the midwestern life seemed still the same as he had known the conditions had changed but not so much as they had changed in the east and the farther west the picture that the major drew of them in his own region was alluring it made march homesick though he knew that he should never go back to his native section there was the comfort of kind in the major and he had a vein of philosophy spare but sweet which march liked he liked also the meekness which had come through sorrow upon a spirit which had once been proud  they had both the elderly mans habit of early rising and they usually found themselves together waiting impatiently for the cup of coffee ingenuously bad which they served on the cupania not earlier than half past six in strict observance of a rule of the line discouraging to people of their habits march admired the vileness of the decoction which he said could not be got anywhere out of the british empire and he asked eltwin the first morning if he had noticed how instantly on the channel boat they had dropped to it and to the sour heavy sodden british bread from the spirited and airy continental tradition of coffee and rolls  the major confessed that he was no great hand to notice such things and he said he supposed that if the line had never lost a passenger and got you to new york in six days it had a right to feed you as it pleased he surmised that if they could get their airing outside before they took their coffee it would give the coffee a chance to taste better and this was what they afterwards did they met well buttoned and well mined up on the promenade when it was yet so early that they were not at once sure of each other in the twilight and watched the morning planets pale east and west before the sun rose sometimes there were no paling planets and no rising sun and a black sea ridged with white tossed under a low dark sky with dim rifts  one morning they saw the sun rise with a serenity and majesty which it rarely has outside of the theatre the dawn began over that sea which was like the rumpled canvas imitations of the sea on the stage under long mauve clouds bathed in solemn light above these in the pale tender sky two silver stars hung and the steamers smoke drifted across them like a thin dusky veil to the right a bank of dun cloud began to burn crimson and to burn brighter till it was like a low hillside full of gorgeous rugosities fleeced with a dense dwarfish growth of autumnal shrubs the whole eastern heaven softened and flushed through diaphanous mists the west remained a livid mystery the eastern masses and flakes of cloud began to kindle keenly but the stars shone clearly and then one star till the tawny pink hid it all the zenith reddened but still the sun did not show except in the color of the brilliant clouds at last the lurid horizon began to burn like a flameshot smoke and a fiercely bright disc edge pierced its level and swiftly defined itself as the suns orb  many thoughts went through marchs mind some of them were sad but in some there was a touch of hopefulness it might have been that beauty which consoled him for his years somehow he felt himself if no longer young a part of the young immortal frame of things his state was indefinable but he longed to hint at it to his companion  yes said eltwin with a long deep sigh i feel as if i could walk out through that brightness and find her i reckon that such hopes wouldnt be allowed to lie to us that so many ages of men couldnt have fooled themselves so im glad ive seen this he was silent and they both remained watching the rising sun till they could not bear its splendor now said the major it must be time for that mud as you call it over their coffee and crackers at the end of the table which they had to themselves he resumed i was thinking all the timewe seem to think half a dozen things at once and this was one of themabout a piece of business ive got to settle when i reach home and perhaps you can advise me about it youre an editor ive got a newspaper on my hands i reckon it would be a pretty good thing if it had a chance but i dont know what to do with it i got it in trade with a fellow who has to go west for his lungs but hes staying till i get back whats become of that young chapwhats his namethat went out with us  burnamy prompted march rather breathlessly  yes couldnt he take hold of it i rather liked him hes smart isnt he  very said march but i dont know where he is i dont know that he would go into the country but he might if  they entered provisionally into the case and for arguments sake supposed that burnamy would take hold of the majors paper if he could be got at it really looked to march like a good chance for him on eltwins showing but he was not confident of burnamys turning up very soon and he gave the major a pretty clear notion why by entering into the young fellows history for the last three months  isnt it the very irony of fate he said to his wife when he found her in their room with a cup of the same mud he had been drinking and reported the facts to her  irony she said with all the excitement he could have imagined or desired nothing of the kind its a leading if ever there was one it will be the easiest thing in the world to find burnamy and out there she can sit on her steps  he slowly groped his way to her meaning through the hypothesis of burnamys reconciliation and marriage with agatha triscoe and their settlement in major eltwins town under social conditions that implied a habit of spending the summer evenings on their front porch while he was doing this she showered him with questions and conjectures and requisitions in which nothing but the impossibility of going ashore saved him from the instant devotion of all his energies to a worldwide inquiry into burnamys whereabouts  the next morning he was up before major eltwin got out and found the secondcabin passengers free of the firstcabin promenade at an hour when their superiors were not using it as he watched these inferiors decentlooking wellclad men and women enjoying their privilege with a furtive air and with stolen glances at him he asked himself in what sort he was their superior till the inquiry grew painful then he rose from his chair and made his way to the place where the material barrier between them was lifted and interested himself in a few of them who seemed too proud to avail themselves of his society on the terms made a figure seized his attention with a sudden fascination of conjecture and rejection the figure of a tall young man who came out on the promenade and without looking round walked swiftly away to the bow of the ship and stood there looking down at the water in an attitude which was bewilderingly familiar his movement his posture his dress even was that of burnamy and march after a first flush of pleasure felt a sickening repulsion in the notion of his presence it would have been such a cheap performance on the part of life which has all sorts of chances at command and need not descend to the poor tricks of secondrate fiction and he accused burnamy of a complicity in the bad taste of the affair though he realized when he reflected that if it were really burnamy he must have sailed in as much unconsciousness of the triscoes as he himself had done he had probably got out of money and had hurried home while he had still enough to pay the secondcabin fare on the first boat back clearly he was not to blame but life was to blame for such a shabby device and march felt this so keenly that he wished to turn from the situation and have nothing to do with it he kept moving toward him drawn by the fatal attraction and at a few paces distance the young man whirled about and showed him the face of a stranger  march made some witless remark on the rapid course of the ship as it cut its way through the water of the bow the stranger answered with a strong lancashire accent and in the talk which followed he said he was going out to see the cottonmills at fall river and new bedford and he seemed hopeful of some advice or information from march then he said he must go and try to get his missus out march understood him to mean his wife and he hurried down to his own to whom he related his hairbreadth escape from burnamy  i dont call it an escape at all she declared i call it the greatest possible misfortune if it had been burnamy we could have brought them together at once just when she has seen so clearly that she was in the wrong and is feeling all broken up there wouldnt have been any difficulty about his being in the secondcabin we could have contrived to have them meet somehow if the worst came to the worst you could have lent him money to pay the difference and got him into the firstcabin  i could have taken that sixhundreddollar room for him said march and then he could have eaten with the swells  she answered that now he was teasing that he was fundamentally incapable of taking anything seriously and in the end he retired before the stewardess bringing her first coffee with a wellmerited feeling that if it had not been for his triviality the young lancashireman would really have been burnamy     lxxv  except for the first day and night out from queenstown when the ship rolled and pitched with straining and squeaking noises and a thumping of the lifted screws there was no rough weather and at last the ocean was livid and oily with a long swell on which she swayed with no perceptible motion save from her machinery  most of the seamanship seemed to be done after dark or in those early hours when march found the stewards cleaning the stairs and the sailors scouring the promenades he made little acquaintance with his fellowpassengers one morning he almost spoke with an old quaker lady whom he joined in looking at the niagara flood which poured from the churning screws but he did not quite get the words out on the contrary he talked freely with an american who bred horses on a farm near boulogne and was going home to the horse show he had been thirtyfive years out of the country but he had preserved his yankee accent in all its purity and was the most typicallooking american on board now and then march walked up and down with a blond mexican whom he found of the usual wellordered latin intelligence but rather flavorless at times he sat beside a nice jew who talked agreeably but only about business and he philosophized the race as so tiresome often because it seemed so often without philosophy he made desperate attempts at times to interest himself in the poolselling in the smokingroom where the betting on the ships wonderful run was continual  he thought that people talked less and less as they drew nearer home but on the last day out there was a sudden expansion and some whom he had not spoken with voluntarily addressed him the sweet soft air was like midsummer the water rippled gently without a swell blue under the clear sky and the ship left a wide track that was silver in the sun there were more sail the first and second class baggage was got up and piled along the steerage deck  some people dressed a little more than usual for the last dinner which was earlier than usual so as to be out of the way against the arrival which had been variously predicted at from five to seventhirty an indescribable nervousness culminated with the appearance of the customs officers on board who spread their papers on cleared spaces of the diningtables and summoned the passengers to declare that they had nothing to declare as a preliminary to being searched like thieves at the dock  this ceremony proceeded while the cupania made her way up the narrows and into the north river where the flare of lights from the crazy steeps and cliffs of architecture on the new york shore seemed a persistence of the last fourth of july pyrotechnics march blushed for the grotesque splendor of the spectacle and was confounded to find some englishmen admiring it till he remembered that aesthetics were not the strong point of our race his wife sat hand in hand with miss triscoe and from time to time made him count the pieces of small baggage in the keeping of their steward while general triscoe held aloof in a sarcastic calm  the steamer groped into her dock the gangways were lifted to her side the passengers fumbled and stumbled down their incline and at the bottom the marches found themselves respectively in the arms of their son and daughter they all began talking at once and ignoring and trying to remember the triscoes to whom the young marches were presented bella did her best to be polite to agatha and tom offered to get an inspector for the general at the same time as for his father then march remorsefully remembered the eltwins and looked about for them so that his son might get them an inspector too he found the major already in the hands of an inspector who was passing all his pieces after carelessly looking into one the official who received the declarations on board had noted a grand army button like his own in the majors lapel and had marked his fellowveterans paper with the mystic sign which procures for the bearer the honor of being promptly treated as a smuggler while the less favored have to wait longer for this indignity at the hands of their government when marchs own inspector came he was as civil and lenient as our hateful law allows when he had finished march tried to put a banknote in his hand and was brought to a just shame by his refusal of it the bedroom steward keeping guard over the baggage helped putit together after the search and protested that march had feed him so handsomely that he would stay there with it as long as they wished this partly restored marchs selfrespect and he could share in general triscoes indignation with the treasury ruling which obliged him to pay duty on his own purchases in excess of the hundreddollar limit though his daughter had brought nothing and they jointly came far within the limit for two  he found that the triscoes were going to a quiet old hotel on the way to stuyvesant square quite in his own neighborhood and he quickly arranged for all the ladies and the general to drive together while he was to follow with his son on foot and by car they got away from the scene of the customs havoc while the steamer shed with its vast darkness dimly lit by its many lamps still showed like a battlefield where the inspectors groped among the scattered baggage like details from the victorious army searching for the wounded his son clapped him on the shoulder when he suggested this notion and said he was the same old father and they got home as gayly together as the dispiriting influences of the new york ugliness would permit it was still in those good and decent times now so remote when the city got something for the money paid out to keep its streets clean and those they passed through were not foul but merely mean  the ignoble effect culminated when they came into broadway and found its sidewalks at an hour when those of any european metropolis would have been brilliant with life as unpeopled as those of a minor country town while long processions of cablecars carted heaps of men and women up and down the thoroughfare amidst the deformities of the architecture  the next morning the march family breakfasted late after an evening prolonged beyond midnight in spite of halfhourly agreements that now they must really all go to bed the children had both to recognize again and again how well their parents were looking tom had to tell his father about the condition of every other week bella had to explain to her mother how sorry her husband was that he could not come on to meet them with her but was coming a week later to take her home and then she would know the reason why they could not all go back to chicago with him it was just the place for her father to live for everybody to live at breakfast she renewed the reasoning with which she had maintained her position the night before the travellers entered into a full expression of their joy at being home again march asked what had become of that stray parrot which they had left in the treetop the morning they started and mrs march declared that this was the last silver wedding journey she ever wished to take and tried to convince them all that she had been on the verge of nervous collapse when she reached the ship they sat at table till she discovered that it was very nearly eleven oclock and said it was disgraceful  before they rose there was a ring at the door and a card was brought in to tom he glanced at it and said to his father oh yes this man has been haunting the office for the last three days hes got to leave today and as it seemed to be rather a case of life and death with him i said hed probably find you here this morning but if you dont want to see him i can put him off till afternoon i suppose  he tossed the card to his father who looked at it quietly and then gave it to his wife perhaps id as well see him  see him she returned in accents in which all the intensity of her soul was centred by an effort of selfcontrol which no words can convey a just sense of she remained with her children while her husband with a laugh more teasing than can be imagined went into the drawingroom to meet burnamy  the poor fellow was in an effect of belated summer as to clothes and he looked not merely haggard but shabby he made an effort for dignity as well as gayety however in stating himself to march with many apologies for his persistency but he said he was on his way west and he was anxious to know whether there was any chance of his kasper hauler paper being taken if he finished it up march would have been a far harderhearted editor than he was if he could have discouraged the suppliant before him he said he would take the kasper hauler paper and add a band of music to the usual rate of ten dollars a thousand words then burnamys dignity gave way if not his gayety he began to laugh and suddenly he broke down and confessed that he had come home in the steerage and was at his last cent beyond his fare to chicago his straw hat looked like a withered leaf in the light of his sad facts his thin overcoat affected marchs imagination as something like the diaphanous cast shell of a locust hopelessly resumed for comfort at the approach of autumn he made burnamy sit down after he had once risen and he told him of major eltwins wish to see him and he promised to go round with him to the majors hotel before the eltwins left town that afternoon  while he prolonged the interview in this way mrs march was kept from breaking in upon them only by the psychical experiment which she was making with the help and sympathy of her daughter at the window of the diningroom which looked up sixteenth street at the first hint she gave of the emotional situation which burnamy was a main part of her son with the brutal contempt of young men for other young mens love affairs said he must go to the office he bade his mother tell his father there was no need of his coming down that day and he left the two women together this gave the mother a chance to develop the whole fact to the daughter with telegrammic rapidity and brevity and then to enrich the firstoutline with innumerable details while they both remained at the window and mrs march said at twominutely intervals with no sense of iteration for either of them i told her to come in the morning if she felt like it and i know she will but if she doesnt i shall say there is nothing in fate or providence either at any rate im going to stay here and keep longing for her and well see whether theres anything in that silly theory of your fathers i dont believe there is she said to be on the safe side  even when she saw agatha triscoe enter the park gate on rutherford place she saved herself from disappointment by declaring that she was not coming across to their house as the girl persisted in coming and coming and at last came so near that she caught sight of mrs march at the window and nodded the mother turned ungratefully upon her daughter and drove her away to her own room so that no society detail should hinder the divine chance she went to the door herself when agatha rang and then she was going to open the way into the parlor where march was still closeted with burnamy and pretend that she had not known they were there but a soberer second thought than this prevailed and she told the girl who it was that was within and explained the accident of his presence i think she said nobly that you ought to have the chance of going away if you dont wish to meet him  the girl with that heroic precipitation which mrs march had noted in her from the first with regard to what she wanted to do when burnamy was in question answered but i do wish to meet him mrs march  while they stood looking at each other march came out to ask his wife if she would see burnamy and she permitted herself so much stratagem as to substitute agatha after catching her husband aside and subduing his proposed greeting of the girl to a hasty handshake  half an hour later she thought it time to join the young people urged largely by the frantic interest of her daughter but she returned from the halfopen door without entering i couldnt bring myself to break in on the poor things they are standing at the window together looking over at st georges  bella silently clasped her hands march gave cynical laugh and said well we are in for it my dear then he added i hope theyll take us with them on their silver wedding
