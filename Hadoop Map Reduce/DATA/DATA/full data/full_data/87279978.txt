87279978	the gorilla hunters by rm ballantyne    chapter one  in which the hunters are introduced  it was five oclock in the afternoon  there can be no doubt whatever as to that  old agnes may say what she pleasesshe has a habit of doing sobut i know for certain because i looked at my watch not ten minutes before it happened that it was exactly five oclock in the afternoon when i received a most singular and every way remarkable visita visit which has left an indelible impression on my memory as well it might for independent of its singularity and unexpectedness one of its results was the series of strange adventures which are faithfully detailed in this volume  it happened thus  i was seated in an armchair in my private study in a small town on the west coast of england  it was a splendid afternoon and it was exactly five oclock  mark that  not that there is anything singular about the mere fact neither is it in any way mixed up with the thread of this tale but old agnes is very obstinatesingularly positiveand i have a special desire that she should see it in print that i have not given in on that point  yes it was five precisely and a beautiful evening  i was ruminating as i frequently do on the pleasant memories of bygone days especially the happy days that i spent long ago among the coral islands of the pacific when a tap at the door aroused me  come in  a veesiter sir said old agnes my landlady an hell no gie his name  old agnes i may remark is a scotchwoman  show him in said i  maybe hes a pickpocket suggested agnes  ill take my chance of that  ay thats like ee  cares for naethin  losh man what if he cuts yer throat  ill take my chance of that too only do show him in my good woman said i with a gesture of impatience that caused the excellent though obstinate old creature to depart grumbling  in another moment a quick step was heard on the stair and a stranger burst into the room shut the door in my landladys face as she followed him and locked it  i was naturally surprised though not alarmed by the abrupt and eccentric conduct of my visitor who did not condescend to take off his hat but stood with his arms folded on his breast gazing at me and breathing hard  you are agitated sir pray be seated said i pointing to a chair  the stranger who was a little man and evidently a gentleman made no reply but seizing a chair placed it exactly before me sat down on it as he would have seated himself on a horse rested his arms on the back and stared me in the face  you are disposed to be facetious said i smiling for i never take offence without excessively good reason  not at all by no means said he taking off his hat and throwing it recklessly on the floor  you are mr rover i presume  the same sir at your service  are you oh thats yet to be seen  pray is your christian name ralph  it is said i in some surprise at the coolness of my visitor  ah just so  christian name ralph tother name roverralph rover very good  age twentytwo yesterday eh  my birthday was yesterday and my age is twentytwo  you appear to know more of my private history than i have the pleasure of knowing of yours  pray sir may ibut bless me are you unwell  i asked this in some alarm because the little man was rolling about in his seat holding his sides and growing very red in the face  oh no not at all perfectly wellnever was better in my life he said becoming all at once preternaturally grave  you were once in the pacificlived on a coral island  i did  oh dont trouble yourself to answer  just shut up for a minute or two  you were rather a soft green youth then and you dont seem to be much harder or less verdant now  sir  i exclaimed getting angry  just so continued he and you knew a young rascal there  i know a rascal here i exclaimed starting up whom ill kick  what cried the little stranger also starting up and capsizing the chair ralph rover has time and sunburning and war so changed my visage that you cannot recognise peterkin  i almost gasped for breath  peterkinpeterkin gay  i exclaimed  i am not prone to indulge in effeminate demonstration but i am not ashamed to confess that when i gazed on the weatherbeaten though ruddy countenance of my old companion and observed the eager glance of his bright blue eyes i was quite overcome and rushed violently into his arms  i may also add that until that day i had had no idea of peterkins physical strength for during the next five minutes he twisted me about and spun me round and round my own room until my brain began to reel and i was fain to cry him mercy  so youre all rightthe same jolly young old wiseacre in whiskers and long coat cried peterkin  come now ralph sit down if you can i mean to stay with you all evening and all night and all tomorrow and all next day so well have lots of time to fight our battles oer again  meanwhile compose yourself and ill tell you what ive come about  of course my first and chief reason was to see your face old boy but i have another reason tooa very peculiar reason  ive a proposal to make and a plan to unfold both of em stunners theyll shut you up and screw you down and altogether flabbergast you when you hear em so sit down and keep quietdo  i sat down accordingly and tried to compose myself but to say truth i was so much overjoyed and excited by the sight of my old friend and companion that i had some difficulty at first in fixing my attention on what he said the more especially that he spoke with extreme volubility and interrupted his discourse very frequently in order to ask questions or to explain  now old fellow he began here goes and mind you dont interrupt me  well i mean to go and i mean you to go with me tobut i forgot perhaps you wont be able to go  what are you  what am i  ay your profession your calling lawyer md scrivenerwhich  i am a naturalist  a what  a naturalist  ralph said peterkin slowly have you been long troubled with that complaint  yes i replied laughing i have suffered from it from my earliest infancy more or less  i thought so rejoined my companion shaking his head gravely  i fancied that i observed the development of that disease when we lived together on the coral island  it dont bring you in many thousands a year does it  no said i it does not  i am only an amateur having a sufficiency of this worlds goods to live on without working for my bread  but although my dear father at his death left me a small fortune which yields me three hundred a year i do not feel entitled to lead the life of an idler in this busy world where so many are obliged to toil night and day for the bare necessaries of life  i have therefore taken to my favourite studies as a sort of business and flatter myself that i have made one or two not unimportant discoveries and added a few mites to the sum of human knowledge  a good deal of my time is spent in scientific roving expeditions throughout the country and in contributing papers to several magazines  while i was thus speaking i observed that peterkins face was undergoing the most remarkable series of changes of expression which as i concluded merged into a smile of beaming delight as he saidralph youre a trump  possibly said i you are right but setting that question aside for the present let me remind you that you have not yet told me where you mean to go to  i mean said peterkin slowly placing both hands on his knees and looking me steadily in the facei mean to go ahunting inbut i forgot  you dont know that im a hunter a somewhat famous hunter  of course i dont  you are so full of your plans and proposals that you have not yet told me where you have been or what doing these six years  and you ye never written to me once all that time shabby fellow  i thought you were dead  did you go into mourning for me ralph  no of course not  a pretty fellow you are to find fault  you thought that i your oldest and best friend was dead and you did not go into mourning  how could i write to you when you parted from me without giving me your address it was a mere chance my finding you out even now  i was taking a quiet cup of coffee in the commercial room of a hotel not far distant when i overheard a stranger speaking of his friend ralph rover the philosopher so i plunged at him promiscuously and made him give me your address  but ive corresponded with jack ever since we parted on the pier at dover  what  jackjack martin  i exclaimed as a warm gush of feeling filled my heart at the sound of his wellremembered name  is jack alive  alive  i should think so  if possible hes more alive than ever for i should suppose he must be fullgrown now which he was not when we last met  he and i have corresponded regularly  he lives in the north of england and by good luck happens to be just now within thirty miles of this town  you dont mean to say ralph that you have never met  never  the very same mistake that happened with you occurred between him and me  we parted vowing to correspond as long as we should live and three hours after i remembered that we had neglected to exchange our addresses so that we could not correspond  i have often often made inquiries both for you and him but have always failed  i never heard of jack from the time we parted at dover till today  then no doubt you thought us both dead and yet you did not go into mourning for either of us  o ralph ralph i had entertained too good an opinion of you  but tell me about jack said i impatient to hear more concerning my dear old comrade  not just now my boy more of him in a few minutes  first let us return to the point  what was it  oh aabout my being a celebrated hunter  a very nimrodat least a miniature copy  well ralph since we last met i have been all over the world right round and round it im a lieutenant in the navy nowat least i was a week ago  ive been fighting with the kaffirs and the chinamen and been punishing the rascally sepoys in india and been hunting elephants in ceylon and tigershooting in the jungles and harpooning whales in the polar seas and shooting lions at the cape oh youve no notion where all ive been  its a perfect marvel ive turned up here alive  but theres one beast ive not yet seen and im resolved to see him and shoot him too  but said i interrupting what mean you by saying that you were a lieutenant in the navy a week ago  i mean that ive given it up  im tired of the sea  i only value it as a means of getting from one country to another  the land the land for me  you must know that an old uncle a rich old uncle of mine whom i never saw died lately and left me his whole fortune  of course he died in india  all old uncles who die suddenly and leave unexpected fortunes to unsuspecting nephews are old indian uncles and mine was no exception to the general rule  so im independent like you ralph only ive got three or four thousand a year instead of hundreds i believe but im not sure and dont careand im determined now to go on a long hunting expedition  what think ye of all that my boy  in truth said i it would puzzle me to say what i think i am so filled with surprise by all you tell me  but you forget that you have not yet told me to which part of the world you mean to go and what sort of beast it is you are so determined to see and shoot if you can  if i can echoed peterkin with a contemptuous curl of the lip  did not i tell you that i was a celebrated hunter  without meaning to boast i may tell you that there is no peradventure in my shooting  if i only get there and see the brute within long range illha wont i  get where and see what  get to africa and see the gorilla cried peterkin while a glow of enthusiasm lighted up his eyes  youve heard of the gorilla ralph of coursethe great apethe enormous puggythe huge baboonthe man monkey that weve been hearing so much of for some years back and that the niggers on the african coast used to dilate about till they caused the very hair of my head to stand upon end  im determined to shoot a gorilla or prove him to be a myth  and i mean you to come and help me ralph hes quite in your way  a bit of natural history i suppose although he seems by all accounts to be a very unnatural monster  and jack shall go tooim resolved on that and we three shall roam the wild woods again as we did in days of yore and  hold peterkin said i interrupting  how do you know that jack will go  how do i know  intuitively of course  i shall write to him tonight the post does not leave till ten  hell get it tomorrow at breakfast and will catch the forenoon coach which will bring him down here by two oclock and then well begin our preparations at once and talk the matter over at dinner  so you see its all cut and dry  give me a sheet of paper and ill write at once  ah heres a bit now a pen bless me ralph havent you got a quill  who ever heard of a philosophical naturalist writing with steel  now then here goesbluvd jackwill that do to begin with eh  im afraid its too affectionate hell think its from a lady friend  but it cant be alteredhere i am and heres ralphralph rover think of that i say ralph ive put six marks of admiration there ive found him out  do come to see us  excruciatingly important business ever thinepeterkin gay  will that bring him dye think  i think it will said i laughing  then off with it ralph cried my volatile friend jumping up and looking hastily round for the bellrope  not being able to find it my bellpull being an unobtrusive knob and not a rope he rushed to the door unlocked it darted out and uttered a tremendous roar which was followed by a clatter and a scream from old agnes whom he had upset and tumbled over  it was curious to note the sudden change that took place in peterkins face voice and manner as he lifted the poor old woman who was very thin and light in his arms and carrying her into the room placed her in my easychair  real anxiety was depicted in his countenance and he set her down with a degree of care and tenderness that quite amazed me i was myself very much alarmed at first  my poor dear old woman said peterkin supporting my landladys head my stupid haste i fear you are hurt  hech its nae hurtits deed i am fair deed killed be a whaumlskamerin young blagyird  oh ma puir heed  the manner and tone in which this was said convinced me that old agnes was more frightened than injured  in a few minutes the soothing tones and kind manner of my friend had such an effect upon her that she declared she was better and believed after all that she was only a wee bit frichtened  nay so completely was she conciliated that she insisted on conveying the note to the postoffice despite peterkins assurance that he would not hear of it  finally she hobbled out of the room with the letter in her hand  it is interesting to note how that in most of the affairs of humanity things turn out very different often totally different from what we had expected or imagined  during the remainder of that evening peterkin and i talked frequently and much of our old friend jack martin  we recalled his manly yet youthful countenance his bold lionlike courage his broad shoulders and winning gentle smile and although we knew that six years must have made an immense difference in his personal appearancefor he was not much more than eighteen when we last parted we could not think of him except as a hearty strapping sailorboy  we planned too how we would meet him at the coach how we would stand aside in the crowd until he began to look about for us in surprise and then one of us would step forward and ask if he wished to be directed to any particular part of the town and so lead him on and talk to him as a stranger for some time before revealing who we were  and much more to the same effect  but when next day came our plans and our conceptions were utterly upset  a little before two we sauntered down to the coachoffice and waited impatiently for nearly twenty minutes  of course the coach was late it always is on such occasions  suppose he does not come said i  what a fellow you are cried peterkin to make uncomfortable suppositions  let us rather suppose that he does come  oh then it would be all right but if he does not come what then  why then it would be all wrong and we should have to return home and eat our dinner in the sulks thats all  as my companion spoke we observed the coach come sweeping round the turn of the road about half a mile distant  in a few seconds it dashed into the town at full gallop and finally drew up abruptly opposite the door of the inn where were assembled the usual group of hostlers and waiters and people who expected friends by the coach  hes not there whispered peterkin in deep disappointmentat least hes not on the outside and jack would never travel inside of a coach even in bad weather much less in fine  thats not him on the backseat beside the fat old woman with the blue bundle surely  its very like him but too young much too young  theres a great giant of a man on the boxseat with a beard like a grenadiers shako and a stout old gentleman behind him with gold spectacles  thats all except two boys farther aft and three ladies in the cabin  oh what a bore  although deeply disappointed at the nonarrival of jack i could with difficulty refrain from smiling at the rueful and woebegone countenance of my poor companion  it was evident that he could not bear disappointment with equanimity and i was on the point of offering some consolatory remarks when my attention was attracted by the little old woman with the blue bundle who went up to the gigantic man with the black beard and in the gentlest possible tone of voice asked if he could direct her to the white house  no madam replied the big man hastily im a stranger here  the little old woman was startled by his abrupt answer  deary me sir no offence i hope  she then turned to peterkin and put the same question possibly under a vague sort of impression that if a gigantic frame betokened a gruff nature diminutive stature must necessarily imply extreme amiability if so she must have been much surprised as well as disappointed for peterkin rendered irascible by disappointment turned short round and said sharply why madam how can i tell you where the white house is unless you say which white house you want  half the houses of the town are whiteat least theyre dirty white he added bitterly as he turned away  i think i can direct you maam said i stepping quickly up with a bland smile in order to counteract if possible my companions rudeness  thank you sir kindly said the little old woman im glad to find some little civility in the town  come with me maam i am going past the white house and will show you the way  and pray sir said the big stranger stepping up to me as i was about to move away can you recommend me to a good hotel  i replied that i could that there was one in the immediate vicinity of the white house and that if he would accompany me i would show him the way  all this i did purposely in a very affable and obliging tone and manner for i hold that example is infinitely better than precept and always endeavour if possible to overcome evil with good  i offered my arm to the old woman who thanked me and took it  what whispered peterkin you dont mean me to take this great ugly gorilla in tow  of course replied i laughing as i led the way  immediately i entered into conversation with my companion and i heard the gorilla attempt to do so with peterkin but from the few sharp cross replies that reached my ear i became aware that he was unsuccessful  in the course of a few minutes however he appeared to have overcome his companions illhumour for i overheard their voices growing louder and more animated as they walked behind me  suddenly i heard a shout and turning hastily round observed peterkin struggling in the arms of the gorilla  amazed beyond measure at the sight and firmly persuaded that a cowardly assault had been made upon my friend i seized the old womans umbrella as the only available weapon and flew to the rescue  jack my boy can it be possible gasped peterkin  i believe it is replied jack laughingralph my dear old fellow how are you  i stood petrified  i believed that i was in a dream  i know not what occurred during the next five minutes  all i could remember with anything like distinctness was a succession of violent screams from the little old woman who fled shouting thieves and murder at the full pitch of her voice  we never saw that old woman again but i made a point of returning her umbrella to the white house  gradually we became collected and sane  why jack how did you find us out cried peterkin as we all hurried on to my lodgings totally forgetful of the little old woman whom as i have said we never saw again but who i sincerely trust arrived at the white house in safety  find you out  i knew you the moment i set eyes on you  ralph puzzled me for a second he has grown so much stouter but i should know your nose peterkin at a mile off  well jack i did not know you retorted peterkin but im safe never again to forget you  such a great hairy cossack as you have become why what do you mean by it  i couldnt help it please pleaded jack i grew in spite of myself but i think ive stopped now  its time remarked peterkin  jack had indeed grown to a size that men seldom attain to without losing in grace infinitely more than they gain in bulk but he had retained all the elegance of form and sturdy vigour of action that had characterised him as a boy  he was fully six feet two inches in his stockings but so perfect were his proportions that his great height did not become apparent until you came close up to him  full half of his handsome manly face was hid by a bushy black beard and moustache and his curly hair had been allowed to grow luxuriantly so that his whole aspect was more like to the descriptions we have of one of the old scandinavian vikings than a gentleman of the present time  in whatever company he chanced to be he towered high above every one else and i am satisfied that had he walked down whitechapel the horse guards would have appeared small beside him for he possessed not only great length of limb but immense breadth of chest and shoulders  during our walk to my lodgings peterkin hurriedly stated his plan and proposal which caused jack to laugh very much at first but in a few minutes he became grave and said slowly that will just suitit will do exactly  what will do exactly  do be more explicit man said peterkin with some impatience  ill go with you my boy  will you cried peterkin seizing his hand and shaking it violently i knew you would  i said it didnt i ralph  and now we shall be sure of a gorilla if theres one in africa for ill use you as a stalkinghorse  indeed exclaimed jack  yes ill put a bearskin or some sort of fur on your shoulders and tie a ladys boa to you for a tail and send you into the woods  the gorillas will be sure to mistake you for a relative until you get quite close then youll take one pace to the left with the left foot as the volunteers say ill take one to the front with the rightat fifty yards readypresentbang and down goes the huge puggy with a bullet right between its two eyes  there  and ralphs agreed to go too  o peterkin ive done nothing of the sort  you proposed it  well and isnt that the same thing  i wonder ralph that you can give way to such meanspirited prevarication  what  its not prevarication  dont say that now you know it is  ah you may laugh my boy but you have promised to go with me and jack to africa and go you shall  and so reader it was ultimately settled and in the course of two weeks more we three were on our way to the land of the slave the black savage and the gorilla    chapter two  life in the wild woods  one night about five or six weeks after our resolution to go to africa on a hunting expedition was formed i put to myself the question can it be possible that we are actually here in the midst of it  certainly my boy in the very thick of it answered peterkin in a tone of voice which made jack laugh while i started and exclaimed  why peterkin how did you come to guess my thoughts  because ralph you have got into a habit of thinking aloud which may do very well as long as you have no secrets to keep but it may prove inconvenient some day so i warn you in time  not feeling disposed at that time to enter into a bantering conversation with my volatile companion i made no reply but abandoned myself again to the pleasing fancies and feelings which were called up by the singular scene in the midst of which i found myself  it seemed as if it were but yesterday when we drove about the crowded streets of london making the necessary purchases for our intended journey and now as i gazed around every object that met my eye seemed strange and wild and foreign and romantic  we three were reclining round an enormous wood fire in the midst of a great forest the trees and plants of which were quite new to me and totally unlike those of my native land  rich luxuriance of vegetation was the feature that filled my mind most  tall palms surrounded us throwing their broad leaves overhead and partially concealing the starlit sky  thick tough limbs of creeping plants and wild vines twisted and twined round everything and over everything giving to the woods an appearance of tangled impenetrability but the beautiful leaves of some and the delicate tendrils of others half concealed the sturdy limbs of the trees and threw over the whole a certain air of wild grace as might a semitransparent and beautiful robe if thrown around the form of a savage  the effect of a strong fire in the woods at night is to give to surrounding space an appearance of ebony blackness against which dark ground the gnarled stems and branches and pendent foliage appear as if traced out in light and lovely colours which are suffused with a rich warm tone from the blaze  we were now in the wilds of africa although as i have said i found it difficult to believe the fact  jack and i wore loose brown shooting coats and pantaloons but we had made up our minds to give up waistcoats and neckcloths so that our scarlet flannel shirts with turneddown collars gave to us quite a picturesque and brigandlike appearance as we encircled the blazepeterkin smoking vigorously for he had acquired that bad and very absurd habit at sea  jack smoked too but he was not so inveterate as peterkin  jack was essentially moderate in his nature  he did nothing violently or in a hurry but this does not imply that he was slow or lazy  he was leisurely in disposition and circumstances seldom required him to be otherwise  when peterkin or i had to lift heavy weights we were obliged to exert our utmost strength and agitate our whole frames but jack was so powerful that a comparatively slight effort was all that he was usually obliged to make  again when we two were in a hurry we walked quickly but jacks long limbs enabled him to keep up with us without effort  nevertheless there were times when he was called upon to act quickly and with energy  on those occasions he was as active as peterkin himself but his movements were tremendous  it was i may almost say awful to behold jack when acting under powerful excitement he was indeed a splendid fellow and not by any means deserving of the name of gorilla which peterkin had bestowed on him  but to continue my description of our costume  we all wore homespun grey trousers of strong material  peterkin and jack wore leggings in addition so that they seemed to have on what are now termed knickerbockers  peterkin however had no coat  he preferred a stout grey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist in the form of a tunic  our tastes in headdress were varied  jack wore a porkpie cap peterkin and i had wideawakes  my facetious little companion said that i had selected this species of hat because i was always more than half asleep  being peculiar in everything peterkin wore his wideawake in an unusual mannernamely turned up at the back down at the front and curled very much up at the sides  we were so filled with admiration of jacks magnificent beard and moustache that peterkin and i had resolved to cultivate ours while in africa but i must say that as i looked at peterkins face the additional hair was not at that time an improvement and i believe that much more could not have been said for myself  the effect on my little comrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise goodlooking face to appear extremely dirty  i wonder said peterkin after a long silence if we shall reach the niggers village in time for the hunt tomorrow  i fear that we have spent too much time in this wildgoose chase  wildgoose chase peterkin  i exclaimed  do you call hunting the gorilla by such a term  hunting the gorilla no certainly but looking for the gorilla in a part of the woods where no such beast was ever heard of since adam was a schoolboy  nay peterkin interrupted jack we are getting very near to the gorilla country and you must make allowance for the enthusiasm of a naturalist  ah we shall see where the naturalists enthusiasm will fly to when we actually do come face to face with the big puggy  well said i apologetically i wont press you to go hunting again ill be content to follow  press me my dear ralph exclaimed peterkin hastily fearing that he had hurt my feelings why man i do but jest with youyou are so horridly literal  im overjoyed to be pressed to go on the maddest wildgoose chase that ever was invented  my greatest delight would be to go gorillahunting down fleet street if you were so disposedbut to be serious jack do you think we shall be in time for the elephanthunt tomorrow  ay in capital time if you dont knock up  what  i knock up  ive a good mind to knock you down for suggesting such an egregious impossibility  thats an impossibility anyhow peterkin because im down already said jack yawning lazily and stretching out his limbs in a more comfortable and degage manner  peterkin seemed to ponder as he smoked his pipe for some time in silence  ralph said he looking up suddenly i dont feel a bit sleepy and yet im tired enough  you are smoking too much perhaps i suggested  its not that cried jack he has eaten too much supper  base insinuation retorted peterkin  then it must be the monkey  thats it  roast monkey does not agree with you  do you know i shouldnt wonder if you were right and its a pity too for we shall have to live a good deal on such fare i believe however i suppose we shall get used to itbut i say boys isnt it jolly to be out here living like savages  i declare it seems to me like a dream or a romancejust look ralph at the strange wild creepers that are festooned overhead and the great tropical leaves behind us and the clear sky above with the moonah the moon yes thats one comfortthe moon is unchanged  the same moon that smiles down upon us through a tangled meshwork of palmleaves and wild vines and monkeys tails is peeping down the chimneypots of london and edinburgh and dublin  why peterkin you must have studied hard in early life to be so good a geographer  rather observed peterkin  yes and look at the strange character of the treestems said i unwilling to allow the subject to drop  see those huge palmettoes likelike  overgrown cabbages suggested peterkin and he continued observe the quaint originality of form in the body and limbs of that bloated old spider that is crawling up your leg ralph  i started involuntarily for there is no creature of which i have a greater abhorrence than a spider  where is it oh  i see and the next moment i secured my prize and placed it with loathing but interest in my entomological box  at that moment a hideous roar rang through the woods seemingly close behind us  we all started to our feet and seizing our rifles which lay beside us ready loaded cocked them and drew close together round the fire  this wont do lads said jack after a few minutes breathless suspense during which the only sound we could hear was the beating of our own hearts we have allowed the fire to get too low and weve forgotten to adopt our friend the traders advice and make two fires  so saying jack laid down his rifle and kicking the logs with his heavy boot sent up such a cloud of bright sparks as must certainly have scared the wild animal whatever it was away for we heard no more of it that night  youre right jack remarked peterkin so let us get up a blaze as fast as we can and ill take the first watch not being sleepy  come along  in a few minutes we cut down with our axes a sufficient quantity of dry wood to keep two large fires going all night we then kindled our second fire at a few yards distant from the first and made our camp between them  this precaution we took in order to scare away the wild animals whose cries we heard occasionally during the night  peterkin having proposed to take the first watchfor we had to watch by turns all the night throughlighted his pipe and sat down before the cheerful fire with his back against the stem of a palmtree and his rifle lying close to his hand to be ready in case of a surprise  there were many natives wandering about in that neighbourhood some of whom might be ignorant of our having arrived at their village on a peaceful errand  if these should have chanced to come upon us suddenly there was no saying what they might do in their surprise and alarm so it behoved us to be on our guard  jack and i unrolled the light blankets that we carried strapped to our shoulders through the day and laying ourselves down side by side with our feet to the fire and our heads pillowed on a soft pile of sweetscented grass we addressed ourselves to sleep  but sleep did not come so soon as we expected  i have often noted with some surprise and much interest the curious phases of the phenomenon of sleep  when i have gone to bed excessively fatigued and expecting to fall asleep almost at once i have been surprised and annoyed to find that the longer i wooed the drowsy god the longer he refused to come to me and at last when i have given up the attempt in despair he has suddenly laid his gentle hand upon my eyes and carried me into the land of nod again when i have been exceedingly anxious to keep awake i have been attacked by sleep with such irresistible energy that i have been utterly unable to keep my eyelids open or my head erect and have sat with my eyes blinking like those of an owl in the sunshine and my head nodding like that of a chinese mandarin  on this our first night in the african bush at least our first night on a hunting expeditionwe had been many nights in the woods on our journey to that spoton this night i say jack and i could by no means get to sleep for a very long time after we lay down but continued to gaze up through the leafy screen overhead at the stars which seemed to wink at us i almost fancied jocosely  we did not speak to each other but purposely kept silence  after a time however jack groaned and said softly  ralph are you asleep  no said i yawning  im quite sure that peterkin is added jack raising his head and looking across the fire at the halfrecumbent form of our companion  is he said peterkin in a low tone  just about as sound as a weasel  jack said i  well  i cant sleep a wink  yeaow isnt it odd  no more can i  do you know ralph ive been counting the red berries in that tree above me for half an hour in the hope that the monotony of the thing would send me off but i was interrupted by a small monkey who has been sitting up among the branches and making faces at me for full twenty minutes  there it is yet i believe  do you see it  no where  almost above your head  i gazed upward intently for a few minutes until i thought i saw the monkey but it was very indistinct  gradually however it became more defined then to my surprise it turned out to be the head of an elephant  i was not only amazed but startled at this  get your rifle jack said i in a low whisper  jack made some sort of reply but his voice sounded hollow and indistinct  then i looked up again and saw that it was the head of a hippopotamus not that of an elephant which was looking down at me curiously enough i felt little or no surprise at this and when in the course of a few minutes i observed a pair of horns growing out of the creatures eyes and a bushy tail standing erect on the apex of its head i ceased to be astonished at the sight altogether and regarded it as quite natural and commonplace  the object afterwards assumed the appearance of a lion with a crocodiles bail and a serpent with a monkeys head and lastly of a gorilla without producing in me any other feeling than that of profound indifference  gradually the whole scene vanished and i became totally oblivious  this state of happy unconsciousness had scarcely lastedit seemed to metwo minutes when i was awakened by peterkin laying his hand on my shoulder and saying  now then ralph its time to rouse up  o peterkin said i in a tone of remonstrance how could you be so unkind as to waken me when i had just got to sleep  shabby fellow  just got to sleep say you  youve been snoring like an apoplectic alderman for exactly two hours  you dont say so  i exclaimed getting into a sitting posture  indeed you have  im sorry to rouse you but times up and im sleepy so rub your eyes man and try to look a little less like an astonished owl if you can  i have just replenished both the fires so you can lean your back against that palmtree and take it easy for threequarters of an hour or so  after that youll have to heap on more wood  i looked at jack who was now lying quite unconscious breathing with the slow deep regularity of profound slumber and with his mouth wide open  what a chance for some waggish baboon to drop a nut or a berry in said peterkin winking at me with one eye as he lay down in the spot from which i had just risen  he was very sleepy poor fellow and could hardly smile at his own absurd fancy  he was asleep almost instantly  in fact i do not believe that he again opened the eye with which he had winked at me but that he merely shut the other and began to slumber forthwith  i now began to feel quite interested in my responsible position as guardian of the camp  i examined my rifle to see that it was in order and capped then leaning against the palmtree which was as it were my sentrybox i stood erect and rubbed my hands and took off my cap so that the pleasant night air might play about my temples and more effectually banish drowsiness  in order to accomplish this more thoroughly i walked round both fires and readjusted the logs sending up showers of sparks as i did so  then i went to the edge of the circle of light in the centre of which our camp lay and peered into the gloom of the dark forest  there was something inexpressibly delightful yet solemn in my feelings as i gazed into that profound obscurity where the great treestems and the wild gigantic foliage nearest to me appeared ghostlike and indistinct and the deep solitudes of which were peopled not only with the strange fantastic forms of my excited fancy but as i knew full well with real wild creatures both huge and small such as my imagination at that time had not fully conceived  i felt awed almost oppressed with the deep silence around and i must confess looked somewhat nervously over my shoulder as i returned to the fire and sat down to keep watch at my post    chapter three  wherein i mount guard and how i did it etcetera  now it so happened that the battle which i had to fight with myself after taking my post was precisely the converse of that which i fought during the earlier part of that night  then it was a battle with wakefulness now it was a struggle with sleep and of the two fights the latter was the more severe by far  i began by laying down my rifle close by my side leaning back in a sitting posture against the palmtree and resigning myself to the contemplation of the fire which burned merrily before me while i pondered with myself how i should best employ my thoughts during the three long hours of my watch  but i had not dwelt on that subject more than three minutes when i was rudely startled by my own head falling suddenly and heavily forward on my chest  i immediately roused myself ah  ralph ralph said i to myself in a whisper this wont do lad to sleep at your post shame on you  had you been a sentinel in time of war that nod would have cost you your life supposing you to have been caught in the act  soliloquising thus i arose and shook myself  then i slapped my chest several times and pulled my nose and sat down again  only a few minutes elapsed before the same thing occurred to me again so i leaped up and mended the fires and walked to and fro until i felt thoroughly awake but in order to make sure that it should not occur again i walked to the edge of the circle of light and gazed for some time into the dark forest as i had done before  while standing thus i felt my knees give way as if they had been suddenly paralysed and i awoke just in time to prevent myself falling to the ground  i must confess i was much amazed at this for although i had often read of soldiers falling asleep standing at their posts i had never believed the thing possible  i now became rather anxious for thought i if i go to sleep and the fires die down who knows but wild beasts may come upon us and kill us before we can seize our arms  for a moment or two i meditated awaking jack and begging him to keep me company but when i reflected that his watch was to come immediately after mine i had not the heart to do it no said i and i said it aloud for the purpose of preventing drowsinessno i will fight this battle alone  i will repeat some stanzas from my favourite authors  yes i will try to remember a portion of a midsummernights dream  it will be somewhat appropriate to my present circumstances  big with this resolve i sat down with my face to the fire and my back to the palmtree andfell sound asleep instantly  how long i lay in this condition i know not but i was suddenly awakened by a yell so appalling that my heart leaped as if into my throat and my nerves thrilled with horror  for one instant i was paralysed then my blood seemed to rebound on its course  i sprang up and attempted to seize my rifle  the reader may judge of my state of mind when i observed that it was gone  i leaped towards the fire and grasping a lighted brand turned round and glared into the woods in the direction whence the yell came  it was grey dawn and i could see things pretty distinctly but the only living object that met my gaze was peterkin who stood with my rifle in his hand laughing heartily  i immediately turned to look at jack who was sitting up in the spot where he had passed the night with a sleepy smile on his countenance  why whats the meaning of this  i inquired  the meaning of it cried peterkin as he advanced and restored the rifle to its place  a pretty fellow you are to mount guard we might have been all murdered in our sleep by niggers or eaten alive by gorillas for all that you would have done to save us  but peterkin said i gravely you ought not to have startled me so you gave me a terrible fright  people have been driven mad before now i assure you by practical jokes  my dear fellow cried peterkin with much earnestness i know that as well as you  but in the first place you were guilty of so heinous a crime that i determined to punish you and at the same time to do it in a way that would impress it forcibly on your memory and in the second place i would not have done it at all had i not known that your nerves are as strong as those of a drayhorse  you ought to be taking shame to yourself on account of your fault rather than objecting to your punishment  peterkin is right my boy said jack laughing though i must say he had need be sure of the nerves of any one to whom he intends to administer such a ferocious yell as that  anyhow i have no reason to complain for you have given me a good long sleep although i cant say exactly that you have taken my watch  it will be broad daylight in half an hour so we must be stirring comrades  on considering the subject i admitted the force of these remarks and felt somewhat crestfallen  no doubt my companions had treated the thing jocularly and to say truth there was much that was comical in the whole affair but the more i thought of it the more i came to perceive how terrible might have been the consequences of my unfaithfulness as a sentinel  i laid the lesson to heart and i can truly say that from that day to this i have never again been guilty of the crime of sleeping at my post  we now busied ourselves in collecting together the dying embers of our fire and in preparing breakfast which consisted of tea hard biscuit and cold monkey  none of us liked the monkey not that its flesh was badquite the contrarybut it looked so like a small roasted baby that we could not relish it at all  however it was all we had for we had set off on this hunting excursion intending to live by our rifles but had been unfortunate having seen nothing except a monkey or two  the kettle was soon boiled and we sat down to our meagre fare with hearty appetites  while we are thus engaged i shall turn aside for a little and tell the reader in one or two brief sentences how we got to this place  we shipped in a merchant ship at liverpool and sailed for the west coast of africa  arrived there we found a party under the command of a portuguese trader about to set off to the interior  he could speak a little english so we arranged to go with him as far as he intended to proceed learn as much of the native language as possible while in his company and then obtain a native guide to conduct us to the country in which the gorillas are found  to this native guide we arranged should be explained by the trader our object in visiting the country so that he might tell the tribes whom we intended to visit  this we found was an absolutely needful precaution on the following ground  the natives of africa have a singular and very bad style of carrying on trade with the white men who visit their shores  the traffic consists chiefly of ivory barwood a wood much used in dyeing and indiarubber the natives of the far interior are not allowed to convey these commodities directly to the coast but by the law of the land which means the law of the strongest for they are absolute savages are obliged to deliver their goods to the care of the tribe next to them these pass them on to the next tribe and so on they go from tribe to tribe till they reach the coast where they are sold by the tribe there the price obtained which usually consists of guns powder and shot lookingglasses cloth and sundry other articles and trinkets useful to men in a savage state is returned to the owners in the far interior through the same channel but as each tribe deducts a percentage for its trouble the price dwindles down as it goes until a mere trifle sometimes nothing at all remains to be handed over to the unfortunate people of the tribe who originally sent off the goods for sale  of course such a system almost paralyses trade  but the intermediate tribes between the coast and the interior being the gainers by this system are exceedingly jealous of anything like an attempt to carry on direct trade  they are ready to go to war with the tribes of the interior should they attempt it and they throw all the opposition they can in the way of the few white men who ever penetrate the interior for such a purpose  it will thus be seen that our travels would be hindered very much if not stopped altogether and ourselves be regarded with jealousy or perhaps murdered if our motives in going inland were not fully and satisfactorily explained to the different tribes as we passed through their lands  and we therefore proposed to overcome the difficulty by taking a native guide with us from the tribe with which we should chance to be residing when obliged to separate from the portuguese trader  we had now reached this point  the day before that on which we encamped in the woods as above related we arrived at a native village and had been received kindly by the king  almost immediately after our arrival we heard so many stories about gorillas that i felt persuaded we should fall in with one if we went ahunting and being exceedingly anxious to add one to my collection of animalsfor i had a small museum at homei prevailed on jack and peterkin to go one days journey into the bush to look for them  they laughed very much at me indeed and said that we were still very far away from the gorilla country but i had read in some work on africa a remark to the effect that there is no cordillera or mountain range extending across the whole continent to limit the habitat of certain classes of animals and i thought that if any animal in africa would not consent to remain in one region when it wished to go to another that animal must be the ferocious gorilla  the trader also laughed at me and said that he had never seen any himself in that region and that we would have to cross the desert before seeing them  still i felt a disposition to try besides i felt certain that we should at least fall in with some sort of animals or plants or minerals that would be worth collecting so it was agreed that we should go out for a single day and be back in time for a great elephanthunt which was about to take place  but to return from this digression  having finished breakfast we made three bundles or packages of our blankets provisions and camp equipage strapped them on our backs and then shouldering our rifles set out on our return to the negro village  of course we gave jack the largest and heaviest bundle to carry peterkins and mine were about equal for although i was taller than peterkin i was not by any means so powerful or active  i often wondered at the great strength that lay in the little frame of my friend  to look at him no one would believe that he was such a tough wiry hardy little fellow  he was the same hearty jovial creature that i had lived with so pleasantly when he and jack and i were cast away on the coral island  with the exception of a small scrap of whisker on each cheek a scar over the right eye and a certain air of manliness there was little change in my old comrade  ralph said jack as we strode along through the forest do you remember how we three used to wander about together in the woods of our coral island  remember  i cried with enthusiasm for at that moment the thought occurred to my own mind how can i ever forget it jack  it seems to me just like yesterday  i can hardly believe that six long years have passed since we drank that delicious natural lemonade out of the green cocoanuts and wandered on the coral beach and visited penguin island and dived into the cave to escape the pirates  the whole scene rises up before me so vividly that i could fancy we were still there  ah these were happy times  so they were cried peterkin but dont you go and become sentimentally sad ralph when you talk of those happy days  if we were happy there are we not happy heretheres no change in usexcept indeed that jack has become a gorilla  ay and you a monkey retorted jack  true and ralph a naturalist which is the strangest beast of all added peterkincan you tell me ralph by the way what tree that is  im sure i cannot tell  never saw or heard of one like it before i replied looking at the tree referred to with some interest  it was a fine tree but the great beauty about it was the gorgeous fruit with which it was laden  it hung in the form of bunches of large grapes and was of the brightest scarlet colour  the glowing bunches seemed like precious gems glittering amongst the green foliage and i observed that a few monkeys and several parrots were peeping at us through the branches  it seems good for food said jack  youd better climb up peterkin and pull a few bunches  the puggies wont mind you of course being one of themselves  ralph said peterkin turning to me and deigning no reply to jack you call yourself a naturalist so i suppose you are acquainted with the habits of monkeys and can turn your knowledge to practical account  well i replied i know something about the monkey tribes but i cannot say that at this moment i remember any particular habit of which we might avail ourselves  do you not  well now thats odd  im a student of nature myself and i have picked up a little useful knowledge in the course of my travels  did you ever travel so far as the zoological gardens in london  of course i have done so often  and did you ever observe a peculiar species of monkey which when you made a face at it instantly flew into a towering passion and shook the bars of its cage until you expected to see them broken  yes said i laughing what then  look here you naturalist and ill put a wrinkle on your horn  yonder hangs a magnificent bunch of fruit that i very much desire to possess  but its too high to reach said i  but theres a monkey sitting beside it said peterkin  i see  you dont expect him to pull it and throw it down do you  oh no certainly not but here peterkin stepped up to the tree and looking up at the monkey said oooooo angrily  ooooooo replied the monkey stretching out its neck and looking down with an expression of surprise and indignation as if to say what on earth do you mean by that  ooooooo roared peterkin  hereupon the monkey uttered a terrific shriek of passion exposed all its teeth and gums glared at its adversary like a little fiend and seizing the branch with both hands shook it with all its might  the result was that not only did the coveted bunch of fruit fall to the ground but a perfect shower of bunches came down one of which hit jack on the forehead and bursting there sent its fragrant juice down his face and into his beard while the parrots and all the other monkeys took to flight shrieking with mingled terror and rage  you see im a practical man observed peterkin quietly as he picked up the fruit and began to eat it  knowledge is power my boy  a man with a philosophical turn of mind like yourself ought to have been up to a dodge of this sort  how capital this fruit is to be suredoes it make good pomade jack  excellent but as im not in the habit of using pomade i shall wash this out of my beard as quickly as possible  while jack went to a brook that ran close to where we stood i tasted the fruit and found it most excellent the pulp being juicy with a very pleasant flavour  while we were thus engaged a wild pig ran grunting past us  doesnt that remind you of some of our doings on the coral island ralph said peterkin  before i could reply a herd of lovely small gazelles flew past  our rifles were lying on the ground and before either of us could take aim the swift creatures were lost sight of in the thick underwood  peterkin fired one shot at a venture but without any result  we were still deploring our stupidity in not having our rifles handy when a strange sound was heard in the distance  by this time jack had come up so we all three seized our rifles and listened intently  the sound was evidently approaching  it was a low dull booming roar which at one moment seemed to be distant thunder at another the cry of some huge animal in rage or pain  presently the beating of heavy hoofs on the turf and the crash of branches were heard  each of us sprang instinctively towards a tree feeling that if danger were near its trunk would afford us some protection  being ignorant as yet of the cries of the various wild beasts inhabiting those woods we were greatly at a loss to determine what creature it could be that approached at such headlong speed  that its mad career was caused by fear soon became apparent for the tones of terror either in man or beast when distinctly heard cannot be mistaken  immediately in front of the spot where we stood was an open space or glade of considerable extent  towards this the animal approached as was evident from the increasing loudness of its wild roar which was almost continuous  in another moment the thick wall of underwood at its farther extremity was burst asunder with a crash and a wild buffalo bull bounded into the plain and dashed madly across  on its neck was crouched a leopard which had fixed its claws and teeth deep in the flesh of the agonised animal  in vain did the bull bound and rear toss and plunge  at one moment it ran like the wind the next it stopped with such violence as to tear up the turf and scatter it around  then it reared almost falling back anon it plunged and rushed on again with the foam flying from its mouth and its bloodshot eyes glaring with the fire of rage and terror while the woods seemed to tremble with its loud and deeptoned bellowing  twice in its passage across the open glade it ran in its blind fury straight against a tree almost beating in its skull and for a moment arresting its progress but it instantly recovered the shock and burst away again as madly as ever  but no effort that it was capable of making could relieve the poor creature from its deadly burden or cause the leopard in the slightest degree to relax its fatal gripe  it chanced that the wild bulls mad gallop was in a direction that brought it within a few yards of the spot where we stood so we prepared to put an end to its misery  as it drew near jack who was in advance raised his rifle  i being only a short distance from him also made ready to fire although i confess that in the agitation of the moment i could not make up my mind whether i should fire at the buffalo or the leopard  as far as i can recall my rapid and disjointed thoughts on that exciting occasion i reasoned thus if i shoot the leopard the bull will escape and if i shoot the bull the leopard will escape  it did not occur to me at that trying moment when selfpossession and decision were so necessary that i might shoot the bull with one barrel and the leopard with the other  still less did it occur to me that i might miss bull and leopard altogether  while i was engaged in this hurried train of troubled thought jack fired both barrels of his rifle one after the other as quickly as possible  the bull stumbled forward upon its knees  in order to make assurance doubly sure i aimed at its head and fired both barrels at once  instantly the bull rose with a hideous bellow and stood for one moment irresolute glaring at its new enemies  the leopard i observed was no longer on its back  at this moment i heard an exclamation of anger and looking round i observed peterkin struggling violently in the grasp of one of the wild vines or thorny plants which abound in some parts of the african forests and render them almost impassable  it seems that as the bull drew near peterkin who like jack and me was preparing to shoot found that a dense thicket came between him and the game so as to prevent his firing  he leaped nimbly over a bush intending to run to another spot whence he could more conveniently take aim but found himself as i have related suddenly entangled among the thorns in such a way that the more he struggled the more firmly he became ensnared  being of an impatient disposition he did struggle violently and it was this probably that attracted the attention of the bull and decided its future course and its ultimate fate for after remaining one moment as i have stated in an irresolute attitude it turned suddenly to the left and rushed with its head down and its tail up straight at peterkin  i cannot describe the sensations that overwhelmed me on observing the imminent danger of my friend  horror almost overwhelmed me as i gazed with a stare of fascination at the frightful brute which with flashing eyes and bloody foam dripping from its mouth charged into the thicket and crashed through the tough boughs and bushes as if they were grass a film came over my eyes  i tried to reload my rifle but my trembling hand refused to act and i groaned with mingled shame and despair on finding myself thus incapable of action in the hour of extreme peril at that moment i felt i would joyfully have given my own life to have saved that of peterkin  it takes me long to describe it but the whole scene passed with the rapidity almost of a flash of light  jack did not even attempt to load but uttering a fearful cry he sprang towards our friend with a bound like that of an enraged tiger  a gleam of hope flashed through my soul as i beheld his gigantic form dash through the underwood  it seemed to me as if no living creature could withstand such a furious onset  alas for peterkin had his life depended on jack strong and lionlike though he was  his aid could not have been in time  a higher power nerved his arm and steeled his heart at that terrible moment  as i gazed helplessly at peterkin i observed that he suddenly ceased his struggles to get free and throwing forward the muzzle of his piece stood boldly up and awaited the onset with calm selfpossession  the bull was on him almost in an instant  one stride more and he would have been lost but that stride was never taken  his rifle poured its deadly charge into the skull of the wild bull which fell a mass of dead flesh literally at his feet  it were vain to attempt to describe the state of our feelings on this memorable occasionthe fervour with which we thanked our heavenly father for our friends deliverancethe delight with which we shook his hands again and again and embraced him  it was with considerable difficulty that we extricated peterkin from his entanglement  when this was accomplished we proceeded to examine our prize  we were not a little puzzled on discovering that only three bullets had struck the bull  for my part i fired straight at its forehead and had felt certain at the time that my shots had taken effect yet there was but one ball in the animals head and that was undoubtedly peterkins for the hair all round the hole was singed off so near had it been to him when he fired  the other two shots were rather wide apartone in the shoulder the other in the neck  both would have proved mortal in the long run but neither was sufficiently near to a vital spot to kill speedily  now ralph my boy said jack after our excitement was in some degree abated you and i must divide the honour of these two shots for i fear we cant tell which of us fired them  peterkin only fired once and that was pretty effectual  yes i replied it is rather perplexing for although i have no objection whatever to your having all the honour of those two shots still one likes to know with certainty who actually made them  youd better toss for them suggested peterkin who was seated on the trunk of a fallen tree examining with a somewhat rueful countenance the tattered condition of his garments  there would not be much satisfaction in that replied jack laughing  it is probable said i that each of us hit with one barrel and missed with the other  and it is possible added jack that one of us hit with both and the other missed with both  all that i can positively affirm is that i fired both barrels at his shoulderone after the other  and all that i am certain of said i is that i fired both barrels at his forehead and that i discharged them both at once  did you said peterkin looking up quickly then ralph im afraid you must give all the honour to jack for you have missed altogether  how do you know that  i asked in a somewhat piqued tone  simply enough  if you fired both shots together at so short a distance they would have been found close together wherever they had struck whereas the two shots in the neck and shoulder are more than two feet apart  i was compelled to admit that there was much truth in the observation but still felt unwilling to give up all claim to having assisted in slaying our first buffalo  i pondered the subject a good deal during the remainder of the time we spent in cutting up and packing part of the buffalo meat and in preparing to continue our journey but could come at no satisfactory conclusion in my own mind and to say truth i felt not a little crestfallen at my conduct in the whole affair  while wandering in this mood near the spot where the buffalo had been first wounded i received a sudden and severe start on observing the leopard crouching within a couple of yards of me  i saw it through the bushes quite distinctly but could not make quite sure of its attitude with a mingled cry of alarm and astonishment i sprang back to the place where i had left my rifle  jack and peterkin instantly ran up with their pieces cocked  where is it they cried in a breath  there crouching just behind that bush  jack darted forward  crouching he cried with a loud laugh seizing the animal by the tail and dragging it forth why its deadstone dead  dead as mutton said peterkin  hallo whats this he added in surprise  two holes close together in its forehead i do declare hooray  ralph my boy give us your paw  youve missed the bull and hit the leopard  if you havent been and put two bullets right between its two eyes im a dutchman  and so in truth it turned out  i had aimed at the bull and hit the leopard  so i left that spot not a little pleased with my bad aim and my good fortune    chapter four  wherein will be found much that is philosophical  having skinned the leopard and cut off as much of the buffalo meat as we could carry we started for the negro village at a round pace for we had already lost much time in our last adventure  as we walked along i could not help meditating on the uncertainty of this life and the terrible suddenness with which we might at any unexpected moment be cut off  these thoughts led me naturally to reflect how important a matter it is that every one no matter how young should be in a state of preparedness to quit this world  i also reflected and not without a feeling of shame on my want of nerve and was deeply impressed with the importance of boys being inured from childhood to trifling risks and light dangers of every possible description such as tumbling into ponds and off trees etcetera in order to strengthen their nervous system  i do not of course mean to say that boys ought deliberately to tumble into ponds or climb trees until they fall off but they ought not to avoid the risk of such mishaps  they ought to encounter such risks and many others perpetually  they ought to practise leaping off heights into deep water  they ought never to hesitate to cross a stream on a narrow unsafe plank for fear of a ducking  they ought never to decline to climb up a tree to pull fruit merely because there is a possibility of their falling off and breaking their necks  i firmly believe that boys were intended to encounter all kinds of risks in order to prepare them to meet and grapple with the risks and dangers incident to mans career with cool cautious selfpossessiona selfpossession founded on experimental knowledge of the character and powers of their own spirits and muscles  i also concluded that this reasoning applies to some extent to girls as well as boys for they too are liable through life to occasional encounters with dangersuch as meeting with mad bulls being run away with on horseback being upset in boats being set on fire by means of crinoline in all of which cases those who have been trained to risk slight mishaps during early life will find their nerves equal to the shock and their minds cool and collected enough to look around and take hasty advantage of any opportunity of escape that may exist while those who have been unhappily nurtured in excessive delicacy and advised from the earliest childhood to take care of themselves and carefully avoid all risks will probably fall victims to their nervous alarms and the kind but injudicious training of parents or guardians  the more i pondered this subject the more deeply impressed did i become with its great importance to the wellbeing of mankind and i was so profoundly engrossed with it that my companions utterly failed to engage me in general conversation as we walked briskly along through the forest  jack again and again attempted to draw my attention to the splendour of the curious specimens of tropical foliage and vegetation through which we passed but i could not rouse myself to take interest therein  in vain did peterkin jest and rally me and point out the monkeys that grinned at us ever and anon as we passed beneath them or the serpents that glided more than once from our path i was fascinated with my train of meditation and as i could not then give it up until i had thought it out so now i cannot pass from the subject until i have at least endeavoured to guard myself from misconception  i beg then that it will be understood that i do not by any means inculcate harebrained recklessness or a course of training that will foster that state of mind  on the contrary the course of training which i should like to see universally practised would naturally tend to counteract recklessness for it would enable a boy to judge correctly as to what he could and could not do  take an illustration  a naturally bold boy has been unwisely trained to be exceedingly careful of himself he does not know the extent of his own courage or the power and agility of his own muscles he knows these things to some extent indeed but owing to restraint he does not know them fully  hence he is liable both to over and under estimate them  this bold boywe shall call him tomtakes a walk into the country with a friend whom we shall name pat  pat is a bad boy but he has been permitted to train his muscles as he pleased and his natural disposition has led him to do difficult and sometimes slightly dangerous things  you cant jump over that river tom says pat  perhaps not replies tom i never tried such a jump because my mother tells me never to go where i am likely to tumble into the water  oh your mothers a muff cries pat  pat says tom flushing with indignation and confronting his friend dont you ever say that again else the friendship between you and me will come to an end  i know you dont really mean what you say but i wont allow you to speak disrespectfully of my mother  well i wont says pat but youre a muff anyhow  perhaps i am replies tom  of course you are because youre afraid to jump over that river and im not  so here goes  pat thereupon jumps the river he is a splendid leaper and tom hesitates  come along tom dont be a hen  tom gives way alas to a disobedient impulse and dashing at the leap comes to the edge when he finds somehow that he has not got the proper foot first for the springalmost every boy knows the feeling i allude to his heart fails and he balks  o tom what a niminipimini muff you are to be sure  tom as i have said is a bold boy  his blood boils at this he rushes wildly at the bank hurls himself recklessly into the air barely reaches the opposite side with a scramble and falls souse into the river from which he issues as pat says amid peals of laughter like a halfdrowned rat  now had tom been permitted to follow the bent of his own bold impulses he would have found out years ago how far and how high he could leap and how far exactly he could depend on his own courage in certain circumstances and he would either on the one hand have measured the leap with an accustomed eye and declined to take it with a goodhumoured admission that it was beyond his powers or on the other hand he would calmly have collected his well and oft tried energies for the spring  the proper foot from long experience would have come to the ground at the right time  his mind freed from all anxiety as to what he could accomplish would have received a beneficial impulse from his friends taunt  no nervous dread of a ducking would have checked the completeness of his bound because he would have often been ducked before and would have discovered that in most cases if the clothes be changed at once a ducking is not worth mentioningfrom a hydropathic point of view is in fact beneficialand he would have cleared the river with comfort to himself and confusion to his friend and without a ducking or the uneasiness of conscience caused by the knowledge that he had disobeyed his mother  had peterkin not been trained to encounter danger his natural boldness alone would never have enabled him to stand the charge of that buffalo bull  there are muffs in this world  i do not refer to those hairy articles of female apparel in which ladies are wont to place their hands handkerchiefs and scentbottles  although not given to the use of slang i avail myself of it on this occasion the word muff being eminently expressive of a certain class of boys big as well as little old as well as young  there are three distinct classes of boysnamely muffs sensible fellows and boasters  i say there are three distinct classes but i do not say that every boy belongs to one or other of those classes  those who have studied chemistry know that natures elements are few  nearly all kinds of matter and certainly all varieties of mind are composite  there are no pure and simple muffs most boasters have a good deal of the muff in them and many muffs are boasters while sensible fellows are occasionally tinged with a dash of both the bad qualitiesthey are if i may be allowed to coin a word sensibleboastomuffers  still for the sake of lucidity i will maintain that there are three distinct phases of character in boys  the muff is a boy who from natural disposition or early training or both is mild diffident and gentle  so far he is an estimable character  were this all he were not a muff  in order to deserve that title he must be timid and unenthusiastic  he must refuse to venture anything that will subject him to danger however slight  he must be afraid of a shower of rain afraid of dogs in general good and bad alike disinclined to try bold things indifferent about learning to swim  he must object to the game called dumps because the blows from the ball are sometimes severe and be a sworn enemy to singlestick because the whacks are uncommonly painful  so feeling and acting he will when he becomes a man find himself unable to act in the common emergencies of lifeto protect a lady from insolence to guard his house from robbery or to save his own child should it chance to fall into the water  the muff is addicted to boasting sometimes especially when in the company of girls but when on the playground he hangs on the skirts of society and sings very small  there are many boys alas who are made muffs by injudicious training who would have grown up to be bold manly fellows had they been otherwise treated  there are also many kinds of muffs  some are goodhearted amiable muffs others are petty sneaking muffs  with many of the varieties i have a strong sympathy and for their comfort i would say that muffs may cure themselves if they choose to try energetically  courage and cowardice are not two distinct and entirely antagonistic qualities  to a great extent those qualities are the result of training  every courageous man has a slight amount of cowardice in his composition and all cowards have a certain infusion of courage  the matador stands before the infuriated bull and awaits its charge with unflinching firmness not because he has more courage than his comrades in the ring who run away but because long training has enabled him to make almost certain of killing the bull  he knows what he has done before he feels that he can do it again therefore he stands like a hero  were a doubt of his capacity to cross his mind for an instant his cheek would blanch his hand would tremble and ten to one he would turn and flee like the rest  let muffs therefore learn to swim to leap and to run  let them wrestle with boys bigger than themselves regardless of being thrown let them practise jinking with their companions so that if even they be chased by a mad bull they will if unable to get out of his way by running escape perhaps by jinking  let them learn to leap off considerable heights into deep water so that if ever called on to leap off the end of a pier or the side of a ship to save a fellowcreature they may do so with confidence and promptitude  let them even put on the gloves and become regardless of a swelled nose in order that they may be able to defend themselves or others from sudden assault  so doing they will become sensible fellows whose character i have thus to some extent described  of course i speak of sensible fellows only with reference to this one subject of training the nerves and muscles  let it never be forgotten that there are men who although sensible in this respect are uncommonly senseless in regard to other things of far higher moment  as to boasters i will dismiss them with a few words  they are too easily known to merit particular description  they are usually loud and bold in the drawingroom but rather mild in the field  they are desperately egotistical fond of exaggeration and prone to depreciate the deeds of their comrades  they make bad soldiers and sailors and are usually held in contempt by others whatever they may think of themselves  i may wind up this digressioninto which i have been tempted by an earnest desire to warn my fellowmen against the errors of nervous and muscular education which in my case led to the weak conduct of which i had been guilty that dayi may wind up this digression i say by remarking that the boys who are most loved in this world are those who are lambs almost muffs in the drawingroom but lions in the field  how long i should have gone on pondering this subject i know not but peterkin somewhat rudely interrupted me by uttering a wild scream and beginning to caper as if he were a madman  i was much alarmed as well as surprised at this course of conduct for although my friend was an inveterate joker he was the very reverse of what is termed a buffoon and never indulged in personally grotesque actions with a view to make people laughsuch as making faces a practice which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred causes the facemakers to look idiotical rather than funny and induces beholders to pity them and to feel very uncomfortable sensations  peterkins yells instead of ceasing continued and increased  why whats wrong  i cried in much alarm  instead of answering peterkin darted away through the wood like a maniac tearing off his clothes as he went  at the same moment jack began to roar like a bull and became similarly distracted  it now flashed across me that they must have been attacked by an army of the bashikouay ant a species of ant which is so ferocious as to prove a perfect scourge to the parts of the country over which it travels  the thought had scarcely occurred to me when i was painfully convinced of its accuracy  the ants suddenly came to me and in an instant i was covered from head to foot by the passionate creatures which hit me so severely that i also began to scream and to tear off my garments for i had been told by the trader who accompanied us to this part of the country that this was the quickest method of getting rid of them  we all three fled and soon left the army of bashikouay ants behind us undressing as we ran in the best way we could and when we at length came to a halt we found ourselves almost in a state of nudity  hastily divesting ourselves of the remainder of our apparel we assisted each other to clear away the ants though we could not rid ourselves of the painful effects of the bites with which we were covered  what dreadful villains gasped peterkin as he busied himself in hastily picking off the furious creatures from his person  it would be curious to observe the effect of an army of soldiers stepping into an army of bashikouays said jack  they would be routed instantly  no discipline or courage could hold them together for two minutes after they were attacked  i was about to make some reply when our attention was attracted by a shout at no great distance and in a few seconds we observed to our confusion the trader and a band of negroes approaching us  we hurried on our clothes as rapidly as possible and were a little more presentable when they arrived  they had a good laugh at us of course and the naked blacks seemed to be much tickled with the idea that we had been compelled to divest ourselves even for a short time of what they considered our unnecessary covering  we thought you were lost said the trader and i began to blame myself for letting you away into the woods where so many dangers may be encountered without a guide  but what have you got there meat of some kind  your guns seem to have done service on this your first expedition  ay that they have answered jack  weve killed a buffalo bull and if you send your black fellows back on our track for some hours theyll come to the carcass of which we could not of course bring very much away on our shoulders which are not accustomed yet to heavy loads  besides added peterkin we were anxious to get back in time for your elephanthunt else we should have brought more meat with us  but jack has not mentioned what i consider our chief prize the honour of shooting which belongs to my friend ralph rovercome ralph unfasten your pack and let them see it  although unwilling to put off more time i threw down my pack and untying it displayed my leopard skin  the shout of delight and surprise which the sight of it drew from the negroes was so enthusiastic that i at once perceived i was considered to have secured a great prize  why mr rover youre in luck said the trader examining the skin its not every day that one falls in with such a fine leopard as that and you have already made a reputation as a daring hunter for the niggers consider it a bold and dangerous thing to attack these critters theyre so uncommon fierce  indeed i do not by any means deserve such a reputation said i refastening my pack for the shot was entirely accidental so i pray you good sir to let the negroes know that as i have no desire to go under a false flag as my friend peterkin would say  go under a false flag exclaimed peterkin in contempt  sail under false colours man  thats what you should have said  whatever you do ralph never misquote a man  go under a false flag ha ha  why you might just as well have said progress beneath assumed bunting  well accidental or otherwise said the trader youve got credit for the deed and your fame will be spread among the tribe whether you will or not for these fellows are such incorrigible liars themselves that they will never believe you if you tell them the shot was accidental they will only give you credit for some strange though unknown motive in telling such a falsehood  while the trader was speaking i observed that the negroes were talking with the eager looks and gesticulations that are peculiar to the africans when excited and presently two or three of them came forward and asked several questions while their eyes sparkled eagerly and their black faces shone with animation as they pointed into the woods in the direction whence we had come  they want to know where you have left the carcass of the leopard and if you have taken away the brains said the trader turning to me  i daresay you knowif not youll soon come to find outthat all the nigger tribes in africa are sunk in gross and cruel superstitions  they have more fetishes and greegrees and amulets and wooden gods and charms than they know what to do with and have surrounded themselves with spiritual mysteries that neither themselves nor anybody else can understand  among other things they attach a very high value to the brains of the leopard because they imagine that he who possesses them will be rendered extraordinarily bold and successful in hunting  these fellows are in hopes that being ignorant of the value of leopard brains you have left them in the carcass and are burning with anxiety to be off after them  poor creatures said i they are heartily welcome to the brains and the carcass lies not more than four hours march from this spot i should thinkis it not so jack  my friend nodded assent and the trader turning to the expectant crowd of natives gave them the information they desired  no sooner had he finished than with loud cries they turned and darted away tossing their arms wildly in the air and looking more like to a band of scared monkeys than to human beings  theyre queer fellows remarked peterkin  so they are replied the trader and theyre kindly fellows too jovial and goodhumoured except when under the influence of their abominable superstitions  then they become incarnate fiends and commit deeds of cruelty that make ones blood run cold to think of  i felt much saddened by these remarks and asked the trader if the missionaries accomplished any good among them  oh yes he replied they do much good such of them at least as really are missionaries for it does not follow that every one who wears a black coat and white neckcloth and goes abroad is a missionary but what can a few men scattered along the coast here and there however earnest they be do among the thousands upon thousands of savages that wander about in the interior of africa  no good will ever be done in this land to any great extent until traders and missionaries go hand in hand into the interior and the system of trade is entirely remodelled  from what you remark said i feeling much interested i should suppose that you have given this subject a good deal of attention  i have  but there are people in this world who supposing that because i am a trader i am therefore prone to exalt trade to an equality with religion do not give me credit for disinterestedness when i speak perhaps you are one of these  not i in truth said i earnestly  my chief desire in conversing with mankind is to acquire knowledge i therefore listen with attention and respect to the opinions of others instead of endeavouring to assert my own  in the present instance being ignorant i have no opinions to assert  i wish there were more people in your country replied the trader who felt as you do  i would tell them that although a trader i regard the salvation of mens souls as the most important work in this world  i would argue that until you get men to listen you cannot preach the gospel to them that the present system of trade in africa is in itself antagonistic to religion being based upon dishonesty and that therefore the natives will not listen to missionariesof course in some cases they will for i believe that the gospel when truly preached is never preached in vainbut they will throw every possible impediment in their way  i would tell them that in order to make the path of the missionary practicable the system of trade must be inverted the trader and the missionary must go hand in hand and commerce and religionalthough incomparably different in their nature and endsmust act the part of brother and sister if anything great is to be done for the poor natives of africa  conversing thus we beguiled the time pleasantly while we proceeded rapidly on our way for the day was drawing to a close and we were still at a considerable distance from the native village    chapter five  preparations for a grand hunt  all was bustle noise and activity in the village or more correctly speaking in the native town of his majesty king jambai early in the morning after our arrival  a great elephanthunt had been resolved on the hunters were brushing up their spears and old gunsall of which latter were flintlocks that had been procured from traders and were not worth more than a few shillings  the women were busy preparing breakfast and the children were playing around their huts  these huts were of the simplest constructionmade of bamboo roofed with large palmleaves and open in front  the wants of savages are generally few their household furniture is very plain and there is little of it  a large hut near to that of his sable majesty had been set apart for the trader and his party during our residence at the town in this we had spent the night as pleasantly as we could but the mosquitoes kept up an unceasing warfare upon us so that daylight was welcomed gladly when it came  on going to the hut of king jambai who had invited us to breakfast with him we found the princess oninga alone seated in the kings armchair and smoking her pipe with uncommon gusto  she had spent the early part of the morning in preparing breakfast for her father and ourselves and was now resting from her labours  you are early astir princess oninga said the trader as we entered and took our seats round the fire for at that hour the air felt chilly  the princess took her pipe from her lips and admitted that she was blowing a long thin cloud of smoke into the air with a sigh of satisfaction  we are ready for breakfast added the trader  is the king at home  he is in the woods but will be back quickly  with this remark the princess rose and knocking the ashes out of her pipe left the tent  upon my word shes a cool beauty said peterkin  i should rather say a black one remarked jack  perhaps an odd one would be the most appropriate term said i  did you ever see such a headdress  the manner in which the princess oninga had seen fit to dress her head was indeed peculiar i may say ludicrous  her woolly hair had been arranged in the form of a cocked hat with a horn projecting in front and at a short distance off it might easily have been mistaken for the headpiece of a general officer minus the feathers  there was little in the way of artificial ornament about it but the princess wore a number of heavy brass rings on her arms and ankles  those on the latter reached halfway up to her knees and they were so heavy that her walk was little better than a clumsy waddle  before we could pass further comment on her appearance king jambai entered and saluted us by taking us each separately and rubbing noses with us  this done he ordered in breakfast which consisted of roast and boiled plantains ground nuts roast fowl and roast pig so we fell to at once and being exceedingly hungry after our long walk of the day before made a hearty meal  now sir said jack when our repast was about concluded as you are going to leave us soon you had better arrange with the king about getting us an interpreter and supplying us with a few men to carry our goods  i think you said there was once a man in the tribe who spoke a little english  have you found out whether he is alive  yes i have heard that he is alive and well and is expected in every day from a hunting expedition  he is a splendid hunter and a capital fellow  his name is makarooroo and if you get him you will be fortunate  then ask his black majesty said peterkin as quick as you please for to say truth im rather anxious on this point  i feel that we should never get on without a good interpreter  to our satisfaction we found that the king was quite willing to do all that we wished and a great deal more  in fact we soon perceived that he felt highly honoured by our visit and had boasted not a little of his white men to the chiefs of neighbouring tribes some of whom had come a considerable distance to see us  you have made quite a conquest gentlemen of worthy jambai said the trader after translating the kings favourable reply  the fact is he is pleased with the liberality you have shown towards him in the way of gifts and is proud of the confidence you have placed in him  had you been bent on a trading expedition he would have opposed your further progress but knowing that you are simply hunters he is anxious to assist you by all the means at his command  he is surprised indeed at your taking so much trouble and coming so far merely to kill wild animals for he cannot understand the idea of sporting  he himself hunts for the sake of procuring meat  can he not understand said peterkin that we hunt for fun  no he dont quite see through that  he said to me a few minutes ago have these men no meat at home that they come all this long way to get it  i told him that you had plenty and then endeavoured to explain your idea of hunting for fun  but he shook his head and i think he does not believe you  at this point in our conversation the king rose and gave the signal to set out on the hunting expedition  instantly the whole population of the town turned out and rushed to the banks of the river near which it stood where canoes were prepared for us  suddenly there arose a great shout and the name makarooroo makarooroo passed from mouth to mouth  presently a fine tall deepchested and broadshouldered negro stepped up to the king and laid a leopard skin at his feet while the people shouted and danced with delight at the success of their companion for as i have already stated it is deemed a bold feat to attack and slay a leopard singlehanded  while the commotion caused by this event was going on i said to the trader  how comes it that makarooroo can speak english  he spent a couple of years on the coast in the service of a missionary and during that time attended the missionary school where he picked up a smattering of english and a trifle of geography and arithmetic but although a stout sturdy hunter and an intelligent man he was a lazy student and gave the good missionary much trouble to hammer the little he knows into his thick skull  at last he grew tired of it and returned to his tribe but he brought his bible with him and i am told is very diligent in the study of it  his education has gained for him a great reputation as a fetishman or doctor of mysteries among his people  i used often to see him at school hammering away at ma maba ba and so on amid a group of children  he used to sit beside the king  the king said i in surprise  ay the king of that district became a christian and he and the queen with one or two others of the royal household used to attend school with the children every day and their diligence in studying the a b c was beyond all praise  but they were terribly stupid  the children beat them easily showing how true is the saying that youth is the time to learn  the king was always booby and makarooroo was always beside him  as the trader spoke makarooroo came forward and shook hands with him in the english fashion  he was then introduced to us and expressed his willingness to become our interpreter in somewhat curious but quite comprehensible english  as i looked at his intelligent goodnatured countenance i could not help thinking that the trader had underrated his intellectual powers  hes a funny dog that makarooroo said peterkin as our interpreter hastened away to fetch his rusty old gun and spears for he meant to join our hunting expedition although he had only that moment arrived from a long and fatiguing chase  do you think so said jack  i dont agree with you said i to me he seems rather of a grave and quiet disposition  o ralph what a bat you are  he was grave enough just now truly but did you not observe the twinkle in his eye when he spoke to us in english  depend on it hes a funny dog  there must be freemasonry then among funny dogs i retorted for jack and i dont perceive it  is this our canoe inquired jack of the trader  it is  then lets jump in  in a few seconds the river was crowded with a fleet of small canoes and we all paddled quickly up the stream which was sluggish at that part we did not intend to proceed more than a few miles by water as the place where game was expected was at some distance from the river  i felt some regret at this for the trip up the river was to me most enchanting  every yard we advanced new beauties of scenery were revealed to view the richness of the tropical vegetation seemed in this place to culminate it was so rank and gorgeous  the day was fine too and all the strangelooking creaturesugly and beautiful large and small peculiar to those regions seemed to have resolved on a general peace in order to bask in the sunshine and enjoy the glorious weather  man alone was bent on war and our track alas was marked with blood wherever we passed along  i pondered much on this subject and wondered at the bloodthirsty spirit which seems to be natural to man in all conditions and climes  then i thought of the difficulty these poor africans have at times in procuring food the frequency with which they are reduced almost to a state of starvation and i ceased to wonder that they shot and speared everything that came in their way  we proceeded up the left bank of the river keeping close in to the shore in order to obtain the protection of the overhanging boughs and foliage for the sun soon began to grow hot and in the middle of the day became so intense that i sometimes feared that i or my companions would receive a sunstroke  i confess that the subject of health often caused me much anxiety for although i knew that we were all old experienced travellersthough young in yearsand had become in a great degree inured to hardships i feared that the deadly climate of central africa might prove too much for our european constitutions  by the free use of quinine however and careful attention to the roles of health as far as circumstances would permit we were fortunate enough to keep in excellent health and spirits during the whole course of our sojourn there for which when i thought of the hundreds of europeans who had perished on that deadly coast without even venturing into the interior i felt very thankful  one of our chief delights to which i in a great degree attribute our uninterrupted health was bathing daily in the streams and ponds with which we fell in or on which we paddled during our travels  on these occasions we were fain however to be exceeding careful in the selection of our bathingpool as crocodiles and alligators and i know not what other hideous animals were constantly on the lookout for prey and i make no doubt would have been very ready to try the flavour of a morsel of english food had we given them the chance  on these occasions when we had made sure of our pool we were wont to paddle about in the cool refreshing stream and recall to mind the splendid dips we had had together six years before in the clear waters of the coral island  since that time peterkin had learned to swim well which was not only a source of much satisfaction and gratification to himself now but he told me had been the means of preserving not only his own life on more than one occasion but the life of a little child which he had the good fortune to rescue from drowning when cruising off the island of madagascar  peterkin used to speak very strongly when talking on this subject and i observed from the unusual seriousness of his manner that he felt deeply too  ralph he said to me one day half the world is madi am not sure that i might not say threequarters of the world is madand im quite certain that all the ladies in the world are mad with the exception of the brown ladies of the south seas and a few rare specimens elsewhere theyre all mad together in reference to the matter of swimming  now that i have learned it nothing is so easy and any one who is not as blind as a rheumatic owl must see that nothing is more important for every one almost is subject to being pitched now and then into deep water and if he cant swim its all up with him  why every time an angler goes out to fish he runs the chance of slipping and being swept into a deep hole where if he cannot swim he is certain to be drowned and yet five strokes would save his life  good swimming is by no means what is wanted swimming of any kind however poor is all that is desiderated  every time a lady goes to have a row on a lake she is liable to be upset by the clumsiness of those who accompany her and although it may be close to shore if she cannot swim down she goes to the bottom  and floating wont do  some ladies delude themselves with the idea that floating is of great value  in nine cases out of ten it is of no value at all for unless water be perfectly smooth and still a person cannot float so as to keep the waves from washing over the face in which case choking is the certain result  there is no excuse for not learning to swim  in most large cities there are swimmingbaths if the sea is not available a river is everywhere  i tell you what it is ralph people who dont learn to swim arearei was going to say asses but that would be an insult to the muchmaligned longeared animal and parents who dont teach their offspring to swim deserve to be drowned in buttermilk and i wish i sawno i dont quite wish i saw them all drowned in that way but i do wish that i could impress upon mankind over the length and breadth of this rotund world the great the immense the intense importance of boys and girls being taught to swim  you make use of strong language said i  quite a powerful orator added jack laughing  bah exclaimed peterkin your reception of this grand truth is but a type of the manner in which it will be received by the pigheaded world whats the use of preaching common sense  im a perfect donkey  nay peterkin said jack i appreciate what you say and have no doubt whatever that your remarks if made public would create quite a revolution in the juvenile world and convert them speedily into aquatic animals  did you ever think of sending your views on that subject to the times  the times cried peterkin  yes the times why not  because said peterkin slowly i once sent a letter to that great but insolent periodical and what do you think it did  cant tell im sure  took no notice of it whatever said peterkin with a look of ineffable disgust  but to return from this digression  i was much struck with the splendid contrast of colours that met my eye everywhere here  the rich variety of greens in the different trees harmonised with the bright pink plums and scarlet berries and these latter were almost dimmed in their lustre by the bright plumage of the birds which i felt intense longing to procure many of them being quite new to me and i am certain totally unknown to naturalists while others i recognised with delight as belonging to several of the species of which i had read in ornithological works  i tried hard to shoot several of these lovely creatures intending to stuff them but to my regret was utterly unable to hit them  seeing this peterkin took pity on me and sitting down in the bow of our canoe picked off all the birds i pointed out to him as we passed with unerring precision  most of them fell into the water and were easily secured while one or two toppled off the branches into the canoe  several of them he shot on the winga feat which even filled jack with surprise and so astounded the natives that they surrounded our canoe at last and gazed openmouthed at my friend whom they evidently regarded as the greatest fetishman that had ever come amongst them  he was obliged to stop at last and lay down his gun in order to make the natives cease from crowding round us and delaying our voyage  a number of iguanas were observed on the branches of the trees that overhung the stream  they dropped into the water as we approached but the natives succeeded in spearing a good many and i afterwards found that they considered them excellent food  if i was charmed with the birds peterkin was no less delighted with the monkeys that chattered at us as we passed along  i never saw a man laugh as he did that day  he almost became hysterical so much was he tickled with their antics and the natives who have a keen sense of the ludicrous seemed quite to sympathise with his spirit although of course what amused him could not have similarly affected them seeing that they were used to monkeys from infancy  theres something new exclaimed jack as we rounded a bend in the river and came in view of an open flat where it assumed somewhat the aspect of a pond or small lake  he pointed to a flock of birds standing on a low rock which i instantly recognised to be pelicans  surely said i pelicans are not new to you  certainly not but if you look a little more attentively i think you will find material for your notebook  jack was right  i observed a very fine fishhawk circling over the head of one of the pelicans  its head and neck were white and its body was of a reddish chocolate colour  just as we came in sight the pelican caught a fine fish which it stowed away safe in the pouch under its chin  the sly hawk which had been watching for this immediately made a descent towards its victim making a considerable noise with its wings as it came down  hearing this the pelican looked hastily up and supposing that a terrible and deadly assault was about to be made opened its mouth and screamed in terror  this was just what the hawk wanted  the open bill revealed the fish in the pouch  down he swooped snatched it out and then soared away with his illgotten gains in his talons  oh what a thief exclaimed peterkin  and the pelican seems to take his loss in a remarkably philosophical manner observed jack  to my surprise the great stupid bird instead of flying away as i had expected quietly resumed his fishing as if nothing had happened  no doubt he was well pleased to find himself still alive and it is not improbable that the hawk made several more meals at the expense of his longbeaked friend after we had passed by  we soon put him to flight however by landing near the spot where he stood this being the place where we were to quit our canoes and pass through the jungle on foot  the hunters now prepared themselves for action for the recent tracks of elephants were seen on the bank of the stream and the natives said they could not be far off  jack and peterkin were armed with immensely heavy rifles which carried balls of the weight of sixounces  i carried my trusty doublebarrelled fowlingpiece which is of the largest size and which i preferred to a rifle because not being a good shot i resolved on all occasions to reserve my fire until we should come to close quarters with game leaving my more expert comrades to take the longer shots  we had also two nativesone being our guide makarooroo who carried jack and peterkins doublebarrelled guns as a reserve  these were loaded of course with ball  this looks something like business said jack as he leaned on his heavy rifle and looked at the natives who were selecting their spears and otherwise making preparations  it does replied peterkin  are you loaded  ay and i have just examined the caps to see that they are dry for its not like grouseshooting on the scottish hills this african hunting depend upon it  a snapping cap might cost us our lives ralph my boy you must keep well in rear  i dont want to hurt your feelings but it wont do to go in front when you cannot depend on your nerves  i experienced a feeling of sadness not unmingled with shame as my friend said this but i could not question the justness of his remark and i knew well that he would not have made it at all but for his anxiety lest i should run recklessly into danger which i might find myself when too late unable to cope with  i was careful however to conceal my feelings as i replied with a smile  you are right jack  i shall act the part of a support while you and peterkin skirmish in advance  and be careful said peterkin solemnly that you dont fire into us by mistake  somewhat of peterkins own spirit came over me as i replied indeed i have been thinking of that and im not sure that i can restrain myself when i see a chimpanzee monkey and a gorilla walking through the woods before me  i think wed better take his gun from him suggested jack  at this moment the king gave the signal to advance so we shouldered our weapons and joined him  as we walked rapidly along jack suggested that we should allow the natives to kill any elephants we might fall in with in their own way so as to observe how they managed it rather than try to push ourselves forward on this our first expedition  we all agreed to this and shortly after we came to the place which elephants were known to frequent  here great preparations had evidently been made for them  a space of more than a mile was partially enclosed by what might be termed a vine wall  the huge thorny creeping vines had been torn down from the trees and woven into a rude sort of network through which it was almost impossible for any animal except an elephant to break  this was intendednot to stop the elephant altogether but to entangle and retard him in his flight until the hunters could kill him with their spears  the work we were given to understand was attended with considerable danger for some of the natives were occasionally caught by the thorny vines when flying from the charge of the infuriated animal and were instantly stamped to death by his ponderous feet  i felt a new and powerful excitement creep over me as i saw the natives extend themselves in a wide semicircle of nearly two miles in extent and begin to advance with loud shouts and cries in order to drive the game towards the vines and the flashing eyes and compressed lips of my two companions showed that they were similarly affected  we determined to keep together and follow close on that part of the line where the king was  you no be fraid said makarooroo looking down at peterkin who he evidently supposed was neither mentally nor physically adapted for an african hunter  peterkin was so tickled with the question that he suddenly began to tremble like an aspen leaf and to chatter with his teeth and display all the symptoms of abject terror  pointing over makarooroos shoulder into the bush behind him he gasped the leopard  the negro uttered a hideous yell and springing nearly his own height into the air darted behind a tree with the agility of a wildcat  instantly peterkin resumed his composure and turning round with a look of cool surprise said  what youre not afraid makarooroo  the goodhumoured fellow burst into a loud laugh on perceiving the practical joke that had been passed on him and it was evident that the incident trifling though it was had suddenly raised his estimation of peterkin to a very exalted pitch  we now began to draw near to the enclosure and i was beginning to fear that our hunt was to prove unsuccessful that day  a considerable quantity of small game had passed us alarmed by the cries of the natives but we purposely withheld our fire although i saw that jack was sorely tempted once or twice when several beautiful gazelles and one or two wild pigs ran past within shot  presently we heard a shrill trumpeting sound which peterkin who had hunted in the forests of ceylon told us in an excited voice was the cry of the elephant  we hastened forward with our utmost speed when suddenly we were brought to a stand by hearing a tremendous roar close in front of us  immediately after a large male lion bounded from among the bushes and with one stroke of his enormous paw struck down a negro who stood not twenty yards from us  the terrible brute stood for an instant or two lashing his sides with his tail and glaring defiance  it chanced that i happened to be nearest to him and that the position of the tangled underwood prevented my companions from taking good aim so without waiting for them being anxious to save if possible the life of the prostrate negro i fired both barrels into the lions side  giving utterance to another terrible roar he bounded away into the bush scattering the negroes who came in his way and made his escape to our great disappointment  we found to our horror on going up to the fallen hunter that he was quite dead  his skull had been literally smashed in as if it had received a blow from a sledgehammer  i cannot describe my feelings on beholding thus for the first time the king of beasts in all the savage majesty of strength and freedom coupled with the terrible death of a human being  my brain was in a whirl of excitement i scarce knew what i was doing  but i had no time to think for almost immediately after firing the shots at the lion two elephants came crashing through the bushes  one was between ten and eleven feet high the other could not have been less than twelve feet i had never seen anything like this in the menageries of england and their appearance as they burst thus suddenly on my vision was something absolutely appalling  those who have only seen the comparatively small and sluggish animals that are wont to ring their bells to attract attention and to feed on gingerbread nuts from the hands of little boys can form no idea of the terrible appearance of the gigantic monsters of africa as they go tearing in mad fury through the forests with their enormous ears and tails and trunks erect their ponderous tusks glistening in the sunshine and their wicked little eyes flashing like balls of fire as they knock down rend asunder and overturn all that comes in their way  the two that now approached us in full career were flying before a crowd of negroes who had already fixed a number of spears in their sides from which the blood was flowing copiously  to say that the bushes went down before them like grass would not give a correct idea of the ponderous rush of these creatures  trees of three and four inches diameter were run against and snapped off like twigs without proving in any degree obstructive  by this time the negroes had crowded in from all sides and as the elephants approached the place where we stood a perfect cloud of spears and javelins descended on their devoted sides  i observed that many of the active natives had leaped up into the trees and discharged their spears from above while others crouching behind fallen trees or bushes threw them from below so that in a few seconds dozens of spears entered their bodies at every conceivable angle and they appeared as if suddenly transformed into monstrous porcupines or hedgehogs  there was something almost ludicrous in this but the magnitude and aspect of the animals were too terrible and our danger was too imminent to permit anything like comic ideas to enter our brains  i observed too that the natives were perfectly wild with excitement  their black faces worked convulsively and their white eyes and teeth glittered as they leaped and darted about in a state of almost perfect nudity so that their aspect was quite demoniacal  the suddenness and violence of the attack made near to us had the effect of turning the elephants aside and the next instant they were tearing and wrenching themselves through the meshes of the tough and thorny vines  the natives closed in with wild cries and with redoubled energy nothing surprised me so much as to observe the incredible number of spears that were sticking all over these creatures and the amount of blood that they lost without any apparent diminution of strength resulting  it seemed as if no human power could kill them and at that moment i almost doubted peterkins assertion that he had while in ceylon actually killed elephants with a single ball  while jack and peterkin and i were gazing in deep interest and surprise at the curious struggle going on before us and holding ourselves in readiness to act should there be any chance of our game escaping the larger of the two elephants succeeded in disentangling himself by backing out of the snare  he then wheeled round and charged straight at king jambai who stood close to us with incredible fury  the beast as it came on with the bristling spears all over it the blood spirting from its innumerable wounds and trumpeting shrill with rage seemed to me like some huge unearthly phantom  it was with difficulty i could believe the whole scene other than a hideous dream  jambai launched his javelin into the animals chest and then turned and fled  the other natives also darted and scattered hither and thither so that the elephant could not make up its mind on which of its enemies to wreak its vengeance  we too turned and took to our heels at once with right good will  all at once i heard jack utter a wild shout or yell very unlike to anything i ever heard from him before  i looked back and saw that his foot had got entangled in a thorny shrub and that the elephant was making at him  to this day i have never been able to account for the remarkable condition of mind and body that ensued on this occasion  instead of being paralysed as i had been when peterkin was in imminent danger all sensation of fear or hesitancy seemed to vanish on thine instant  i felt my nerves and muscles strung as it were and rendered firm as a rock and with calm deliberation yet with the utmost rapidity of which i was capable i turned round sprang between jack and the enraged beast and presented my piece at his head  right in the centre of his forehead gasped jack as he endeavoured to wrench his foot from the entanglement  at that moment i observed peterkin leap to my side the next instant the report of both our guns rang through the woods the elephant bounded completely over jack as peterkin and i leaped to either side to let it pass and fell to the ground with such violence that a tree about six inches thick against which it struck went down before it like a willow wand  we immediately assisted jack to extricate himself but we had no time to congratulate ourselves on our narrow escape for mingled shouts and yells from the men in the bushes ahead apprised us that some new danger menaced them in that direction  reloading as fast as we could we hastened forward and soon gained the new scene of battle  here stood the other elephant trying to break down a small tree up which king jambai had climbed partly for safety and partly in order to dart a javelin down on the brute as it passed  this was a common custom of the natives but the king who was a bold reckless man had neglected to take the very necessary precaution of selecting a strong tree  the elephant seemed actually to have observed this for instead of passing on it suddenly rushed headlong against the tree and began to break it down  when we came up the beast was heaving and straining with all its might the stout tree was cracking and rending fearfully so that the king could scarcely retain his position on it  the natives were plying their spears with the utmost vigour but although mortally wounded it was evident that in a few more seconds the elephant would succeed in throwing down the tree and trample the king to death  peterkin instantly sprang forward but jack laid his hand on his shoulder  its my turn this time lad he cried and leaping towards the monster he placed the muzzle of his rifle close to its shoulder and sent a sixounce ball right through its heart  the effect was instantaneous  the elephant fell to the ground a mountain of dead flesh  the delight of the negroes at this happy termination of the battle was excessive  they leaped and laughed and danced like insane men and we had much ado to prevent them seizing us in their arms and rubbing noses with us  as we had not commenced the hunt until well on in the day evening was now closing in so the king gave orders to encamp on a dry rising ground not far distant where the jungle was less dense and thither we all repaired the natives bringing in all the game and cutting up the elephants in a very short space of time  your shot was not such a bad one this time ralph observed peterkin as we three stood looking at the large elephant which the natives were cutting up  there they are just above the proboscis  but let me warn you never again to venture on such a foolhardy thing as to fire in the face of a charging elephant unless you are a dead shot  thank you peterkin for your advice which however i will not take when a comrades life may depend on my doing so  i give you full credit for the excellence of your intention rejoined my friend but if jacks life had depended on those two shots from your doublebarrel he would have been but a dead man now  there is only one vulnerable spot in the front of an elephants head that is exactly in the centre of the forehead  the spot is not bigger than a saucer and the bone is comparatively thin there  if you cannot make sure of hitting that you simply face certain death  i would not have tried it on any account whatever had i not seen that both you and jack would have been killed had i not done so  on examination we found that the heavy ball from peterkins rifle had indeed penetrated the exact spot referred to and had been the means of killing the elephant while my two bullets were found embedded in the bone  the tusks of this animal were magnificent  i do not know what their exact weight was not having the means wherewith to weigh them  they were probably worth a considerable sum of money in the british market of course we did not lay claim to any part of the spoil of that day with the exception of a few of the beautiful birds shot on the voyage up the river which were of no value to the natives although priceless to me  alas when i came to examine them next morning i found that those destructive creatures the white ants had totally destroyed the greater part of them and the few that were worth stuffing were very much damaged  experience is a good though sometimes a severe teacher  never again did i after that put off the stuffing of any valuable creature till the next day  i always stuffed it in the evening of the day on which it was killed and thus although the practice cost me many a sleepless night i preserved and ultimately brought home many specimens of rare and beautiful birds and beasts which would otherwise have been destroyed by those rapacious insects  that night the scene of our camp was indescribably romantic and wild numerous huge fires were lighted and round these the negroes circled and cooked elephant and venison steaks while they talked over the events of the day or recounted the adventures of former hunts with noisy volubility and gesticulation  the negro has a particular love for a fire  the nights in his warm climate are chill to him though not so to europeans and he luxuriates in the heat of a fire as a cat does in the rays of the sun  the warm blaze seems to draw out his whole soul and causes his eyes to sparkle with delight  a good supper and a warm fire render him almost perfectly happy  there is but one thing wanting to render him supremely so and that isa pipe  no doubt under similar circumstances the white man also is in a state of enviable felicity but he does not show his joy like the negro who seems to forget his cares and sorrows the miseries which his gross superstitions entail on him the frequency with which he is exposed to sudden destruction everything in short is forgotten save the present and he enjoys himself with unmitigated fervour  it really did my heart good as i sat with my comrades beside our fire and looked around me on their happy faces which were rendered still happier by the gift from us of a small quantity of tobacco with which we had taken care to provide ourselves for this very purpose  i could scarcely believe that the jovial kindly hearty fellows were the very men who are wellknown to be such cruel bloodthirsty fiends when under the influence of their dreadful superstitions and who but a few hours before had been darting through the woods besmeared with blood and yelling like maniacs or demons  in fact the whole scene before me and the days proceedings seemed to me at that time like a vivid dream instead of a reality  moreover after i lay down the reality became a dream and i spent that night as i had spent the day shooting gazelles lions wild pigs and elephants in imagination    chapter six  dreaming and feeding and bloody work enlarged upon  the first object of which my senses became cognisant on awaking next morning was my friend peterkin who had evidently awakened just a moment or two before me for he was in the act of yawning and rubbing his eyes  i have all my life been a student of character and the most interesting yet inexplicable character which i have ever studied has been that of my friend peterkin whose eccentricities i have never been able fully to understand or account for  i have observed that on first awaking in the mornings he has been wont to exhibit several of his most eccentric and peculiar traits so i resolved to feign myself asleep and watch him  heighho he exclaimed after the yawn i have just referred to having said this he stretched out both arms to the utmost above his head and then flung himself back at full length on his couch where he lay still for about half a minute  then he started up suddenly into a sitting posture and looked slowly from one to another of the recumbent forms around him  satisfied apparently that they were asleep he gave vent to a long yawn which terminated in a gasp and then he looked up contemplatively at the sky which was at that hour beginning to warm with the red rays of the rising sun  while thus engaged he caressed with his right hand the very small scrap of whisker that grew on his right cheek  at first it seemed as if this were an unconscious action but he suddenly appeared to become absorbed in it and stared straight before him as one does when only half awake mumbling the while in an undertone  i could not make out distinctly what he said but i think i caught the words yes a littlea very little thickersix new hairs i thinkumph slow very slow  here he looked at jacks bushy beard and sighed  suddenly he thrust both hands deep into his breeches pockets and stared at the black embers of the extinct fire then as suddenly he pulled out his hands and placing the forefinger of his right hand on the end of the thumb of his left said slowly  let me seeill recall it  he spoke with intense gravity  most persons do when talking to themselves  yes i remember now  there were two elephants and fouror three was itno it must have been four lions  the biggest elephant had on a false front of fair curls and a marriagering on its tail  stay was it not the other one had that  no it was the biggest  i remember now for it was just above the marriagering i grasped it when i pulled its tail out  i didnt pull it off for it wouldnt come off it came out like a telescope or a long piece of indiarubber  ha and i remember thinking how painful it must be  that was odd now to think of that the other elephant had on crinoline  that was odder still for of all animals in the world it least required it  well let me see  what did i do  oh yes i shot them both  of course that was natural but it wasnt quite so natural that the big one should vomit up a live lion which attacked me with incredible fury  but i killed it cleverly  yes it was a clever thing undoubtedly to split a lion in two from the tip of its nose to the extremity of its tail with one stroke of a penknife  at this climax i could contain myself no longer and burst into a loud laugh as i perceived that peterkin had spent the night as i myself had done in huntingthough i confess there was a considerable difference in the nature of our achievements and in the manner of their accomplishment  why what are you laughing at said jack sitting up and gazing at me with a stupid stare  at peterkins dreams said i  ah said jack with a smiling yawn thats it is it  been hunting elephants and lions eh  why how did you guess that  i asked in surprise were you not asleep just now  of course i was and dreaming too like yourself i make no doubt  i had just bagged my fifteenth elephant and my tenth lion when your laugh awoke me  and the best of it is that i was carrying the whole bagful on my back at once and did not feel much oppressed by the weight  that beats my dream hollow observed peterkin so its my opinion wed better have breakfastmakarooroo hy dye hear rouse up you junk of ebony  yis massa comin said our guide rising slowly from his lair on the opposite side of our fireplace  dyou hear  yis massa  youre a nigger  dat am a fact  well being a nigger youre a brick so look sharp with that splendid breakfast you promised us last night  ill wager a million pounds that you had forgotten all about it  no massa me no forgit  me up in centre ob de night and put im in de hole  wat you call imoben  ay oven thats it  yis  well me git im drecly  and i say hold on added peterkin  dont you suppose im going to stand on ceremony with you  your names too long by half  too many rooroos about it so im going to call you mak in future dye understand  the negro nodded and grinned from ear to ear as he left us  presently he returned with a huge round or lump of meat at which we looked inquisitively  the odour from it was delightful and the tender juicy appearance of the meat when makarooroo who carved it for us cut the first slice was quite appetising to behold  what is it inquired peterkin  elephants foot replied the guide  gammon remarked peterkin  its true massa  dont you see hims toe  so it is said jack  and its firstrate cried i tasting a morsel  with that we fell to and made a hearty meal after which we along with the king and all his people retraced our steps to the river and returned to the native town where we spent another day in making preparations to continue our journey towards the land of the gorilla  during the hunt which i have just described i was very much amused as well as amazed at the reckless manner in which the negroes loaded their rusty old tradeguns  they put in a whole handful of powder each time and above that as much shot and bits of old iron of all kinds as they dared some i saw charged thus to within a few inches of the muzzle and the owners seemed actually afraid to put them to their shoulders as well they might be for the recoil was tremendous and had the powder been good their guns must have been blown to pieces and themselves killed  on our return to the village we found the people on the eve of one of those terrible outbursts of superstitious passion which rarely if ever pass away without some wretched human creature perishing under the hands of murderers  there is something wrong with the fetishman i think remarked jack as we disembarked at the landing  he seems excited  do you know what it can be at makarooroo  jack interposed peterkin i have changed his name to mak so you and ralph will please to remember thatmak my boy whats wrong with your doctor  the negro looked very grave and shook his head as he replied don know massa  hims be goin to rizz de peepil wid him norrible doins dere will be death in the camp mos bery quickpraps dis night  that is terrible said i  are you sure of what you say  sartin sure replied the negro with another shake of the head  then mak said jack it behoves us to look to ourselves  you look like an honest fellow and i believe we may trust you  we cannot expect you to help us to fight against your own kith and kin but i do expect that you will assist us to escape if any foul play is intended whatever betides it is as well that you should know that white men are not easily conquered  our guns are goodthey never miss fire  we will sell our lives dearly you may depend on it  ay added peterkin it is well that you should know that moreover it is well that the rascally niggers of your tribe should know it too so you can take occasion to give them a hint that we shall keep ourselves prepared for them with my compliments  de mans ob my peepil replied the negro with some dignity of manner be not wuss dan oder mans  but dem is bad enuff  but you no hab need for be fraid  dey no touch de white mans  dem bery much glad you com here  if any bodies be killed it be black mans or oomans  we felt somewhat relieved on hearing this for to say truth we knew well enough that three men no matter how wellarmed or resolute they might be could not hope to defend themselves against a whole tribe of savages in their own country  nevertheless we resolved to keep a sharp lookout and be prepared for the worst  meanwhile we did all in our power to expedite our departure  that evening the trader started on his return journey to the coast leaving us in charge of king jambai who promised earnestly to take good care of us  we immediately put his willingness to fulfil his promise to the test by begging him to furnish us with men to carry our goods into the interior  he tried very hard to induce us to change our minds and remain hunting with his tribe telling us that the gorilla country was far far away from his lands that we should never reach it alive or that if we did we should certainly be killed by the natives who besides being cruel and warlike were cannibals and that if we did meet in with gorillas we should all be certainly slain for no one could combat successfully with that ferocious giant of the monkey tribe  to this we replied that we were quite aware of the dangers we should have to encounter in our travels but added that we had come there for the very purpose of encountering such dangers and especially to pay a visit to the giant monkeys in their native land so that it was in vain his attempting to dissuade us as we were resolved to go  seeing that we were immovable the king eventually gave in and ordered some of his best men to hold themselves in readiness to start with us on the following morning  we then proceeded to his majestys house where we had supper and afterwards retired to our own hut to rest  but we were destined to have little or no rest that night  the doctor or fetishman of the tribe had stirred up the passions of the people in a manner that was quite incomprehensible to us  king jambai it seems had been for some weeks suffering from illnesspossibly from indigestion for he was fond of gorging himselfand the medicineman had stated that his majesty was bewitched by some of the members of his own tribe and that unless these sorcerers were slain there was no possibility of his getting well  we never could ascertain why the fetishman should fix upon certain persons to be slain unless it was that he had a personal enmity against them but this seemed unlikely for two of the persons selected were old female slaves who could never of course have injured the doctor in any way  but the doings of africans especially in regard to religious superstitions i afterwards found were so mysterious that no one could or would explain the meaning of them to us  and i am inclined to believe that in reference to the meaning of many things they were themselves utterly ignorant  towards midnight the people had wrought themselves up to a frenzied condition and made so much noise that we could not sleep  in the midst of the uproar makarooroo who we observed had been very restless all the evening rushed into our hut exclaiming massa massa come save my okandaga come quick  the poor fellow was trembling with anxiety and was actually pale in the face for a distinctly discernible pallor overspreads the countenance of the negro when under the influence of excessive terror  okandaga we had previously heard of and seen  she was according to african notions an exceedingly pretty young girl with whom our worthy guide had fallen desperately in love  makarooroos education had done much for him and especially in regard to females  having observed the kind respectful consideration with which the missionaries treated their wives and the happiness that seemed to be the result of that course of conduct he resolved in his own mind to try the experiment with one of the girls of his own tribe and soon after rejoining it paid his attentions to okandaga who seemed to him the most modest and lovable girl in the village  poor okandaga was first amazed and then terrified at the strangely gentle conduct of her lover and thought that he meant to bewitch her for having never before been accustomed to other than harsh and contemptuous treatment from men she could not believe that makarooroo meant her any good  gradually however she began to like this respectful wooer and finally she agreed to elope with him to the seacoast and live near the missionaries  it was necessary however to arrange their plans with great caution  there was no difficulty in their getting married  a handsome present to the girls father was all that was necessary to effect that end and a good hunter like makarooroo knew he could speedily obtain possession of his bride but to get her removed from her tribe and carried to the coast was quite a different affair  while the perplexed negro was pondering this subject and racking his brains to discover a way of getting over the difficulty our arrival at the village occurred  at once he jumped to the conclusion that somehow or other he should accomplish his object through our assistance and holding this in view he the more willingly agreed to accompany us to the gorilla country intending first to make our acquaintance and afterwards to turn us to account in furthering his plans  all this we learned long afterwards  at the period of which i am now writing we were profoundly ignorant of everything save the fact that okandaga was his affianced bride and that the poor fellow was now almost beside himself with horror because the fetishman had condemned her among others to drink the poisoned cup  this drinking of the poisoned cup is an ordeal through which the unhappy victims to whom suspicion has been attached are compelled to pass  each one drinks the poison and several executioners stand by with heavy knives to watch the result  if the poison acts so as to cause the supposed criminal to fall down he is hacked in pieces instantly but if through unusual strength or peculiarity of constitution he is enabled to resist the effects of the poison his life is spared and he is declared innocent  jack and peterkin and i seized our weapons and hurrying out followed our guide to the spot where this terrible tragedy was enacting  dont fear mak said peterkin as we ran along well save her somehow  im certain of that  the negro made no reply but i observed a more hopeful expression on his countenance after the remark  he evidently had immense faith in peterkin which i must say was more than i had for when i considered our small numbers my hope of influencing savages was very slight  the scene that met our eyes was indescribably horrible  in the centre of a dense circle of negroes who had wrought themselves up to a pitch of ferocity that caused them to look more like wild beasts than men stood the king and beside him the doctor or fetishman  this latter was ornamented with a towering headdress of feathers  his face was painted white which had the effect of imparting to him an infinitely more hideous and ghastly aspect than is produced in the white man when he is painted black  a stripe of red passed round his head and another down his forehead and nose  his naked body was decked with sundry fantastic ornaments and altogether he looked more like a fiend than i had believed it possible for man to appear  the ground all round him was saturated with blood and strewn with arms fingers cleft skulls and masses of flesh that had been hewn from the victims who had already fallen one of whom we afterwards learned had belonged to the royal family  two still remaineda young female and an old man  the emaciated frame and white woolly head of the latter showed that in the course of nature his earthly career must soon terminate  it is probable that the poor old man had become a burden to his relations and the doctor took this opportunity of ridding the tribe of him  the girl was okandaga who stood weeping and trembling as she gazed upon the butchery that had already taken place  the old man had swallowed the poison shortly before we arrived and he was now struggling to maintain an erect position  but he failed his quivering limbs sank beneath him and before we could interfere the bloody executioners had cut off his head and then in a transport of passion they literally hacked his body to pieces  we rushed hastily forward to the king and jack in an earnest voice implored him to spare the last victim  surely said he enough have been sacrificed alreadytell him makarooroo that i will quit his village and never see him more if he does not spare the life of that young girl  the king appeared much perplexed by this unlookedfor interference on our part  i cannot check the spirits of my people now he replied  they are roused  the girl has bewitched me and many others  she must die  it is our custom  let not my white men be offended  let them go to their hut and sleep  we cannot sleep while injustice is done in the village answered jack in a lofty tone  let not king jambai do that which will make his visitors ashamed of him  let the girl live till tomorrow at midnight let the case be investigated and if she be proved guilty then let her die  the king commenced a long reply in the same dignified manner and tone which jack had assumed  while he was thus engaged peterkin touched our guide on the shoulder and whispered  i say mak tell the doctor to back up jacks request and ill give him a gun  the negro slipped at once to the side of the doctor who had begun to frown fiercely on jack and whispered a few words in his ear  instantly his face assumed a calmer aspect and presently he stepped up to the king and a whispering conversation ensued in which the doctor carefully refraining from making any mention of the gun commended the wise advice of the white man and suggested that the proposal should be agreed to adding however that he knew for certain that the girl was a witch but that the investigation would do good in the way of proving that he the doctor was correct and thus the girl should perish on the following night and the white men would be satisfied  having announced this to the multitude the king ordered okandaga to be conducted back to her prison and carefully guarded and we returned to our hutnot however to sleep but to consult as to what was to be done next  i knew that you wanted a respite for her said peterkin as we sat round our fire that you might have time to consider how to act and i backed up your request accordingly as you know  but now i confess im very much at a loss what to suggest  it seems to me we have only purchased a brief delay  true answered jack  the delay is not so brief however but that we may plan some method of getting the poor girl out of this scrapewhat say you mak  if you no can tink pon someting i gib up all hope replied our guide sorrowfully  come mak cheer up cried peterkin  if the worst comes to the worst you can at any rate fight for your bride  fight exclaimed the negro displaying his white teeth like a mastiff rolling his eyes and clinching his fists convulsively  then in a calmer tone he continued ay me can fight  me could kill all de guards an take okandaga by de hand an run troo de bushes for eber  but guards no die widout hollerin an yellerin like de gorilla an nigger mans can run fasterer dan womans  no no dat am dumpossobable  nothings dumpossobable to brave hearts and stout arms replied jack  there are only four guards put over her i believe  well there are just four of usnot that we require to be equal by any means peterkin and i could settle them easily but we require to be equal in numbers in order to do it quietly  i have a plan in my head but theres one hitch in it that i cannot unravel  and what may that be  if asked  why i dont see how after getting clear off with okandaga we are to avoid being pursued on suspicion and captured  dere is one cave remarked the guide not far off to here  praps we be safe if we git into im  but i fraid it not do cause him be peepiled by fiends an dead mans spirits  thats a grave objection said peterkin laughing  yes an de tribe neber go near dere dey is most drefful terrorfied to be cotched dere  then that will just do cried jack with animation  the very thing and now ill tell you what my plan is  tomorrow morning early we will tell the king that we wish to be off at oncethat we have put off too much time already and wish to make no further delay  then well pack up and start  at night we will encamp in a quiet outoftheway part of the woods and slip back to the village in the dark a short time before midnight  the whole village will at that time be assembled probably at the spot where the execution is to take place so we can rush in overpower the guard free okandaga and make our escape to the cave where they will never think of looking for us  peterkin shook his head  there are two difficulties in your plan jack  first what if the natives are not assembled on the place of execution and we find it impossible to make our entrance into or exit from the village quietly  i propose replied jack that we shall undress ourselves rub ourselves entirely over with charcoal and grease so that they shall not recognise us and dash in and carry the girl off by a coup de main in which case it will of course be neck or nothing and a tremendous race to the cave where if they follow us we will keep them at bay with our rifles  umph dashing no doubt but risky said peterkinextremely risky yet its worth trying  well my second difficulty iswhat if they dont stick to their promise after we quit and kill the poor thing before midnight  we must take our chance of that  but i shall put the king on his honour before leaving and say that i will make particular inquiry into the way in which the trial has been conducted on my return  put the king on his honour observed peterkin  im afraid that youll put his majesty on an extremely unstable foundation  however i see nothing better that can be done  have you any more difficulties  yes said i  there is one other  what do you propose to do with the men who are to be supplied us by the king during these extremely delicate and difficult manoeuvres  the countenances of my comrades fell at this question  i never thought of them said jack  nor i said peterkin  makarooroo groaned  well said i if you will allow me to suggest i would recommend that we should towards the close of the day send them on ahead of us and bid them encamp at a certain place saying that we shall spend the night in hunting and return to them in the morning  the very thing said jack  now comrades to rest  i will occupy myself until i fall asleep in maturing my plans and thinking out the details  do you the same and if anything should occur to you let us consult over it in the morning  we were all glad to agree to this being wearied more perhaps by excitement than want of rest so bidding each other goodnight we lay down side by side to meditate and for my part to dream of the difficult and dangerous work that awaited us on the morrow    chapter seven  we circumvent the natives  we arose on the following morning with the dawn of day and began to make preparation for our departure  to our satisfaction we found the king quite willing that we should go so embarking our goods in one of the native canoes we ordered our negroes to embark and commenced our journey amid the firing of guns and the good wishes of the natives  i must confess that i felt some probings of conscience at the thought of the double part we were compelled to play but the recollection of the horrid fate that awaited the poor negro girl put to flight such feelings and induced a longing for the time of action to arrive  i have more than once referred to our goods  perhaps it may be as well to explain that when we first landed on the african coast we made inquiries of those who were best acquainted with the nature and requirements of the country we were about to explore as to what goods we ought to purchase of the traders in order to be in a position to pay our way as we went along for we could not of course expect the savages to feed us and lodge us and help us on our way for nothing after mature consideration we provided ourselves with a supply of such things as were most necessary and suitablesuch as tobacco powder and shot and ball a few tradeguns several pieces of brightlycoloured cloth packages of beads some white enamelled others of coloured glass coffee and tea knives scissors rings and a variety of other knickknacks  these with a little brandy to be used medicinally our blankets and camp cooking utensils formed a heavy load for ten men but of course as we advanced the load was lightened by the consumption of our provisions and the giving away of goods  the additions which i made however in the shape of stuffed specimens began in the course of time to more than counterbalance this advantage  being resolved to impress the natives with a respect for our physical powers we made a point of each carrying a pretty heavy load on our journeysexcepting of course when we went out ahunting  but to return  our crew worked willingly and well so that ere night closed in upon us we were a considerable distance away from the village  as the sun set we landed and ordering our men to advance in the canoe to a certain bend in the river and there encamp and await our return we landed and went off into the woods as if to search for game  now makarooroo quick march and dont draw rein till we reach the cave said jack when we were out of sight of the canoe  our guide obeyed in silence and for the next two hours we travelled through the woods at a sort of half trot that must have carried us over the ground at the rate of five miles in hour  the pace was indeed tremendous and i now reaped the benefit of those long pedestrian excursions which for years past i had been taking with scientific ends in view over the fields and hills of my native land  jack and peterkin seemed both to be made of iron and incapable of suffering from fatigue but i have no doubt that the exciting and hazardous nature of the expedition on which we had embarked had much to do with our powers of endurance  after running and doubling gliding and leaping through the dense woods as i have said for two hours we arrived at a broken rocky piece of ground over which we passed and eventually came upon a thick jungle that concealed a vast cliff almost entirely from view  the cracking of the bushes as we approached showed that we had disturbed the slumbers of more than one of the wild beasts that inhabited the spot  here makarooroo paused and although it was intensely dark i could observe that he was trembling violently  come mak said i in a whisper surely you who have received a christian education do not really believe that devils inhabit this spot  me don know massa  eber since me was be a pikaniny me fraid horrobably fraid ob dat cave  come come said jack impatiently we have no time for fears of any kind this night  think of okandaga mak and be a man  this was sufficient  the guide pushed boldly forward and led us to the mouth of a large cavern at which he halted and pointed to the gloomy interior  you have the matches peterkin quick strike a light  it is getting late said jack  in another moment a light was struck and with it we kindled three goodlysized torches with which we had provided ourselves  holding these high over our heads we entered the cavernjack first peterkin second i next and the terrified negro in rear  we had scarcely entered and were peering upwards at the black vault overhead when an indescribable rushing sound filled the air of the cavern and caused the flame of our torches to flicker with such violence that we could not see any object distinctly  we all came to a sudden pause and i confess that at that moment a feeling of superstitious dread chilled the blood in my veins  before we could discover the cause of this strange effect several large black objects passed through the air near our heads with a peculiar muffled noise next instant the three torches were extinguished  unable to command himself any longer the negro uttered a cry of terror and turned to fly but jack whose wits seemed always prepared for any emergency had foreseen the probability of this and springing quickly after him threw his arms round his neck and effectually prevented his running away  the noise caused by the scuffle seemed to arouse the fury of all the evil spirits of the place for a perfect hurricane of whirring sounds raged around us for a few seconds  its only bats cried jacklook alive peterkin another light  in a few seconds the torches were rekindled and we advanced into the cavern and mak after recovering from his fright and learning the cause thereof became much bolder  the cave was about a hundred yards deep by about fifty wide but we could not ascertain its height for the light of our torches failed to penetrate the deep gloom overhead  it was divided into two natural chambers the outer being large the inner smalla mere recess in fact  in this latter we planted our torches and proceeded with our hasty preparations  peterkin was ready first we endeavoured to make ourselves as like to the natives in all respects as possible and when i looked at my companions i was obliged to confess that except in the full blaze of the torchlight i could not discern any point of difference between them and our guide  now then jack said peterkin as youre not quite ready and i am i shall employ myself in preparing a little plan of my own which i intend to put in force if the savages dare to venture into the cavern after us  very good but see that you finish it in less than five minutes for ill be ready in that time  peterkin immediately poured out a large quantity of powder on a flat rock and mingling with it a little water from a pool near by converted it into a semimoist ball  this he divided into three parts and forming each part into the shape of a tall cone laid the whole carefully aside  there said he lie you there until you are wanted  at this moment while jack and i were bending down fastening the latchet of our shoes our ears were saluted with one of the most appalling yells i ever listened to  makarooroo fell flat to the earth in his fright and my own heart chilled with horror while jack sprang up and instinctively grasped the handle of his huntingknife  very good said peterkin as he stood laughing at us quietly and we immediately perceived that it was he who uttered the cry  why what mean you said jack almost angrily  surely this is no time for foolish jesting  i am anything but jesting jack  im only rehearsing another part of my plan  but you ought to give us warning when you are about to do such startling things said i remonstratively  nay that would not have done at all because then i should not have known what effect my cry is likely to produce on unexpectant ears  well now are you all ready inquired jack  then let us go  issuing forth armed only with our doublebarrelled guns and heavy huntingknives we hastened towards the native village  when within a hundred yards of the edge of the wood that skirted it we stopped to pull off our shoes for it was necessary that we should have nothing about our persons to tell who we were should any one chance to see us as we ran  we also left our rifles beside the shoes at a spot where we could find them in an instant in passing and then slowly approached the outskirts of the village  presently we heard the hum of distant voices shouting and the fear that the scene of bloodshed had already begun induced us to quicken our pace to a smart run  i never saw a man so deeply affected as was our poor guide and when i looked at him i felt extremely anxious lest his state of mind should unfit him for acting with needful caution  we gained the first cottagesthey were empty  the village having been recently built no stockade had yet been thrown round it so our progress was unimpeded  we must be very cautious now observed jack in a whisperrestrain yourself makarooroo okandagas life depends on our coolness  on reaching the back of the next hut which was also empty  jack motioned to us to halt and coming close to us looked earnestly in each of our faces without saying a word  i supposed that like a wise general he was reviewing his troopsseeing whether the men he was about to lead into battle were fit for their work  now said he rapidly its evident from the shouting thats going on that they wont waste much time with their palaver  the hut in which she is confined is not fifty yards off i took care to ascertain its position before leaving this morning  what we have to do is simple spring on the guards and knock them down with our fists or the hilts of our huntingknives or with bits of stick as suits us best  but mindhere he looked pointedly at our guideno shedding of blood if it can be avoided  these men are not our enemies  follow me in single file when i halt come up into line let each single out the man nearest to him and when i hold up my hand spring like wildcats  if there happen to be five or six guards instead of four leave the additional ones to me  we merely nodded assent and in another minute were close upon the prison  peterkin mak and i had provided us with short heavy bludgeons on our way  these we held in our right hands our left hands we kept free either to grasp our opponents with or to draw our knives if necessary  jack carried his long knifeit might almost have been termed a short swordin his left hand and from the manner in which he clinched his right i saw that he meant to make use of it as his principal weapon  on gaining the back of the house we heard voices within but could see nothing so we moved softly round to the front keeping however well behind the screen of bushes  here jack halted and we ranged up alongside of him and peeped through the bushes  the hut was quite open in front and the interior was brightly lighted by a strong fire round which the four guardsstout fellows all of themwere seated with their spears beside them on the ground  they were conversing in an excited tone and taking no notice of okandaga who sat behind them partially in the shade with her face buried in her hands  she was not tied in any way as the guards knew well enough that she could not hope to escape them by mere running way  one rapid glance showed us all this and enabled us to select our men then jack gave the signal and without an instants hesitation we darted upon them  i know not in what manner my comrades acted their part from the moment i set eyes on the negro nearest to me my blood began to boil  somehow or other i saw jack give the signal without taking my eyes off my intended victim then i sprang forward and he had barely time to look up in alarm when i struck him with all my force on the right temple  he fell without a groan  i looked round instantly and there lay the other three with my companions standing over them  our plan had been so well concerted and so promptly executed that the four men fell almost at the same instant and without a cry  poor okandaga leaped up and uttered a faint scream of alarm but makarooroos voice instantly reassured her and with an exclamation of joy she sprang into his arms  there was no time for delay  while the scene i have described was being enacted the shouts in the centre of the village had been increasing and we guessed that in a few minutes more the bloodthirsty executioners would come for their helpless victim  we therefore left the hut at once and ran as fast as we could towards the place where our guns and shoes had been left  our guide seized okandaga by the wrist and dragged her along but indeed she was so nimble that at first she required no assistance  in a short time however we were obliged to slacken our pace in order to enable her to keep up  we reached the guns in safety but while we were in the act of lifting them a burst of wild cries that grew louder and fiercer as they approached told that the natives were rushing tumultuously towards the prison  now lads said jack we must put on full speedmak take her right handhere okandaga your left  at that instant there was a shout in the village so loud that we knew the escape was discovered  an indescribable hubbub ensued but we soon lost it in the crackling of the underwood as we burst through it in our headlong flight towards the cave  the poor girl feeling that her life depended on it exerted herself to the utmost and with the aid of jack and her lover kept well up  shell never hold out to the end said peterkin glancing over his shoulder as he ran  the cries of the savages filled the woods in all directions showing that they had instantly scattered themselves in the pursuit in order to increase their chances of intercepting us  we had already traversed the greater part of the wood that lay between the village and the haunted cavern when two negroes who must have taken a shorter route descried us  they instantly uttered a yell of triumph and followed us at full speed while from the cries closing in upon us we could tell that the others had heard and understood the shout  just then okandagas strength began to fail and her extreme terror as the pursuers gained on us tended still further to increase her weakness  this was all the more unfortunate that we were now almost within a couple of hundred yards of the mouth of the cave  makarooroo spoke encouragingly to her but she was unable to reply and it became evident that she was about to sink down altogether  jack glanced over his shoulder  the two negroes were within fifty yards of us but no others were in sight  hold my gun said jack to me sharply  i seized it  he instantly stooped down grasped okandaga round the waist and without stopping swung her with an exertion of strength that seemed to me incredible into his arms  we gained the mouth of the cavern jack dropped okandaga who immediately ran in while the rest of us stopped abruptly and faced about  back all of you cried jack else they will be afraid to come on  the words had scarcely passed his lips when the two negroes came up but halted a few yards from the mouth of the cave on seeing such a giant form guarding the entrance  to let those men escape and reveal the place of our concealment was not to be thought of  jack darted out upon them  they separated from each other as they turned to fly  i was peeping out of the cave and saw that jack could not secure them both i therefore darted out and quickly overtaking one seized him by the hair of the head and dragged him into the cave with the aid of peterkin  jack lifted the other savage completely from the ground and carried him in struggling in his gripe like a child in its nurses arms  this last episode was enacted so quickly that the two negroes were carried into the cavern and gagged before the other pursuers came up at the caves mouth the whole of the men of the village shortly assembled with the king at their head  thus far the excitement of the chase had led them but now that the first burst of their rage was over and they found themselves on the threshold of that haunted cavern the fear of which had been an element in their training from infancy they felt no doubt overawed by superstitious dread and hesitated to enter although most of them must have been convinced that the fugitives were there  their fears increased as their anger abated and they crowded round king jambai who seemed loath to take upon himself the honour of leader  they must have sought shelter here said the king pointing to the cavern and looking round with an assumption of boldness which he was evidently far from feeling  who among my warriors will follow me  perhaps the evil spirits have carried them away suggested one of the sable crew  that is the word of a coward cried the king who although somewhat timorous about spirits was in reality a bold brave man and felt nettled that any of his warriors should show the white feather  if evil spirits are there our fetishman will drive them away  let the doctor stand forth  at that moment the doctor worthy knave must have wished in his inmost soul that he had remained quietly at home and left to warriors the task of capturing the fugitives but there was no resisting the mandate of the king besides his honour and credit as a fetishman was at stake moreover no doubt he felt somewhat emboldened by the presence of such a large number of menthere were certainly several hundreds on the groundso all things considered he thought it best to accept the post of leader with a good grace  stepping quickly forward he cried let torches be brought and i will lead the way  a murmur of approbation ran through the crowd of blacks who like a flock of sheep felt bold enough to follow a leader blindly  while the consultation was going on outside we were making hasty preparation for defending ourselves to the last extremity  peterkin in particular was extremely active and to say truth his actions surprised us not a little  i once or twice fancied that excitement had turned his brain  he first dressed up his head in a species of wild turban made of dried grass and tall sedgy leaves then he put several patches of red and white earth on his black face as well as on his body in various places and fastened a number of loose pieces of rag torn from a handkerchief and bits of tattered leaves to his arms and legs in such a manner as to give him an extremely wild and dishevelled appearance  i must say that when his hasty toilet was completed he seemed to me the most horriblelooking demon i had ever conceived of he next poured out nearly a whole flask of gunpowder on a ledge of rock the edge of which was visible from the entrance to the cave while the rock itself concealed him from view  last of all he took up the three cones of moistened gunpowder which the reader will remember he had made before we left the cave to attack the village  one of these he placed among the grass and branches on his head the other two he held in his hands  now boys he said when all was ready all i have to ask of you is that you will stand by with matches and when i give the word light the points of those three cones of gunpowder simultaneously and instantly and leave me to finish the remainder of my part  of course you will be prepared to back me up with your rifles if need be but keep well out of sight at first  we now saw the drift of our eccentric friends intention but for my part i felt little confidence in his success  the plan seemed altogether too wild and absurd  but our danger was imminent  no way of escape seemed possible and it is wonderful how readily men will grasp at anything in the shape of a ruse or stratagem no matter how silly or wild that affords the most distant chance of escape from danger  jack too i could see from the look of his face put little faith in the plan and i observed an expression on the countenance of our negro guide which seemed to indicate that his respect for peterkins wisdom was on the wane  we had not to wait long  the doctor with several torchbearers suddenly darted in with a shout followed closely by the warriors who yelled furiously in order no doubt to keep up their courage  alarmed by such an unusual hubbub in their usually quiet domain the bats came swooping from their holes in the walls by hundreds and the torches were extinguished almost instantly  the savages who were near the entrance drew back in haste those who had entered stood rooted to the spot in terror  now whispered peterkin eagerly  we struck our lights at once and applied them to the points of the gunpowder cones which instantly began to spout forth a shower of sparks with great violence  peterkin darted out from behind the rock with a yell so appalling that we ourselves were startled by it having forgotten that it formed an element in his plan  in passing he allowed a few sparks to fall on the heap of powder which exploded with so bright a flame that the whole cavern was illuminated for an instant  it also set fire to the ragged scraps with which peterkin had decked himself outa result which had neither been intended nor anticipated so that he rushed towards the mouth of the cave howling with pain as well as with a desire to scare the savages  the effect of this apparition was tremendous  the negroes turned and crushed through the narrow entrance screaming and shrieking with terror the bats no less alarmed than the men and half suffocated with smoke fled out of the cave like a whirlwind flapping their wings on the heads of the negroes in their flight and adding if that were possible to their consternation  the negroes ran as never men ran before tumbling over each other in their mad haste dashing against trees and crashing through bushes in their terror while peterkin stood leaping in the caves mouth smoking and blazing and spurting and unable to contain himself giving vent to prolonged peals of demoniacal laughter  had the laugh been that of negroes it might have been recognised but peterkins was the loud violent british guffaw which i make no doubt was deemed by them worthy of the fiends of the haunted cave and served to spur them on to still greater rapidity in their wild career  returning into the caves innermost recess we lighted one of the torches dropped by the savages and placing it in a sort of natural niche seated ourselves on several pieces of rock to rest  our first act was to look earnestly in each others faces our next to burst into peals of laughter  i say comrades i exclaimed checking myself dont we run some risk in giving vent to our feelings so freely  no fear cried peterkin who was still smoking a little from unextinguished sparks  there is not a man in the whole crew who will draw rein till he is sitting with the teeth still chattering in his head at his own fireside  i never saw men in such a fright since i was born  depend upon it we are safe enough here from this day forth dont you think so mak  our guide who was now trying to reassure his trembling bride turned with a broad grin on his sable countenance and said  safe ho yis massa  dere not be a man asll come to dis yere cuvern for de nix tree hunr year or more  massa peterkin be de most horriboble ghost dey ever did saw an no mistake  but massas we mus go way quick an git to our camp for de king sure to go dere an see if you no hab someting to do wid it all  hims a bery clebber king am jambaibery clebber hims no be bughummed bery easy  humbugged you mean said jack laughing  youre right mak we must set off at once  but what are we to do with poor okandaga now that we have got her  this was indeed a puzzling question  it was impossible to take her to our camp and account to the negroes for her appearance in a satisfactory manner besides if jambai took it into his head to pursue us in order to ascertain whether we had had anything to do with the rescue our case would be hopeless  it was equally impossible to leave her where she was and to let her try to make her escape through the woods alone was not to be thought of  while we pondered this dilemma an idea occurred to me  it seems to me said i that men are seldom perhaps never thrown into a danger or difficulty in this world without some way of escape being opened up which if they will but grasp at it promptly will conduct them at last out of their perplexities  now it has just occurred to me that since everything else seems to be impossible we might send okandaga into the woods with makarooroo to guide and defend her and to hunt for her  let them travel in a line parallel with the river route which we intend to follow  each night mak will make a secure shelter for her and then return to our camp as if he had come in from hunting  each morning he will set off again into the woods as if to hunt rejoin okandaga and thus we will journey together as it were and when we reach the next tribe of natives we will leave the girl in their charge until we return from the gorilla country  what do you think of that plan  not a bad one replied jack but if mak is away all day what are we to do for an interpreter  make him describe to us and to the men the days route before leaving us suggested peterkin and as for the talking we can manage that well enough for all needful purposes by a mixture of the few phrases we know with signs  in the excitement of this whole affair we had totally forgotten our two prisoners who lay not far from us on the ground gagged and pinioned we were now reminded of their presence rather abruptly  we must have secured their fastenings badly for during the time we were conversing they managed to free themselves and made a sudden dash past us  jacks eye fortunately caught sight of them in time  he sprang up rushed at the one nearest him and throwing out his foot as he passed tripped him up  it chanced that at that spot there was a deep hole in the floor of the cavern  into this the poor wretch plunged head first and he was killed on the spot  meanwhile the other gained the outlet of the cave and had almost escaped into the forest when makarooroo darted after him with the speed of an antelope  in a few seconds we heard a cry and shortly after our guide returned with his knife clotted with blood  he had overtaken and slain the other negro  i cannot convey to the reader the horror that filled me and my two companions at this unexpected and melancholy termination of the affair yet we felt that we were guiltless of rashly spilling human blood for jack had no intention of killing the poor negro whom he tripped up and as to the other we could not have prevented our guide from doing what he did  he himself deemed it justifiable and said that if that man had escaped to the village and told who it was that frightened them out of the cave they would certainly have come back and murdered us all there was truth in this  still we could not but feel overwhelmed with sadness at the incident  we were now doubly anxious to get away from this cave so we rapidly finished the discussion of our plan and jack arranged that he should accompany what may be termed the overland part of our expedition  this settled we washed the charcoal off our persons with the exception of that on our faces having been advised by king jambai himself to hunt with black faces as wild animals were quicker to perceive our white skins than their black ones  then we resumed our garments and quitting the haunted cavern set out on our return journey to the camp    chapter eight  peterkin distinguishes himself and okandaga is disposed of etcetera  when within about three miles of the place where our men had been ordered to haul the canoe out of the water and make the camp we came to a halt and prepared a spot for okandaga to spend an hour or two in sleep  the poor creature was terribly exhausted  we selected a very sequestered place in a rocky piece of ground where the light of the small fire we kindled in order to cook her some supper could not be seen by any one who might chance to pass by that way  jack remained with her but the guide went on with us in order to give instructions to our men who when we arrived seemed much surprised that we had made such a bad hunt during the night  having pointed out our route makarooroo then left us and we lay down to obtain a few hours repose  we had not lain more than an hour when one of our men awoke us saying that it was time to start so we rose very unwillingly and embarked  i say ralph observed peterkin as we glided up the stream which in this place was narrow and sluggish isnt it strange that mankind as a rule with very few exceptions should so greatly dislike getting up in the morning  it is rather curious no doubt  but i suspect we have ourselves to thank for the disinclination  if we did not sit up so late at night we should not feel the indisposition to rise so strong upon us in the morning  there you are quite wrong ralph  i always find that the sooner i go to bed the later i am in getting up  the fact is ive tried every method of rousing myself and without success  and yet i can say conscientiously that i am desirous of improving for when at sea i used to have my cot slung at the head with a blocktackle and i got one of the middies to come when the watch was changed and lower me so that my head lay on the deck below and my feet pointed to the beams above  and would you believe it i got so accustomed to this at last that when desperately sleepy i used to hold on in that position for a few minutes and secure a short nap during the process of suffocation with blood to the head  you must indeed have been incorrigible said i laughing nevertheless i feel assured that the want of will lies at the root of the evil  of course you do retorted peterkin testily people always say that when i try to defend myself  is it not probable that people always say that just because they feel that there is truth in the remark  humph ejaculated my friend  besides i continued our success in battling with the evil tendencies of our natures depends often very much on the manner in which we make the attack  i have pondered this subject deeply and have come to the conclusion that there is a certain moment in the awaking hour of each day which if seized and improved gains for us the victory  you know shakespeares judicious remarkthere is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune or something to that effect  i never feel quite sure of the literal correctness of my quotations although i am generally certain as to the substance  well there is a tide also in the affair of getting up in the morning and its floodpoint is the precise instant when you recover consciousness  at that moment every one i believe has moral courage to leap violently out of bed but let that moment pass and you sink supinely back if not to sleep at least into a desperate condition of unconquerable lethargy  you may be very correct in your reasoning returned peterkin but not having pondered that subject quite so deeply as you seem to have done i shall modestly refrain from discussing it  meanwhile i will go ashore and stalk yonder duck which floats so comfortably and lazily in the cove just beyond the point ahead of us that i think it must be in the condition of one who having missed the floodtide you have just referred to is revelling in the luxury of its second napho you ebonyfaced scoundrel he added turning to the negro who steered our canoe shove ashore like a good fellowcome ralph lend me your fowlingpiece and do you carry my big rifle  there is nothing so good for breakfast as a fat duck killed and roasted before it has had time to cool  and here is a capital spot on which to breakfast said i as we landed  firstrate  now then follow me and mind your muzzle  better put the rifle over your shoulder ralph so that if it does go off it may hit the sun or one of the stars  a sixounce ball in ones spine is not a pleasant companion in a hunting expedition  but retorted i you forget that i am particularly careful  i always carry my piece on halfcock and never put my finger on the trigger  indeed not even when you pull it  of course when i am about to fire but you know well enough what i mean  hush ralph we must keep silence now and step lightly  in a few minutes we had gained the clump of bushes close behind which the duck lay and peterkin going down on all fours crept forward to get a shot  i followed him in the same manner and when he stopped to take a deliberate aim i crept up alongside  the duck had heard our approach and was swimming about in a somewhat agitated manner among the tall reeds so that my companion made one or two unsuccessful attempts to take aim  what an aggravating thing exclaimed peterkin in a whisper  at that moment i happened to cast my eyes across the river and the reader may judge of my surprise when i beheld two elephants standing among the trees  they stood so silently and so motionless and were so like in colour to the surrounding foliage that we had actually approached to within about thirty yards without observing them  i touched peterkin on the shoulder and pointed to them without saying a word  the expression of amazement that instantly overspread his features showed that he also saw them  the rifle ralph he said in a low excited whisper  i handed it to him  with careful deliberation he took aim and fired at the animal nearest to us  the heavy ball entered its huge body just behind the shoulder  both elephants tossed up their trunks and elevating their great ears they dashed furiously into the bush but the one that had been hit after plunging head foremost down a low bank fell to the ground with a heavy crash quite dead  it was a splendid shot  the natives who almost immediately after came up screaming with delight could scarcely believe their eyes  they dashed across the river in the canoe while some of them regardless of the alligators that might be hidden there sprang into the water and swam over  im sorry we did not get the duck however observed peterkin as we returned to the place where we had left the canoe  elephant meat is coarse nasty stuff and totally unfit for civilised mouths though these niggers seem to relish it amazingly  you forget the baked foot said i  well so i did  it was pretty good certainly but thats the only part o the brute thats fit to eat  soon after this the canoe came back and took us over the river and we breakfasted on the side where the elephant had fallen in order to allow the natives to cut off such portions of the meat as they required and to secure the tusks  then we continued our journey and at night encamped near a grove of palmtrees which makarooroo had described to us and where we were soon joined by him and jack who told us that he had got on well during the daythat he had shot an antelope and had seen a zebra and a rhinoceros besides a variety of smaller game  he also told us that okandaga was encamped in a place of safety a few miles to the right of our position and that she had stood the journey well  i was much interested by jacks account of the zebra and the rhinoceros specimens of both of which animals i had seen in menageries and felt disposed to change places with him on the march but reflecting that he was much more likely than i successfully to hunt anything he might pursue i made up my mind to remain by the canoe  thus we travelled for several days without anything particular occurring and at length arrived at a native village which lay on the banks of a noble stream  here makarooroo introduced us to mbango the chief a finelooking and goodnatured negro who received us most hospitably supplied us with food and urged us to remain and hunt with his people  this however we declined to do telling our entertainer that we had come to his country for the purpose of shooting that wonderful animal the gorilla but assuring him that we would come back without fail if we should be spared  we further assured him on this head by proposing to leave in his charge a woman for whom we had a great respect and love and whom we made him promise faithfully to take care of till we returned  peterkin who soon gave them a specimen of his powers as a marksman and contrived in other ways to fill the minds of the chief and his people with a very exalted idea of his powers both of body and intellect endeavoured to make assurance doubly sure by working on their superstitious fears  tell mbango said he to our guide that though we be small in numbers we are very powerful that we can do deeds here he became awfully solemn and mysterious such as no black man ever conceived of and that if a hair of the head of okandaga is hurt we will on our return  instead of completing the sentence peterkin started up threw himself into violent contortions rolled his eyes in a fearful manner and in short gave the chief and his people to understand that something quite indescribable and unutterably terrible would be the result of their playing us false  send for njamie said mbango to one of his retainers  njamie who was the chiefs principal wife soon appeared  she led a sturdy little boy by the hand  he was her only son and a very fine little fellow despite the blackness of his skin and his almost total want of clothing  to this woman mbango gave okandaga in charge directing her in our presence how to care for her and assuring her of the most terrible punishment should anything befall the woman committed to her care  njamie was a mild agreeable woman  she had more modesty of demeanour and humility of aspect than the most of the women of her tribe whom we happened to see so that we felt disposed to believe that okandaga was placed in as safe keeping as it was possible for us to provide for her in our circumstances  even makarooroo appeared to be quite at ease in his mind and it was evidently with a relieved breast and a light heart that he bade adieu to his bride and started along with us on the following day on our journey into the deeper recesses of the wilderness  before entering upon these transactions with the people of this village we took care to keep our crew in total ignorance of what passed by sending them on in advance with the canoe under jacks care a few hours before we brought okandaga into the village or even made mention of her existence and we secured their ready obedience to our orders and total indifference as to our motives in these incomprehensible actions by giving them each a few inches of tobaccoa gift which rendered them supremely happy  one day about a week after the events above narrated we met with an adventure which wellnigh cost jack his life but which ultimately resulted in an important change in our manner of travelling  we were traversing an extremely beautiful country with the goods on our shoulders having in consequence of the increasing turbulence of the river as well as its change of direction been compelled to abandon our canoe and cut across the country in as straight a line as its nature would permit  but this was not easy for the grass which was bright green was so long as to reach sometimes higher than our shoulders  in this species of country jacks towering height really became of great use enabling him frequently to walk along with his head above the surrounding herbage while we were compelled to grope along ignorant of all that was around us save the tall grass at our sides  occasionally however we came upon more open ground where the grass was short and then we enjoyed the lovely scenery to the full  we met with a great variety of new plants and trees in this region  many of the latter were festooned with wild vines and other climbing plants  among others i saw several specimens of that curious and interesting tree the banyan with its dropshoots in every state of growthsome beginning to point towards the earth in which they were ultimately destined to take root some more than halfway down while others were already fixed forming stout pillars to their parent branchesthus as it were on reaching maturity rendering that support which it is the glory as well as the privilege of youth to accord to age  besides these there were wild dates and palmyra trees and many others too numerous to mention but the peculiar characteristics of which i carefully jotted down in my notebook  many small watercourses were crossed in some of which mak pointed out a number of holes which he said were made by elephants wading in them  he also told us that several mudpools which seemed to have been recently and violently stirred up were caused by the wallowing of the rhinoceros so we kept at all times a sharp lookout for a shot  lions were also numerous in this neighbourhood and we constantly heard them roaring at night but seldom saw them during our march  well as i have already remarked one day we were travelling somewhat slowly through the long grass of this country when feeling oppressed by the heat as well as somewhat fatigued with my load i called to jack who was in advance to stop for a few minutes to rest  most willingly he replied throwing down his load and wiping away the perspiration which stood in large drops on his brow  i was on the point of calling a halt when you spokehow do you get on down there peterkin  our friend who had seated himself on the bale he had been carrying and seemed to be excessively hot looked up with a comical expression of countenance and replied  pretty well thankee  how do you get on up there  oh capitally  theres such a nice cool breeze blowing im quite sorry that i cannot send a little of it down  dont distress yourself my dear fellow ill come up to snuff it  so saying peterkin sprang nimbly upon jacks shoulders and began to gaze round him  i say peterkin said jack why are you a very clever fellow just now  dont know replied peterkin  i give it up at once  always do never could guess a riddle in all my life  because said jack youre up to snuff  oh oh that certainly deserves a pinch so theres for you  jack uttered a roar and tossed peterkin off his shoulders on receiving the punishment  shabby fellow cried peterkin rubbing his head  but i say do let me up again  i thought just as you dropped me that i saw a place where the grass is short  ay there it is fifty yards or so ahead of us with a palmyra tree on it  come let us go rest there for i confess that i feel somewhat smothered in this long grass  we took up our packs immediately and carried them to the spot indicated which we found almost free from long grass  here we lay down to enjoy the delightful shade of the tree and the magnificent view of the country around us  our negroes also seemed to enjoy the shade but they were evidently not nearly so much oppressed with the heat as we were which was very natural  they seemed to have no perception of the beautiful in nature however although they appreciated fully the agreeable influences by which they were surrounded  while i lay at the foot of that tree pondering this subject i observed a very strangelooking insect engaged in a very curious kind of occupation  peterkins eye caught sight of it at the same instant with mine  hollo  jack look here he cried in a whisper  i declare heres a beast been and shoved its head into a hole and converted its tail into a trap  we all three lay down as quietly as possible and i could not but smile when i thought of the literal correctness of my friends quaint description of what we saw  the insect was a species of anteater  it was about an inch and a quarter long as thick as a crowquill and covered with black hair  it put its head into a little hole in the ground and quivered its tail rapidly  the ants which seemed to be filled with curiosity at this peculiar sight went near to see what the strange thing could be and no sooner did one come within the range of the forceps on the insects tail than it was snapped up  now that is the most original trapper i ever did see or hear of remarked peterkin with a broad grin  ive seen many things in my travels but i never expected to meet with a beast that could catch others by merely wagging its tail  you forget the hunters of north america said jack who entice little antelopes towards them by merely wagging a bit of rag on the end of a ramrod  i forget nothing of the sort retorted peterkin  wagging a ramrod is not wagging a tail  besides i spoke of beasts doing it men are not beasts  then i hold you selfconvicted my boy exclaimed jack for you have often called me a beast  by no means jack  i am not selfconvicted but quite correct as i can prove to the satisfaction of any one who isnt a philosopher  you never can prove anything to a philosopher  prove it then  i will  isnt a monkey a beast  certainly  isnt a gorilla a monkey  no doubt it is  and arent you a gorilla  i say lads its time to be going cried jack with a laugh as he rose and resumed his load  at that moment mak uttered an exclamation and pointed towards a particular spot in the plain before us where close by a clump of trees we saw the graceful head and neck and part of the shoulders of a giraffe  we were naturally much excited at the sight this being the first we had fallen in with  youd better go after it said jack to peterkin and take mak with you  id rather youd go yourself replied peterkin for to say truth im pretty well knocked up today  i dont know how it isone day one feels made of iron as if nothing could tire one and the next one feels quite weak and spiritless  well ill go but i shall not take any one with metake observation of the sun mak and keep a straight course as you are now going until night  dye see yonder ridge  yes massa  then hold on direct for that and encamp there  ill not be long behind you and hope to bring you a giraffe steak for supper  we endeavoured to dissuade jack from going out alone but he said truly that his load distributed among us all was quite sufficient without adding to it by taking away another member of the party  thus we parted but i felt a strange feeling of depression a kind of foreboding of evil which i could not shake off despite my utmost efforts peterkin too was unusually silent and i could not avoid seeing that he felt more anxiety on account of jacks rashness than he was willing to allow  our friend took with him one of our largebore rifles and a doublebarrel of smaller bore slung at his back  shortly after parting with him we descried an ostrich feeding in the plain before us  i had long desired to meet with a specimen of this gigantic bird in its native wilds and peterkin was equally anxious to get a shot at it so we called a halt and prepared to stalk it  we were aware that the ostrich is a very silly and very timid bird but not being aware of the best method of hunting it we asked makarooroo to explain how he was in the habit of doing it  you mus know he began dat bird hims be a mos exroroninary beast when hims run hims go fasterer danoh it be dumpossobable for say how much fast hims go  you no can see hims legs dey go same as legs ob leetle bird  but hims be horrobably stupid  suppose he see you far far away goin to de windard ob him he no run way to leeward hims tink you wants to get round him so off him start to git past you and before hims pass he sometimes come close nuff to be shooted or speared me hab spear him dat way but hims awful differcult to git at for all dat  well then mak after that lucid explanation what dyou propose that we should do inquired peterkin examining the locks of his rifle  me pruppose dat you go far ober dere massa ralph go not jist so far and me go to de windard and gib him fright  acting upon this advice we proceeded cautiously to the several spots indicated and our guide set off towards an exposed place where he intended to show himself  in a few minutes we observed the gigantic bird look up in alarm and then we saw makarooroo running like a deer over the plain  the ostrich instantly rushed off madly at full speed not as might have been expected in a contrary direction or towards any place of shelter but simply as it appeared to me with no other end in view than that of getting to windward of his supposed enemy  i observed that he took a direction which would quickly bring him within range of my companions rifle but i was so amazed at the speed with which he ran that i could think of nothing else  every one knows that the ostrich has nothing worthy of the name of wingsmerely a small tuft of feathers at each side with which he cannot make even an attempt to fly but every one does not know probably that with his stout and long legs he can pass over the ground nearly at the ordinary speed of a locomotive engine  i proved this to my own satisfaction by taking accurate observation  on first observing the tremendous speed at which he was going i seized my notebook and pulling out my watch endeavoured to count the number of steps he took in a minute  this however i found was totally impossible for his legs big though they were went so fast that i could no more count them than i could count the spokes of a carriagewheel  i observed however that there were two bushes on the plain in the direction of his flight which he would soon have to pass  i therefore laid down my notebook and rifle and stood with my watch in hand ready to note the precise instants at which he should pass the first and second  by afterwards counting the number of footsteps on the ground between the bushes and comparing the result with the time occupied in passing between the two i thus proposed to myself to ascertain his rate of speed  scarcely had i conceived this idea when the bird passed the first bush and i glanced at my watch then he passed the second and i glanced again  thus i noted that he took exactly ten seconds to pass from one bush to the other  while i was in the act of jotting this down i heard the report of peterkins rifle and looking up hastily saw the tailfeathers of the ostrich knocked into the air but the bird itself passed on uninjured  i was deeply mortified at this failure and all the more so that from past experience i had been led to believe that my friend never missed his mark  hurrying up i exclaimed  why my dear fellow what can have come over you  poor peterkin seemed really quite distressed he looked quite humbled at first  ah said he its all very well for you to say what has come over you but you ought to make allowance for a man who has carried a heavy load all the forenoon  besides he was almost beyond range  moreover although i have hunted a good deal i really have not been in the habit of firing at animal locomotives under full steam  did you ever see such a slapping pace and such an outrageous pair of legs ralph  never said i  but come with me to yonder bushes  im going to make a calculation  whats a calcoolashun inquired our guide who came up at that moment panting violently  its a summation case of counting up one two three etceteraand may be multiplying subtracting and dividing into the bargain  ho dats what me been do at de missionary school  exactly but what sort of calculation ralph means to undertake at present i know not  perhaps hes going to try to find out whether if we were to run at the rate of six miles an hour till doomsday in the wrong direction there would be any chance of our ever sticking that ostrichs tail again on his big body  but come along we shall see  on reaching the spot i could scarcely believe my eyes  each step this bird had taken measured fourteen feet in length  i always carried a rolledup yardmeasure about with me which i applied to the steps so that i could make no mistake  there were exactly thirty of those gigantic paces between the two bushes  this multiplied by six gave 180 steps or 2520 feet in one minute which resulted in 151200 feet or 50400 yards or very nearly thirty miles in the hour  no wonder i only knocked his tail off said peterkin  on the contrary said i the wonder is that under the circumstances you hit the bird at all  on further examination of the place where we had seen the ostrich before it was alarmed we ascertained that his ordinary walking pace varied from twenty to twentysix inches in length  after this unsuccessful hunt we returned to our comrades and proceeded to the rendezvous where we expected to find jack but as he was not there we concluded that he must have wandered farther than he intended so throwing down our packs we set about preparing the camp and a good supper against his return  gradually the sun began to sink low on the horizon then he dipped below it and the short twilight of those latitudes was rapidly merging into night but jack did not return and the uneasiness which we had all along felt in regard to him increased so much that we could not refrain from showing it  ill tell you what it is ralph cried peterkin starting up suddenly im not going to sit here wasting the time when jack may be in some desperate fix  ill go and hunt for him  me tink you right said our guide dere is ebery sort ob ting here beasties and mans  praps massa jack am be kill  i could not help shuddering at the bare idea of such a thing so i at once seconded my companions proposal and resolved to accompany him  take your doublebarrel ralph and ill lend our spare big gun to mak  but how are we to proceed which way are we to go  i have not the most distant idea as to what direction we ought to go in our search  leave that to mak  he knows the ways o the country best and the probable route that jack has taken  are you ready  yes  shall we take some brandy  ay well thought of  hell perhaps be the better of something of that sort if anything has befallen him  now then lets go  leaving our men in charge of the camp with strict injunctions to keep good watch and not allow the fires to go down lest they should be attacked by lions we three set forth on our nocturnal search  from time to time we stood still and shouted in a manner that would let our lost friend know that we were in search of him should he be within earshot but no answering cry came back to us and we were beginning to despair when we came upon the footprints of a man in the soft soil of a swampy spot we had to cross  it was a clear moonlight night so that we could distinguish them perfectly  ho exclaimed our guide as he stooped to examine the marks  well mak what do you make of it inquired peterkin anxiously  mak made no reply for a few seconds then he rose and said earnestly dat am massa jacks foot  i confess that i was somewhat surprised at the air of confidence with which our guide made this statement for after a most careful examination of the prints which were exceedingly indistinct i could discern nothing to indicate that they had been made by jack  are you sure mak asked peterkin  sartin sure massa  then push on as fast as you can  presently we came to a spot where the ground was harder and the prints more distinct  ha youre wrong mak cried peterkin in a voice of disappointment as he stooped to examine the footsteps again  here we have the print of a naked foot jack wore shoes  and whats this blood  yis massa me know dat massa jack hab shoes  but dat be hims foot for all dat and hims hurt somehow for certain  the reader may imagine our state of mind on making this discovery without uttering another word we quickened our pace into a smart run keeping closely in the track of jacks steps  soon we observed that these deviated from side to side in an extraordinary manner as if the person who made them had been unable to walk straight  in a few minutes more we came on the footprints of a rhinocerosa sight which still further increased our alarm  on coming out from among a clump of low bushes that skirted the edge of a small plain we observed a dark object lying on the ground about fifty yards distant from us  i almost sank down with an undefinable feeling of dread on beholding this  we held our rifles in readiness as we approached it at a quick pace for we knew not whether it was not a wild animal which might spring upon us the moment we came close enough  but a few seconds dispelled our dread of such an attack and confirmed our worst fears for there in a pool of blood lay jacks manly form  the face was upturned and the moon which shone full upon it showed that it was pale as death and covered with blood  his clothes were rent and dishevelled and covered with dust as if he had struggled hard with some powerful foe and all round the spot were footprints of a rhinoceros revealing too clearly the character of the terrible monster with which our friend had engaged in unequal conflict  peterkin darted forward tore open jacks shirt at the breast and laid his hand upon his heart  thank god he muttered in a low subdued tone hes not dead quick ralphthe brandyflask  i instantly poured a little of the spirit into the silver cup attached to the flask and handed it to peterkin who after moistening jacks lips began assiduously to rub his chest and forehead with brandy kneeling down by his side i assisted him while i applied some to his feet  while we were thus engaged we observed that our poor friends arms and chest had received several severe bruises and some slight wounds and we also discovered a terrible gash in his right thigh which had evidently been made by the formidable horn of the rhinoceros  this and the other wounds which were still bleeding pretty freely we stanched and bound up and our exertions were at length rewarded by the sight of a faint tinge of colour returning to jacks cheeks  presently his eyes quivered and heaving a short broken sigh he looked up  where am i eh  why whats wrong what has happened he asked faintly in a tone of surprise  all right old boy  here take a swig of this you abominable gorilla said peterkin holding the brandyflask to his mouth while one or two tears of joy rolled down his cheeks  jack drank and rallied a little  ive been ill i see he said gently  ah  i remember now  ive been hurtthe rhinoceros eh have you killed it  i gave it a good shot  it must have been mortal i think  whether youve killed it or not i cannot tell said i taking off my coat and putting it under jacks head for a pillow but it has pretty nearly killed you  do you feel worse jack  i asked this in some alarm observing that he had turned deadly pale again  hes fainted man out o the way cried peterkin as he applied the brandy again to his lips and temples  in a few seconds jack again rallied  now mak bestir yourself cried peterkin throwing off his coat cut down two stout poles and well make some sort of litter to carry him on  i say ralph whispered jack faintly do look to my wounds and see that they are all tightly bound up  i cant afford to lose another drop of blood  its almost all drained away i believe  while i examined my friends wounds and readjusted the bandages my companions cut down two poles  these we laid on the ground parallel to each other and about two feet apart and across them laid our three coats which we fastened in a rough fashion by means of some strong cords which i fortunately happened to have with me  on this rude litter we laid our companion and raised him on our shoulders  peterkin and i walked in rear each supporting one of the poles while makarooroo being the stoutest of the three supported the entire weight of the other ends on his broad shoulders  jack bore the moving better than we had expected so that we entertained sanguine hopes that no bones were broken but that loss of blood was all he had to suffer from  thus slowly and with much difficulty we bore our wounded comrade to the camp    chapter nine  i discover a curious insect and peterkin takes a strange flight  it happened most fortunately at this time that we were within a short days journey of a native village to which after mature consideration we determined to convey jack and remain there until he should be sufficiently recovered to permit of our resuming our journey  hitherto we had studiously avoided the villages that lay in our route feeling indisposed to encounter unnecessarily the risk of being inhospitably receivedperhaps even robbed of our goods if nothing worse should befall us  there was however no other alternative now for jacks wounds were very severe and the amount of blood lost by him was so great that he was as weak as a child  happily no bones were broken so we felt sanguine that by careful nursing for a few weeks we should get him set firmly upon his legs again  on the following morning we set forth on our journey and towards evening reached the village which was situated on the banks of a small stream in the midst of a beautiful country composed of mingled plain and woodland  it chanced that the chief of this village was connected by marriage with king jambaia most fortunate circumstance for us as it ensured our being hospitably received  the chief came out to meet us riding on the shoulders of a slave who although a much smaller man than his master seemed to support his load with much case  probably habit had strengthened him for his special work  a large hut was set apart for our accommodation a dish of yams a roast monkey and a couple of fowls were sent to us soon after our arrival and in short we experienced the kindest possible reception  none of the natives of this village had ever seen a white face in their lives and as may well be imagined their curiosity and amazement were unbounded  the people came constantly crowding round our hut remaining however at a respectful distance and gazed at us until i began to fear they would never go away  here we remained for three weeks during which time jacks wounds healed up and his strength returned rapidly  peterkin and i employed ourselves in alternately tending our comrade and in scouring the neighbouring woods and plains in search of wild animals  as we were now approaching the country of the gorillaalthough indeed it was still far distantour minds began to run more upon that terrible creature than used to be the case and our desire to fall in with it was increased by the strange accounts of its habits and its tremendous power that we received from the natives of this village some of whom had crossed the desert and actually met with the gorilla face to face  more than once while out hunting i have been so taken up with this subject that i have been on the point of shooting a native who appeared unexpectedly before me under the impression that he was a specimen of the animal on which my thoughts had been fixed  one day about a week after our arrival as i was sitting at the side of jacks couch relating to him the incidents of a hunt after a buffalo that makarooroo and i had had the day before peterkin entered with a swaggering gait and setting his rifle down in a corner flung himself on the pile of skins that formed his couch  ill tell you what it is said he with the look and tone of a man who feels that he has been unwarrantably misledi dont believe theres such a beast as a gorilla at all now thats a fact  there was something so confident and emphatic in my comrades manner that despite my wellgrounded belief on that point i felt a sinking at the heart  the bare possibility that after all our trouble and toil and suffering in penetrating thus far towards the land which he is said to inhabit we should find that there really existed no such creature as the gorilla was too terrible to think upon  peterkin said i anxiously what do you mean  i mean replied he slowly that jack is the only living specimen of the gorilla in africa  come now i see you are jesting  am i cried peterkin savagelyjesting eh  that means expressing thoughts and opinions which are not to be understood literally  oh i would that i were sure that i am jesting  ralph its my belief i tell you that the gorilla is a regular sella great big unnatural hairy do  but i saw the skeleton of one in london  i dont care for that  you may have been deceived humbugged  perhaps it was a compound of the bones of a buffalo and a chimpanzee  nay that were impossible said i quickly for no one pretending to have any knowledge of natural history and comparative anatomy could be so grossly deceived  what like was the skeleton ralph inquired jack who seemed to be rather amused by our conversation  it was nearly as tall as that of a mediumsized mani should think about five feet seven or eight inches but the amazing part about it was the immense size and thickness of its bones  its shoulders were much broader than yours jack and your chest is a mere childs compared with that of the specimen of the gorilla that i saw  its legs were very shortmuch shorter than those of a man but its arms were tremendous they were more than a foot longer than yours  in fact if the brutes legs were in the same proportion to its body as are those of a man it would be a giant of ten or eleven feet high  or to take another view of it if you were to take a robust and properly proportioned giant of that height and cut down his legs until he stood about the height of an ordinary man that would be a gorilla  i dont believe it cried peterkin  well perhaps my simile is not quite so felicitous as  i dont mean that interrupted peterkin i mean that i dont believe theres such a brute as a gorilla at all  why what has made you so sceptical inquired jack  the nonsense that these niggers have been telling me through the medium of mak as an interpreter that is what has made me sceptical only think they say that a gorilla is so strong that he can lift a man by the nape of the neck clean off the ground with one of his hind feet yes they say he is in the habit of sitting on the lower branches of trees in lonely dark parts of the wood watching for prey and when a native chances to pass by close enough he puts down his hind foot seizes the wretched man therewith lifts him up into the tree and quietly throttles him  they dont add whether or not he eats him afterwards or whether he prefers him boiled or roasted  now i dont believe that  neither do i returned jack nevertheless the fact that these fellows recount such wonderful stories at all is to some extent evidence in favour of their existence for in such a country as this where so many wonderful and horrible animals exist men are not naturally tempted to invent new creatures it is sufficient to satisfy their craving for the marvellous that they should merely exaggerate what does already exist  go to you sophist if what you say be true and the gorilla turns out to be only an exaggerated chimpanzee or ringtailed roarer does not that come to the same thing as saying that there is no gorilla at all always of course excepting yourself  credit yourself with a punched head said jack and the account shall be balanced when i am sufficiently recovered to pay you off  meanwhile continue your account of what the niggers say about the gorilla  peterkin assumed a look of offended dignity as he replied  without deigning any rejoinder to the utterly absurd and totally irrelevant matter contained in the preliminary sentences of your last remark i pass on to observe that the natives of these wilds hold the opinion that there is one species of the gorilla which is the residence of the spirits of defunct niggers and that these fellows are known by their unusual size and ferocity  hold cried i until i get out my notebook  now peterkin no fibs  honour bright said he ill give it you just as i got it  these possessed brutes are never caught and cant be killed  i only hope i may get the chance to try whether that be true or not  they often carry off natives into the woods where they pull out their toe and finger nails by the roots and then let them go and they are said to be uncommonly fond of sugarcane which they steal from the fields of the natives sometimes in a very daring manner  is that all said i  all exclaimed my comrade  how much more would you have  do you suppose that the gorilla can do anything it likeshang by its tail from the moon or sit down on its nose and run round on its chin  massa jack said makarooroo entering the hut and interrupting our conversation at this point de chief hims tell to me for to tell to you dat wen yous be fit for gohid agin hims gib you cottle for sit upon  cottle mak whats cottle inquired jack with a puzzled look  ho massa you know bery well jist cottlehoxes you know  indeed i dont know replied jack still more puzzled  ive no doubt interposed peterkin that he means cuttle which is the short name for cuttlefish which in such an inland place as this must of course be hoaxes  but what do you mean mak  describe the thing to us  mak scratched his woolly pate as if he were quite unable to explain himself  o massas you be most stoopid dis yer day  cottle not a ting hims am a beast wid two horn an one tail  dere said he pointing with animation to a herd of cattle that grazed near our hut dats cottle or hoxes  we all laughed at this proposal  what cried jack does he mean us to ride upon hoxes as if they were horses  yis massa hims say dat  hims hear long ago ob one missionary as hab do dat so de chief he tink it bery good idea an hims try too an like it bery much only hims fell off ebery tree steps an amost broke all de bones in hims body down to powder  but hims git up agin and fell hoff agin  oh hims like it bery much  if we follow the chiefs example said i laughing we shall scarcely be in a fit state to hunt gorillas at the end of our journey but now i come to think of it the plan seems to me not a bad one  you know a great part of our journey now lies over a comparatively desert country where we shall be none the worse of a ride now and then on oxback to relieve our limbs  i think the proposal merits consideration  right ralph said jackgo mak and tell his majesty or chieftainship or his royal highness with my compliments that i am much obliged by the offer and will consider it  also give him this plug of tobacco and see you dont curtail its dimensions before it leaves your hand you rascal  our guide grinned as he left the hut to execute his mission and we turned to converse on this new plan which the more we thought of it seemed the more to grow in our estimation as most feasible  now lads leave me said jack with a sigh after we had chatted for more than an hour  if i am to go through all that our worthy host seems to have suffered it behoves me to get my frame into a fit state to stand it  i shall therefore try to sleep  so saying he turned round on his side and we left him to his slumbers  as it was still early in the afternoon we two shouldered our rifles and strolled away into the woods partly with the intention of taking a shot at anything that might chance to come in our way but chiefly with the view of having a pleasant chat about our prospect of speedily reaching that goal of our ambitionthe gorilla country  it seems to me observed peterkin as we walked side by side over an open grassy and flowerspeckled plain that lay about a couple of miles distant from the villageit seems to me that we shall never reach this farfamed country  i have no doubt that we shall said i but tell me peterkin do you really doubt the existence of the gorilla  well since you do put it to me so very seriously i can scarce tell what i believe  the fact is that im such a sceptical wretch by nature that i find it difficult to believe anything unless i see it  i endeavoured to combat this very absurd state of mind in my companion by pointing out to him very clearly that if he were to act upon such a principle at all times he would certainly disbelieve many of the commonest facts in nature and give full credit on the other hand to the most outrageous absurdities  for instance said i you would believe that every conjurer swallows fire and smoke and penknives and rabbits because you see him do it and you would disbelieve the existence of the pyramids because you dont happen to have seen them  ralph said my companion seriously dont go in too deep else i shall be drowned  i was about to make some reply when my attention was attracted by a very singular appearance of moisture at the foot of a figtree under which we were passing  going up to it i found that there was a small puddle of clear water near the trunk  this occasioned me much surprise for no rain had fallen in that district since our arrival and probably there had been none for a long period before that  the ground everywhere except in the large rivers and watercourses was quite dry insomuch that as i have said this little solitary pool which was not much larger than my hand occasioned us much surprise  how comes it there said i  thats more than i can tell replied peterkin  perhaps theres a small spring at the root of the tree  perhaps there is said i searching carefully round the spot in all directions but i found nothing to indicate the presence of a spring and indeed when i came to think of it if there had been a spring there would also certainly have been a watercourse leading from it but such was not the case  presently i observed a drop of water fall into the pool and looking up discovered that it fell from a cluster of insects that clung to a branch close over our heads  i at once recognised this waterdistilling insect as an old acquaintance  i had seen it before in england although of a considerably smaller size than this african one  my companion also seemed to be acquainted with it for he exclaimed  ho  i know the fellow  hes what we used at home to call a froghopper after he got his wings and a cuckoospit before that time but these ones are six times the size of ours  i was aware that there was some doubt among naturalists as to whence these insects procured the water they distilled  my own opinion founded on observations made at this time led me to think the greater part of the moisture is derived from the atmosphere though possibly some of it may be procured by suction from the trees  i afterwards paid several visits to this tree and found by placing a vessel beneath them that these insects distilled during a single night as much as three or four pints of water  turning from this interesting discovery we were about to continue our walk when we observed a buffalo bull feeding in the open plain not more than five or six hundred yards off from us  ha  ralph my boy cried peterkin enthusiastically here is metal more attractive  follow me we must make a detour in order to get to leeward of him  we set off at a brisk pace and i freely confess that although the contemplation of the curious processes of the waterdistilling insect afforded me deeper and more lasting enjoyment the gush of excitement and eagerness that instantly followed the discovery of the wild buffalo bull enabled me thoroughly to understand the feeling that leads men especially the less contemplative among theminfinitely to prefer the pleasures of the chase to the calmer joys attendant upon the study of natural history  at a later period that evening i had a discussion with my companions on that subject when i stood up for the pursuit of scientific knowledge as being truly elevating and noble while the pursuit of game was to say the least of it a species of pleasure more suited to the tastes and condition of the savage than of the civilised man  to this peterkin repliedhaving made a preliminary statement to the effect that i was a humbugthat a mans pluck was brought out and his nerves improved by the noble art of hunting which was beautifully scientific in its details and which had the effect of causing a man to act like a man and look like a mannot like a woman or a nincompoop as was too often the case with scientific men  hereupon jack announced it as his opinion that we were both wrong and both right which elicited a cry of bravo from peterkin  for said jack what would the naturalist do without the hunter  his museums would be almost empty and his knowledge would be extremely limited  on the other hand if there were no naturalists the hunterinstead of being the hero who dares every imaginable species of danger in order to procure specimens and furnish information that will add to the sum of human knowledgewould degenerate into the mere butcher who supplies himself and his men with meat or into the semimurderer who delights in shedding the blood of inferior animals  the fact is that the naturalist and the hunter are indispensably necessary to each otherboth are best to use an old expression and when both are combined in one as in the case of the great american ornithologist audubon that is best of all  betterer than both suggested peterkin  but to return from this digression  in less than quarter of an hour we gained a position well to leeward of the buffalo which grazed quietly near the edge of the bushes little dreaming of the enemies who were so cautiously approaching to work its destruction  keep well in rear of me ralph said peterkin as we halted behind a bush to examine our rifles  ill creep as near to him as i can and if by any chance i should not kill him at the first shot do you run up and hand me your gun  without waiting for a reply my companion threw himself on his breast and began to creep over the plain like a snake in the grass  he did this so well and so patiently that he reached to within forty yards of the bull without being discovered  then he ceased to advance and i saw his head and shoulders slowly emerge from among the grass and presently his rifle appeared and was slowly levelled  it was one of our largebore singlebarrelled rifles  he lay in this position for at least two minutes which seemed to me a quarter of an hour so eager was i to see the creature fall  suddenly i heard a sharp snap or crack  the bull heard it too for it raised its huge head with a start  the cap of peterkins rifle had snapped and i saw by his motions that he was endeavouring with as little motion as possible to replace it with another  but the bull caught sight of him and uttering a terrific roar charged in an instant  it is all very well for those who dwell at home in security to think they know what the charge of an infuriated buffalo bull is  did they see it in reality as i saw it at that time tearing madly over the grass foaming at the mouth flashing at the eyes tossing its tail and bellowing hideously they would have a very different idea from what they now have of the trials to which hunters nerves are frequently exposed  peterkin had not time to cap  he leaped up turned round and ran for the woods at the top of his speed but the bull was upon him in an instant  almost before i had time to realise what was occurring i beheld my companion tossed high into the air  he turned a distinct somersault and fell with a fearful crash into the centre of a small bush  i cannot recall my thoughts on witnessing this  i remember only experiencing a sharp pang of horror and feeling that peterkin must certainly have been killed  but whatever my thoughts were they must have been rapid for the time allowed me was short as the bull turned sharp round after tossing peterkin and rushed again towards the bush evidently with the intention of completing the work of destruction  once again i experienced that strange and sudden change of feeling to which i have before referred  i felt a bounding sensation in my breast which tingled to my fingerends  at the same time my head became clear and cool  i felt that providence had placed the life of my friend in my hands  darting forward in advance of the bush i awaited the charge of the infuriated animal  on it came  i knew that i was not a sufficiently good shot to make sure of hitting it in the brain  i therefore allowed it to come within a yard of me and then sprang lightly to one side  as it flew past i never thought of taking aim or putting the piece to my shoulder but i thrust the muzzle against its side and pulled both triggers at once  from that moment consciousness forsook me and i knew not what had occurred for some minutes after  the first object that met my confused vision when i again opened my eyes was peterkin who was seated close beside me on the body of the dead buffalo examining some bloody scratches on the calf of his left leg  he had evidently been attempting to restore me to consciousness for i observed that a wet handkerchief lay on my forehead  he muttered to himself as he examined his wounds  this comes of not looking to ones caps  humph  i do believe that every bone in my body isah heres another cut two inches at least and into the bone of course to judge from the flow of blood  i wonder how much blood i can afford to lose without being floored altogether such a country  i wonder how high i went  i felt as if id got above the moon  hollo ralph better  i sat up as he said this and looked at him earnestly  my dear peterkin then youre not killed after all  not quite but pretty near  if it had not been for that friendly bush i should have fared worse  it broke my fall completely and i really believe that my worst hurts are a few scratches  but how are you ralph  yours was a much more severe case than mine  you should hold your gun tighter man when you fire without putting it to your shoulder  how why what do you mean  simply this that in consequence of your reckless manner of holding your rifle it came back with such a slap on your chest that it floored you  this then accounts for the pain i feel in it  but come said i rising and shaking my limbs to make sure that no bones were broken we have reason to be very thankful we have escaped so easily  i made sure that you were killed when i saw you flying through the air  i always had a species of catluck about me replied peterkin with a smile  but now let us cut off a bit o this fellow to take back with us for jacks supper  with some difficulty we succeeded in cutting out the buffalos tongue by the root and carried it back to the village where after displaying it as an evidence of our prowess we had it cooked for supper  the slight hurts that we had received at the time of this adventure were speedily cured and about two weeks after that we were all well enough to resume our journey    chapter ten  water appreciateddestructive files etcetera  our first start from the village where we had been entertained so hospitably and so long was productive of much amusement to ourselves and to the natives  we had determined to accept of three oxen from the chief and to ride these when we felt fatigued but we thought it best to let our native porters carry our baggage on their shoulders as they had hitherto done  when the animals were led up to our hut we could not refrain from laughing  they were three sturdylooking darkskinned oxen with wickedlooking black eyes and very long horns  now jack do you get up first said peterkin and show us what we are to expect  nay lad i am still entitled to be considered an invalid so you must get up first and not only so but you must try them all in order that i may be enabled to select the quietest  upon my word you are becoming despotic in your sickness and you forget that it is but a short time since i came down from a journey to the sky and that my poor bones are still tender  but here goes  i was born to be victimised so i submit to the decrees of fate  peterkin went up to one of the oxen and attempted to mount it but the animal made a demonstration of an intention to gore him and obstinately objected to this  hold him tight mak he cried after several futile attempts to mount i was always good at leapfrog when a schoolboy see if i dont bring my powers into play now  so saying he went behind the ox took a short race and sprang with the agility of a monkey over its tail on to its back  the ox began to kick and sidle and plunge heavily on receiving this unexpected load but its rider held on well until it took it into its head to dart under a neighbouring tree the lower branches of which swept him off and caused him to fall with a heavy plump to the ground  i told you so he cried rising with a rueful face and rubbing himself as he limped forward  however his pain was more than half affected for the next minute he was on the back of another ox  this one also proved restive but not so much so as the first  the third was a very quiet animal so jack appropriated it as his charger  having bade adieu to the chief and rubbed noses with him and with several of our friends in the village we all three got upon our novel steeds and set forth  but we had not got away from the village more than a mile when the two restive oxen began to display a firm determination to get rid of their intolerable burden  mine commenced to back and sidle and peterkins made occasional darts forward and then stopping suddenly refused to budge a step  we lost all patience at last and belaboured them soundly with twigs the effect of which was to make them advance rather slowly and evidently under protest  look out for branches cried peterkin as we came up to a narrow belt of wood  i had scarcely time to raise my head when i was swept off my seat and hurled to the ground by a large branch  peterkins attention was drawn to me and his ox as if aware of the fact seized the opportunity to swerve violently to one side thereby throwing its rider off  both animals gave a bellow as of triumph erected their tails and ran away they were soon recaptured however by our negroes and mounting once more we belaboured them well and continued our journey  in course of time they became more reconciled to their duties but i cannot say that i ever came to enjoy such riding and all of us ultimately agreed that it was a most undesirable thing to journey on oxback  thus we commenced our journey over this desert or plain of africa and at the end of many weeks found ourselves approaching that part of the country near the equator in which the gorilla is said to dwell  on the way we had many adventures some of an amusing some of a dangerous character and i made many additions to my collection of animals besides making a number of valuable and interesting notes in my journal but all this i am constrained to pass over in order to introduce my reader to those regions in which some of our most wonderful adventures occurred  one or two things however i must not omit to mention  in passing over the desert we suffered much from want of water frequently the poor oxen had to travel two or three days without tasting a drop and their distress was so great that we more than once thought of turning them adrift at the first good wateringplace we should come to and proceed as formerly on foot for we had all recovered our wonted vigour and were quite capable of standing the fatigues of the journey as well as our men  but several times we had found the country destitute of game and were reduced to the point of starvation so we continued to keep the oxen lest we should require them for food  on one occasion we were wending our way slowly along the bed of what in the rainy season would become a large river but which was now so thoroughly dry that we could not find even a small pool in which the oxen might slake their thirst  they had been several days absolutely without a drop of water while we were reduced to a mouthful or two per man in the day  as we could not exist much longer without the lifegiving fluid jack dismounted and placing the load of one of the men on the oxs back sent him off in advance to look for water  we had that morning seen the footprints of several animals which are so fond of water that they are never found at any great distance from some spot where it may be found  we therefore felt certain of falling in with it ere long  about two hours afterwards our negro returned saying that he had discovered a pool of rainwater and showing the marks of mud on his knees in confirmation of the truth of what he said  ask him if theres much of it mak said jack as we crowded eagerly round the man  hims say there be great plenty ob itnuff to tumble in  gladdened by this news we hastened forward  the oxen seemed to have scented the water from afar for they gradually became more animated and quickened their pace of their own accord until they at last broke into a run  peterkin and i soon outstripped our party and quite enjoyed the gallop  there it is cried my comrade joyfully pointing to a gleaming pond in a hollow of the plain not two hundred yards off  hurrah  i shouted unable to repress my delight at the sight  the oxen rushed madly forward and we found that they were away with us no pulling at our ropebridles had any effect on them  my companion foreseeing what would happen leaped nimbly off just as he reached the margin of the pond  i being unable to collect my thoughts for the emergency held on  my steed rushed into the water up to the neck and stumbling as he did so threw me into the middle of the pond out of which i scrambled amidst the laughter of the whole party who came up almost as soon as the oxen so eager were they to drink  after appeasing our own thirst we stood looking at the oxen and it really did our hearts good to see the poor thirsty creatures enjoy themselves so thoroughly  they stood sucking in the water as if they meant to drink up the whole pond half shutting their eyes which became mild and amiable in appearance under the influence of extreme satisfaction  their sides which had been for the last two days in a state of collapse began to swell and at last were distended to such an extent that they seemed as if ready to burst  in point of fact the creatures were actually as full as they could hold and when at length they dragged themselves slowly almost unwillingly out of the pool any sudden jerk or motion caused some of the water to run out of their mouths  some time after that we were compelled to part with our poor steeds in consequence of their being bitten by an insect which caused their death  this destructive fly which is called tsetse is a perfect scourge in some parts of africa  its bite is fatal to the horse ox and dog yet strange to say it is not so to man or to wild animals  it is not much larger than the common housefly and sucks the blood in the same manner as the mosquito by means of a proboscis with which it punctures the skin  when man is bitten by it no more serious evil than slight itching of the part follows  when the ox is bitten no serious effect follows at first but a few days afterwards a running takes place at the eyes and nose swellings appear under the jaw and on other parts of the body emaciation quickly follows even although the animal may continue to graze and after a long illness sometimes of many weeks it dies in a state of extreme exhaustion  the tsetse inhabits certain localities in great numbers while other places in the immediate neighbourhood are entirely free  those natives therefore who have herds of cattle avoid the dangerous regions most carefully yet despite their utmost care they sometimes come unexpectedly on the habitat of this poisonous fly and lose the greater part of their cattle  when our poor oxen were bitten and the fatal symptoms began to appear we knew that their fate was sealed so we conducted them into a pleasant valley on which we chanced to alight where there was plenty of grass and water and there we left them to die  another incident occurred to us in this part of our journey which is worthy of record  one day peterkin and i had started before our party with our rifles and had gone a considerable distance in advance of them when we unexpectedly came upon a band of natives who were travelling in an opposite direction  before coming up with their main body we met with one of their warriors who came upon us suddenly in the midst of a wooded spot and stood rooted to the earth with fear and amazement at which indeed we were not much surprised for as he had probably never seen white faces before he must have naturally taken us for ghosts or phantoms of some sort  he was armed with shield and spear but his frame was paralysed with terror  he seemed to have no power to use his weapons  at first we also stood in silent wonder and returned his stare with interest but after a few seconds the comicality of the mans appearance tickled peterkin so much that he burst into a fit of laughter which had the effect of increasing the terror of the black warrior to such a degree that his teeth began to chatter in his head  he actually grew livid in the face  i never beheld a more ghastly countenance  i say ralph observed my companion after recovering his composure we must try to show this fellow that we dont mean him any harm else hell die of sheer fright  before i could reply or any steps could be taken towards this end his party came up and we suddenly found ourselves face to face with at least a hundred men all of whom were armed with spears or bows and arrows  behind them came a large troop of women and children  they were all nearly naked and i observed that they were blacker in the skin than most of the negroes we had yet met with  heres a pretty mess said peterkin looking at me  what is to be done said i  if we were to fire at them id lay a bet theyd run away like the wind replied my comrade but i cant bear to think of shedding human blood if it can possibly be avoided  while we spoke the negroes who stood about fifty yards distant from us were consulting with each other in eager voices but never for a moment taking their eyes off us  what say you to fire over their heads  i suggested  ready present then cried peterkin with a recklessness of manner that surprised me  we threw forward our rifles and discharged them simultaneously  the effect was tremendous  the whole bandmen women and children uttered an overwhelming shriek and turning round fled in mad confusion from the spot  some of the warriors turned however ere they had gone far and sent a shower of spears at us one of which went close past my cheek  we have acted rashly i fear said i as we each sought shelter behind a tree  no doubt the savages construed this act of ours into an admission that we did not consider ourselves invulnerable and plucked up courage accordingly for they began again to advance towards us though with hesitation  i now saw that we should be compelled to fight for our lives and deeply regretted my folly in advising peterkin to fire over their heads but happily before blood was drawn on either side makarooroo and jack came running towards us  the former shouted an explanation of who and what we were to our late enemies and in less than ten minutes we were mingling together in the most amicable manner  we found that these poor creatures were starving having failed to procure any provisions for some time past and they were then on their way to another region in search of game  we gave them as much of our provisions as we could spare besides a little tobacco which afforded them inexpressible delight  then rubbing noses with the chief we parted and went on our respective ways    chapter eleven  how we met with our first gorilla and how we served him  it never rains but it pours is a true proverb  i have often noticed in the course of my observations on sublunary affairs that events seldom come singly  i have often gone out fishing for trout in the rivers of my native land day after day and caught nothing while at other times i have day after day returned home with my basket full  as it was in england so i found it in africa  for many days after our arrival in the gorilla country we wandered about without seeing a single creature of any kind  lions we ascertained were never found in those regions and we were told that this was in consequence of their having been beaten off the field by gorillas  but at last after we had all severally and collectively given way to despair we came upon the tracks of a gorilla and from that hour we were kept constantly on the qui vive and in the course of the few weeks we spent in that part of the country we bagged as peterkin expressed it no end of gorillasgreat and small young and old  i will never forget the powerful sensations of excitement and anxiety that filled our breasts when we came on the first gorilla footprint  we felt as no doubt robinson crusoe did when he discovered the footprint of a savage in the sand  here at last was the indubitable evidence of the existence and presence of the terrible animal we had come so far to see here was the footstep of that creature about which we had heard so many wonderful stories whose existence the civilised world had up to within a very short time back doubted exceedingly and in regard to which even now we knew comparatively very little  makarooroo assured us that he had hunted this animal some years ago and had seen one or two at a distance though he had never killed one and stated most emphatically that the footprint before us which happened to be in a soft sandy spot was undoubtedly caused by the foot of a gorilla  being satisfied on this head we four sat down in a circle round the footprint to examine it while our men stood round about us looking on with deep interest expressed in their dark faces  at last said i carefully brushing away some twigs that partly covered the impression  ay at last echoed jack while his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm  ay observed peterkin and a pretty big last he must require too i shouldnt like to be his shoemaker  what a thumb or a toe  one doesnt know very well which to call it  i wonder if its old said i  as old as the hills replied peterkin at least 50 i would judge from its size  you mistake me  i mean that i wonder whether the footprint is old or if it has been made recently  hims quite noo interposed our guide  how dye know mak  cause me see  ay but what do you see that enables you to form such an opinion  o ralph how can you expect a nigger to understand such a sentence as that said jack as he turned to mak and added what do you see  me see one leetle stick brok in middel  if you look to him you see him white and clean  if hims was old hims would be mark wid rain and dirt  there cried peterkin giving me a poke in the side see what it is to be a minute student of the small things in nature  make a note of it ralph  i did make a note of it mentally on the spot and then proposed that we should go in search of the gorilla without further delay  we were in the midst of a dark gloomy wood in the neighbourhood of a range of mountains whose blue serrated peaks rose up into the clouds their sides were partly clothed with wood  we were travellingnot huntingat the time we fell in with the track above referred to so we immediately ordered the men to encamp where they were while we should go after the gorilla accompanied only by mak whose nerves we could depend on  shouldering our trusty rifles and buckling tight the belts of our heavy huntingknives we sallied forth after the manner of american indians in single file keeping as may well be supposed a sharp lookout as we went along  the fact was that long delay frequent disappointment and now the near prospect of success conspired together to fill us with a species of nervous excitement that caused us to start at every sound  the woods here were pretty thick but they varied in their character so frequently that we were at one time pushing slowly among dense almost impenetrable underwood at another walking briskly over small plains which were covered in many places with large boulders  it was altogether a gloomy savagelooking country and seemed to me well suited to be the home of so dreadful an animal  there were few animals to be seen here  even birds were scarce and a few chattering monkeys were almost the only creatures that broke the monotonous silence and solitude around us  what a dismal place said peterkin in a low tone  i feel as if we had got to the fagend of the world as if we were about plunging into ancient chaos  it is indeed i replied a most dreary region  i think that the gorillas will not be disturbed by many hunters with white faces  theres no saying interposed jack  i should not wonder now if you ralph were to go home and write a book detailing our adventures in these parts that at least half the sportsmen of england would be in africa next year and the race of gorillas would probably become extinct  if the sportsmen dont come out until i write a book about them i fear the gorillas will remain undisturbed for all time to come  at that time reader i was not aware of the extreme difficulty that travellers experience in resisting the urgent entreaties of admiring and too partial friends  presently we came to a part of the forest where the underwood became so dense that we could scarcely make our way through it at all and here we began for the first time to have some clearer conception of the immense power of the creature we were in pursuit of for in order to clear its way it had torn down great branches of the trees and in one or two places had seized young trees as thick as a mans arm and snapped them in two as one would snap a walkingcane  following the track with the utmost care for several miles we at length came to a place where several huge rocks lay among the trees  here while we were walking along in silence makarooroo made a peculiar noise with his tongue which we knew meant that he had discovered something worthy of special attention so we came to an abrupt pause and looked at him  what is it mak inquired jack  the guide put his finger on his mouth to impose silence and stood in a listening attitude with his eyes cast upon the ground his nostrils distended and every muscle of his dusky frame rigid as if he were a statue of black marble  we also listened attentively and presently heard a sound as of the breaking of twigs and branches  dat am be gorilla said the guide in a low whisper  we exchanged looks of eager satisfaction  how shall we proceed mak inquired jack  we mus go bery slow dis way said the guide imitating the process of walking with extreme caution  no break leetle stick  if you break leetle stick hims go right away  promising mak that we would attend to his injunctions most carefully we desired him to lead the way and in a few minutes after came so near to where the sound of breaking sticks was going on that we all halted fearing that we should scare the animal away before we could get a sight of it amongst the dense underwood  what can he be doing said i to the guide as we stood looking at each other for a few seconds uncertain how to act  hims breakin down branches for git at hims feed spose  do you see that whispered peterkin as he pointed to an open space among the bushes  isnt that a bit o the hairy brute  it looks like it replied jack eagerly  cluck ejaculated makarooroo making a peculiar noise with his tongue dat him  blaze away  but it may not be a mortal part objected peterkin  he might escape if only wounded  nebber fear  hims come at us if hims be wound  only we mus be ready for him  all ready said jack cocking both barrels of his riflenow peterkin a good aim  if he comes here he shall get a quietus  all this was said in the lowest possible whispers  peterkin took a steady aim at the part of the creature that was visible and fired  i have gone through many wild adventures since then  i have heard the roar of the lion and the tiger in all circumstances and the laugh of the hyena besides many other hideous sounds but i never in all my life listened to anything that in any degree approached in thundering ferocity the appalling roar that burst upon our ears immediately after that shot was fired  i can compare it to nothing for nothing i ever heard was like it  if the reader can conceive a human fiend endued with a voice far louder than that of the lion yet retaining a little of the intonation both of the mans voice and of what we should suppose a fiends voice to be he may form some slight idea of what that roar was it is impossible to describe it  perhaps maks expression in regard to it is the most emphatic and truthful it was absolutely horriboble every one has heard a sturdy wellgrown little boy when being thrashed howling at the very top of his bent  if one can conceive of a fullgrown male giant twenty feet high pouring forth his whole soul and voice with similarly unrestrained fervour he may approximate to a notion of it  and it was not uttered once or twice but again and again until the whole woods trembled with it and we felt as if our ears could not endure more of it without the tympanums being burst  for several moments we stood motionless with our guns ready expecting an immediate attack and gazing with awe not unmingledat least on my partwith fear at the turmoil of leaves and twigs and broken branches that was going on round the spot where the monster had been wounded  come cried jack at length losing patience and springing forward if he wont attack us we must attack him  we followed close on his heels and next moment emerged upon a small and comparatively open space in the midst of which we found the gorilla seated on the ground tearing up the earth with its hands grinning horribly and beating its chest which sent forth a loud hollow sound as if it were a large drum  we saw at once that both its thighs had been broken by peterkins shot  of all the hideous creatures i had ever seen or heard of none came up in the least degree to this  apart altogether from its gigantic size this monster was calculated to strike terror into the hearts of beholders simply by the expression of its visage which was quite satanic  i could scarcely persuade myself that i was awake  it seemed as if i were gazing on one of those hideous creatures one beholds when oppressed with nightmare  but we had little time to indulge in contemplation for the instant the brute beheld us it renewed its terrible roar and attempted to spring up but both its legs at once gave way and it fell with a passionate growl biting the earth and twisting and tearing bunches of twigs and leaves in its fury  suddenly it rushed upon us rapidly by means of its fore legs or arms  look out jack we cried in alarm  jack stood like a rock and deliberately levelled his rifle  even at this moment of intense excitement i could not help marvelling at the diminutive appearance of my friend when contrasted with the gorilla  in height indeed he was of course superior and would have been so had the gorilla been able to stand erect but his breadth of shoulder and chest and his length and size of arm were strikingly inferior  just as the monster approached to within three yards of him jack sent a ball into its chest and the king of the african woods fell dead at our feet  it is impossible to convey in words an idea of the gush of mingled feelings that filled our breasts as we stood beside and gazed at the huge carcass of our victim  pity at first predominated in my heart then i felt like an accomplice to a murder and then an exulting sensation of joy at having obtained a specimen of one of the rarest animals in the world overwhelmed every other feeling  the size of this animaland we measured him very carefullywas as follows  height 5 feet 6 inches girth of the chest 4 feet 2 inches spread of its arms 7 feet 2 inches  perhaps the most extraordinary measurement was that of the great thumb of its hind foot which was 5 and a half inches in circumference  when i looked at this and at the great bunches of hard muscles which composed its brawny chest and arms i could almost believe in the stories told by the natives of the tremendous feats of strength performed by the gorilla  the body of this brute was covered with grey hair but the chest was bare and covered with tough skin and its face was intensely black  i shuddered as i looked upon it for there was something terribly humanlike about it despite the brutishness of its aspect  now ill tell you what we shall do said jack after we had completed our examination of the gorilla  we will encamp where we are for the night and send makarooroo back to bring our fellows up with the packs so that you ralph will be able to begin the work of skinning and cleaning the bones at once  what say you  agreed with all my heart i replied  well then observed peterkin here goes for a fire to begin with and then for victuals to continue with  by the way what say you to a gorilla steak  im told the niggers eat himdont they mak  yis massa dey does  more dan dat de niggers in dis part ob country eat mans  eat mans echoed peterkin in horror  yis eat mans and womins an childerdens  oh the brutes  but i dont believe you mak  what are the villains called  well it not be easy for say what dem be called  missnaries calls dem canibobbles  ho shouted peterkin canibobbles eh well done  mak i must get you to write a new dictionary i think it would pay  it wont pay to go on talking like this though observed jack come hand me the axe  ill fell this tree while you strike a light peterkinbe off with you makas for ralph we must leave him to his notebook i see there is no chance of getting him away from his beloved gorilla till he has torn its skin from its flesh and its flesh from its bones  jack was right  i had now several long hours work before me which i knew could not be delayed and to which i applied myself forthwith most eagerly while my comrades lit the fire and prepared the camp and makarooroo set off on his return journey to bring up the remainder of our party  that night while i sat by the light of the campfire toiling at my task long after the others had retired to rest i observed the features of jack and peterkin working convulsively and their hands clutching nervously as they slept and i smiled to think of the battles with gorillas which i felt assured they must be fighting and the enormous bags they would be certain to tell of on returning from the realms of dreamland to the regions of reality    chapter twelve  peterkins schoolday reminiscences  the day following that on which we shot our first gorilla was a great and memorable day in our hunting career in africa for on that day we saw no fewer than ten gorillas two females seven young onesone of which was a mere baby gorilla in its mothers armsand a huge lone male or bachelor gorilla as peterkin called him  and of these we killed fourthree young ones and the old bachelor  i am happy to add that i saved the lives of the infant gorilla and its mother as i shall presently relate  the portion of country through which we travelled this day was not so thickly wooded as that through which we had passed the day before so that we advanced more easily and enjoyed ourselves much as we went along  about the middle of the day we came to a spot where there were a number of wild vines the leaves of which are much liked by the gorilla so we kept a sharp lookout for tracks  soon we came upon several as well as broken branches and twigs in which were observed the marks of teeth showing that our game had been there  but we passed from the wood where these signs were discovered out upon an open plain of considerable extent  here we paused undecided as to whether we should proceed onward or remain there to hunt  i vote for advancing said peterkin for i observe that on the other side of this plain the wood seems very dense and it is probable that we may find mister gorilla therewhat think you mak  the guide nodded in reply  i move said jack that as the country just where we stand is well watered by this little brook besides being picturesque and beautiful to look upon we should encamp where we are and leaving our men to guard the camp cross this plainwe three take mak along with us and spend the remainder of the day in hunting  i vote for the amendment said i  then the amendment carries cried jack for in all civilised societies most votes always carry and although we happen to be in an uncivilised region of the earth we must not forget that we are civilised hunters  the vote of two hunters ought certainly to override that of one hunter  peterkin demurred to this at once on the ground that it was unfair  how so said i  in the first place replied he looking uncommonly wise and placing the point of his right finger in the palm of his left handin the first place i do not admit your premises and therefore i object to your conclusion  i do not admit that in civilised societies most votes carry on the contrary it too frequently happens that in civilised societies motions are made seconded discussed and carried without being put to the vote at all often they are carried without being made seconded or discussedas when a bottlenosed old gentleman in office chooses to ignore the rights of men and carry everything his own way neither do i admit that we three are civilised hunters for although it is true that i am it is wellknown that you ralph are a philosopher and jack is a gorilla  therefore i object to your conclusion that your two votes should carry for you cannot but admit that the vote of one hunter ought to override that of two such creatures which would not be the case were there an equality existing between us  peterkin said i there is fallacy in your reasoning  can you show it said he  no the web is too much ravelled to disentangle  not at all cried jack i can unravel it in a minute and settle the whole question by proving that there does exist an equality between us for it is wellknown and generally admitted by all his friends and must be acknowledged by himself that peterkin is an ass  even admitting that rejoined peterkin it still remains to be proved that a philosopher a gorilla and an ass are equal  of course i believe the latter to be superior to both the former animals but in consideration of the lateness of the hour and the able manner in which you have discussed this subject i beg to withdraw my motion and to state that i am ready to accompany you over the plain as soon as you please  at this point our conversation was interrupted by the shriek of a small monkey which had been sitting all the time among the branches of the tree beneath which we stood  i declare it has been listening to us cried peterkin  yes and is shouting in triumph at your defeat added jack  as he spoke makarooroo fired and the monkey fell to the ground almost at our feet  alas it has paid a heavy price for its laugh said peterkin in a tone of sadness  the poor thing was mortally wounded so much so that it could not even cry  it looked up with a very piteous expression in our faces  placing its hand on its side it coughed once or twice then lying down on its back and stretching itself out quite straight it closed its eyes and died  i never could bear to shoot monkeys  there was something so terribly humanlike in their sufferings that i never could witness the death of one without feeling an almost irresistible inclination to weep sometimes when short of provisions i was compelled to shoot monkeys but i did so as seldom as possible and once i resolved to go supperless to bed rather than shoot one whose aspect was so sad and gentle that i had not the heart to kill it  my companions felt as i did in this matter and we endeavoured to restrain makarooroo as much as possible but he could not understand our feelings and when he got a chance of a shot almost invariably forgot our injunctions to let monkeys alone unless we were absolutely ill off for food  to do him justice however i must add that we were at this particular time not overburdened with provisions and the men were much pleased to have the prospect of a roast monkey for supper  having given our men a little tobacco a gift which caused their black faces to beam with delight we shouldered our rifles and set off across the plain towards the thick wood which was not more than five miles distant if so much  it was a beautiful scene this plain with its clumps of trees scattered over it like islands in a lake and its profusion of wild flowers  the weather too was delightfulcooler than usualand there was a freshness in the air which caused us to feel light of heart while the comparative shortness of the grass enabled us to proceed on our way with light steps  as we walked along for some time in silence i thought upon the goodness and the provident care of the creator of our world for during my brief sojourn in africa i had observed many instances of the wonderful exactness with which things in nature were suited to the circumstances in which they were placed and the bountiful provision that was made everywhere for man and beast  yet i must confess i could not help wondering and felt very much perplexed when i thought of the beautiful scenes in the midst of which i moved being inhabited only by savage men who seemed scarcely to appreciate the blessings by which they were surrounded and who violated constantly all the laws of him by whom they were created  my meditations were interrupted by jack saying  i cannot help wondering why that poor monkey kept so still all the time we were talking  one would think that it should have been frightened away just as we came under the tree  i have no doubt said i that although of course it could not understand what we said yet it was listening to us  im not so certain that it did not understand observed peterkin you know that sailors believe that monkeys could speak if they chose but they dont for fear that they should be made to work  well whatever truth there may be in that of this i am certain they are the most deceptive creatures that exist  i dont agree with you rejoined peterkin  its my opinion that little boys are the greatest deceivers living  what all little boys exclaimed jack  no not all  i have not so bad an opinion of the race as that  ive had a good deal to do with boys during my naval career and among the middies of her majestys navy i have met with as fine little chaps as one would wish to seeregular bricks afraid of nothing except of doing anything that would be thought sneaking or shabby ready to dare anythingto attack a seventyfour singlehanded in a punt or a bumboat if need be nevertheless ive met boys and a good many of them too who would beat all the monkeys in africa at sneaking and deceiving  i remember one rascal who went to the same school with me who was a wonderfully plausible deceiver  i cant help laughing yet when i think of the curious way he took to free himself of the restraint of school  how was it cried jack tell us about itdo  well you must know began peterkin that this boy was what jack tars would call a great stupid lubberly fellow  he was a very fairhaired white eyelashed sort of chap that seemed to grow at such a rate that he was always too big for his clothes and showed an unusual amount of wrist and ankle even for a boy  most people who met him thought him a very stupid boy at first but those who came to know him well found that he was rather a sharp clever fellow but a remarkably shy dog  we called him doddle  his mother was a widow and he was an only son and had been spoiled of course so that he was not put to school till he was nearly twelve years of age  he had been at several schools before coming to ours but had been deemed by each successive schoolmaster a hopeless imbecile and he was so mischievous that they advised his poor mother to take him away and try if she could not instil a little knowledge into him herself  the old lady was a meek simple body and quite as stupid as her hopeful son appeared to be  hearing that our master was a sharp fellow and somewhat noted as a good manager of obstreperous boys she brought him to our school as a last resource and having introduced him to the master went her way  it was near the end of playhour when she brought him so he was turned out into the playground and stood there looking like a mongrel cur turned unexpectedly into a kennel of pointers  well doddle said one of the sixthform boys going up to him and addressing him for the first time by the name which stuck to him ever after where did you grow and who cut you down and tossed you in here  eh said doddle looking sheepish  whats your name man and where did you come from and how old are you and how far can you jump without a race and in fact i want to know all about you  my names tommy thompson replied the boy and i  at that moment the bell rang and the remainder of his sentence was drowned in the rush of the rest of us to the classroom  when all was quiet the master called doddle up and said well thompson my boy your mother tells me you have learned a little grammar and a little arithmetic  i hope that we shall instil into you a good deal of those branches of learning and of many others besides ere long  let me hear what you can do  i can play hockey and dumps began doddle in a singsong tone and with the most uncommonly innocent expression of visage an i can  stay boy interrupted the master smiling i do not want to know what you can play at  keep silence until i put a few questions to you  what is english grammar  eh  dont say eh  when you fail to understand me say sir interrogatively  what is english grammar  its a book  the master looked over the top of his spectacles at doddle in surprise  english grammar said he slowly and with a slight touch of sternness is indeed contained in a book but i wish to know what it teaches  ehai mean sir interrogatively  what does english grammar teach boy cried the master angrily  doddle laid hold of his chin with his right hand and looked down at the floor with an air of profound thought saying slowly in an undertone to himself whatdoesenglishgrammarteachteach grammarteach  itteachesai dont know what it teaches perhaps you can tell me sir  he looked up and uttered the last sentence with such an air of blank humility that we all had to cram our pocket handkerchiefs into our mouths to prevent a universal explosion  the master looked over his spectacles again at doddle with an expression of unutterable amazement we looked on with breathless interest not unmingled with awe for we expected some awful outbreak on the part of the master who seemed quite unable to make up his mind what to do or say but continued to stare for nearly a minute at the boy who replied to the stare with a humble idiotic smile  suddenly the master said sharply how much are seven times nine  five hundred and fortytwo and a half answered doddle without a moments hesitation  the master did not look surprised this time but he took doddle by the shoulder and drawing him towards his chair looked earnestly into his face  then he said quietly that will do thompson go to your seat  this was all that occurred at that time  during a whole week the master tried by every means to get doddle to learn something but doddle could learn nothing  yet he seemed to try  he pored over his book and muttered with his lips and sometimes looked anxiously up at the ceiling with an expression of agony on his face that seemed to indicate a tremendous mental effort  every species of inducement was tried and occasionally punishment was resorted to  he was kept in at playhours and put in a corner during schoolhours and once the master having lost patience with him he was flogged  but it was all one to doddle all the methods tried proved utterly unavailing  he could not be got to acquire a single lesson and often gave such remarkable answers that we all believed him to be mad  on the monday forenoon of his second week at the school the master called him up again for examination  now thompson he began you have been a long time over that lesson let us see how much of it you have learned  what is etymology  etymology answered doddle isisan irregular pronoun  boy cried the master sternly  please sir pleaded doddle with deprecatory air ii suppose i was thinkin o one o the other mologies not the etty one  ha ejaculated the master well tell me how many parts of speech are there  nineteen answered the boy quite confidently  oh exclaimed the master with a good deal of sarcasm in his tone pray name them  in a very singsong voice and with an air of anxious simplicity doddle began article noun adjective pronoun verb adverb preposition conjunction interjection outerjection beginning with ies in the pluralas baby babies lady ladies hady hadies please sir isnt that last one a bad word  the boy is a lunatic muttered the master  the boys in the class were far past laughing now we were absolutely stunned  the master seemed perplexed for doddle was gazing at him with a look of mild selfsatisfaction  i say peterkin whispered the boy next to me as sure as youre alive that boys shamming stupid  presently the master who had been turning over the leaves of the grammar in a way that showed he was not conscious of what he was about looked up and said abruptly what is a proper noun  a wellbehaved one replied doddle  at this the whole school tittered violently  silence boys cried the master in a tone that produced the desired effect so thoroughly that you might have heard a pin drop  then laying his hand on doddles shoulder he looked him full in the face and said solemnly thompson i have found you out  go sir to your seat and remain behind when the other boys go to the playground  we observed that doddle grew very red in the face as he came back to his seat and during the rest of the hour he never once looked up  during the whole of the playhour the master and he remained shut up together in the schoolroom  we never discovered what took place there between them for neither threats nor coaxing could induce doddle afterwards to speak on the subject but from that day forward he was a changed boy  he not only learned his lessons but he learned them well and in the course of time became one of the best scholars in the school so that although he never would admit it we all came to the conclusion he had been shamming stupidattempting to deceive the master into the belief that he was incurable and thus manage to get rid of lessons and school altogether  a most remarkable boy observed jack when peterkin concluded certainly he beat the monkeys hollow  i wonder said i what the master said or did to him that wrought such a mighty change  dont know replied peterkin i suppose he told him that now he had found him out he would flay him alive if he didnt give in or something of that sort  we had now entered the dark forest that edged the plain over which we had been walking and further conversation on this subject was stopped and the subject itself banished utterly from our minds by the loud startling cry of a gorilla at no great distance from us  hist thats him whispered peterkin  instantly throwing our rifles into a position of readiness we pushed rapidly through the underwood in the direction whence the cry had come    chapter thirteen  we get into the thick of itgreat success  in a few minutes we came upon a female gorilla which all unconscious of our approach was sitting at the foot of a vine eating the leaves there were four young ones beside her engaged in the same occupation in order to approach within shot of these we had to creep on all fours through the brushwood with the greatest caution for gorillas are sharpsighted and they have a remarkably acute sense of hearing so that sometimes the breaking of a dry twig under ones foot is sufficient to alarm them  we did not venture to speak even in whispers as we advanced but by a sign jack told peterkin to take the lead  jack himself followed makarooroo went next and i brought up the rear  in all our hunting expeditions we usually maintained this arrangement where it was necessary  peterkin was assigned the post of honour because he was the best shot jack being next best came second and i came last not because our guide was a better shot than i but because he was apt to get excited and to act rashly so that he required looking after  i was at all times ready to lay hold of him by the hair of his woolly head which as he was nearly naked was the only part of him that one could grasp with any degree of firmness  after creeping in this manner for some distance we got within range peterkin and jack took aim and fired together  the old gorilla and one of the young ones fell instantly and from their not struggling it was evident that they were shot quite dead  the guide and i fired immediately after but only the one that i fired at fell  the other two ran off as fast as they could  sometimes they ran on all fours and i observed that while running in this fashion the hind legs passed between the arms or as it were overstepped them  occasionally however they rose and ran on their hind legs in a stooping position  when they did this i was particularly struck with their grotesque yet strong resemblance to man and i do not think that i could at that time have prevailed upon myself to fire at them  i should have felt like a murderer  in truth my thoughts and sensations just then were anything but agreeable  nevertheless i was so excited by the chase that i am quite certain no one to look at me could have guessed what was passing in my mind  we ran as rapidly as was possible in such a tangled forest but we had no chance with the young gorillas  peterkin at last ran himself out of breath  stopping suddenly he said pantingly  itsono use whatever  ho dear me my bellows are about exploded  weve no chance in a race with these hairy men responded jack as he wiped the perspiration from his foreheadwhy did you miss mak  cause me no could hit spose massa  very justly and modestly said remarked peterkin with an approving nod  tis a pity that men are not more generally animated with your spirit mak  most people when they do wrong or make a mistake are too apt to try to excuse themselves  yes i added with a laugh particularly when they blow the tails out of ostriches  peterkin shook his head and said solemnly ralph my boy dont take to joking  it dont agree with your constitution  youll get ill if you do and we cant afford to have you laid up on our hands in these outotheway regions  come now let us back to the gorillas and secure them lest their comrades carry them away said jack turning to retrace our steps  i was anxious to shoot as many gorillas as possible in order that i might study the peculiarities of and differences existing between the different speciesif there should be suchand between various individuals of the same species in all stages of development  i had made an elaborate examination of our first gorilla and had taken copious notes in regard to it  being desirous of doing the same as far as possible with the female and the two young ones we had just killed i hastened back with my companions and we fastened them securely among the branches of a conspicuous tree intending to send out some of our men for them on our return to camp  after this we resumed our search for more but wandered about for several hours without meeting with any although we observed recentlymade footprints in abundance  we went as nearly as possible in a direction parallel to our camp so that although we walked far we did not increase our distance from it to any great extent  presently makarooroo made a peculiar cluck with his tongue and we all came to an abrupt stand  what ist mak  the negro did not speak but pointed eagerly in front of him while the whites of his eyes seemed to sparkle with animation and raised his gun to shoot  we came up at the moment and through an opening in the bushes saw what he was about to fire at  it was a female gorilla with a baby gorilla in her arms  fierce and hairy though she was there was a certain air of tenderness about this mother as she stroked and pawed her little one that went straight to my heart and caused me almost involuntarily to raise my arm and strike up the muzzle of makarooroos gun at the moment he pulled the trigger  the consequence of this act was that the ball passed close over their heads  the report of the piece was instantly followed by a roar of consternation mingled with rage from the mother and a shriek of terror from the baby which again was immediately followed by a burst of laughter from us as we beheld the little baby clasp its arms tightly round its mother while she scampered wildly away from us  mak looked at me in amazement  what for you be do dat massa  to prevent you from committing murder you rascal said i laughing have you no feelings of natural pity or tenderness that you could coolly aim at such a loving pair as that  the guide seemed a little put out by this remark and went on reloading his gun without making reply  he had received enough of moral education at the mission stations to appreciate to some extent the feelings by which i was actuated yet he had been so long accustomed and so early inured to harsh unfeeling deeds that the only idea that probably occurred to him on seeing this mother and her baby was how near he could get to them in order to make sure of his aim  ah  ralph said jack as we resumed our march youre too tenderhearted my boy for a hunter in africa  there youve lost a chance of getting a gorilla baby which you have been desiring so much the last few days and which you might have stuck in a bottle of spirits and sent home to be held up to universal admiration in piccadilly who knows  ay who knows echoed peterkin  i think it more probable however that it would be held up to universal ridicule  besides you forget that we have no spirits to preserve it in except our own which i admit are pretty higha good deal overproof considering the circumstances in which we are placed and the unheardof trials we have to endure  im sure i dont know what ever induced me to come as a scotch cousin of mine once said so far frae my ain fireside to endure trials  i do believe ive had more trials since i came to this outrageous land than all the criminals of the last century in england put together have had  peterkin said i seriously trials are a decided benefit and blessing to mankind  oh of course interrupted peterkin but then as you have often retorted upon me that i am of the monkey kind i think that i could get on pretty well without them  my opinion is that they are good both for man and monkey said jack just consider now it must have been a terrible trial for yon gorillamamma to hear a bullet pass within an inch of her head and have her sweet little darling frightened almost out of its wits  well but just think of the state of satisfaction and rejoicing that she must be in now at having escaped  had it not been for that trial she would now have been in her ordinary humdrum condition  i quite agree with ralph that trials are really a blessing to us  i declare it is quite refreshing to hear that you agree with anybody jack rejoined peterkin in a tone of sarcasmperhaps mr rover will kindly enlarge on this most interesting subject and give us the benefit of his wisdomand mak you lump of ebony do you keep a sharp lookout for gorillas in the meantime  the guide whose appreciation of fun was very considerable said yis massa grinned from ear to ear in doing which he displayed a double row of tremendous white teeth and pretended to be gazing earnestly among the bushes on either side in search of game as he followed us the moment we began to talk however i observed that he came close up behind and listened with all his ears  if eager expansion indicates anything i may add that he listened with all his eyes too  i shall have much pleasure in obliging you peterkin said i with a smile  and in the first place  o ralph i entreat you interrupted peterkin do not begin with a first place  when men begin a discourse with that however many intermediate places they may have to roam about in and enlarge on they never have a place of any kind to terminate in but go skimming along with a couple of dozen lastlies like a stone thrown over the surface of a pond which after the first two or three big and promising bounds spends itself in an endless succession of twittering ripples and finally sinks somehow or nohow into oblivion  ahem  shakespeare said jack  not at all retorted peterkin  if anybody gave utterance to the sentiment before it was shelley and he must have been on the seashore at the time with a crotchet if not a crab inside of himbut pray go on ralph  well then in the first place i repeated with emphasis whereat peterkin sighed trials when endured in a proper spirit improve our moral nature and strengthen our hearts the result of which is that we are incited to more vigorous mental and by consequence physical exertion so that our nervous system is strengthened and our muscular powers are increased  very well put indeed cried peterkin  now ralph try to forget your secondly omit your thirdly throw your fourthly to the winds and let your first place be your last place and ill give you credit for being a wise and effective speaker  i gave in to my volatile friend at that time as i saw that he would not allow me to go on and to say truth i thought that i had exhausted my subject  but after all peterkin did not require to be incited either to good thoughts or good actions  with all his exuberant fun and jocularity he was at bottom one of the most earnest and attached friends i ever possessed  i have lived to know that his superficial lightness of character overlaid as deeply earnest and sympathetic a spirit as ever existed  while we were thus conversing and wandering through the forest we again came upon the fresh tracks of a gorilla and from their great size we conjectured them to be those of a solitary male  it is a remarkable fact that among several of the lower animals we find specimens of that unnatural class of creatures which among men are termed old bachelors among the gorillas these solitaires are usually very large remarkably fierce uncommonly ugly desperately vindictive and peculiarly courageous so much so that the natives hold them in special dread  it is of these wild men of the woods that their most remarkable and incredible stories are related  i dont think its a gorilla at all said jack stooping down to examine the footprints which in that place were not very distinct i think an elephant or a rhinoceros must have passed this way  no massa thems not deep nuff for dat  hims be a gorillaa bery big one too  dont let us talk then lest we should scare it whispered peterkin lead the way mak and mind when we come close enough move your great carcass out of the way and let me to the front  no no lad said jack  fair play  its my turn now  so be it my boy  but get on  the tracks led us a considerable distance deeper into the wood where the trees became so thick that only a species of twilight penetrated through them  to add to our discomfort the light we knew would soon fail us altogether as evening was drawing on apace so we quickened our pace to a smart run  we had not proceeded far when we were brought to a sudden standstill by one of those awfully loud and savage roars which we at once recognised as being that of a gorilla  it sounded like what we might term barking thunder and from its intensity we were assured that our conjectures as to the creature being a solitary male gorilla were correct  dat him massas cried our guide quickly at the same time cocking both barrels of his rifle  look hout we no hab go after him no more hims come to fight us  most always doos dotde big ole gorilla  we saw from the deeply earnest expression of the negros countenance that he felt himself now to be in a very serious position which would demand all his nerve and coolness  again the roar was repeated with terrible loudness and ferocity and we heard something like the beating of a huge bass drum mingled with the cracking of branches as though some heavy creature were forcing its way through the underwood towards us  we were all much impressed with this beating sound and as is often the case when men are startled by sounds which they cannot account for we were more filled with the dread of this incomprehensible sound than of the gorilla which we knew was approaching us  we might indeed have asked an explanation from makarooroo but we were all too much excited and anxious just then to speak  we drew together in a group  jack who stood a little in front of us having claimed the first shot was whispering something about its being a pity there was so little light when his voice was drowned by a repetition of the roar so appalling that we each started feeling as though it had been uttered close to our ears  next instant the bushes in front of us were torn aside and the most horrible monster i ever saw or hope to set eyes on stood before us  he was evidently one of the largestsized gorillas  in the gloom of the forest he appeared to us to be above six feet high  his jetblack visage was working with an expression of rage that was fearfully satanic  his eyes glared horribly  the tuft of hair on the top of his head rose and fell with the working of his low wrinkled forehead in a manner that peculiarly enhanced the ferocity of his expression  his great hairy body seemed much too large for his misshapen legs and his enormous arms much too long for the body  it was with the fists at the ends of those muscular arms that he beat upon his bulky chest and produced the unaccountable sounds above referred to  as he stood there uttering roar upon roarapparently with the view of screwing up his courage to attack usdisplaying his great canine teeth and advancing slowly step by step i felt a mingling of powerful emotions such as i had never felt before in all my life and such as cannot by any possibility be adequately described  i felt quite selfpossessed however and stood beside my comrades with my rifle ready and my finger on the trigger  now whispered peterkin  but jack did not move  now said he again more anxiously as the immense brute advanced beating its chest and roaring to within eight yards of us  still jack did not move and i observed that it was as much as peterkin could do to restrain himself  as it took the next step and appeared about to spring jack pulled the trigger  the cap alone exploded  like a flash of light the other trigger was pulled it also failed some moisture must have got into the nipples in loading  almost as quick as thought jack hurled his piece at the brute with a force that seemed to me irresistible  the butt struck it full in the chest but the rifle was instantly caught in its iron gripe  at that moment peterkin fired and the gorilla dropped like a stone uttering a heavy groan as it fell prone with its face to the earthnot however before it had broken jacks rifle across and twisted the barrel as if it had been merely a piece of wire  that was a narrow escape jack said i seriously after we had recovered from the state of agitation into which this scene had thrown us  indeed it was and thanks to peterkins everready rifle that it was an escape at all  what a monstrous brute  much bigger than the first one said peterkinwhere is your measure ralph  out with it  i pulled out my measure and applying it to the prostrate carcass found that the gorilla we had now shot was five feet eight inches in height and proportionately large round the chest  it seemed to be a mass of sinews and hard muscles and as i gazed at its massive limbs i could well imagine that it had strength sufficient to perform many at least if not all of the wonderful feats ascribed to it by the natives  shortly after the death of the gorilla night settled down upon the scene so we hurried back towards our camp where we arrived much exhausted yet greatly elated by our successful days sport  i spent a great part of that night making entries in my notebook by the light of our campfires while my companions slept  and truly i enjoyed such quiet hours after days of so great mental and physical excitement  i observed also that the negroes enjoyed those seasons exceedingly  they sat round the blaze talking and laughing and recounting i have no doubt their feats of daring by flood and field then when they began to grow sleepy they sat there swaying to and fro making an occasional remark until they became too sleepy even for that when they began to nod and wink and start and almost fell into the fire so unwilling did they seem to tear themselves away from it even for the distance of the few feet they required to draw back in order to enable them to lie down  at last nature could hold out no longer and one by one they dropped back in their places  i too began to nod at last and to make entries in my notebook which were too disjointed at last to be comprehensible so i finally resigned myself to repose and to dream as a matter of course    chapter fourteen  our plans are suddenly alteredwicked designs discovered  for several weeks after this we wandered about in the woods searching for gorillas  we were very successful and shot so many that i had the satisfaction of making elaborate notes of specimens of nearly all ages and kinds  but an event was looming in the future which we little thought of and which ultimately compelled us to abandon the gorilla country and retrace our steps towards the southern part of the continent  one day we set out as was our wont to hunt for gorillas accompanied only by our faithful follower makarooroo  it chanced to be a lovely day and the country through which we were passing was exceedingly beautiful so that we found more pleasure at that time in conversing together on the beauties of nature and on the wonderful works of natures god than in contemplating our chances of falling in with game  its a splendid country said jack as we walked along under the shade of some magnificent ebony trees  i wish that it were inhabited by a christian people  perhaps this may be the case one of these days but i dont think we shall live to see it  theres no saying jack observed peterkin  does not the bible speak of a nation being born in a day  of course that must be figurative language nevertheless it must mean something and i incline to think that it means that there shall be a time when men shall flock rapidly and in unusually great numbers to the saviour  it may be so observed i but i have made up my mind on this point that christian people are not sufficiently awake to the terrible condition of the natives of countries such as this or to the fact that they have much in their power to do for the amelioration of both their temporal and spiritual welfare  i for one will if spared to return home contribute more largely than i have been wont to do to the cause of missions  talking of that said peterkin do you think it right to support the missions of other churches besides your own  do i think it right  i exclaimed in surprise  of course i do  i think it one of the greatest evils that can befall a christian that he should become so narrowminded as to give only to his own church and think only of his own churchs missions  why surely a soul saved if a matter of rejoicing in heaven ought to be a matter of joy on earth without reference to the particular church which was the instrument used by the holy spirit for that end  i feel very strongly that all christians who love our saviour with deep sincerity must of necessity have a warm feeling towards his people in all churches  at any rate we ought to cultivate such a feeling  who can these be cried jack stopping and pointing to some figures that appeared to be approaching us in the distance  they are negroes at any rate said i for they seem to be black and are evidently naked  warriors too if i mistake not  they have not yet observed us  shall we hide and let them pass  jack hesitated a moment then leaping behind a bush cried  ay tis well to be cautious when nothing is to be gained by daring these fellows outnumber us and warparties are not to be trustedat least not if these of africa resemble those of north america  hollo theres a white man with them cried peterkin as he peeped over the bushes behind which we were hid  you dont say so eh  so there is  come we have nothing to fear from the party of a travellerwhat mak you shake your head  what mean you  makarooroo increased the shaking of his head and said me no know dat massa  praps hab more to fear dan you tink  oh stuff come along  why mak it seems as if gorillahunting had failed to improve your courage  as jack said this he stepped out from among the bushes and advanced to meet the strangers  of course we all followed and although we carried our rifles in a careless manner as if we expected no evil yet we held ourselves in readiness to take instant action if necessary  the moment the negroes perceived us they set up a great shout and brandished their spears and guns but the voice of their leader was instantly heard commanding them to halt  they obeyed at once and the european stranger advanced alone to meet us  as he drew near we observed that he was a splendidlooking man nearly as large as jack himself with a handsome figure and a free offhand gait  but on coming closer we saw that his countenance though handsome wore a forbidding stern expression  dat am a slabedealer whispered our guide as the stranger came up and saluted us in french  jack replied in the same language but on learning that we were englishmen he began to talk in our own tongue although he evidently understood very little of it  do you travel alone with the natives inquired jack after a few preliminary remarks  yaas sair i doos replied the stranger who was a portuguese trader according to his own account  you seem to carry little or no merchandise with you said jack glancing towards the party of natives who stood at some distance looking at us and conversing together eagerly  i has none wis me true bot i has moche not ver far off  i bees go just now to seek for ivory and ebony and slawat you call him barwood  the man corrected himself quickly but the slip confirmed makarooroos remark and our own suspicions that he was a slavedealer  de day is far gone he continued putting as amiable a smile on his countenance as possible perhaps you vill stop and we have dine togedder  although we did not much like the appearance of our new friend or his party we felt that it would be uncourteous in so wild a country where we had so few chances of meeting with white faces to refuse so we agreed  a campfire was speedily kindled and the two parties mingled together and sat down amicably to discuss roast monkey and venison steaks together  during the course of the meal the portuguese trader became so communicative and agreeable that we all began to think we had judged him harshly  we observed too that makarooroo and the negroes had fraternised heartily and our guide was singing and laughing and making himself agreeable at a very uncommon rate so much so as to call forth our surprise  mak seems to be mad today observed peterkin as one of our guides jovial laughs rang through the wood and was echoed by his new acquaintances  bees him not always so inquired the portuguese  hes always hearty enough replied jack but i must confess i never saw him in such high spirits as he seems to be in just now  it must be the effect of meeting with new faces i suppose  ah spose so remarked the trader  i was struck with the manner in which this was said  there was a tone of affected indifference such as one assumes when making a passing remark but at the same time a dark frown rested for one moment on his brow and he cast a piercing vindictive glance at our guide  next moment he was smiling blandly and making some humorous remark to peterkin  i looked at my companions but they had evidently not observed this little piece of byplay  it seemed to me so unaccountable considering that the two men had never met before that i resolved to watch them  i soon observed that makarooroos mirth was forced that he was in fact acting a part and i noticed once or twice that he also cast an occasional stealthy and piercing glance at the portuguese  it afterwards turned out that both men had been acting the same part and that each had suspected what the other was doing  when our meal was concluded we prepared to resume our separate routes  i goes to de west observed the portuguese in a casual way as he buckled on the belt that supported his huntingknife  indeed  i had understood you to say that you were going south  no you not have onderstand me  i goes to de west ver long way  then sir i wish you a safe and pleasant journey said jack lifting his cap  de same to you sairs an goot plenty of gorillas to you  farder nord dey be more plenty  adieu  we took off our caps to each other and saying farewell we turned away and soon lost sight of the party  ho de yallerfaced villain exclaimed makarooroo between his clinched teeth after we were out of earshot  why whats wrong mak inquired peterkin in great surprise  ho noting porteekler replied the guide with an air and tone of sarcasm that quite amused us  hims not go sout ho no hims go west ho yis  hims advise us to go nort ho dear dat bery clibber bery mush clibber but we is clibberer we is ho ho ho  our worthy guide looked so terribly fierce as he uttered this fiendish laugh that we all came to a stand and gazed at him in surprise we fancied that something must have deranged his mind  mak said peterkin you are mad  what mean you by such grimaces  pursing his lips tightly and looking at each of us for a few moments in silence he finally crossed his arms on his chest and turning eagerly to jack said with extreme volubility  dat rascal dat tief  hims no trader hims slabedealer hims no go west hims go south an wat for hims go  wat for hims carry guns so many eh  hims go here the guide dropped his voice into a whisper of intense bitternesshims

dey bery wise dey no speak mush but dey manage to speak nuff for me  yis me bambameh  boozle suggested peterkin  vis bamboozle dem altogidder ho ho  after a little further explanation we found that this portuguese trader was a manstealer on his way to one of the smaller villages with the intention of attacking it  makarooroo ascertained that they meant to proceed direct to that of king jambai first however getting one of the neighbouring tribes to pick a quarrel with that monarch and go to war with him and we now recollected with deep regret that in our ignorance of what the portuguese was we had given him a great deal of information regarding the village of our late hospitable entertainer which might prove very useful to him and very hurtful to poor king jambai in the event of such a raid being carried out  but in addition to this makarooroo had ascertained that it was possible that before going to king jambais village they might perhaps make a descent on that of our friend mbango with whom we had left poor okandaga  it was this that raised the wrath of our guide to such a pitch  the instant we heard it jack said  then that settles the question of our future proceedings  we must bid adieu to the gorillas at once and dog the steps of this marauding party so as to prevent our good friends mbango and jambai being surprised and carried into slavery along with all their people  it seems to me that our path is clear in this matter  even if we were not bound in honour to succour those who have treated us hospitably we ought to do our best to undo the evil we have done in telling their enemies so much about them  besides we must save okandaga whatever happens  what say you comrades  of course we must said peterkin  i also heartily concurred  yous a good man said makarooroo his eyes glistening with emotion  if i did not stand by you at such a time as this replied jack smiling i should certainly be a very bad man  but what are we to do about our goods inquired i we cannot hope to keep up with these robbers if we carry our goods with us and yet it seems hard to leave them behind for we should fare ill i fear in this country if we travel as beggars  we shall easily manage as to that replied jack  i have observed that one of our niggers is a sensible and i am disposed to think a trustworthy fellow  dyou mean the man with the blind eye and the thumping big nose inquired peterkin  the same  well i shall put him in charge and tell him to follow us to mbangos village then we four shall start off light and hunt our way south travelling as fast as we can and carrying as many strings of beads by way of small change as we can stuff into our pockets and fasten about our persons  the very thing cried peterkin  so lets put it in practice at once  ay this very night said jack as we hurried back to the spot where our goods had been left  as we went along in silence i noticed that peterkin sighed once or twice very heavily and i asked him if he was quite well  well  ay well enough in body ralph but ill at ease in mind  how can it be otherwise when we are thus suddenly and unexpectedly about to take leave of our dear friends the gorillas  i declare my heart is fit to break  i sympathise with you peterkin said i for i have not yet made nearly as many notes in regard to these monstermonkeys as i could have wished  however i am thankful for what i have got and perhaps we may come back here again one of these days  what bloodthirsty fellows cried jack laughing  if you talk so i fear that mak and i shall have to cut your acquaintance for you see he and i have got a little feeling left  well its natural i fancy observed peterkin that gorillas should feel for their kindred  however i console myself with the thought that the country farther south is much better filled with other game although the great puggy is not there  and then we shall come among lions again which we can never find i believe in the gorilla country i wonder if the gorilla has really driven them out of this part of africa  some think it probable observed i but we cannot make sure of that point  well we can at all events make sure of this point cried peterkin as we came in sight of our encampment that lions are thick enough in the country whither we are bound so lets have a good supper and hurrah for the south  its a bright prospect before us  a fair lady to be saved possibly a fight with the niggers and lion elephant rhinoceros alligator hippopotamus and buffalo shooting by way of relaxation in the intervals of the war    chapter fifteen  an unexpected meetingwe fly and i make a narrow escape from an appalling fate  during many days after the incidents narrated in the last chapter did jack and peterkin and makarooroo and i push across the continent through bush and brake over hill and dale morass and plain at our utmost possible speed  we did not during the whole course of our journey overtake the portuguese slavedealer but we thought little of that for it was not very probable that we should hit upon exactly the same route and we entertained sanguine hopes that the energy and speed with which we kept steadily and undeviatingly on our way would enable us to reach the village of mbango before the slavedealer and his party  when i look back upon that time now and reflect calmly on the dangers we encountered and the hardships we endured i confess that i am filled with amazement  i might easily fill several volumes such as this with anecdotes of our encounters with wild animals and other adventures but however interesting these might be in themselves i must not forget that some of the main incidents of our sojourn in africa have yet to be related and that there is a limit to the patience of even youthful readers  our power of enduring fatigue and sustained active exertion with comparatively short intervals of nightly repose was much greater than i could have believed to be possible  i have no doubt that anxiety to save okandaga from the terrible fate that hung over her enabled us to bear up under fatigues which would at other times have overcome us  i know not well how it was that i kept up with my strong and agile comrades  oftentimes i felt ready to drop down as i walked yet somehow i never thought of falling behind but went doggedly on and at nights found myself little worse in condition than they  peterkin although small was tough and springy and his spirits seemed rather to rise than otherwise as his strength abated  as for jack i never saw any one like him  he seemed like a lion roaming in his strength over his native deserts  so hardened had we all become during the course of our travels that we found ourselves not only equal to makarooroo in pedestrian powers but superior for when occasion required we could almost knock him up but i am free to admit that we never succeeded in doing this thoroughly  in short we were all as nearly as possible equal to each other with the exception of jack who seemed in every way invulnerable  during this long and hurried but intensely interesting and delightful journey we came upon at different times almost every species of animal plant and tree peculiar to the african continent  oftentimes we passed by droves and herds of elephants deer buffalo giraffes antelopes and zebras we saw rhinoceroses alligators leopards lions apes of several kinds and smaller monkeys innumerable  we also saw great numbers of birdssome curious on account of their habits and form others beautiful and bright as the rainbow  yet although as i have said this journey was very delightful our feelings were at different times exceedingly varied and not unfrequently pained for while we saw around us much that was beautiful innocent and lovely we also witnessed the conflicts of many wild creatures and sometimes came across evidences of the savage and cruel dispositions of the human beings by whom the country was peopled  we always however carefully avoided native villages being anxious not to be interrupted on our forced march  neither did we turn aside to hunt although we were much tempted so to do but contented ourselves with killing such animals as we required for our daily subsistence and of these we shot as many as we required without having to turn aside from our straight course  thus we went on day after day and slept under the shade of the trees or under the wide canopy of heaven night after night until we arrived one day at a beautiful valley bordered by a plain and traversed by a river where peterkin met with a sad accident and our onward progress was for a short period arrested  it happened thusthe region through which we chanced to be passing was peopled by so many natives that we had the utmost difficulty in avoiding them and more than once were compelled to halt during the daytime in some sequestered dell and resume our journey during the night  one dayit was if i remember rightly about two oclock in the afternoonwe came suddenly in sight of a native village on the banks of the river whose course we were at that time following and made a wide detour in order to avoid it  we had passed it several miles and were gradually bending into our course again when we came unexpectedly upon a band of natives who had been out hunting and were returning to their village with the spoils of the chase on their shoulders  both parties at once came to an abrupt halt and we stood for several minutes looking at each otherthe natives in speechless amazement while we conversed in whispers uncertain what to do  we knew that if we made friendly advances we should no doubt be welcomed but then we should certainly be compelled to go back with them to their village and spend at least a day or two with them as we could not hope to give them a satisfactory reason for our going on at once we also knew that to go on in spite of them would produce a quarrel and of course a fight which as it would certainly result in bloodshed was by all means to be avoided for we could not bear to think that a mere caprice of ours in visiting africa should be the means of causing the death of a single human being if we could prevent it  what is to be done said peterkin looking at jack in despair  i dont know replied jack  its very awkward  it will never do to go all the way back to the village with these stupid fellows and we cannot tell them our real reason for going on for in the first place they would perhaps not believe us or in the second place they might offer to join us  fight said makarooroo in a low tone grinding his teeth together and clutching his rifle  i felt deep sympathy with the poor fellow for i knew well that in disposition he was naturally the reverse of quarrelsome and that his present state of mind was the consequence of anxiety for the deliverance of his faithful bride  no no replied jack quickly we shall not fight  suppose we bolt whispered peterkin brightening up as the idea occurred to himregularly run away  we seized at the idea instantly  we were all of us hard of muscle and strong of wind now and we knew that we could outstrip the savages  well do it said jack hastily  let us scatter too so as to perplex them at the outset  capital  then here goes  im off cried peterkin  stay said jack  why demanded peterkin  because we must appoint a place of rendezvous if we would hope to meet again  true i forgot that  dyou all see yonder blue mountainpeak  let us meet there  if we miss each other at the base let us proceed to the summit and wait  away  as jack uttered the last word we all turned right about and fled like the wind  the savages instantly set up a hideous yell and darted after us but we made for the thick woods and scattering in all directions as had been previously arranged speedily threw them off the scent and finally made our escape  for the first time since landing on the continent of africa i now found myself totally alone in the wild forest  after separating from my companions i ran at my utmost speed in the direction of a dense jungle where i purposed taking shelter until the natives should pass by and then come out and pursue my way leisurely  but i was prevented from adopting this course in consequence of two very fleet negroes discovering my intention and by taking a short cut frustrating it  i was compelled therefore to keep in the more open part of the forest and trust simply to speed and endurance for escape  i should think that i ran nearly two miles at full speed and kept well ahead of my pursuers  indeed i had distanced them considerably but feeling that i could not hold out long at such a killing pace i pulled up a little and allowed them to gain on me slightly  i was just about to resume my full speed and if possible throw them at once far behind when my foot was caught by a thorny shrub and i fell headlong to the ground  i was completely stunned for a moment or two and lay quite motionless  but my consciousness suddenly returned accompanied by a feeling of imminent danger which caused me to spring up and renew my headlong career  glancing over my shoulder i saw that the two natives had gained so much on me that had i lain a few seconds longer i must inevitably have been captured  i exerted myself now beyond my powers  my head too from the shock i had received became confused and i scarce knew whither i was going presently a loud dull roar as if of distant thunder struck upon my ear and i beheld what appeared to me to be a vast white plain covered with mist before  next moment i found myself on the brink of a precipice of a hundred feet deep over which a little to my left a large river fell and thundered down into a dark abyss whence issued those clouds of spray which i had taken for a white plain in the confusion of my brain and vision  i made a desperate effort to check myself but it was too late  my heels broke off the earthy edge of the cliff and i obtained just one awful glance of the horrid turmoil directly below me as i fell over with a mass of debris  i uttered an involuntary shriek of agony and flung my arms wildly out  my hand clutched the branch of an overhanging bush this slight though it was was the means under god of saving my life  the branch broke off but it checked my fall and at the same time swung me into the centre of a tree which projected out from the cliff almost horizontally  through this tree i went crashing with fearful violence until i was arrested by my chest striking against a stout branch  this i clutched with the tenacity of despair and wriggling myself as it were along it wound my arms and legs round it and held on for some time with the utmost fervour of muscular energy  my position now was beyond conception horrible  i shut my eyes and prayed earnestly for help  presently i opened them and in the position in which i then lay the first thing i saw was the boiling water of the fall more than a hundred feet below me  my agony was such that large drops of perspiration broke out all over my forehead  it was many minutes before i could summon up courage to turn my head so as to look upward for i had a vague feeling that if i were to move the branch on which i lay would break off  when i did so i observed that the branches over my head completely screened the sky from me so that i knew i had escaped one danger for the natives believing no doubt that i had fallen down into the river would at once give up their hopeless pursuit  the branch on which i lay was so slender that it swayed about with every motion that i made and the longer i remained there the more nervous did i become  at last i bethought me that unless i made a manful effort i should certainly perish so i looked about me until i became accustomed to the giddy position  then i perceived that by creeping along the branch until i gained the trunk of the tree i could descend by means of it to the face of the precipice from which it projected and thus gain a narrow ledge of rock that overhung the abyss  in any other circumstances i would as soon have ventured to cross the falls of niagara on a tightrope but i had no other alternative so i crept along the branch slowly and nervously clinging to it at the same time with terrible tenacity  at last i gained the trunk of the tree and breathed more freely for it was much steadier than the branch  the trunk projected as i have said almost horizontally from the precipice so i had to draw myself carefully along it not daring to get on my hands and knees and finally reached the ledge above referred to compared with my former position this was a place of temporary safety for it was three feet wide and having a good head i had no fear of falling over  but on looking up my heart sank within me for the bare cliff offered no foothold whatever  i do not believe that a monkey could have climbed it  to descend the precipice was equally impossible for it was like a wall  my only hope therefore lay in the ledge on which i stood and which i observed ran along to the right and turned round a projecting rock that hid the remainder of it from view  hasting along it i found to my inexpressible relief that it communicated with the top of the precipice  the ascent was difficult and dangerous but at last i succeeded in passing the most serious part and soon gained the summit of the cliff in safety where i immediately fell on my knees and returned thanks for my deliverance  i had passed nearly an hour in the trying adventure which i have just related and feeling that my companions would naturally begin soon to be anxious about me i started for our rendezvous which i reached in little more than an hour and a half  here i found jack seated alone beside a stream of water from which he occasionally lifted a little in the hollow of his hand and drank greedily  ah ralph my boy he exclaimed joyfully as i came up im glad youve come  i had begun to fear that you must have been captured  ay drink lad  you seem warm enough though i scarcely think you can be much more so than i am  what a run we have had to be sure  but what ralphyour clothes are much torn and your face and hands are scratched  why you must have got among thorns  not badly hurt i trust  oh no nothing to speak of  i have however had a narrow escape  but before i speak of that what of peterkin  i dont know replied jack with an anxious expression and to say truth i begin to feel uneasy about him for he ought to have been here almost as soon as myself  how so  did you then run together  latterly we did  at first we separated and i knew not what had become either of him or you  the fact is i had enough to do to look out for myself for a dozen of rascally niggers kept close upon my heels and tried my powers of running somewhat so i took to the thick wood and made a detour to throw them off the scent  all at once i heard a smashing of the bushes right in front of me and before i knew what i was about peterkin bounced through the underwood and almost plunged into my arms  we both gave an involuntary yell of alarm  theres two of em right on my heels said he in a gasp as he dashed off again  come along with me jack  i followed as fast as i could and we crossed an open plain together when i looked over my shoulder and saw that all the other fellows had given up the chase except the two mentioned by peterkin  these kept on after us and somehow or other we got separated again just after reentering the wood on the other side of the plain  of course i ran on expecting to see my companion every minute  finally i came to the rendezvous and here i found that the savages had given up all hope of overtaking me for i could see nothing of them  how long ago is that  i inquired quickly  about an hour  then poor peterkin must have been caught said i in a voice of despair  no that is not likely replied jack for i climbed a high tree and saw the savages recrossing the plain alone  i think it probable he may have lost his way and is afraid to climb trees or to fire off his gun to signal us for fear of being heard or seen by the niggers  i have sent mak who came here soon after i did to search for him  it may be as you say jack but we must go at once to look for him  with all my heart ralph  i only waited until you had sufficiently rested  the body cannot rest when the mind is ill at ease  come let us start at once  i shall tell you of my little adventure as we go along  we soon reached the edge of the plain where jack had been separated from his companion and here we proceeded to make a careful search  being certain that the savages were now out of earshot we began to halloo occasionally as we went along  but monkeys and parrots alone replied to us  this is the very spot where i last saw him said jack leading me to a palmtree which stood a little within the outer verge of the wood and here are his footsteps faintly indicated on the grass  ah then let us follow these up said i eagerly  we might if we were north american backwoodsmen or red indians but i can scarcely follow  stay here they enter upon a piece of soft ground and are more distinct  now then we shall get on  for nearly quarter of an hour we followed the footprints then we came to dry ground again and lost all traces of them  we wandered about perseveringly nevertheless and were rewarded by again discovering them about quarter of a mile farther on leading down to the banks of the river on another part of which i had had such a narrow escape  while we were advancingi in fronti felt the ground beneath me suddenly begin to give way with a crackling sound  i instinctively threw up my arms and sprang back  hollo ralph cried my companion seizing me with one hand by the collar and hauling or rather lifting me back as if i had been a poodle dog  why you were as near as possible into a pitfall  thanks to you jack that i am not actually in said i putting my somewhat twisted costume to rights  but i say does it not strike you that perhaps peterkin has fallen into one of these  we both started and listened with breathless attention for at that moment we heard a faint groan not far from us  it was repeated almost immediately though so faintly that we could scarcely ascertain the direction whence it came  we advanced cautiously however a few paces and discovered a hole in the ground from which at that very moment the dishevelled head of poor peterkin appeared like jack coming out of his box  his sudden appearance and seriocomic expression would have been at any other time sufficient to have set us off in fits of laughter but joy at finding him and anxiety lest he should prove to be seriously hurt restrained us at that time effectually  my dear fellow cried jack hurrying forward  keep back avaunt ye  oh dear me jack my poor head said peterkin with a sigh pressing his hand to his forehead what an intolerable whack i have got on my miserable caput  there dont come nearer else youll break through  reach me your hand  thats it thankee  there you are all safe my boy cried jack as he drew peterkin out of the holebut hollo  i say ralph run down for some water i believe the poor fellow has fainted  i sprang down the riverbank and speedily returned with some water in the crown of my wideawake  peterkin had recovered before i came back and a long draught quite restored him so that in a few minutes he was able to relate how the accident had befallen him  you see said he in a jocular tone for it was a most unusually severe accident indeed that could drive the fun out of our little friendyou see after i lost sight of jack i took a leaf out of the hares book and doubled on my course  this brought me unhappily to the banks of the river where i came upon one of the pitfalls that are made by the niggers here to catch wild beasts and in i went  i kept hold of the surface boughs however scrambled out again and pushed on but i had not gone ten yards when the ground began to crackle and sink i made a desperate bound to clear it but my foot caught in a branch and down i went head foremost into the pit  and thats the whole of my story  how long i remained there i know not  if i had known what time it was when i dived in and you were to tell me what oclock it is now we might arrive at a knowledge of the time i have spent at the bottom of that hole  all that i can positively affirm is that i went in and within in the last ten minutes i came out  we laughed at this freeandeasy manner of narrating the incident and then prepared to return to our rendezvous but on attempting to walk peterkin found that he had received a greater shake than at first he had imagined  several times during our march he became giddy and had to be supported and after reaching our encampment where we found makarooroo waiting for us he fainted  we were therefore obliged to make up our minds to encamp where we were for a few days    chapter sixteen  an unfortunate delay and a terrible visitor  only those who have been forcibly held back when filled with the deepest anxiety to go forward can form any thing like a conception of our state of mind during the few days that succeeded that on which peterkin met with his accident  we felt like chained hounds when the huntsmen pass by  we knew that every hour increased the distance between us and the slavedealers party who unless we succeeded in passing them and reaching the villages first would infallibly succeed in their villainous design but peterkin was unable to proceed without great risk as whenever he attempted to walk steadily for any distance his head became giddy and we were compelled to halt so that a day or twos rest was absolutely necessary  poor makarooroo was nearly beside himself with impatience but to do him justice he endeavoured to conceal the state of his feelings when in peterkins presence  during this period of forced inaction although of course i had nothing to do i found it impossible to apply my mind closely to the study of any of the strange and beautiful objects by which i was surrounded anxiety banished from me almost entirely the love of study as well as the power of observation  nevertheless one or two things that i saw were so curious that they could not but make a deep impression on my memory  i discovered a spider of a very remarkable kind which was such an ingenious creature as to be capable of making a door to the entrance of its house  i came upon the animal one day while taking a stroll a short distance from our camp  it was as large as a shilling reddish in colour and from the fierce rapid way in which it ran about hither and thither as if in search of prey it had an exceedingly horrible and voracious aspect  the hole of this creature is visible only when its owner is absent from home  it is quite evident either that there are no thieves among the lower animals there or that there is nothing in the hole to steal for when he goes out he leaves the door open behind him when he returns he shuts the door and the hole becomes invisible in consequence of the door being coated with earth on the outside  its inside is lined with a pure white silky substance which at once attracted my attention as i passed  on trying to pick up the door i found that it was attached by a hinge to the hole and on being shut it fitted exactly  perhaps the most singular discovery i made was a tree the stem of which had been so completely surrounded by spiders webs that it could not be seen and i had to cut through the network with my knife in order to get at the tree  the lines of those webs were as thick as coarse threads and pretty strong as i had reason to know for when walking back to camp the same evening meditating deeply on our unfortunate detention i ran my head into the middle of a spiders web and was completely enveloped in it so much so that it was with considerable difficulty i succeeded in clearing it away  i was as regularly netted as if a gauze veil had been thrown over me  on our third morning after the accident we set forth again and continued our journey by forced marches as peterkin could bear it although the two past days and nights had been absolutely lost and could not now be recalled yet the moment we set out and left our camp behind us the load of anxiety was at once lifted off our minds and we hurried forward with an elasticity of step and spirit that was quite delightful  we felt like prisoners set free and kept up a continual flow of conversation sometimes in reference to the scenery and objects around us at other times in regard to our future plans or our past experiences  it seems to me said jack breaking silence at the end of a long pause which had succeeded an animated discussion as to whether it were better to spend ones life in the civilised world or among the wilds of africa in which discussion peterkin who advocated the wild life was utterly though not admittedly beatenit seems to me that notwithstanding the short time we stayed in the gorilla country we have been pretty successful  havent we bagged thirtythree altogether  thirtysix if you count the babies in arms responded peterkin  of course we are entitled to count these  i think you are both out in your reckoning said i drawing out my notebook the last baby that i shot was our thirtyseventh  what cried peterkin the one with the desperately black face and the horrible squint that nearly tore all the hair out of jacks head before he managed to strangle him  that wasnt a baby it was a big boy and i have no doubt a big rascal besides  that may be so i rejoined but whatever he was i have him down as number thirtyseven in my list  pity we didnt make up the forty observed jack  ah yes indeed said peterkin  but let me see could we not manage to make it up to that yet  impossible said i  we are far away from the gorilla land now i know for in addition to the fact that we have seen no traces of gorillas for a long time we have within the last few days seen several lions which you are well aware do not exist in the gorilla country  true but you mistake me rejoined peterkin  i do not mean to make up the number to forty by killing three more but by proving almost to demonstration that we have already been the death of that number in addition to those noted down  youll find that rather difficult said jack laughing  not at all cried peterkin  let me think a minute  you remember that enormously big hairy fellow that looked so like an ugly old man that ralph refused pointblank to fire at him whereupon you fired at him pointblank and wounded him in the shoulder as he was running away  we treated several big fellows in that way replied jack which of them do you allude tothe one that roared so loud and terrified you so much that you nearly ran away  no no you know well enough which one i mean  the one that ran along the edge of the stagnant pool into which you tumbled as we were coming back  oh yes  i remember said jack laughing  well that fellow flew into such a horrible rage when he was wounded continued peterkin that i am perfectly certain he went straight home and murdered his wife in a passion which brings up the number to thirtyeight  then there was that old womangorilla that i brought down when we were descending yon hill that was covered with such splendid vines  you remember  well im quite certain that the young mangorilla beside her who ran off and escaped was her son and that he went home straightway and died of grief  that makes thirtynine then  oh do be quiet peterkin please said i with a shudder  you put things in such a fearfully dark and murderous light that i feel quite as if i were a murderer  i feel quite uneasy i assure you and if it were not that we have killed all these creatures in the cause of science i should be perfectly miserable  in the cause of science repeated peterkin humph  i suspect that a good deal of wickedness is perpetrated under the wing of science  come come said jack dont you begin to grow sarcastic master peterkin  i abominate sarcasm and cannot tolerate sarcastic people if you adopt that style i shall revert to my natural habits as a gorilla and tear you in pieces  there you exhibit your unnatural ignorance of your own natural habits retorted peterkin for you ought to know that gorillas never tear men in piecestheir usual mode being to knock you down with a blow of their huge paws  well i will knock you down if you prefer it  thank you id rather not  besides you have almost knocked me up already so pray call a halt and let me rest a bit  we were all very willing to agree to this request having walked the last two or three miles at a very quick pace  seating ourselves on the trunk of a fallen tree we enjoyed the beautiful prospect before us  an open vista enabled us to see beyond the wood in which we were travelling into an extensive sweep of prairieland on which the sinking sun was shedding a rich flood of light  it happened to be a deliciously cool evening and the chattering of numerous parrots as well as the twittering songs of other birdsless gorgeous perhaps but more musical than theyrefreshed our ears as the glories of the landscape did our eyes  while we were gazing dreamily before us in silent enjoyment jack suddenly interrupted our meditations by exclaiming  hist look yonder  he pointed as he spoke to a distant part of the plain on which the forest closely pressed  a zebra cried i with delight for besides the feeling of pleasure at seeing this splendid creature i entertained a hope that we might shoot him and procure a steak for supper of which at that time we stood much in need  im too tired to stalk it now said peterkin with an air of chagrinare you up to it jack  quite but i fear hes an animal thats very difficult to stalk in such an open countrywhat say you mak  hims no be cotched dis yer night massa hims too far away an too wide wake  what say you to a long shot peterkin  your rifle is sighted for four hundred yards and he seems to be little more than six hundred off  ill try said our friend going down on one knee and adjusting the sight of his piece  taking a long steady aim he fired and in another instant the zebra lay dead on the plain  i need hardly add that our amazement was excessive  even peterkin himself could scarcely believe his eyes  had his rifle been sighted for such a distance the shot although a splendid one would not have amazed us so much because we knew that our friends aim was deadly but as he had to elevate the muzzle above the object fired at and guess the amount of elevation the shot was indeed wonderful  it was a long time before our guide could move but when he did recover himself he danced and shouted like a madman with delight and then setting off with a bound sped across the plain like a deer  come along cried jack with a laughlets follow for mak looked so rabid when he went off that i believe hell eat the beast raw before we can claim our share if we dont look sharp  we all of us set off at a smart trot and soon came to the spot where our prize lay  it was a splendid creature and in prime condition after examining it carefully and descanting on the beauty of its striped skin i sat down beside it and pulled out my notebook while my comrades entered the forest to search for a suitable place on which to encamp and to kindle a fire  a spot was quickly found and i had scarcely finished making notes when they returned to carry the zebra into the encampment  we accomplished this with some difficulty and laid it beside the fire  then cutting four large steaks from its flanks we proceeded to sup after which we made our arrangements for spending the night there  we little knew the startling surprise that was in store for us that night  as the forest in that place happened to be swarming with wild animals of every kind we deemed it prudent to set a watch as well as to keep up a blazing fire  jack and i and the negro kept watch by turns peterkin being still sufficiently an invalid to claim exemption from laborious duties was permitted to rest undisturbed  about midnight i aroused jack and having made him sit up in order to show that he was thoroughly awake i lay down and went to sleep  how long i slept i cannot tell but i was suddenly awakened by one of the most tremendous roars i ever heard  it was so chose to me that in the confusion of my sleepy brain it seemed to be far more terrible than that even of the gorilla  i was mistaken in this however and no doubt my semisomnolent condition tended to increase its awfulness  springing into a sitting posture and by an involuntary impulse reaching out my hand for my gun which lay close to me i beheld a sight that was calculated to appal the stoutest heart  a lion of the largest size was in the very act of springing over the bushes and alighting on the zebra which as i have said lay on the other side of the fire and not four yards off from us  as the light glared in the brutes eyes and as it were sparkled in gleams on its shaggy mane which streamed out under the force of its majestic bound it seemed to my bewildered gaze as though the animal were in the air almost above my head and that he must inevitably alight upon myself  this at least is the impression left upon my mind now that i look back upon that terrific scene  but there was no time for thought  the roar was uttered the bound was made and the lion alighted on the carcass of the zebra almost in one and the same moment  i freely confess that my heart quailed within me  yet that did not prevent my snatching up my gun but before i had time to cock it the crashing report of jacks elephant rifle almost split the drum of my ear and i beheld the lion drop as if it had been a stone  it lay without motion completely dead and we found on examination that the ball had smashed in the centre of its forehead and completely penetrated its brain  some time elapsed before we could find words to express our feelings our guide who had so completely enveloped his head and shoulders in grass when he lay down to sleep that he was the last to spring up looked at the huge carcass of the lion with an expression of utter bewilderment  what a magnificent fellow  and what a splendid shot exclaimed peterkin at last  why jack i dont believe theres a finer lion in africa  its lucky though that you were on the qui vive  yes said i had it not been for you we might have been all killed by this time  no fear o dat chimed in our guide as he sat down on the lions shoulder and began to stroke its mane hims was want hims supper off de zebra ho ho  hims got hims supper off a bullet  tis well that he has observed jack as he reloaded his rifle  to say truth comrades i scarcely deserve credit for being guardian of the camp for im ashamed to say that i was sound asleep at the moment the lion roared  how i ever managed to take so quick and so good an aim is more than i can tell  luckily my rifle was handy and i had fallen asleep in a sitting posture  had it been otherwise i could scarcely have been in time to prevent the brute springing on us had he felt so disposed  here was now another subject for my notebook so i sat down and began a minute inspection of the noblelooking animal while my comrades heaping fresh logs on the fire sat down in front of it and for upwards of an hour fought their battles oer again  it was a matter of deep regret to us all that we could not afford to carry away with us the skin of this lion as a memorial but circumstanced as we then were that was out of the question so we contented ourselves with extracting his largest teeth and all his claws which we still preserve in our museum as trophies of the adventure    chapter seventeen  we visit a natural menagerie see wonderful sights and meet with strange adventures  we observed on this journey that the elephants which we met with in our farthest north point were considerably smaller than those farther to the south yet though smaller animals their tusks were much larger then those of the south  the weight of those tusks varied from twenty to fifty pounds and i saw one that was actually upwards of one hundred pounds in weightequal in fact to the weight of a big boy or a little man  such tusks however were rare  at nights when we encamped near to a river or pool of water we saw immense numbers of elephants come down to drink and enjoy themselves they seemed in fact to be intoxicated with delight if not with water for they screamed with joy and filling their trunks with water spurted it over themselves and each other in copious showers  of course we never disturbed them on such occasions for we came to the conclusion that it would be the height of barbarity and selfishness to spoil the pleasure of so many creatures merely for the sake of a shot  frequently we were wont to go after our supper to one of those ponds when we chanced to be in the immediate neighbourhood of one and lying concealed among the bushes watch by the light of the moon the strange habits and proceedings of the wild creatures that came there to drink the hours thus passed were to me the most interesting by far that i spent in africa  there was something so romantic in the kind of scenery in the dim mysterious light and in the grand troops of wild creatures that came there in all the pith and fire of untamed freedom to drink  it was like visiting a natural menagerie on the most magnificent scale for in places where water is scarce any pool that may exist is the scene of constant and everchanging visits during the entire night  in fact i used to find it almost impossible to tear myself away although i knew that repose was absolutely needful in order to enable me to continue the journey on the succeeding day and i am quite certain that had not peterkin and jack often dragged me off in a jocular way by main force i should have remained there all night and have fallen asleep probably in my ambush  one night of this kind that we passed i shall never forget  it was altogether a remarkable and tremendously exciting night and as it is a good type of the style of night entertainment to be found in that wild country i shall describe it  it happened on a saturday night  we were then travelling through a rather dry district and had gone a whole day without tasting water  as evening approached we came to our satisfaction to a large pond of pretty good water into which we ran kneedeep and filling our caps with water drank long and repeated draughts  then we went into a piece of jungle about a quarter of a mile distant and made our encampment intending to rest there during the whole of the sabbath  i may mention here that it was our usual custom to rest on the sabbath days  this we did because we thought it right and we came ere long to know that it was absolutely needful for on this journey southward we all agreed that as life and death might depend on the speed with which we travelled we were quite justified in continuing our journey on the sabbath  but we found ourselves at the end of the second week so terribly knocked up that we agreed to devote the whole of the next sabbath to repose  this we did accordingly and found the utmost benefit from it and we could not avoid remarking in reference to this on the care and tenderness of our heavenly father who has so arranged that obedience to his command should not only bring a peculiar blessing to our souls but so to speak a natural and inevitable advantage to our bodies  these reflections seemed to me to throw some light on the passage the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath but as this is not the place for theological disquisition i shall not refer further to that subject  not having then to travel on the following day we made up our minds to spend an hour or two in a place of concealment near the margin of this pond and i secretly resolved that i would spend the whole night there with my notebook for the moon we knew would be bright and make a soft pillow of leaves on which i might drop and go to sleep when my eyes refused any longer to keep open  the moon had just begun to rise when we finished our suppers and prepared to go to our post of observation  we took our rifles with us of course for although we did not intend to shoot having more than sufficient food already in camp we could not tell but that at any moment those weapons might be required for the defence of our lives makarooroo had been too long accustomed to see wild animals to understand the pleasure we enjoyed in merely staring at them so he was left in charge of our camp  now then said peterkin as we left the encampment hurrah for the menagerie  you may well call it that said jack for theres no lack of variety  are we to shoot inquired peterkin  better not i think  we dont require meat and there is no use in murdering the poor things  what a splendid scene  we halted to enjoy the view for a few seconds  the forest out of which we had emerged bordered an extensive plain which was dotted here and there with scattered groups of trees which gave to the country an exceedingly rich aspect  in the midst of these the pond lay glittering in the soft moonlight like a sheet of silver  it was surrounded on three sides by low bushes and a few trees  on the side next to us it was open and fully exposed to view  the moonlight was sufficiently bright to render every object distinctly visible yet not so bright as to destroy the pleasant feeling of mysterious solemnity that pervaded the whole scene  it was wonderfully beautiful  i felt almost as if i had reached a new world  continuing our walk we quickly gained the bushes that fringed the margin of the pool which was nowhere more than thirty yards broad and on our arrival heard the hoofs of several animals that we had scared away clattering on the ground as they retreated  there they go already cried jack now let us look for a hillock of some kind on which to take up our position  we shall not have to look far said i for here seems a suitable spot ready at our hand  your eyes are sharp tonight ralph observed peterkin the place is splendid so lets to work  laying down our rifles we drew our huntingknives and began to cut down some of the underwood on the top of a small hillock that rose a little above the surrounding bushes and commanded a clear view of the entire circumference of the pond  we selected this spot for the double reason that it was a good point of observation and a safe retreat as animals coming to the pond to drink from whatever quarter they might arrive would never think of ascending a hillock covered with bushes if they could pass round it  having cleared a space sufficiently large to hold usleaving however a thin screen of shrubs in front through which we intended to peepwe strewed the ground with leaves and lay down to watch with our loaded rifles close beside us  we felt certain of seeing a good many animals for even during the process of preparing our unlace of retreat several arrived and were scared away by the noise we made  presently we heard footsteps approaching  theres something whispered peterkin  ay returned jack  what i like about this sort o thing is your uncertainty as to what may turn up  its like deepsea fishing  hist look out  the steps were rapid  sometimes they clattered over what appeared to be pebbly ground then they became muffled as the animal crossed a grassy spot at last it trotted out of the shade of the bushes directly opposite to us into the moonlight and showed itself to be a beautiful little antelope of the longhorned kind with a little fawn by its side the two looked timidly round for a few seconds and snuffed the air as if they feared concealed enemies and then trotting into the water slaked their thirst together  i felt as great pleasure in seeing them take a long satisfactory draught as if i had been swallowing it myself and hoped they would continue there for some time but they had barely finished when the rapid gallop of several animals was heard and scared them away instantly  the newcomers were evidently heavy brutes for their tread was loud and quite distinct as compared with the steps of the antelopes  a few seconds sufficed to disclose them to our expectant eyes  a large herd of giraffes trotted to the waters edge and began to drink  it was a splendid sight to behold these graceful creatures stooping to drink and then raising their heads haughtily to a towering height as they looked about from side to side  in the course of a couple of hours we saw elands springboks gnus leopards and an immense variety of wild creatures some of which fawned on and played with each other while others fought and bellowed until the woods resounded with the din  while we were silently enjoying the sight and i attempting to make a few entries in my notebook our attention was attracted to a cracking of the branches close to the right side of our hillock  look out whispered jack but the warning was scarcely needed for we instinctively seized our rifles  a moment after our hearts leaped violently as we heard a crashing step that betokened the approach of some huge creature  are we safe here  i whispered to jack  safe enough if we keep still  but we shall have to cut and run if an elephant chances to get sight of us  i confess that at that moment i felt uneasy  the hillock on the summit of which we lay was only a place of comparative safety because no animal was likely to ascend an elevated spot without an object in view and as the purpose of all the nocturnal visitors to that pond was the procuring of water we did not think it probable that any of them would approach unpleasantly near to our citadel but if any wild beast should take a fancy to do so there was nothing to prevent him and the slight screen of bushes by which we were surrounded would certainly have been no obstacle in the way  a hunter in the african wilds however has not much time to think danger is usually upon him in a moment  we had barely time to fullcock our rifles when the bushes near us were trodden down and a huge black rhinoceros sauntered slowly up to us  so near was he that we could have sprung out from our hidingplace and have caught hold of him had we chosen to do so  this enormous unwieldy monster seemed to me so large that he resembled an elephant on short legs and in the dim mysterious moonlight i could almost fancy him to be one of those dreadful monsters of the antediluvian world of which we read so much in these days of geological research  i held my breath and glanced at my comrades  they lay perfectly motionless with their eyes fixed on the animal which hesitated on approaching our hillock  my blood almost stagnated in my veins  i thought that he must have observed us or smelt us and was about to charge  he was only undecided as to which side of the hillock he should pass by on his way to the pond  turning to the left he went down to the water with a heavy rolling gait crushing the shrubs under his ponderous feet in a way that filled me with an exalted idea of his tremendous power  i breathed freely again and felt as if a mighty load had been lifted off me  from the suppressed sighs vented by my comrades i judge that they also had experienced somewhat similar relief  we had not however had time to utter a whisper before our ears were assailed by the most tremendous noise that we had yet heard  it came from the opposite side of the pool as if a great torrent were rushing towards us  presently a black billow seemed to burst out of the jungle and roll down the sloping bank of the pond  elephants exclaimed jack  impossible said i they must be buffaloes  at that instant they emerged into the full blaze of the moon and showed themselves to be a herd of fullgrown elephants with a number of calves  there could not have been fewer than one hundred on the margin of the pond but from the closeness of their ranks and their incessant movements i found it impossible to count their numbers accurately  this magnificent army began to drink and throw water about waving their trunks and trumpeting shrilly at the same time with the utmost delight the young ones especially seemed enjoy themselves immensely and i observed that their mothers were very attentive to them caressing them with their trunks and otherwise showing great fondness for their offspring  i say whispered peterkin what a regiment of cavalry these fellows would make mounted by gorillas armed with scytheblades for swords and highland claymores for dirks  ay and cannonrevolvers in their pockets added jack  but look that hideous old rhinoceros  he has been standing there for the last two minutes like a rock staring intently across the water at the elephants  hush said i  whisper softly  he may hear us  there goes something else on our side whispered peterkin pointing to the right of our hillock  dont you see it  there against thei do believe its another giraffe  so it is  keep still  his ears are sharp muttered jack examining the lock of his rifle  come come said i no shooting jack  you know we came to see not to shoot  very true but its not every day one gets such a close shot at a giraffe  i must procure a specimen for you ralph  jack smiled as he said this and raised his rifle  peterkin at the same moment quietly raised his saying if thats your game my boy then here goes at the rhinoceros  dont hurry your aim weve lots of time  as i waited for the reports with breathless attention i was much struck at that moment by the singularity of the circumstances in which we were placed  on our left stood the rhinoceros not fifteen yards off on our right the giraffe raised his long neck above the bushes about twenty yards distant apparently uncertain whether it was safe to advance to the water while in front lay the lake reflecting the soft clear moonlight and beyond that the phalanx of elephants enjoying themselves vastly  i had but two moments to take it all in at a glance for jack said now in a low tone and instantly the loud report of the two rifles thundered out upon the night air  words cannot convey and the reader certainly cannot conceive any idea of the trumpeting roaring crashing shrieking and general hubbub that succeeded to the noise of our firearms  it seemed as if the wild beasts of twenty menageries had simultaneously commenced to smash the woodwork of their cages and to dash out upon each other in mingled fury and terror for not only was the crashing of boughs and bushes and smaller trees quite terrific but the thunderous tread of the large animals was absolutely awful  we were thoroughly scared for in addition to all this from the midst of the horrid turmoil there came forth a royal roar close behind us that told of a lion having been secretly engaged in watching our proceedings and we shuddered to think that but for our firing he might have sprung upon us as we lay there little dreaming of his presence  since our last adventure with the king of beasts makarooroo had entertained us with many anecdotes of the daring of lions especially of those monsters that are termed maneaters so that when we heard the roar above referred to we all three sprang to our feet and faced about with the utmost alacrity  so intent were we on looking out for this dreadful foefor we had made up our minds that it must be a maneating lionthat we were utterly indifferent to the other animals  but they were not indifferent to us for the wounded rhinoceros catching sight of us as we stood with our backs towards him charged at once up the hillock  to utter three simultaneous yet fearfully distinct yells of terror spring over the low parapet of bushes and fly like the wind in three different directions was the work of a moment  in dashing madly down the slope my foot caught in a creeping shrub and i fell heavily to the earth  the fall probably saved my life for before i could rise the rhinoceros sprang completely over me in its headlong charge  so narrow was my escape that the edge of one of its ponderous feet alighted on the first joint of the little finger of my left hand and crushed it severely indeed had the ground not been very soft it must infallibly have bruised it off altogether  the moment it had passed i jumped up and turning round ran in the opposite direction  i had scarcely gone ten paces when a furious growl behind me and the grappling sound as of two animals in deadly conflict followed by a fierce howl led me to conclude that the lion and the rhinoceros had unexpectedly met each other and that in their brief conflict the former had come off second best  but i gave little heed to that  my principal thought at that moment was my personal safety so i ran on as fast as i could in the direction of our encampment for which point i had no doubt my companions would also make  i had not run far when the growl of a lion apparently in front caused me to stop abruptly  uncertain of the exact position of the brute i turned off to one side and retreated cautiously and with as little noise as possible yet with a feeling of anxiety lest he should spring upon me unawares  but my next step showed me that the lion was otherwise engaged  pushing aside a few leaves that obstructed my vision i suddenly beheld a lion in the midst of an open space crouched as if for a spring  instinctively i threw forward the muzzle of my rifle but a single glance showed me that his tail not his head was towards me  on looking beyond i observed the head and shoulders of jack who like the lion was also in a crouching position staring fixedly in the face of his foe  they were both perfectly motionless and there could not have been more than fifteen or twenty yards between them  the true position of affairs at once flashed across me  jack in his flight had unwittingly run almost into the jaws of the lion and i now felt convinced that this must be a second lion for it could not have been the one that was disturbed by the rhinoceros as i had been running directly away from the spot where these two brutes had met  jack had crouched at once  we had often talked over our campfire of such an event as unexpectedly meeting a lion face to face and peterkin who knew a good deal about such matters had said that in such a case a mans only chance was to crouch and stare the lion out of countenance we laughed at this but he assured us positively that he had himself seen it done to tigers in india and added that if a man turned and ran his destruction would be certain  to fire straight in the face of a lion in such a position would be excessively dangerous for while the bullet might kill it was more than probable it would glance off the bone of the forehead which would be presented at an angle to the hunter  the best thing to do he said was to stare steadily at the creature until it began to wince which if not a wounded beast it would certainly do and then when it turned slowly round to slink away take aim at its heart and fire instantly  the moon was shining full in jacks face which wore an expression of intense ferocity i had never before witnessed and had not believed it possible that such a look could have been called up by him  the lower part of his face being shrouded in his black beard was undiscernible but his cheeks and forehead were like cold marble  his dark brows were compressed so tightly that they seemed knotted and beneath them his eyes glittered with an intensity that seemed to me supernatural  not a muscle moved his gaze was fixed and it was not difficult to fancy that he was actually instead of apparently petrified  i could not of course observe the visage of the lion and to say truth i had no curiosity on that point for just then it occurred to me that i was directly in the line of fire and that if my friend missed the lion there was every probability of his killing me  i was now in an agony of uncertainty  i knew not what to do  if i were to endeavour to get out of the way i might perhaps cause jack to glance aside and so induce the lion to spring  if on the other hand i should remain where i was i might be shot  in this dilemma it occurred to me that as jack was a good shot and the lion was very close it was extremely unlikely that i should be hit so i resolved to bide my chance and offering up a silent prayer awaited the issue  it was not long of coming  the fixed gaze of a bold human eye cowed at last even the king of the woods  the lion slowly and almost imperceptibly rose and sidled gently round with the intention doubtless of bounding into the jungle  i saw that if it did so it would pass very close to me so i cocked both barrels and held my piece in readiness  the click of my locks attracted the lions attention its head turned slightly round  at that instant jacks rifle sprang to his shoulder and the loud crack of its report was mingled with and drowned by the roar of the lion as he sprang with a terrible bound not past me but straight towards me  i had no time to aim but throwing the gun quickly to my shoulder drew both triggers at once  i had forgotten in my perturbation that i carried peterkins heavy elephant rifle charged with an immense quantity of powder and a couple of sixounce balls  my shoulder was almost dislocated by the recoil and i was fairly knocked head over heels  a confused sound of yells and roars filled my ear for a moment  i struggled to collect my faculties  hollo  jackralph where are you shouted a voice that i well knew to be that of peterkin  hurrah im coming  dont give in  ive killed him  the rhinoceros is dead as a doornail  where have you  i heard no more having swooned away    chapter eighteen  strange and terrible discoveriesjack is made commanderinchief of an army  when my consciousness returned i found myself lying on my back beside our campfire with my head resting on peterkins knee and the first sound i heard was his pleasant voice as he said  all right jack hes coming round  im quite certain that no serious damage is done  i know well what sort o rap he must have got  itll bother him a little at first but it wont last long  comforted not a little by this assurance i opened my eyes and looked up  what has happened  i inquired faintly  ah thats right ralph  im glad to hear your voice again  dyou know i thought at first it was all over with you  over with him echoed peterkin its only begun with him  ralphs days of valorous deeds are but commencinghere my boy put this flask to your mouth  its lucky i fetched it with us  here drink  no not until you tell me what has occurred said i for i still felt confused in my brain  then i wont tell you a word until you drink repeated my friend as he looked anxiously in my face and held the flask to my lips  i sipped a mouthful and felt much revived  now continued peterkin ill tell you what has happened  weve floored a rhinoceros and a giraffe and a lion which to my thinking is a pretty fair bag to make after dusk of a saturday night  and my big rifle has floored you which is the least satisfactory part of the nights entertainment but which wouldnt have occurred had you remembered my instructions which you never do  oh i recollect now said i as the spirits revived me  im all rightbut jack i trust that you have not received damage  not a scratch im thankful to say though i must confess i was near catching an ugly wound  how so  i inquired quickly observing a peculiar smile on jacks face as he spoke  oh make your mind easy put in peterkin it was just a small bit of an escape he made  when you let drive at the lion so effectively one of the balls went in at his mouth and smashed its way out at the back of his skull  the other ball shaved his cheek and lodged in a tree not two inches from jacks nose  you dont mean it cried i starting up regardless of the pain occasioned to my injured shoulder by the movement and gazing intently in jacks face  come come said he smiling you must not be so reckless ralph lie down again sir  peterkin you should not talk lightly of so narrow an escape said i reproachfully  the fact that such a terrible catastrophe has nearly occurred ought to solemnise one  granted my dear boy but the fact that such a catastrophe did not occur ought i hold to make us jolly  theres no managing a fellow like you ralph  i knew that if i told you of this gravely you would get into such a state of consternational selfreproachativeness so to speak that you would infallibly make yourself worse  and now that i tell it to you lightly as you call it you take to blowing me up  i smiled as my friend said this and held out my hand which he grasped and squeezed  feeling at the moment overcome with drowsiness i unconsciously retained it in my grasp and thus fell sound asleep  three days after this misadventure i was nearly as well as ever and we were once more journeying by forced marches towards the south  two days more we calculated would bring us to mbangos village  as the end of our journey approached we grew more desperately anxious to push forward lest we should be too late to give them timely warning of the slavedealers approach  we also became more taciturn and i could see plainly that the irrepressible forebodings that filled my own heart were shared by my companions  poor makarooroo never spoke save in reply to questions addressed pointedly to himself and seeing the state of his mind we forbore to trouble him with conversation  yet even while in this anxious state i could not avoid noticing the singular variety and beauty of both the animal and the vegetable kingdom in the regions through which we passed  in one part of our journey we had to cross a portion of what is called desert country but which notwithstanding its name was covered with grass and in many places with bushes and even trees  its vegetation however as compared with other parts of the country was light and it was almost entirely destitute of water there being no rivers or springs only a few pools of rainwater were to be found in the hard beds of ancient rivercourses  this desert land was inhabited by numbers of bushmen and other natives as well as by large quantities of game of various kinds  but what struck me as being most singular was the great variety of tuberous roots with which the region was supplied and which were evidently designed by our beneficent creator to make up to the inhabitants in a great degree for the want of a full supply of water  i also observed with much interest a species of plant which like man is capable of being as it were acclimatised  it is not by nature a tuberbearing plant yet here it had become so in order to be able to retain a sufficiency of moisture during the dry season  makarooroo also dug up for us several tuberroots which were the size of a large turnip and filled with a most delicious juice which as we were much oppressed with thirst at the time appeared to us like nectar  besides these we also procured watermelons in abundance at certain spots which were a great treat not only to us but also to elephants rhinoceroses antelopes and many other animals whose footprints we found in great numbers and whose depredations among the watermelons were very evident  during the whole of this journey we made a point as i have already remarked of avoiding man not that we were indifferent to him but anxious not to be detained at that particular time  we were very fortunate in this matter for we succeeded in eluding the observation of the natives of many villages that we passed in escaping others by flight and in conciliating those who caught us by making them liberal gifts of beads  one day we came to a halt under the most magnificent tree i ever saw it was a mowano tree whose trunk consisted of six stems united in one the circumference a yard or so from the ground was eightyfour feet upwards of nine yards in diameter  what a tree for a noblemans park said jack as we gazed at it lost in admiration  ay and behold a gentleman worthy to take up his residence under it said peterkin pointing as he spoke to a living creature that sat among the grass near its roots  what can it be  i exclaimed  the original father of all frogs replied peterkin as he darted forward and killed the thing with a stick  i believe it is a frog said jack  we all burst into a fit of laughter for undoubtedly it was a frog but certainly the largest by far that any of us had ever seen  it was quite as large as a chicken  what a shame to have killed it said i  why did you do it  shame  it was no shame  in the first place i killed it because i wish you to make scientific inspection of it and in the second place i wanted to eat it  why should not we as well as frenchmen eat frogs  by the way that reminds me that we might introduce this giant species into france and thereby make our fortunes  you greedy fellow cried jack who was busying himself in lighting the fire your fortune is made already  how many would you have  dye know jack i have been in possession of my fortune as you call it so short a time that i cannot realise the fact that i have it hollo  mak whats wrong with you  peterkin thus addressed our guide because he came into the camp at that moment with a very anxious expression of countenance  dere hab bin fight go on here said he showing several broken arrows stained with blood which he had picked up near our encampment  ha so there has unless these have been shot at wild beasts said jack examining the weapons carefully  no massa no shot at wild beast  de wild beast hab bin here too but dey come for to eat mans after he dead  come let us see the spot said jack  makarooroo at once led the way and we all followed him to a place not a hundred yards distant where there were evident traces of a fight having taken place  jack seemed to be much distressed at the sight  there can be no question as to the fact he remarked as we returned to our fire and at any other time or in any other place i would have thought nothing of it for we know well enough that the natives here often go to war with each other but just at this time and so near to our friend mbangoi fear i fear much that that villain has been before us  no been long massa said makarooroo earnestly  if we go quick we ketch im  we shall go quick mak  but in order to do that we must eat well and sleep at least an hour or so  if we push on just now after a hard days journey without food or rest we shall make but slow progress and even if we did come up with the slavedealer we should not be in a very fit state for a battle  this was so obvious that we all felt the wisdom of jacks remarks so we ate a hearty supper and then lay down to rest  peterkin declared the frog to be excellent but i could not at that time make up my mind to try it  an hour and a half after lying down our guide awakened us and we set forth again with recruited energies  that night the lions and hyenas roared around us more than was their wont as if they were aware of our anxious condition and were desirous of increasing our discomforts  we had to keep a sharp lookout and once or twice discharged our rifles in the direction of the nearest sounds not in the expectation of hitting any of the animals but for the purpose of scaring them away  towards morning we came out upon an open plain and left these evil prowlers of the night behind us  about daybreak we came within sight of mbangos village but the light was not sufficient to enable us to distinguish any object clearly  here again we came upon traces of war in the shape of broken arrows and daggers and human bones for the poor wretches who had been slain had been at once devoured by wild beasts  hurrying forward with intense anxiety we reached the outskirts of the village and here a scene presented itself that was well calculated to fill our breasts with horror and with the deepest anxiety  many of the houses had been set on fire and were reduced to ashes  the mangled corpses of human beings were seen lying here and there amongst the emberssome partially devoured by wild beasts others reduced to simple skeletons and their bones left to whiten on the ruins of their old homes  in one place the form of a woman tied to a tree and dreadfully mangled showed that torture had been added to the other horrors of the attack  with feelings of mingled rage pity and anxiety we hastened towards the hut that had been the residence of mbango the chief  we found it like the rest in ruins and among them discovered the remains of a child  recollecting the little son of our friend njamie okandagas guardian i turned the body over in some anxiety but the features were too much mutilated to be recognisable  alas alas  i exclaimed as we collected in a group round this remnant of a little child what a dreadful sight  what an unhappy race of beings  without doubt our friends have been slain or carried into captivity  poor makarooroo who had been from the first going about among the ruins like a maniac with a bewildered air of utter despair on his sable countenance looked at me as if he hoped for a slight word that might reanimate hope in his bosom  but i could give him none for i myself felt hopeless  not so jack  with that buoyancy of spirit that was peculiar to him he suggested many ideas that consoled our guide not a little  you see said he the rascally portuguese trafficker in human flesh would naturally try to effect his object with as little bloodshed as possible  he would just fight until he had conquered not longer and then he would try to take as many prisoners as he could in order to carry them away into slavery  now i cannot conceive it possible that he could catch the whole tribe  of course not interrupted peterkin he had a comparatively small party  to take a whole tribe prisoners with such a band were impossible  ay but you forget said i that he might easily prevail on some other tribe to go to war along with him and thus capture nearly the whole  yet some must have escaped into the woods and it is probable that among these may have been the chief and his household  okandaga may be safe and not far off for all we know  the guide shook his head  at any rate observed jack if caught they would certainly be guarded with care from injury so that if we could only find out which way they have gone we might pursue and attack them  four men attack forty or fifty said i despondingly  ay ralph  why not asked peterkin  oh i doubt not our pluck to do it i replied but i doubt very much our chances of success  while we were yet speaking our attention was attracted by a low wail and the appearance of some living object creeping amongst the ruins not far from us  at first we thought it must be a beast of prey lurking in the neighbourhood of the dead and impatient at our having interrupted its hideous banquet but presently the object sat up and proved to be a woman  yet she was so covered with blood and dust and so awfully haggard in appearance that we could with difficulty believe her to be a human being  at first she appeared to be in ignorance of our presence  and indeed so she actually was for her whole soul was absorbed in the contemplation of the dead and mangled body of an infant which lay in her arms and which she pressed ever and anon with frantic energy to her breast uttering occasionally a wail of such heartbroken sadness that the tears sprang irresistibly into my eyes while i gazed upon her  there needed no explanation of her tale of woe  the poor mother had crept back to her hut after the fierce din of battle was over to search for her child and she had found it but ah who can conceive the unutterable anguish of heart that its finding had occasioned  speak to her mak said peterkin in a husky voice she will be less afraid of you no doubt than of us  our guide advanced  the slight noise he made in doing so attracted the poor womans attention and caused her to look up with a wild quick glance  the instant she saw us she leaped up with the agility of a leopard clasped her dead child tightly to her breast and uttering shriek upon shriek rushed headlong into the jungle  after her cried jack bounding forward in pursuit  shes our only chance of gaining information  we all felt the truth of this and joined in the chase at top speed but although we ran fast and well the affrighted creature at first outstripped us  then as we tired her out and drew near she doubled on her track and dived hither and thither among the thick underwood in a way that rendered it exceedingly difficult to catch her  peterkin was the first to come up with her  he gradually but perseveringly ran her down  when he came within a few yards of her the poor creature sank with a low wail to the ground and turning half round glanced at her pursuer with a timid imploring yet despairing expression  alas despair mingled with it because she knew too well the terrible cruelty of savage men when their blood is up and she knew nothing yet of the hearts of christians  peterkin whose susceptible nature was ever easily touched felt a thrill of selfreproach as the thought suddenly occurred that however good his intentions might be he was in reality running a helpless woman down like a bloodhound  he stopped short instantly and acting as on most occasions he did impulsively he threw his rifle away from him unclasped his belt and throwing it with his huntingknife also away sat down on the ground and held out both his hands  there was something almost ludicrous in the act but it had the effect of to some extent relieving the poor womans fears  seeing this as we successively came up we all laid down our rifles and stood before the crouching creature with our empty hands extended towards her to show that we meant her no harm  still although she seemed less terrified she trembled violently and panted from her recent exertion but never for a moment relaxed her hold of the dead child  speak to her mak said jack as the guide came up  tell her who and what we are at once to relieve her feelings and let her know especially that we are the bitter enemies of the villain who has done this deed  while makarooroo explained the womans countenance seemed to brighten up and in a few minutes she began to tell with great volubility the events of the attack  the trader she said had come suddenly on them in the dead of night with a large band and had at once routed the warriors of the village who were completely taken by surprise  a few had escaped but mbango with okandaga and his household had been taken prisoners and carried away with many others  how long is it since this happened inquired jack  she say two days massa  den dey go off to tack king jambai  ah then it is too late to save him returned jack in a tone of sadness  our hearts sank on learning this but on questioning the woman further we found that the marauding party deeming themselves too weak to attack so large a village as that of king jambai had talked of turning aside to secure the assistance of another tribe not far distant who they knew would be too glad to pick a quarrel with that chief  then we shall do it yet cried jack springing up energetically  we shall be in time to warn jambai and to save okandaga and her friends come mak cheer up things begin to look better  the cheerful confident voice in which our friend said this raised my hopes wonderfully even although on consideration i could not see that our chances of success were very great  our guide was visibly comforted and we stepped aside to pick up our rifles with considerable alacrity  during the brief period in which we were thus employed the poor woman managed to creep away and when we again looked round she was gone  our first impulse was to give chase again but the thought of the needless terror which that would occasion her deterred us and before we could make up our minds what to do she was almost beyond our reach and would certainly have cost us an hour of search if not longer to find her time pressed  to reach the village of king jambai with the utmost possible speed was essential to the safety of the tribe so we resolved to leave her feeling as we did so that the poor creature could sustain herself on roots and berries without much difficulty or suffering until she reached the village of some neighbouring tribe  we now pushed on again by forced marches travelling by night and by day shooting just enough game as we required for food and taking no more rest than was absolutely necessary to enable us to hold on our way in a short time we reached the village which to our great joy we found in much the same state as it was when we left it  king jambai received us with great delight and his people went into a state of immense rejoicingfiring guns and shouting and beating kettles and drums in honour of the arrival of the white faces which name was certainly a misnomer seeing that our faces had by that time become the very reverse of whiteindeed they were little lighter than the countenances of the good people by whom we were surrounded  but the kings consternation was very great when we told him the reason of our unexpected visit and related to him the details of the terrible calamity that had befallen poor mbango and his people  he appeared sincerely grateful for the effort we had made to warn him of the impending attack and seemed unable to express his thanks when we offered to aid him in the defence of his village  we now deemed this a fitting moment to tell the king boldly of our having assisted in the escape of okandaga from his village and beg his forgiveness  he granted this at once but strongly advised us to keep our secret quiet and leave it to him to account to his warriors for the reappearance of the runaway maiden when retaken  of course we could make no objection to this so after thanking him we entered upon a discussion of the best method of frustrating the slavedealers designs  tell the king said jack addressing himself to our guide that if he will make me commanderinchief of his forces i will show him how white warriors manage to circumvent their enemies  i would like much said peterkin laughing to know how mak will translate the word circumvent  your style is rather flowery jack for such an interpreter and upon my word now i think of it your presumption is considerable  how do you know that i do not wish to be commanderinchief myself  i shall make over the command to you with all my heart if you wish it said jack smiling blandly  nay ill none of it  however suited i may be to the work the work is not suited to me so i resign in your favour  well then said jack since you decline to accept the chief command ill make you my second  mak shall be my aidedecamp you and ralph shall be generals of divisions  i thank you much my honoured and honourable generalissimo but perhaps before being thus liberal of your favours it were well to ascertain that your own services are accepted  that is soon donewhat says the king mak  hims say that hims delighted to git you an you may doos how you like  thats plain and explicit  you see peterkin that im fairly installed so you and i will take a short walk together and hold a consultation as to our plans in the approaching campaign while ralph arranges our hut and makes things comfortable  a glorious campaign truly to serve in an army of baboons led by a white gorilla  i would deem it almost comical did i not see too sure a probability of bloodshed before its conclusion remarked peterkin  that you shall not see if i can prevent it and it is for the purpose of consulting you on that point and claiming your services in an old and appropriate character that i drag you along with me now said jack as he rose and making a bow to the king left the hut    chapter nineteen  preparations for war and peculiar drill  the plan which jack and peterkin concocted while i was engaged in making the interior of our old residence as comfortable as possible was as follows  scouts were in the first place to be sent out that night all over the country to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy  then when the enemy should be discovered they were to send back one of their number to report while the remainder should remain to dog their steps if need be in order to ascertain whether mbango and okandaga were in their possession and if so where they were keptwhether in the midst of the warriors or in their rear  this settled the remainder of the warriors of the village were to be collected together and a speech to be made to them by jack who should explain to them that they were to be divided into two bands all who carried guns to be under the immediate charge of jack himself the others carrying bows and spears to be placed under me  peterkin was to act a peculiar part which will appear in the course of narration  having partaken of a hearty supper we assembled the scouts and having through makarooroo given them their instructions sent them away just as the shades of night began to fall  we next caused a huge bonfire to be kindled and round this all the men of the village assembled to the extent of several hundreds  the king soon appeared and mounting the trunk of a fallen tree made a long speech to his warriors telling them of the danger that threatened them in such vivid and lively terms that the greater part of them began to exhibit expressions of considerable uneasiness on their countenances  he then told them of the trouble that we had taken in order to give them timely warningwhereat they cast upon us looks of gratitude and after that introduced jack to them as their commanderinchief saying that as a white man led the enemy nothing could be better than that a white man should lead them to meet the enemywhereat the sable warriors gave a shout of satisfaction and approval  having been thus introduced jack mounted the trunk of the fallen tree and makarooroo got up beside him to interpret  he began like a wise diplomatist by complimenting king jambai and spoke at some length on courage in general and on the bravery of king jambais warriors in particular which of course he took for granted  then he came to particulars and explained as much of his intended movements as he deemed it good for them to know and wound up by saying that he had three words of command to teach them which they must learn to understand and act upon that very night  they were forward  halt and fire  by saying the first of these words very slow and in a drawling voice thus forwaaaaard and the second in a quick sharp tone and the third in a ferocious yell that caused the whole band to start he actually got them to understand and distinguish the difference between the commands and to act upon them in the course of half an hour  the drill of his army being thus completed jack dismissed them with a caution to hold themselves in readiness to answer promptly the first call to arms and the king enforced the caution by quietly assuring them that the man who did not attend to this order and otherwise respect and obey jack as if he were the king should have his heart eyes and liver torn out and the rest of his carcass cast to the dogsa threat which seemed to us very horrible and uncalled for but which nevertheless was received by the black warriors with perfect indifference  now mak said jack as he descended to the ground do you come with me and help me to place sentries  wat be dat massa  men who are placed to guard the village from surprise during the night explained jack  ho dat be de ting me know someting bout dat  no doubt you do but i daresay you dont know the best way to place them and perhaps you are not aware that the pretty little threat uttered by the king shall be almost carried out in the case of every man who shall be found asleep at his post or who shall desert it  the guide grinned and followed his commander in silence while i returned to our hut and busied myself in cleaning the rifles and making other preparations for the expected fight  at an early hour on the following morning we were awakened by the arrival of one of the scouts who reported that the portuguese trader with a strong and wellarmed force was encamped on the margin of a small pond about fifteen miles distant from the village  the scout had gone straight to the spot on being sent out knowing that it was a likely place for them to encamp if they should encamp at all  and here he found them making active preparations for an attack on the village creeping like a serpent through the grass the scout approached near enough to overhear their arrangements which were to the elect that the attack should take place at midnight of the following day  he observed that there were many prisoners in the campmen women and children and these were to be left behind in charge of a small party of armed men while the main body under the immediate command of the portuguese trader should proceed to the attack of the village  from the scouts description of the prisoners we became convinced that they were none other than our friends mbango and his people and one woman answering to the description of okandaga was among them  so mak we shall save her yet cried jack heartily slapping the shoulder of the guide whose honest visage beamed with returning hope  yis massa  spose we go off dis hour and fight em  nay that were somewhat too hasty a movement  slow but sure must be our motto until night  then we shall pounce upon our foes like a leopard on his prey  but ask the scout if that is all he has got to tell us  hims say massa dat hims find one leetle chileone boywhen hims go away from de camp to come back to here  a boy repeated jack wherehow  in de woods where hims was trowd to die so de scout take him up and bring him to here  ah poor child said i no doubt it must have been sick and being a burden has been left behind  but stay  how could that be possible if it was found between the camp and this village  on further inquiry we ascertained that the scout after hearing what he thought enough of their arrangements had travelled some distance beyond the encampment in order to make sure that there were no other bands connected with the one he had left and it was while thus engaged that he stumbled on the child which seemed to be in a dying condition  hims say too continued makarooroo after interpreting the above information that there be one poor woman in awfable sorrow screechin and hollerowin like one lion  eh exclaimed peterkin  describe her to us  the scout did so as well as he could  as sure as we live cried peterkin it is our friend njamie and the child must be her boy  come show us the little fellow  we all ran out and followed the scout to his hut where we found his wivesfor he had three of themnursing the child as tenderly as if it had been their own  it was very much wasted evidently through want of food and overfatigue but we instantly recognised the once sturdy little son of njamie in the faded little being before us  he too recognised us for his bright spectral eyes opened wide when he saw us  i knew it said i  i told you so cried peterkinnow mak pump him and lets hear what he knows  the poor child was far too much exhausted to undergo the pumping process referred to  he could merely answer that njamie and okandaga and mbango were prisoners in the camp and then turned languidly away as if he desired rest  poor boy said peterkin tenderly as he laid his hand gently on the childs woolly patetell them mak to look well after him here and they shall be paid handsomely fornay here he interrupted himself dont say that  tis a bad thing to offer to pay for that which people are willing to do for love  right lad said jack we can easily make these poor folk happy by giving them something afterwards without saying that it is bestowed because of their kindness to the boy  the proper reward of diligent successful labour is a prize but the best reward of love and kindness is a warm hearty recognition of their existencejust tell them mak that we are glad to see them so good and attentive to the little chap and now my generals if it is consistent with your other engagements i would be glad to have a little private consultation with you  ready and willing my lord said peterkin as we followed jack towards the kings palace  but he added seriously i dont like to be a general of division at all  why not peterkin  why you see when i was at school i found division so uncommonly difficult and suffered so much mentally and physically in the learning of it that i have a species of morbid antipathy to the very name  i even intend to refuse a seat in parliament when offered to me because of the divisions that are constantly going on there  if you could only make me a general of subtraction now or  that interrupted jack were easily done by deducting you from the force altogether and commanding you to remain at home  in which case rejoined peterkin i should have to become general of addition by revolunteering my services in order to prevent the whole expedition from resolving itself into general muddle whose name and services are wellknown in all branches of military and civil service  so that added jack it all comes to this that you and ralph and i must carry on the war by rule of three each taking his just and appropriate proportion of the work to be done  now to change the subject theres the sun getting up and so is the king if i may judge from the stir in his majestys household  having begged the king to assemble his warriors together jack now proceeded to divide them into four companies or bands over which he appointed respective leaders  all the men who possessed guns were assembled together in one band numbering about one hundred and fifty men  these jack subdivided into two companies one including a hundred the other fifty men  the remainder constituting the main army were armed with bows and arrows spears and knives  of these a large force was told off to remain behind and guard the village  this homeguard was placed under command of the king in person  the hundred musketeers were placed under peterkins command  the other fifty were given to me along with a hundred spear and bow men  jack himself took command of the main body of spearmen  as peterkin had to act a special and independent part besides commanding his hundred musketeers makarooroo was made over to him to act as lieutenant  all these arrangements and appointments were made in a cool quiet and arbitrary manner by jack to whom the natives including the king looked up with a species of awe amounting almost to veneration  now said our commanderinchief to lieutenant mak tell the niggers i am going to make them a speech this was received with a grunt of satisfaction and that if they wish to have the smallest chance of overcoming their enemies they had better give their closest attention to what i have to say  another grunt of acquiescence followed this announcement  say that i am going to speak to them of things so mysterious that they shall not by any conceivable or possible effort understand them  this being quite in accordance with the superstitions and tastes of the negroes was received with eager acclamations of delight  tell them continued jack in a deep solemn tone and frowning darkly that we shall gain the victory only through obedience each man must keep his ears open and his eye on his leader and must obey orders at once  if the order halt should be given and any man should have his mouth open at the time he must keep his mouth open and shut it after he has halted  here jack took occasion to revert to the three orders forward halt and fire and repeated the lesson several times until his men were quite perfect  then he put the various bodies under their respective commanders and telling the musketeers to make believe to fire but making sure that they should not really do it by taking their guns from them he made each of us give the various words separately so that our men should become familiar with our voices  this done he called the generals of divisions to him and said  now gentlemen i am going to review my troops and to give them their final lesson in military tactics with the double view of seeing that they know what they have got to do and of impressing them with a due sense of the great advantage of even a slight knowledge of drill  he then directed us to take command of our several companies makarooroo being placed on this occasion over the kings band and pointed out the separate directions in which we were ultimately to post our troops so as to advance upon the spot on which the king stood when the signal should be given  we had already taught the men the necessity of attacking in a compact single line and of forming up into this position from what is termed indian file with which latter they were already acquainted  of course we could not hope to teach them the principles of wheeling in the short time at our command  to overcome this difficulty we told each band to follow its leader who should walk in front to advance when he advanced to retire when he retired and to turn this way or that way according to his movements  at a signal we gave the word forward and the whole band defiled into the woods before the king and disappeared like a vision to the unutterable amazement of his majesty who stood perfectly motionless with eyes and mouth open to their fullest extent  having marched together for some distance each leader detached his men and led them as it were to opposite directions of the compass three of the bands making a considerable detour in order to get the spot where the king stood in the centre of us  then we halted and awaited the next signal  in about ten minutes it was givena loud whistleand we gave the word forward again  i say we because the result proved that we had done so  being out of sight of the other bands of course i could not see how they acted  on i rushed over brake and bush and morass my men following me in a very good line considering the nature of the ground  i had divided them into four lines with an interval of about six yards between each and it was really wonderful how well they kept in that position  the other companies had been ordered to act in the same way  on bursting out of the woods i saw that we had outstripped the other companies so i held my men in check by running somewhat slower and they had been so deeply impressed with the fatal consequences of not doing exactly as i did that they stared at me with all their eyes to the no small risk of their lives for one or two dashed against trees and others tumbled head over heels into holes in their anxiety to keep their eyes upon me  in a few seconds i observed peterkin spring out of the woods followed by his men so i went on again at full speed  as we entered the village our ranks were sadly broken and confused by the huts but on gaining the open space where jack stood i was pleased to observe that the negroes tried of their own accord to regain their original formation and succeeded so well that we came on in four tolerably straight and compact lines  each commander having been forewarned to hold his men in check or to push forward so as to arrive at the central point at the same moment jack peterkin makarooroo and i ran in upon the king together and unitedly gave the word halt whereupon we found ourselves in the centre of a solid square  so deeply had the men been impressed with the necessity of obedience that they had scarcely observed each others approach  they now stood rooted to the ground in every possible attitude of suddenlyarrested motion and all with their eyes and mouths wide open  in another moment the result of their combined movement became evident to them and they uttered a yell of delighted surprise  very good very good indeed said jack and that concluding yell was very effectivequite magnificentbut you see he added turning to me although such a yell is sufficiently appalling to us it will no doubt be a mere trifle to men who are used to it  what say you to teaching them a british cheer  absurd said i they will never learn to give it properly  i dont know that rejoined jack in a doubtful manner  try said peterkin  so i willmak tell them now that im going to continue the speech which this little review interrupted  theys all ready for more massa  this was patent to the meanest capacity for the negroes stood gazing at their commanderinchief with eyes and mouths and ears open and nostrils expanded as if anxious to gulp in and swallow down his words through every organ  there is a cry said jack which the white man gives when he enters into battlea terrible cry which is quite different from that of the black man and which is so awful that it strikes terror into the heart of the white mans enemies and has even been known to make a whole army fly almost without a shot being fired  we shall let you hear it  thereupon jack and i and peterkin gave utterance to a cheer of the most vociferous description which evidently filled the minds of the natives with admiration  now resumed jack i wish my black warriors to try that cheer  some of the black warriors supposing that the expression of this wish was a direct invitation to them to begin gave utterance to a terrific howl  stay stop cried jack holding up his hand  every mouth was closed instantly  you must cheer by command  i will say hip hip hip three times as soon as i say the third hip out with the cry  now then  hip hip  popotamus whispered peterkin  hip hurrah shouted jack  hurl ho sh kee how yelled the savages each man giving his own idea of our terrorinspiring british cheer  that will do said jack quietly it is quite evident that the warcry of the white man is not suited to the throat of the black  you will utter your usual shout my friends when the signal is given but remember not before that  and now i come to the greatest mystery of all  every ear was eagerly attentive the shot and bits of metal and little stones with which king jambais warriors are accustomed to kill will not do on this great and peculiar occasion  they will not answer the purposemy purpose therefore i have provided a kind of bullet which every one must use instead of his usual shot  no warriors ever used such bullets in the fight before  they are very precious because i have only enough of them to give one to each man  but that will do  if the enemy does not fly at the first discharge then you may load with your own shot  so saying jack with the utmost gravity took from the pouch that hung at his side a handful of little balls of paper about the size of a musket bullet which he began to distribute among the savages  we had observed jack making several hundreds of these the night previous to this memorable day out of one or two newspapers we had carried along with us for wadding but he would not at that time tell us what he was going to do with them  the negroes received this novel species of ammunition with deep interest and surprise  never having seen printed paper before or in all probability paper of any kind they were much taken up with the mysterious characters imprinted thereon and no doubt regarded these as the cause of the supernatural power which the bullets were supposed to possess  remember said jack when these are discharged at the enemy i do not say that they will kill but i do say that they will cause the enemy to fly  only be assured that everything depends on your obedience  and if one single stone or nail or hard substance is put in along with these bullets the chief part of my plans will be frustrated  it was quite evident from the expression of their sable countenances that the idea of the bullets not killing was anything but agreeable they were too deeply impressed however with jacks power and too far committed in the enterprise and generally too much overwhelmed with mingled surprise and perplexity to offer any objection  now said jack in conclusion you may go and eat well  tonight when it grows dark hold yourselves in readiness to go forth in dead silence  mind that not a sound to be uttered until the signal hip hip hip is given  and added peterkin in an undertone to makarooroo tell them that king jambai expects that every man will do his duty  this remark was received with a shout and a frightful display of white teeth accompanied by a tremendous flourish of guns bows and spears  there was something quite awful not to say picturesque in this displaying of teeth which took place many times during the course of the above proceedings  you looked upon a sea of black ebony balls each having two white dots with black centres near the top of it  suddenly the ebony balls were gashed across and a sort of storm as it were of deep red mingled with pure white swept over the dark cloud of heads before you and vanished as quickly as it had appeared only to reappear however at the next stroke of humour or at some touch of that nature which is said on very high authority to make the whole world kin  the proceedings eventually closed with a brief speech from the king who referred to peterkins remark about each man doing his duty and said that if each man did not do his duty here his majesty paused for a minute and wrought his countenance into horrible contortions indicative of the most excruciating agony and wound up with an emphatic repetition of that dire threat about the unnatural treatment of eyes heart liver and carcass which had on the previous evening sounded so awful in our ears and had been treated with such profound indifference by those whom it was specially designed to affect  i didnt know jack observed peterkin gravely as we returned to our hut that you were such an outandout humbug  you are severe peterkin  i scarcely deserve to be called a humbug for acting to the best of my judgment in peculiar circumstances  peculiar circumstances responded peterkin  truly they have received peculiar treatment  that is as it should be rejoined jack at any rate be they peculiar or be they otherwise our plans are settled and our mode of action fixed so we must een abide the issue    chapter twenty  a warlike expedition and a victory  it was excessively dark that night when we set forth on our expedition  the scout from whom we had already ascertained so much about the intended movements of the enemy also told us that they meant to set out at a little before midnight and march on the village by a certain route indeed it was very unlikely that they would approach by any other as the jungle elsewhere was so thick as to render marching especially at night very difficult  jack therefore resolved to place the greater proportion of his troops in ambush at the mouth of a small gully or dell a few miles from the enemys camp where they were almost certain to pass  but with a degree of caution that i thought highly creditable in so young and inexperienced a general he sent out a considerable number of the most trustworthy men in advance with instructions to proceed with the stealth of leopards and to bring back instant information of any change of route on the part of the foe  the troops placed in ambush at the dell above referred to were peterkins hundred musketeers supported by jacks spear and bow men  i was ordered to advance by a circuitous route on the camp itself with my fifty musketeers followed by my small company of spearmen  my instructions were to conceal my men as near to the camp as possible and there await the first discharge of firearms from the dell when i was to rise advance upon the camp utter a terrific shout when within fifty yards rush forward to within twentyfive yards halt pour in one withering volley of blank cartridge and charge without giving my men time to load  of course i could not speak to my men but this was a matter of little consequence as they were now well acquainted with our three words of command forward halt and fire and fully understood that they must under all circumstances follow their leader  i knew well enough that there must be no little danger in this arrangement because the leader would necessarily be always in front of the muzzles of the loaded guns  but there was no help for it so i resolved to act upon my usual principlenamely that when a thing is inevitable the best thing to do is to treat it as being unavoidable  having conducted my men stealthily and successfully to the vicinity of the enemys camp though with some difficulty owing to the almost impenetrable nature of the jungle through which we had to pass in making the detour necessary to avoid falling in with the attacking force we proceeded to advance to within as short a distance of it as possible without running the risk of being discovered  this was not difficult for the men left to guard the camp supposing no doubt that their presence in that part of the country was not suspected had taken no precautions in the way of placing sentries so we quickly arrived at the foot of a small mound about sixty yards or so from the encampment  at the foot of this mound i caused my men to lie down giving them to understand by signs that they were on no account to move until i should return  then i crept alone to the brow of the mound and obtained a clear view of the camp  the men who should have guarded it were i found busily employed in cooking their supper  there were perhaps upwards of a hundred of them  to my great satisfaction i observed the captives sitting near to the fire and although at so considerable a distance from them i felt certain that i recognised the figures of mbango and okandaga  hastening back to my men i endeavoured to give them as much information as possible by means of signs and then lay down beside them to await the signal from jacks party  although the attack of both our parties was to be simultaneous the first shot was to be fired by our troops in the dell  i will therefore describe their part of the engagement first  jack described it to me minutely after all was over  on reaching the dell jack disposed his forces so as to command the only approach to it  the hundred musketeers he placed in a double row directly across the deepest and darkest part  the spearmen he divided into two bodies which he posted on the flanks of the musketeers among the bushes  he then showed the rear rank of the latter how to point their pieces over the shoulders of the men in the front rank at a given signal but carefully reiterated the order not to touch a trigger until the word fire should be given  now peterkin said jack when these dispositions had been made it is time for you to get ready  makarooroo and i can manage these fellows so you have my permission to go and play your own independent part  only let me warn you to remember your last exploit in this way and see that you dont do yourself a damage  thanks noble general for the permission answered peterkin of which i shall avail myself  in reference to your advice i may remark that it is exceedingly valuableso much so indeed that i would advise you not to part with it until asked for  with that peterkin ran into the jungle and was soon lost to view  on gaining a sufficient distance from the men he took off the greater part of his clothes and wound round his person several pieces of lightcoloured cotton that he chanced to have with him and some pieces of old newspaper  then he decked his head with leaves and ragged branches as he had done before in the haunted cave making himself in short as wild and fantastic a looking creature as possiblethe only difference between his gettingup on this and the former occasion being that he was white instead of black  for he wisely judged that a white demon must naturally appear infinitely more appalling and horrible to a negro than one of his own colour  the two cones of moistened powder however which he had prepared for this occasion were very much larger than the former and had been fitted into two wooden handles or cups for safety  with these in his hands he crept to the top of a steep sloping mound or hill near the entrance to the dell and considerably in advance of the troops  here he sat down to await the approach of the enemy  there is something very eerie and aweinspiring in a solitary nightwatch especially if it be kept in a wild lonesome place peterkin afterwards told me that while sitting that night on the top of the mound looking out upon a plain over which the enemy were expected to approach on the one hand and down into the dark dell where our troops were posted on the other hand his heart more than once misgave him and he could not help asking himself the questions what if our plans miscarry  what if our united volley and cheer and my demoniac display should fail to intimidate the negroes  such questions he did not like to dwell upon for he knew that in the event of failure a regular pitched battle would be fought and much blood would certainly flow  while indulging in such thoughts he observed a dark form glide past the foot of the mound on which he lay and vanish in the obscurity of the dell which was so surrounded by crags and rocky places covered with underwood that no light could penetrate into it  at first he was startled and thought of giving the alarm to his comrades but on second thoughts he concluded the person must have been one of his own scouts returned with news at all events he felt that one man could do no harm worth speaking of to so large a party  presently he observed a large band of men coming over the plain towards the entrance of the dell  these he felt assured must be the enemy and he was right  they came on in a large compact body and were wellarmed yet from the quick and unguarded manner of their approach he could perceive that they suspected no ambush  they entered the dell in a confused though solid and silent body and peterkin could observe by the dim light that they were led by one man who walked in advance whom he rightly judged to be the portuguese slavedealer  the time for action had now come  he examined the points of his powdercones to ascertain that they were dry then held a match in readiness and listened intently to the footsteps of the foe  i have already explained that jack had drawn his musketeers across the dell and placed the spearmen in the jungle on both flanks  they were arranged in such a way as to form three sides of a square into which the unsuspecting enemy now marched  jack allowed them to approach to within thirty paces of his musketeers and then gave in a loud deep sonorous tone the wordhip hip hip  the compound cheer and yell that instantly followed the last hip was so tremendous coming as it did from all sides except the rear that the enemy were absolutely paralysed  they stood rooted to the earth as motionless as if they had been transformed into stone  jack raised his hand in which he held a bunch of white grass that could be distinctly seen in the dark  every muzzle was pointed on the instant but not a sound was heard save the click of a hundred locks  the sound was familiar to the enemy although never before heard at one moment in such numbers  they started but before a step could be taken the word fire was given  instantly a sheet of flame swept across the entire dell and the united crash of a hundred guns seemed to rend the very earth  the surrounding cliffs reverberated and multiplied the horrid din while led by jack cheer followed cheer or rather howls and yells filled the air and kept awake the echoes of the place  the enemy turned and fled and the shrieks to which they gave utterance as they ran betokened the extremity of their terror  it wanted but one touch to complete their consternation and that touch was given when peterkin lighting his powdercones showed himself on the mound dancing in a blaze of fire and shrieking furiously as the horrified tide of men swept by  in the midst of his wild orgies peterkin acted an impromptu and unintentional part by tripping over the brow of the hill and rolling down the steep declivity like a firewheel into the very midst of the flying crew  jumping hastily up he charged through the ranks of the foe flung the two hissing cones high into the air and darting into the jungle hid himself effectually from view  meanwhile jack still held the bunch of white straw aloft  every eye was fixed on it but not a man moved because it remained stationary  this absence of pursuit in the midst of such appalling sights and sounds must undoubtedly have added to the mystery and therefore to the terrors of the scene  suddenly the white bunch was seen to dart forward  jack who now considered the enemy almost beyond the chance of being overtaken gave the word forward in the voice of a stentor following it up with hip hip hurrah and the whole host musketeers and spearmen in a mingled mass rushed yelling out upon the plain and gave chase to the foe  not so badly done said jack with a quiet laugh as he laid his hand on peterkins shoulder  why jack how did you find me out  easily enough when it is considered that i saw you go in  the flame of your wildfire indicated your movements pretty plainly to me although terror and amazement no doubt blinded the eyes of every one else  even maks teeth began to chatter when he saw you perform that singular descent of the hill and no wonder  i hope no bones have been broken  no all right as far as that goes replied peterkin within a laugh but ive lost a good deal of skin  however itll grow again  im glad its no worse  but i say jack do you think our fellows wont overtake these rascals  no fear of that  i took care to give them a good start and if there be any truth in the generally received idea that terror lends wings im pretty sure that each man in the enemys ranks must have obtained the loan of several pairs tonight  but have you heard the sound of ralphs guns  no the din here was enough to drown anything so distant  well we must away to him as fast as we can  i expect that poor mak is off before us  but youll wait until i put on my clothes said peterkin hasting back towards the place where he had undressed  certainly lad only look alive  soon afterwards they left the place together  while this was going on at the dell i on hearing the first shot gave the word forward in a low tone  my men instantly rose and followed me and i could not even at that anxious moment help admiring the serpentlike facility with which they glided from bush to bush without the slightest noise  we descended a hill crossed a small brook and approached to within thirty yards of the camp without being discovered  suddenly i leaped on the top of a hillock and shouted at the utmost pitch of my voice the single word halt  on hearing it all the men in the camp sprang to their arms and stood gazing round them with looks of consternation  my next word was fire  a firm tremendous crash burst from among the bushes and my single person enveloped in smoke and flame was i believe the only object visible to those in the camp  hip hip hip hurrah forward  i shouted and with a ferocious yell we poured like a whirlwind upon the foe  the same result that had occurred at the dell took place here  the enemy never awaited our charge  they fled instantly and so great was their terror that they actually threw down their arms in order to facilitate their flight  on gaining the camp however i found to my sorrow that we had done the thing only too vigorously for we had not only put the enemy to flight but we had also frightened away those whom we had come to deliver  at this point in the engagement i came to learn how incompetent i was to command men in cases of emergency for here my presence of mind utterly forsook me  in my anxiety to capture mbango and his friends i ordered an immediate pursuit  then it occurred to me that in the event of my men being successful in overtaking the fugitives they would instantly murder them all so i tried to call them back but alas they did not understand my words and they were by this time so excited as to be beyond all restraint  in a few minutes i found myself left alone in the enemys camp and heard the shouts of pursued and pursuers growing gradually fainter and more distant as they scattered themselves through the jungle  seating myself by the fire in a state of mind bordering on despair i buried my face in my hands and endeavoured to collect myself and consider what under the circumstances should be now done    chapter twenty one  arrangements for pursuing the enemy and sudden change of plans  you seem to be taking it easy old boy said a voice close to my elbow  i started and looked up hastily  ah  peterkin  you there  ay and may i not reply with some surprise you here  truly you maybut what could i do  the men ran away from me whether i would or no and you are aware i could not make myself understood not being able tobut where is jack  i asked this abruptly because it occurred to me at that moment that he and peterkin should have been together  where is jack echoed peterkin i may ask that of you for i am ignorant on the point  he and i got separated in endeavouring to escape from the scrimmage caused by your valiant attack  you seem to have scattered the whole force to the winds  oh here he is and mak along with him  jack and our guide came running into the camp at that moment  well ralph what of okandaga  ah what of her indeed said peterkin  i forgot her  you dont moan to say she was not in the camp  indeed she was said i and so were mbango and his wife njamie and one or two others whom i did not know but my men went at them with such ferocity that they fled along with our enemies  fled cried jack  ay and i fear much that it will fare ill with them if they are overtaken for the men were wild with excitement and passion  come this must be looked to cried jack seizing his rifle and tightening his belt we must follow for if they escape our hands they will certainly be retaken by their former captors  we followed our comrade without further remark in the direction of the fugitives but although we ran fast and long we failed to come up with them  for two hours did we dash through bush and brake jungle and morass led by makarooroo and lighted by the pale beams of the moon then we came to a halt and sat down to consult  dem be gone said our wretched guide whose cup of happiness was thus dashed from his hand just as he was about to raise it to his lips  now dont look so dismal mak cried peterkin slapping the man on the shoulder  you may depend upon it we will hunt her up somehow or other  only let us keep stout hearts and we can do anything  very easily said master peterkin observed jack but what course do you propose we should follow just now  collect our scattered men go back to the village have a palaver with king jambai and his chiefs get up a pursuit and run the foxes to earth  and suppose said jack that you dont know in which direction they have fled how can we pursue them  it is very easy to suppose all manner of difficulties retorted peterkin  if you have a better plan out with it  i have no better plan but i have a slight addition to make to yours which is that when we collect a few of our men i shall send them out to every point of the compass to make tracks like the spokes of a wheel of which the village shall be the centre and by that means we shall be pretty certain to get information ere long as to the whereabouts of our fugitives  so now let us be up and doing time is precious tonight  in accordance with this plan we rapidly retraced our steps to the dell which had been appointed as our place of rendezvous  here we found the greater part of our men assembled and so welltimed had jacks movements been that not one of them all had been able to overtake or slay a single enemy  thus by able generalship had jack gained a complete and bloodless victory  having detached and sent off our scoutswho besides being picked men travelled without any other encumbrance than their armswe resumed our journey homeward and reached the village not long after sunrise to the immense surprise of jambai who could scarcely believe that we had routed the enemy so completely and whose scepticism was further increased by the total and to him unaccountable absence of prisoners or of any other trophies of our success in the fight  but jack made a public speech of such an elaborate deeply mysterious and totally incomprehensible character that even makarooroo who translated listened and spoke with the deepest reverence and wonder and when he had concluded there was evidently a firm impression on the minds of the natives that this victory wasby some means or in some way or other quite inexplicable but highly satisfactorythe greatest they had ever achieved  the king at once agreed to jacks proposal that a grand pursuit should take place to commence the instant news should be brought in by the scouts  but the news when it did come had the effect of totally altering our plans  the first scout who returned told us that he had fallen in with a large body of the enemy encamped on the margin of a small pond  creeping like a snake through the grass he succeeded in getting near enough to overhear the conversation from which he gathered two important pieces of informationnamely that they meant to return to their own lands in a northeasterly direction and that their prisoners had escaped by means of a canoe which they found on the banks of the river that flowed past king jambais village  the first piece of information decided the king to assemble his followers and go off in pursuit of them at once the second piece of news determined us to obtain a canoe and follow mbango and his companions to the seacoast whither from all that we heard we concluded they must certainly have gone  as this however was a journey of many weeks we had to take the matter into serious consideration  it is quite evident said jack as we sat over our supper on the night after receiving the above newsit is quite evident that they mean to go to the coast for mbango had often expressed to mak a wish to go there and the mere fact of their having been seen to escape and take down stream is in itself pretty strong evidence that they did not mean to return to their now desolated village seeing that the country behind them is swarming with enemies and of course they cannot know that we have conquered the main body of these rascals  i therefore propose that we should procure a canoe and follow them first because we must at all hazards get hold of poor okandaga and relieve the anxiety of our faithful guide makarooroo and second because it is just as well to go in that direction as in any other in order to meet with wild animals and see the wonders of this land  but what if king jambai takes it into his black woolly head to decline to let us go said peterkin  in that case we must take french leave of him  in which case said i in some alarm all my specimens of natural history will be lost  jack received this remark with a shake of his head and a look of great perplexity and peterkin said ah ralph i fear theres no help for it  you must make up your mind to say goodbye to your mummiesbig puggies and all  but you do not know said i energetically that jambai will detain us against our will  certainly not replied jack and for your sake i hope that he will not  at any rate i will go to see him about this point after supper its of no use presenting a petition either to king lord or common while his stomach is empty  but there is another thing that perplexes me that poor sick child njamies son must not be left behind  the poor distracted mother has no doubt given him up for lost  it will be like getting him back from the grave  true said i we must take him with us  yet i fear he is too ill to travel and we cannot await his recovery  he is not so ill as he seemed observed peterkin  i went to see him only half an hour ago and the little chap was quite hearty and glad to see me  the fact is he has been illused and illfed  the rest and good treatment he has received have even in the short time he has been here quite revived him  good said jack then he shall go with us  ill engage to take him on my back when he knocks up on the marchfor we have a march before us as i shall presently explainand when we get into a canoe he will be able to rest  but what march do you refer to  i asked  simply this  mak with whom i have had a good deal of conversation on the subject tells me that the river makes a considerable bend below this village and that by taking a short cut of a days journey or so over land we can save time and will reach a small hamlet where canoes are to be had  the way to be sure is through rather a wild country but that to us is an advantage as we shall be the more likely to meet with game  i find also that the king has determined to follow the same route with his warriors in pursuit of the enemy so that thus far we may travel together  at the hamlet we will diverge to the northeast while we if all goes well embarking in our canoe will proceed toward the west coast where if we do not overtake them on the way we shall be certain to find them on our arrival  okandaga has often longed to go to the mission station there and as she knows it is in vain to urge mbango to return to his destroyed village she will doubtless advise him to go to the coast  what you say seems highly probable said i and i think the best thing you can do is to go to the king at once and talk him over  trust jack for that added peterkin who was at that moment deeply engaged with what he called the drumstick of a roast monkey  jack would talk over any creature with life so persuasive is his eloquence i say ralph he added holding the halfpicked drumstick at arms length and regarding it with a critical gaze i wonder now how the drumstick of an ostrich would taste  good i have no doubt though rather large for one mans dinner  it would be almost equal to gorilla ham i should fancy said jack as he left the hut on his errand to the king  o you cannibal to think of such a thing cried peterkin throwing the bone of his drumstick after our retreating comradebut tis always thus he added with a sigh man preys upon man monkey upon monkey yet i had hoped better things of jack  i had believed him to be at least a refined species of gorilla  i say ralph what makes you look so lugubrious  the difficulties i suppose that beset our path said i sadly for to say truth i did not feel in a jesting humour just then  i was forced however in spite of myself to laugh at the expression of mingled disgust and surprise that overspread the mobile countenance of my friend on hearing my reply  the difficulties echoed he that beset our path  really ralph life will become insupportable to me if you and jack go on in this fashion  a man of nerve and sanguine temperament might stand it but to one like me of a naturally timid and leaning nature with the addition of low spirits it is really crushingquite crushing  i laughed and replied that he must just submit to be crushed as it was impossible for jack and me to change our dispositions to suit his convenience whereupon he sighed lighted his pipe and began to smoke vehemently  in the course of little more than an hour jack returned accompanied by makarooroo and from the satisfied expression of their faces i judged that they had been successful  ah  i see its all right said peterkin raising himself on one elbow as they entered the hut and seated themselves beside the fire old jambai has been talked over  right but he needed a deal of talkhe was horribly obstinate said jack  ho yis ho ho horribubly obsterlate added makarooroo in corroboration rubbing his hands and holding his nose slyly over the bowl of peterkins pipe in order to enjoy as it were a secondhand whiff  here theres a bit for yourself old boy  sit down and enjoy yourself while jack tells us all about his interview with royalty said peterkin handing a lump of tobacco to our guide whose eyes glistened and white teeth gleamed as he received the muchprized gift  jack now explained to us that he had found the king in a happy state of satiety smoking in his very curious and uneasylooking easychair that he had at first begged and entreated him jack to stay and take command of his warriors and had followed up his entreaties with a hint that it was just possible he might adopt stronger measures if entreaty failed  to this jack replied in a long speech in which he pointed out the impossibility of our complying with the kings request under present circumstances and the absolute necessity of our returning at some period or other to our native land to tell our people of the wonders we had seen in the great country of king jambai  observing that his arguments did not make much impression on the king he brought up his reserve force to the attack and offered all the remainder of our goods as a free gift to his majesty stipulating only that he the king should in consideration thereof carefully send our boxes of specimens down to the coast where the messengers on arriving should be handsomely paid if everything should arrive safely and in good order  these liberal offers had a visible influence on the sable monarch whose pipe indicated the state of his mind pretty clearlythin wreaths of smoke issuing therefrom when he did not sympathise with jacks reasoning and thick voluminous clouds revolving about his woolly head and involving him as it were in a veil of gauze when he became pleasantly impressed  when jack made mention of the valuable gifts above referred to his head and shoulders were indistinctly visible amid the white cloudlets and when he further offered to supply him with a few hundreds of the magical paper balls that had so effectually defeated his enemies the day before the upper part of his person was obliterated altogether in smoke  this last offer of jacks we deemed a great stroke of politic wisdom for thereby he secured that the pending war should be marked by the shedding of less blood than is normal in such cases  he endeavoured further to secure this end by assuring the king that the balls would be useless for the purpose for which they were made if any other substance should be put into the gun along with them and that they would only accomplish the great end of putting the enemy to flight if fired at them in one tremendous volley at a time when the foe had no idea of the presence of an enemy  all things being thus amicably arranged we retired to rest and slept soundly until daybreak when we were awakened by the busy sounds of preparation in the village for the intended pursuit  we too made active arrangements for a start and soon after were trooping over the plains and through the jungle in the rear of king jambais army laden with such things as we required for our journey to the coast and jack besides his proportion of our food bedding cooking utensils etcetera carrying njamies little sick boy on his broad shoulders    chapter twenty two  we meet with a ludicrously awful adventure  the day following that on which we set out from king jambais village as narrated in the last chapter jack peterkin makarooroo njamies little boy and i embarked in a small canoe and bidding adieu to our hospitable friends set out on our return journey to the coast  we determined to proceed thither by another branch of the river which would take us through a totally new and in some respects different country from that in which we had already travelled and which in the course of a few weeks would carry us again into the neighbourhood of the gorilla country  one beautiful afternoon about a week after parting from our friends we met with an adventure in which the serious and the comic were strangely mingled  feeling somewhat fatigued after a long spell at our paddles and being anxious to procure a monkey or a deer as we had run short of food we put ashore and made our encampment on the banks of the river this done we each sallied out in different directions leaving makarooroo in charge of the camp  for some time i wandered about the woods in quest of game but although i fired at many animals that were good for food i missed them all and was unwillingly compelled to return emptyhanded  on my way back and while yet several miles distant from the camp i met jack who had several fat birds of the grouse species hanging at his girdle  i am glad to see that you have been more successful than i jack said i as we met  yet i have not much to boast of he replied  it is to be hoped that peterkin has had better luck  have you seen him  no i have not even heard him fire a shot  well let us go on  doubtless he will make his appearance in good time  what say you to following the course of this brook  i have no doubt it will guide us to the vicinity of our camp and the ground immediately to the left of it seems pretty clear of jungle  agreed said i and for the next ten minutes or so we walked beside each other in silence  suddenly our footsteps were arrested by a low peculiar noise  hark is that a human voice whispered jack as he cocked his rifle  it sounds like it said i  at the same moment we heard some branches in an opposite direction crack as if they had been broken by a heavy tread  immediately after the first sound became louder and more distinct  jack looked at me in surprise and gradually a peculiar smile overspread his face  its peterkin said i in a low whisper  my companion nodded and halfcocking our pieces we advanced with slow and cautious steps towards the spot whence the sound had come  the gurgling noise of the brook prevented us from hearing as well as usual so it was not until we were close upon the bushes that fringed the banks of the streamlet that we clearly discerned the tones of peterkins voice in conversation with some one who however seemed to make no reply to his remarks  at first i thought he must be talking to himself but in this i was mistaken  lets listen for a minute or two whispered my companion with a broad grin  i nodded assent and advancing cautiously we peeped over the bushes the sight that met our eyes was so irresistibly comic that we could scarcely restrain our laughter  on a soft grassy spot close to the warbling stream lay our friend peterkin on his breast resting on his elbows and the forefinger of his right hand raised  before him not more than six inches from his nose sat the most gigantic frog i ever beheld looking inordinately fat and intensely stupid  my memory instantly flew back to the scene on the coral island where jack and i had caught our friend holding a quiet conversation with the old cat and i laughed internally as i thought on the proverb the boy is the father of the man  frog said peterkin in a low earnest voice at the same time shaking his finger slowly and fixing his eyes on the plethoric creature before himfrog you may believe it or not as you please but i do solemnly assure you that i never did behold such a great big fat monster as you are in allmylife  what do you mean by it  as the frog made no reply to this question but merely kept up an incessant puffing motion in its throat peterkin continued  now frog answer me this one questionand mind that you dont tell liesyou may not be aware of it but you cant plead ignorance for i now tell you that it is exceedingly wicked to tell lies whether you be a frog or only a boy  now tell me did you ever read aesops fables  the frog continued to puff but otherwise took no notice of its questioner  i could not help fancying that it was beginning to look sulky at being thus catechised  what you wont speak  well ill answer for you you have not read aesops fables if you had you would not go on blowing yourself up in that way  im only a little man its truemores the pitybut if you imagine that by blowing and puffing like that you can ever come to blow up as big as me youll find yourself mistaken  you cant do it so you neednt try  youll only give yourself rheumatism  now will you stop  if you wont stop youll burstthere  peterkin paused here and for some time continued to gaze intently in the face of his new friend  presently he began again  frog what are you thinking of  do you ever think  i dont believe you do  tightened up as you seem to be with wind or fat or conceit if you were to attempt to think the effort would crack your skin so youd better not try  but after all youve some good points about you  if it were not that you would become vain i would tell you that youve got a very good pair of bright eyes and a pretty mottled skin and that youre at least the size of a big chickennot a plucked but a fullfledged chicken  but o frog youve got a horribly ugly big mouth and youre too fata great deal too fat for elegance though i have no doubt its comfortable  most fat people are comfortable  oh you would would you  this last exclamation was caused by the frog making a lazy leap to one side tumbling heavily over on its back and rolling clumsily on to its legs again as if it wished to escape from its tormentor but had scarcely vigour enough to make the effort  peterkin quietly lifted it up and placed it deliberately before him again in the same attitude as before  dont try that again old boy said he shaking his finger threateningly and frowning severely else ill be obliged to give you a poke in the nose  i wonder now frog if you ever had a mother or if you only grew out of the earth like a plant  tell me were you ever dandled in a mothers arms  do you know anything of maternal affection eh  humph  i suspect not  you would not look so besottedly stupid if you did  i tell you what it is old fellow youre uncommonly bad company and ive a good mind to ram my knife through you and carry you into camp to my friend ralph rover wholl skin and stuff you to such an extent that your own mother wouldnt know you and carry you to england and place you in a museum under a glass case to be gazed at by nurses and stared at by children and philosophised about by learned professors  hollo none o that now  come poor beast i didnt mean to frighten you  there sit still and dont oblige me to stick you up again and ill not take you to ralph  the poor frog which had made another attempt to escape gazed vacantly at peterkin again without moving except in regard to the puffing before referred to  now frog ill have to bid you good afternoon  im sorry that time and circumstance necessitate our separation but im glad that i have had the pleasure of meeting with you  glad and sorry frog in the same breath  did you ever philosophise on that point eh  is it possible think you to be glad and sorry at one and the same moment  no doubt a creature like you with such a very small intellect if indeed you have any at all will say that it is not possible  but i know better  why what do you call hysterics  aint that laughing and crying at once sorrow and joy mixed  i dont believe you understand a word that i say you great puffing blockhead what are you staring at  the frog as before refused to make any reply so our friend lay for some time chuckling and making faces at it  while thus engaged he happened to look up and to our surprise as well as alarm we observed that he suddenly turned as pale as death  to cock our rifles and take a step forward so as to obtain a view in the direction in which he was gazing with a fixed and horrified stare was our immediate impulse  the object that met our eyes on clearing the bushes was indeed well calculated to strike terror into the stoutest heart for there not three yards distant from the spot on which our friend lay and partially concealed by foliage stood a large black rhinoceros  it seemed to have just approached at that moment and had been suddenly arrested if not surprised by the vision of peterkin and the frog  there was something inexpressibly horrible in the sight of the great block of a head with its mischievouslooking eyes ungainly snout and ponderous horn in such close proximity to our friend  how it had got so near without its heavy tread being heard i cannot tell unless it were that the noise of the turbulent brook had drowned the sound  but we had no time either for speculation or contemplation  both jack and i instantly took aimhe at the shoulder as he afterwards told me i at the monsters eye into which with i am bound to confess my usual precipitancy i discharged both barrels  the report seemed to have the effect of arousing peterkin out of his state of fascination for he sprang up and darted towards us  at the same instant the wounded rhinoceros crossed the spot which he had left with a terrific rush and bursting through the bushes as if it had been a great rock falling from a mountain cliff went headlong into the rivulet  without moving from the spot on which we stood we recharged our pieces with a degree of celerity that i am persuaded we never before equalled  peterkin at the same time caught up his rifle which leaned against a tree hard by and only a few seconds elapsed after the fall of the monster into the river ere we were upon its banks ready for another shot  the portion of the bank of the stream at this spot happened to be rather steep so that the rhinoceros on regaining his feet experienced considerable difficulty in the attempts to clamber out which he made repeatedly and violently on seeing us emerge from among the bushes  let us separate said jack it will distract his attention  stay you have blown out his eye ralph i do believe said peterkin  on drawing near to the struggling monster we observed that this was really the case  blood streamed from the eye into which i had fired and poured down his hideous jaws dyeing the water in which he floundered  look out cried jack springing to the right in order to get on the animals blind side as it succeeded in effecting a landing  peterkin instantly sprang in the same direction while i bounded to the opposite side  i have never been able satisfactorily to decide in my own mind whether this act on my part was performed in consequence of a sudden almost involuntary idea that by so doing i should help to distract the creatures attention or was the result merely of an accidental impulse  but whatever the cause the effect was most fortunate for the rhinoceros at once turned towards me and thus being blind in the other eye lost sight of jack and peterkin who with the rapidity almost of thought leaped close up to its side and took close aim at the most vulnerable parts of its body  as they were directly opposite to me i felt that i ran some risk of receiving their fire but before i had time either to reflect that they could not possibly miss so large an object at so short a distance or to get out of the way the report of both their heavy rifles rang through the forest and the rhinoceros fell dead almost at my feet  hurrah shouted peterkin throwing his cap into the air at this happy consummation and sitting down on the haunch of our victim  shame on you peterkin said i as i reloaded his rifle for himshame on you to crow thus over a fallen foe  ha boy its all very well for you to say that now but you know well enough that you would rather have lost your ears than have missed such a chance as this  but i say itll puzzle you to stuff that fellow wont it  no doubt of it answered jack as he drew a percussion cap from his pouch and placed it carefully on the nipple of his rifle  ralph will not find it easy and its a pity too not to take it home with us for under a glass case it would make such a pretty and appropriate pendant in his museum to that interesting frog with which you  oh you sneaking eavesdropper cried peterkin laughing  it is really too bad that a fellow cant have a little teteatete with a friend but you and ralph must be thrusting your impertinent noses in the way  not to mention the rhinoceros observed jack  ah to be surethe rhinoceros yes i might have expected to find you in such low company for birds of a feather you know are said to flock together  if there be any truth in that said i you are bound on the same ground to identify yourself with the frog  by the way cried peterkin starting up and looking around the spot on which his interesting teteatete had taken place where is the frog it was just here thatahohoh poor poor frog    your course is run your days are oer   well never have a chat no more  as shakespeare has it  well well who would have thought that so conversable and intelligent a creature should have come to such a melancholy end  the poor frog had indeed come to a sad and sudden end and i felt quite sorry for it although i could not help smiling at my companions quaint manner of announcing the fact  not being gifted with the activity of peterkin it had stood its ground when the rhinoceros charged and had received an accidental kick from the great foot of that animal which had broken its back and killed it outright  theres one comfort however observed jack as we stood over the frogs body you have been saved the disagreeable necessity of killing it yourself ralph  this was true and i was not sorry that the rhinoceros had done me this service for to say truth i have ever felt the necessity of killing animals in cold blood to be one of the few disagreeable points in the otherwise delightful life of a naturalist  to shoot animals in the heat and excitement of the chase i have never felt to be particularly repulsive or difficult but the spearing of an insect or the deliberate killing of an unresisting frog are duties which i have ever performed with a feeling of deep selfabhorrence  carefully packing my frog in leaves and placing it in my pouch i turned with my companions to quit the scene of our late encounter and return to our camp on arriving at which we purposed sending back makarooroo to cut off the horn of the rhinoceros for we agreed that as it was impossible to carry away the entire carcass we ought at least to secure the horn as a memorial of our adventure    chapter twenty three  we see strange things and give our negro friends the slip  during the two following days we passed through a country that was more thickly covered with the indiarubber vine than any place we had before met with in our african travels  i could not help feeling regret that such a splendid region should be almost if not altogether unknown and useless to civilised man  there seemed to be an unlimited supply of caoutchouc but the natives practised a method of gathering it which had the effect of destroying the vine  one day some weeks after this we came upon the habitation of a most remarkable species of monkey named the nshiego mbouve which we had often heard of but had not up to that time been so fortunate as to see being exceedingly anxious to observe how this remarkable creature made use of its singular house peterkin and i lay down near the place and secreting ourselves in the bushes patiently awaited the arrival of the monkey while jack went off in another direction to procure something for supper  i dont believe hell come home tonight said peterkin after we had lain down  people never do come in when any one chances to be waiting for them  the human race seems to be born to disappointment  did you never notice ralph how obstinately contrary and crossgrained things go when you want them to go otherwise  i dont quite understand you said i  of course you dont  yours seems to be a mind that can never take anything in unless it is hammered in by repetition  come now peterkin dont become yourself an illustration of your own remark in reference to crossgrained things  well i wont  but seriously ralph have you not observed in the course of your observant life that when you have particular business with a man and go to his house or office you are certain to find him out to use the common phrase  it would be more correct however to say you are certain not to find him in  you are uncommonly particular peterkin  truly i had need to be so with such an uncommonly stupid audience  thank you  well  well have you never observed that if you have occasion to call at a house where you have never been before the number of that particular house is not in its usual place and you find it after a search quite away from where it ought to be  has it never struck you that when you take out your umbrella the day is certain to become hot and sunny while if you omit to carry it with you it is sure to rain  from all of which you conclude said i that the nshiego will not come home tonight  exactly so that is my meaning precisely  after peterkin said this we relapsed into silence and it was well that we did so for had we continued our conversation even in the whispering tones in which it had up to that time been conducted we should have frightened away the ape which now came as it were to rebuke peterkin for his unbelief  coming quickly forward the nshiego mbouve chambered quickly up the tree where its nest was built  this nest was not a structure into which it clambered but a shelter or canopy formed of boughs with their leaves somewhat in shape like an umbrella under which it sat  the construction of this shelter exhibited a good deal of intelligent ingenuity on the part of the ape for it was tied to the tree by means of wild vines and creepers and formed a neat comfortable roof that was quite capable of shedding the night dews or heavy rains and thus protecting its occupant  we were greatly amused by the manner in which the creature proceeded to make itself comfortable  just below the canopy was a small branch which jutted out horizontally from the stem of the tree  on this branch the ape seated itself its feet and haunches resting thereon  then it threw one arm round the tree and hugging that lovingly to its side gave what appeared to me to be a small sigh of satisfaction and prepared to go to sleep  at this peterkin chuckled audibly  the nshiegos eyes opened at once i cocked my gun and took aim  the desire to procure a specimen was very strong within me but an unconquerable aversion to kill an animal in such cozy circumstances restrained me  the nshiego got up in alarm  i pointed the gun but could not fire  it began to descend  i pulled the trigger and i am happy to add missed my aim altogether to the intense delight of peterkin who filled the woods with laughter while the nshiego mbouve dropping to the ground ran shrieking from the spot  my forbearance at this time was afterwards repaid by my obtaining two much finer specimens of this shelterbuilding ape both of which were killed by peterkin  on quitting this place we had a narrow escape the recollection of which still fills me with horror  we were walking rapidly back towards our encampment chatting as we went when peterkin suddenly put his foot on what appeared to be the dead branch of a tree  no sooner had he done so than the curling folds of a black snake fully ten feet long scattered the dry leaves into the air and caused us both to dart aside with a yell of terror  i have thought that in the complicated and wonderful mechanism of man there lies a species of almost involuntary muscular power which enables him to act in all cases of sudden danger with a degree of prompt celerity that he could not possibly call forth by a direct act of volition  at all events on the present emergency without in the least degree knowing what i was about i brought my gun from my shoulder into a horizontal position and blew the snakes head off almost in an instant  i have pondered this subject and from the fact that while at one time a man may be prompt and courageous in case of sudden danger at another time the same man may become panicstricken and helpless i have come to the conclusion that the allwise creator would teach useven the bravest among usthe lesson of our dependence upon each other as well as our dependence upon himself and would have us know that while at one time we may prove a tower of strength and protection to our friends at another time our friends may have to afford succour and protection to us  i have often wondered in reference to this that many men seem to take pride in bold independence when it is an obvious fact that every man is dependent on his fellow and that this mutual dependence is one of the chief sources of human happiness  the black snake which i had killed turned out to be one of a very venomous kind whose bite is said to be fatal so that we had good cause to be thankful and to congratulate ourselves on our escape  in this region of africa we were particularly fortunate in what we saw and encountered as the narrative of our experiences on the day following the above incidents will show  we had scarcely advanced a few miles on our journey on the morning of that day when we came upon a part of the country where the natives had constructed a curious sort of trap for catching wild animals and it happened that a large band of natives were on the point of setting out for a grand hunt at that time  we were greeted with immense delight on our arrival for those natives we soon discovered had already heard of our exploits in the lands of the gorilla and regarded us as the greatest hunters that had ever been born  after a short conversation with the chief through the medium of makarooroo we arranged to rest there a day and accompany them on their hunting expedition and the better to secure their good will we presented some of the head men with a few of the beads which we still possessed  then hauling our canoe out of the water we prepared ourselves for the chase  after a long and tedious march through somewhat dense jungle we came upon the ground which was partly open partly clothed with trees and shrubs  here the natives who numbered several hundreds spread themselves out in a long semicircular line in order to drive the game into the trap  as we followed them or rather formed part of the line i overheard the following conversation between peterkin and makarooroo who chanced to be together  now mak said the former examining the caps of his rifle explain to me what sort of trap this is that were coming to and what sort of brutes we may expect to find in it  de trap massa replied our faithful follower drawing the back of his hand across his mouthde trap am be call hopo  called whato inquired peterkin  hopo  oh go on  an hims be made ob great number oh sticks tumble downan hole at de end ob dat an de beasties dat goes in be zebros elosphants eelands bufflos gaffs nocrices noos an great more noders ob which me forgit de names  oh you forgit de names do you  yis massa  ah it wouldnt be a great loss mak if you were to forget the names of those you remember  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the appearance of a buffalo which showed that we were drawing near to the scene of action but as makarooroos description is not remarkable for lucidity i may explain here that the hopo or trap consists of two parts one part may be termed the conducting hedges the other the pit at their termination and into which the game is driven  the conducting hedges are formed in the shape of the letter v  at the narrow extremity there is a narrow lane at the end of which is the terminating pit  this pit is about eight feet deep and fifteen feet broad and its edges are made to overlap in such a way that once the animals are in it they have no chance whatever of getting out again  the surface of the pit is concealed by a thin crust of green rushes and the hedges are sometimes a mile long and nearly the same width apart at the outer extremities  we were still a considerable distance from the outer ends of the hedges when the natives spread out as above described and i am convinced that our line extended over at least four miles of ground  the circle of course narrowed as they advanced shouting wildly in order to drive the game into the enclosure  that the country was teeming with game soon became apparent for ever and anon as we advanced a herd of gnus or buffaloes or hartbeests would dart affrighted from their cover and sweep over the open ground into another place of shelter out of which they were again driven as the line advanced  in the course of half an hour we drove out hartbeests zebras gnus buffaloes giraffes rhinoceroses and many other kinds of smaller game either singly or in herds  now lads said jack approaching peterkin and me as we walked together it is quite evident that if we wish to see this sport in perfection we must get outside the hedge and run along towards the pit for there in the natural course of things we may expect the grand climax  what say you  shall we go  agreed said i  ditto cried peterkin  so without more words we turned aside followed by makarooroo leaped the hedge and running down along it soon reached the edge of the pit  here we found a number of the natives assembled with spears looking eagerly through the interstices of the hedges in expectation of the advancing herds  we took up our stand on a convenient spot and prepared to wait patiently  but our patience was not severely tried we had not been more than five minutes stationed when the noise of the closing line was heard and a herd of buffaloes dashed wildly out from a small piece of jungle in which they had sought shelter and galloped over the plain towards us  suddenly they halted and stood for a moment snuffing the air as if uncertain what to do while we could see even at that distance that every muscle of their bodies trembled with mingled rage and terror  before they could decide a herd of gnus burst from the same place and presently a dozen zebras galloped out tossing up their heels and heads in magnificent indignation  these last scattered and approached the hedges which caused several natives to dart into the enclosure who from beneath the shelter of oval shields as large as themselves threw their spears with unerring certainty into the sides of the terrified creatures  at this moment there was a general rush from the scattered groups of trees and clumps of jungle for the animals were now maddened with terror not only at the shouts of their human persecutors but at their own wild cries and the increasing thunder of their tread  the shouting and tumult now became excessive  it was almost bewildering  i looked round upon the faces of the negroes nearest to me  they seemed to be almost insane with suppressed excitement and their dark faces worked in a manner that was quite awful to witness  presently there was a general and indiscriminate rush of all kinds of wild animals towards the narrow end of the hopo  the natives pressed in upon them with wild cries  spears flew in all directions  ere long the plain was covered with wounded animals struggling and bellowing in their deathagonies  as the rushing multitude drew nearer to the fatal pit they became crowded together and now the men near us began to play their part  look out jack  i cried as a buffalo bull with glaring eyes and foaming jaws made a desperate effort to leap over the barrier in our very faces  jack raised his rifle and fired at the same instant a spear was sent into the buffalos breast and it fell back to form a stumblingblock in the way of the rushing mass  the report of the rifle caused the whole herd to swerve from our side so violently that they bore down the other side until i began to fear the hedge would give way altogether but they were met by the spears and the furious yells of the natives there and again swept on towards the narrow lane  and now the head of the bellowing mass came to the edge of the pit those in front seemed to suspect danger for they halted suddenly but the rush of those behind forced them on  in another moment the thin covering gave way and a literal cataract of huge living creatures went surging down into the abyss  the scene that followed was terrible to witness and i could not regard it with other than feelings of intense horror despite my knowledge of the fact that a large tribe of natives depended on the game then slain for their necessary food  the maddened animals attempted to leap out of the pit but the overlapping edges already referred to effectually prevented this until the falling torrent filled it up then some of them succeeded in leaping out from off the backs of their smothered comrades these however were quickly met and speared by the natives while ever and anon the great mass was upheaved by the frantic struggles of some gigantic creature that was being smothered at the bottom  while this scene of wholesale destruction was going on makarooroo came up to me and begged me with mysterious looks to follow him out of the crowd  i obeyed and when we had got away from the immediate neighbourhood of the turmoil i saidwell mak whats wrong  de chief massa hims tell me few moments ago dat canoe wid mbango and oomans hab pass dis way tomorrow  tomorrow  i exclaimed  no me forgit hab pass yistumday  indeed  yis an de chief hims say hims want us to stop wid him and go hunt for week or two  praps he no let us go way  thats just possible mak  have you told jack  no massa  then go bring him and peterkin hither at once  in a few minutes my companions were with me and we held a brief earnest consultation as to what we should do  i think we should tell the chief we are anxious to be off at once and leave him on good terms said i  peterkin objected to this  no said he we cannot easily explain why we are anxious to be off so hastily  i counsel flight  they wont find out that we are gone until it is too late to follow  jack agreed with this view so of course i gave in though i could not in my heart approve of such a method of sneaking away  but our guide seemed also to be exceedingly anxious to be off so we decided and slipping quietly away under the shelter of the hedge while the natives were still busy with their bloody work we soon gained the forest  here we had no difficulty in retracing our steps to the village where having picked up our little companion njamies son who had been left to play with the little boys of the place we embarked swept down the stream and were soon far beyond the chance of pursuit    chapter twenty four  a long chase and a happy termination thereof  knowing that unless we advanced with more than ordinary speed we could not hope to overtake our friends for several daysa stern chase being proverbially a long onewe travelled a great part of the night as well as all day and on our third day after quitting the scene of the curious hunt described in the last chapter we descried the fugitives descending the river about a quarter of a mile ahead of us  unhappily we made a stupid mistake at this time  instead of waiting until we were near enough to be recognised we shouted to our friends the moment we saw their canoe  i cannot say that we knew them to be our friends but we had every reason to suppose so  the result of our shout was that they supposed us to be enemies and paddled away as if for their lives  it was in vain that we tried to show by signs that we were not enemies  yell cried peterkin turning to makarooroo who sat close behind him  our guide opened his huge mouth and gave utterance to a yell that might well have struck terror into the heart of mars himself  stop stay cried peterkin hastily  i didnt mean a waryell i meant a yell ofof peace  me no hab a yell ob peace said makarooroo with a look of perplexity  i should not suppose you had observed jack with a quiet laugh as he dipped his paddle more energetically than ever into the streamthe fact is peterkin that we shall have to go in for a long chase  there is no doubt about it  i see that there are at least four men in their canoe and if one of them is mbango as we have reason to believe a stout and expert arm guides them  but ho give way never venture never win  with that we all plied our paddles with our utmost might  the chase soon became very exciting  ere long it became evident that the crews of the two canoes were pretty equally matched for we did not apparently diminish the distance between us by a single inch during the next halfhour  what if it turns out not to be mbango and his party after all suggested peterkin who wielded his light paddle with admirable effect  jack who sat in the bow replied that in that case we should have to make the best apology and explanation we could to the niggers and console ourselves with the consciousness of having done our best  for some time the rapid dip of our paddles and the rush of our canoe through the water were the only sounds that were heard  then peterkin spoke again  he could never keep silence for any great length of time  i say jack well never do it  if we had only another man or even a boy  peterkin glanced at njamies little son who lay sound asleep at the bottom of the boat no he wont do we might as well ask a mosquito to help us  i say lads isnt one of the crew of that canoe a woman said jack looking over his shoulder but not ceasing for an instant to ply his paddle  cant tell answered peterkinwhat say you mak  yeis massa replied the guide with some hesitation  me tink dat am be one oomans arm what wag de paddil  oh yis me sartin sure now dat am a ooman  that being the case observed jack in a tone of satisfaction the chase wont last much longer for a womans muscles cant hold out long at such a pace  ho give way once more  in less than five minutes the truth of jacks remark became apparent for we began rapidly to overhaul the fugitives  this result acted with a double effect while it inspirited us to additional exertion it depressed those whom we were pursuing and so rendered them less capable than before of contending with us  there was evidently a good deal of excitement and gesticulation among them  suddenly the man in the stern laid down his paddle and stooping down seized a gun with which turning round he took deliberate aim at us  thats rather awkward observed jack in a cool quiet way as if the awkwardness of the case had no reference whatever to him personally  we did not however check our advance  the man fired and the ball came skipping over the water and passed us at a distance of about two yards  hum  i expected as much observed jack  when a bad shot points a bad gun at you your best plan is to stand still and take your chance in such a case the chance is not a bad one  hollo the rascal seems about to try it again  i say boys we must stop this  we had now gained so much on the fugitives that we had reason to hope that we might by signs enable them to understand that we were not enemies  we had to make the attempt rather abruptly for as jack uttered his last remark the man in the stern of the canoe we were chasing having reloaded his gun turned round to aim at us again  at the same time the rest of the crew suddenly ceased to paddle in order to enable their comrade to take a steady aim  it was evident that they rested all their hopes upon that shot disabling one of our number and so enabling them to escape  seeing this makarooroo in desperation seized his rifle and levelled it  no no said peterkin hastily holding up his hand  give me your rifle mak and yours ralph  now then stop paddling for a moment ill try an experiment  so saying he sprang to his feet and grasping a rifle in each hand held them high above his head intending thus to show that we were wellarmed but that we did not intend to use our weapons  the device was happily successful the man in the other canoe lowered the gun with which he was in the act of taking aim at us  now boys paddle slowly towards the bank cried peterkin laying down the rifles quickly and standing erect again with his empty hands extended in the air to confirm the fugitives in regard to our good intentions  they understood the sign and also turned toward the bank where in a few minutes both parties landed at the distance of about two hundred yards from each other  mak you had better advance alone said jack  if it is mbango and his friends they will know you at once  dont carry your rifle you wont need it  nay jack i interposed you do not act with your usual caution should it chance not to be mbango it were well that mak should have his rifle and a companion to support him  o most sapient ralph said peterkin dont you know that jack and i have nothing to do but sit down on this bank each with a doublebarrel in his hand and if anything like foul play should be attempted four of the enemy should infallibly bite the dust at the same time  but youd better go with mak since youre so careful of him  we will engage to defend you bothhollo puggy take the line of our canoe here and fasten it to yonder bush  the latter part of this remark was addressed to njamies little boy whose name we had never learned and who had been called puggy by peterkinnot let me remark in anything approaching to a contemptuous spirit  he evidently meant it as a title of endearment  we had tacitly accepted it and so had the lad who for some time past had answered to the name of puggy in utter ignorance of course as to its signification  mak and i now advanced unarmed towards the negroes and in a few seconds we mutually recognised each other  i was overjoyed to observe the wellknown face of okandaga who no sooner recognised her lover than she uttered a joyful shout and ran towards him  i at the same time advanced to mbango and grasping his hand shook it warmly but that goodhearted chief was not satisfied with such a tame expression of good will seizing me by the shoulders he put forward his great flat nose and rubbed mine heartily therewith  my first impulse was to draw back but fortunately my better judgment came to my aid in time and prevented me from running the risk of hurting the feelings of our black friend  and i had at that time lived long enough to know that there is nothing that sinks so bitterly into the human heart as the repulse however slightly of a voluntary demonstration of affection  i had made up my mind that if the dirtiest negro in all africa should offer to rub noses with me i would shut my eyes and submit  i observed among the crew of mbangos canoe a female figure who instantly attracted my attention and awakened my sympathy  she was seated on a rock paying no attention whatever to the events that were occurring so near to her and which for aught she could tell might be to her matter of life or death  her hands hung idly by her side her body was bowed forward her head drooped on her breast and her whole appearance indicated a depth of woe such as i have never before seen equalled  i pointed to her and looked at mbango in surprise  he looked first at the woman and then at me and shook his head mournfully but being unable to speak to me or i to him of course i could not gather much from his looks  i was about to turn to our guide when the woman raised her head a little so that her face was exposed  i at once recognised the features of njamie mbangos favourite wife and i was now at no loss to divine the cause of her grief  starting up in haste i ran away back at full speed towards the spot where our canoe lay  jack and peterkin seeing how matters stood were by that time advancing to meet us and the little boy followed  i passed them without uttering a word seized the boy by the wrist and dragged him somewhat violently towards the place where his mother sat  hollo ralph shouted peterkin as i passed see that you dont damage my puggy else youll have to  i heard no more  the next instant i stood beside njamie and placed her boy before her  i have never in my life witnessed such a mingling of intense eagerness surprise and joy as was expressed by the poor woman when her eyes fell on the face of her child  for one moment she gazed at him and the expressions i have referred to flitted or rather flashed across her dusky countenance then giving utterance to a piercing shriek she sprang forward and clasped her son to her bosom  i would not have missed that sight for the world  i know not very well what my thoughts were at the time but the memory of that scene has often since in my musings filled me with inexpressible gladness and in pondering the subject i have felt that the witnessing of that meeting has given additional force to the line in scripture wherein the word love alone is deemed sufficiently comprehensive to describe the whole character of the almighty  here on the one hand i beheld unutterable indescribable woe on the other hand unutterable inconceivable joyboth i should suppose in their extremest degree and both resulting from pure and simple love i pondered this much at the time i have pondered it often since  it is a subject of study which i recommend to all who chance to read this page    chapter twenty five  i have a desperate encounter and a narrow escape  the happiness that now beamed in the faces of makarooroo okandaga and njamie was a sufficient reward to us for all the trouble we had taken and all the risk we had run on their account  poor njamie was exceedingly grateful to us  she sought by every means in her power to show this and among other things hearing us call her son by the name of puggy she at once adopted it to the immense amusement and delight of peterkin  after the first excitement of our meeting had subsided somewhat we consulted together as to what we should now do  on the one hand we were unwilling to quit the scene of our hunting triumphs and adventures on the other hand makarooroo and his bride were anxious to reach the mission stations on the coast and get married in the christian manner  our opposing interests are indeed a little perplexing said jack after some conversation had passed on the subjectno doubt mak you and mbango with his friends might reach the coast safely enough without us but then what should we do without an interpreter  our poor guide whose troubles seemed as though they would never end sighed deeply and glanced at his bride with a melancholy countenance as he replied  mell go wid you massa an okandagall go to coast an wait dere for me come  ha ejaculated peterkin thats all very well mak but youll do nothing of the sort  that plan wont do so well have to try again  i agree with you peterkin observed jack  that plan certainly will not do but i cannot think of any other that will so we must just exercise a little selfdenial for once give up all further attacks on the wild beasts of africa and accompany mak to the coast  could we not manage a compromise said i  what be a cumprumoise asked makarooroo who had been glancing anxiously from one to the other as we conversed  peterkin laid hold of his chin pursed up his mouth and looked at me with a gleeful leer  theres a chance for you ralph said he why dont you explain  because its not easy to explain said i considering the best way in which to convey the meaning of such a worda compromise mak isis a bargain a compactat least so johnson puts it  yes interposed peterkin so you see mak when you agree with a trader to get him an elephanttusk thats a cumprumoise according to johnson  no no mak said i quickly peterkin is talking nonsense  it is not a bargain of that kind its aayou know every question has two sides  yis massa  well suppose you took one side  yis  and suppose i took the other side  then suppose we were to agree to forsake our respective sides and meet as it were halfway and thus hold the same middle course  ay down the middle and up again thats it mak again interrupted peterkinthats a cumprumoise  in short to put it in another and a clearer light suppose that i were to resolve to hit you an awful whack on one side of your head and suppose that ralph were to determine to hit you a frightful bang on the other side then suppose that we were to agree to give up those amiable intentions and instead thereof to give you unitedly one tremendous smash on the place where if you had one the bridge of your nose would bethat would be a cumprumoise  ho ha ha hi shouted our guide rolling over on the grass and splitting himself with laughter for makarooroo like the most of his race was excessively fond of a joke no matter how bad and was always ready on the shortest notice to go off into fits of laughter if he had only the remotest idea of what the jest meant  he had become so accustomed at last to expect something jocular from peterkin that he almost invariably opened his mouth to be ready whenever he observed our friend make any demonstration that gave indication of his being about to speak  from the mere force of sympathy mbango began to laugh also and i know not how long the two would have gone on had not jack checked them by saying  i suspect we are not very well fitted to instruct the unenlightened mind hohi sighed makarooroo gathering himself up and settling down to listen and it seems to me that youll have to try again peterkin some other mode of explanation  very good by all means said our friendnow mak look here  you want to go there pointing to the coast with his left hand and we want to go there pointing to the interior with his right hand  now if we both agree to go there pointing straight before him with his nose that will be a cumprumoise  dye understand  ho yis massa me compiperhend now  exactly so said i thats just it  there is a branch of this river that takes a great bend away to the north before it turns towards the sea is there not  i think i have heard yourself say so before now  yis massa hall right  well let us go by that branch  we shall be a good deal longer on the route but we shall be always nearing the end of our journey and at the same time shall pass through a good deal of new country in which we may hope to see much game  good said jack you have wisdom with you for once ralphit seems feasiblewhat say you mak  i think it a capital plan  yis massa it am a copitle plan sure nuff  the plan being thus arranged and agreed to we set about the execution of it at once and ere long our two canoes were floating side by side down the smooth current of the river  the route which we had chosen led us as i had before suspected into the neighbourhood of the gorilla country and i was much gratified to learn from mbango who had travelled over an immense portion of southwestern africa that it was not improbable we should meet with several of those monstrous apes before finally turning off towards the coast  i say that i was much gratified to learn this but i little imagined that i was at that time hastening towards a conflict that wellnigh proved fatal to me and the bare remembrance of which still makes me shudder  it occurred several weeks after the events just related  we had gone ashore for the purpose of hunting our supply of provisions chancing at that time to be rather low  feeling a desire to wander through the woods in solitude for a short time i separated from my companions  i soon came to regret this deeply for about an hour afterwards i came upon the tracks of a gorilla  being armed only with my smallbore double rifle and not being by any means confident of my shooting powers i hesitated some time before making up my mind to follow the tracks  at first i thought of retracing my steps and acquainting my comrades with the discovery i had made but the little probability there was of my finding them within several hours deterred me  besides i felt ashamed to confess that i had been afraid to prosecute the chase alone so after pondering the matter a little i decided on advancing  before doing so however i carefully examined the caps of my rifle and loosened my long huntingknife in its sheath  then i cautiously followed up the track making as little noise as possible for i was well aware of the watchfulness of the animal i was pursuing  the footprints at first were not very distinct but ere long i came on a muddy place where they were deeply imprinted and my anxiety was somewhat increased by observing that they were uncommonly largethe largest i had ever seenand that therefore they had undoubtedly been made by one of those solitary and gigantic males which are always found to be the most savage  i had scarcely made this discovery when i came unexpectedly on the gorilla itself  it was seated at the foot of a tree about fifty yards from the spot where i stood the space between us being comparatively clear of underwood  in an instant he observed me and rose at the same time giving utterance to one of those diabolical roars which i have before referred to as being so terrible  i halted and felt an irresistible inclination to fire at once but remembering the oftrepeated warnings of my companions i restrained myself  at that moment i almost wished i freely confess that the gorilla would run away  but the monster had no such intention  again uttering his horrible roar he began slowly to advance at the same time beating his drumlike chest with his doubled fist  i now felt that my hour of trial had come  i must face the gorilla boldly and act with perfect coolness  the alternative was death  as the hideous creature came on i observed that he was considerably larger than the biggest we had yet seen but strange to say this fact made no deeper impression upon me  i suppose that my whole mental and nervous being was wound up to the utmost possible state of tension  i felt that i was steady and able to brave the onset  but i was not aware of the severity of the test to which i was destined to be subjected instead of coming quickly on and deciding my fate at once the savage animal advanced slowly sometimes a step or two at a time and then pausing for a moment ere it again advanced  sometimes it even sat down on its haunches for a second or two as if the weight of its overgrown body were too much for its hind legs but it did not cease all that time to beat its chest and roar and twist its features into the most indescribable contortions  i suppose it took nearly five minutes to advance to within twelve yards of me but those five minutes seemed to me an hour  i cannot describe the mental agony i endured  when within ten yards of me i could restrain myself no longer  i raised my rifle aimed at its chest and fired  with a terrible roar it advanced  again i fired but without effect for the gorilla rushed upon me  in despair i drew my huntingknife and launched it full at the brutes chest with all my might  i saw the glittering blade enter it as the enormous paw was raised to beat me down  i threw up my rifle to ward off the fatal blow and at the same moment sprang to one side in the hope of evading it  the stock of the rifle was shattered to pieces in an instant and the blow which would otherwise have fallen full on my head or chest was diverted slightly and took effect on my shoulder the blade of which was smashed as i was hurled with stunning violence to the ground  for one moment i felt as if i were falling headlong down a precipice the next i became unconscious  on recovering i found myself lying on my back at the bottom of what appeared to be a large pit  i must have lain there for a considerable time for i felt cold and stiff and when i attempted to move my wounded shoulder caused me unutterable anguish  i knew however that i must certainly perish if i did not exert myself so with much difficulty i crept out of the pit  the first object that met my eyes on rising to my feet was the carcass of my late antagonist which on examination i found though badly wounded by both bullets had eventually been killed by the knife  it must have died almost immediately after giving me the blow that had hurled me into the pit  i had not observed this pit owing to the screen of bushes that surrounded it but i have now no doubt that it was the means of saving my life  my recollections of what followed this terrible adventure are exceedingly confused  i remember that i wandered about in a state of dreamy uncertainty endeavouring to retrace my steps to our encampment i have a faint recollection of meeting to my surprise with jack and peterkin and of their tender expressions of sympathy and i have a very vivid remembrance of the agony i endured when jack set my broken shoulderblade and bandaged my right arm tightly to my side  after that all was a confused dream in which all the adventures i had ever had with wild beasts were enacted over again and many others besides that had never taken place at all  under the influence of fever i lay in a state of delirium for many days in the bottom of the canoe and when my unclouded consciousness was at length restored to me i found myself lying in a bed under the hospitable roof of a missionary the windows of whose house looked out upon the sea  and now reader the record of our adventures is complete  during the few weeks that i spent with the kind missionary of the cross i gained strength rapidly and amused myself penning the first chapters of this book  makarooroo and okandaga were married and soon became useful members of the christian community on that part of the african coast mbango and his friends also joined the missionary for a time but ultimately returned to the interior whither i have no doubt they carried some of the good influences that they had received on the coast along with them  king jambai proved faithful to his engagement  all our packages and boxes of specimens arrived safely at the coast and when unpacked for examination and displayed in the large schoolroom of the station the gorillas and other rare and wonderful animals besides curious plants altogether formed a magnificent collection the like of which has not yet been seen in great britain and probably never will be  when i was sufficiently restored to stand the voyage jack and peterkin and i embarked in a homewardbound trading vessel and taking leave of our kind friends of the coast and of makarooroo and okandaga who wept much at the prospect of separation from us we set sail for old england  farewell said i as we leaned over the vessels side and gazed sadly at the receding shorefarewell to you kind missionaries and faithful negro friends  ay added peterkin with a deep sigh and fareyouwell ye monstrous apes gorillas fareyouwell  the end
