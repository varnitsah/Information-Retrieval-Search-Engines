15530350	the hollytreethree branches   first branchmyself   i have kept one secret in the course of my life  i am a bashful man nobody would suppose it nobody ever does suppose it nobody ever did suppose it but i am naturally a bashful man  this is the secret which i have never breathed until now  i might greatly move the reader by some account of the innumerable places i have not been to the innumerable people i have not called upon or received the innumerable social evasions i have been guilty of solely because i am by original constitution and character a bashful man  but i will leave the reader unmoved and proceed with the object before me  that object is to give a plain account of my travels and discoveries in the hollytree inn in which place of good entertainment for man and beast i was once snowed up  it happened in the memorable year when i parted for ever from angela leath whom i was shortly to have married on making the discovery that she preferred my bosom friend  from our schooldays i had freely admitted edwin in my own mind to be far superior to myself and though i was grievously wounded at heart i felt the preference to be natural and tried to forgive them both  it was under these circumstances that i resolved to go to americaon my way to the devil  communicating my discovery neither to angela nor to edwin but resolving to write each of them an affecting letter conveying my blessing and forgiveness which the steamtender for shore should carry to the post when i myself should be bound for the new world far beyond recalli say locking up my grief in my own breast and consoling myself as i could with the prospect of being generous i quietly left all i held dear and started on the desolate journey i have mentioned  the dead wintertime was in full dreariness when i left my chambers for ever at five oclock in the morning  i had shaved by candlelight of course and was miserably cold and experienced that general allpervading sensation of getting up to be hanged which i have usually found inseparable from untimely rising under such circumstances  how well i remember the forlorn aspect of fleet street when i came out of the temple  the streetlamps flickering in the gusty northeast wind as if the very gas were contorted with cold the whitetopped houses the bleak starlighted sky the market people and other early stragglers trotting to circulate their almost frozen blood the hospitable light and warmth of the few coffeeshops and publichouses that were open for such customers the hard dry frosty rime with which the air was charged the wind had already beaten it into every crevice and which lashed my face like a steel whip  it wanted nine days to the end of the month and end of the year  the postoffice packet for the united states was to depart from liverpool weather permitting on the first of the ensuing month and i had the intervening time on my hands  i had taken this into consideration and had resolved to make a visit to a certain spot which i need not name on the farther borders of yorkshire  it was endeared to me by my having first seen angela at a farmhouse in that place and my melancholy was gratified by the idea of taking a wintry leave of it before my expatriation  i ought to explain that to avoid being sought out before my resolution should have been rendered irrevocable by being carried into full effect i had written to angela overnight in my usual manner lamenting that urgent business of which she should know all particulars byandbytook me unexpectedly away from her for a week or ten days  there was no northern railway at that time and in its place there were stagecoaches which i occasionally find myself in common with some other people affecting to lament now but which everybody dreaded as a very serious penance then  i had secured the boxseat on the fastest of these and my business in fleet street was to get into a cab with my portmanteau so to make the best of my way to the peacock at islington where i was to join this coach  but when one of our temple watchmen who carried my portmanteau into fleet street for me told me about the huge blocks of ice that had for some days past been floating in the river having closed up in the night and made a walk from the temple gardens over to the surrey shore i began to ask myself the question whether the boxseat would not be likely to put a sudden and a frosty end to my unhappiness  i was heartbroken it is true and yet i was not quite so far gone as to wish to be frozen to death  when i got up to the peacockwhere i found everybody drinking hot purl in selfpreservationi asked if there were an inside seat to spare  i then discovered that inside or out i was the only passenger  this gave me a still livelier idea of the great inclemency of the weather since that coach always loaded particularly well  however i took a little purl which i found uncommonly good and got into the coach  when i was seated they built me up with straw to the waist and conscious of making a rather ridiculous appearance i began my journey  it was still dark when we left the peacock  for a little while pale uncertain ghosts of houses and trees appeared and vanished and then it was hard black frozen day  people were lighting their fires smoke was mounting straight up high into the rarified air and we were rattling for highgate archway over the hardest ground i have ever heard the ring of iron shoes on  as we got into the country everything seemed to have grown old and gray  the roads the trees thatched roofs of cottages and homesteads the ricks in farmers yards  outdoor work was abandoned horsetroughs at roadside inns were frozen hard no stragglers lounged about doors were close shut little turnpike houses had blazing fires inside and children even turnpike people have children and seem to like them rubbed the frost from the little panes of glass with their chubby arms that their bright eyes might catch a glimpse of the solitary coach going by  i dont know when the snow begin to set in but i know that we were changing horses somewhere when i heard the guard remark that the old lady up in the sky was picking her geese pretty hard to day  then indeed i found the white down falling fast and thick  the lonely day wore on and i dozed it out as a lonely traveller does  i was warm and valiant after eating and drinkingparticularly after dinner cold and depressed at all other times  i was always bewildered as to time and place and always more or less out of my senses  the coach and horses seemed to execute in chorus auld lang syne without a moments intermission  they kept the time and tune with the greatest regularity and rose into the swell at the beginning of the refrain with a precision that worried me to death  while we changed horses the guard and coachman went stumping up and down the road printing off their shoes in the snow and poured so much liquid consolation into themselves without being any the worse for it that i began to confound them as it darkened again with two great white casks standing on end  our horses tumbled down in solitary places and we got them upwhich was the pleasantest variety i had for it warmed me  and it snowed and snowed and still it snowed and never left off snowing  all night long we went on in this manner  thus we came round the clock upon the great north road to the performance of auld lang syne by day again  and it snowed and snowed and still it snowed and never left off snowing  i forget now where we were at noon on the second day and where we ought to have been but i know that we were scores of miles behindhand and that our case was growing worse every hour  the drift was becoming prodigiously deep landmarks were getting snowed out the road and the fields were all one instead of having fences and hedgerows to guide us we went crunching on over an unbroken surface of ghastly white that might sink beneath us at any moment and drop us down a whole hillside  still the coachman and guardwho kept together on the box always in council and looking well about themmade out the track with astonishing sagacity  when we came in sight of a town it looked to my fancy like a large drawing on a slate with abundance of slatepencil expended on the churches and houses where the snow lay thickest  when we came within a town and found the church clocks all stopped the dialfaces choked with snow and the innsigns blotted out it seemed as if the whole place were overgrown with white moss  as to the coach it was a mere snowball similarly the men and boys who ran along beside us to the towns end turning our clogged wheels and encouraging our horses were men and boys of snow and the bleak wild solitude to which they at last dismissed us was a snowy sahara  one would have thought this enough notwithstanding which i pledge my word that it snowed and snowed and still it snowed and never left off snowing  we performed auld lang syne the whole day seeing nothing out of towns and villages but the track of stoats hares and foxes and sometimes of birds  at nine oclock at night on a yorkshire moor a cheerful burst from our horn and a welcome sound of talking with a glimmering and moving about of lanterns roused me from my drowsy state  i found that we were going to change  they helped me out and i said to a waiter whose bare head became as white as king lears in a single minute what inn is this  the hollytree sir said he  upon my word i believe said i apologetically to the guard and coachman that i must stop here  now the landlord and the landlady and the ostler and the postboy and all the stable authorities had already asked the coachman to the wide eyed interest of all the rest of the establishment if he meant to go on the coachman had already replied yes hed take her through itmeaning by her the coachif so be as george would stand by him george was the guard and he had already sworn that he would stand by him  so the helpers were already getting the horses out  my declaring myself beaten after this parley was not an announcement without preparation  indeed but for the way to the announcement being smoothed by the parley i more than doubt whether as an innately bashful man i should have had the confidence to make it  as it was it received the approval even of the guard and coachman  therefore with many confirmations of my inclining and many remarks from one bystander to another that the gentleman could go forard by the mail tomorrow whereas tonight he would only be froze and where was the good of a gentleman being frozeah let alone buried alive which latter clause was added by a humorous helper as a joke at my expense and was extremely well received i saw my portmanteau got out stiff like a frozen body did the handsome thing by the guard and coachman wished them goodnight and a prosperous journey and a little ashamed of myself after all for leaving them to fight it out alone followed the landlord landlady and waiter of the hollytree upstairs  i thought i had never seen such a large room as that into which they showed me  it had five windows with dark red curtains that would have absorbed the light of a general illumination and there were complications of drapery at the top of the curtains that went wandering about the wall in a most extraordinary manner  i asked for a smaller room and they told me there was no smaller room  they could screen me in however the landlord said  they brought a great old japanned screen with natives japanese i suppose engaged in a variety of idiotic pursuits all over it and left me roasting whole before an immense fire  my bedroom was some quarter of a mile off up a great staircase at the end of a long gallery and nobody knows what a misery this is to a bashful man who would rather not meet people on the stairs  it was the grimmest room i have ever had the nightmare in and all the furniture from the four posts of the bed to the two old silver candlesticks was tall highshouldered and spindlewaisted  below in my sittingroom if i looked round my screen the wind rushed at me like a mad bull if i stuck to my armchair the fire scorched me to the colour of a new brick the chimneypiece was very high and there was a bad glasswhat i may call a wavy glassabove it which when i stood up just showed me my anterior phrenological developmentsand these never look well in any subject cut short off at the eyebrow  if i stood with my back to the fire a gloomy vault of darkness above and beyond the screen insisted on being looked at and in its dim remoteness the drapery of the ten curtains of the five windows went twisting and creeping about like a nest of gigantic worms  i suppose that what i observe in myself must be observed by some other men of similar character in themselves therefore i am emboldened to mention that when i travel i never arrive at a place but i immediately want to go away from it  before i had finished my supper of broiled fowl and mulled port i had impressed upon the waiter in detail my arrangements for departure in the morning  breakfast and bill at eight fly at nine  two horses or if needful even four  tired though i was the night appeared about a week long  in cases of nightmare i thought of angela and felt more depressed than ever by the reflection that i was on the shortest road to gretna green  what had i to do with gretna green  i was not going that way to the devil but by the american route i remarked in my bitterness  in the morning i found that it was snowing still that it had snowed all night and that i was snowed up  nothing could get out of that spot on the moor or could come at it until the road had been cut out by labourers from the markettown  when they might cut their way to the hollytree nobody could tell me  it was now christmaseve  i should have had a dismal christmastime of it anywhere and consequently that did not so much matter still being snowed up was like dying of frost a thing i had not bargained for  i felt very lonely  yet i could no more have proposed to the landlord and landlady to admit me to their society though i should have liked itvery much than i could have asked them to present me with a piece of plate here my great secret the real bashfulness of my character is to be observed  like most bashful men i judge of other people as if they were bashful too  besides being far too shamefaced to make the proposal myself i really had a delicate misgiving that it would be in the last degree disconcerting to them  trying to settle down therefore in my solitude i first of all asked what books there were in the house  the waiter brought me a book of roads two or three old newspapers a little songbook terminating in a collection of toasts and sentiments a little jestbook an odd volume of peregrine pickle and the sentimental journey  i knew every word of the two last already but i read them through again then tried to hum all the songs auld lang syne was among them went entirely through the jokesin which i found a fund of melancholy adapted to my state of mind proposed all the toasts enunciated all the sentiments and mastered the papers  the latter had nothing in them but stock advertisements a meeting about a county rate and a highway robbery  as i am a greedy reader i could not make this supply hold out until night it was exhausted by teatime  being then entirely cast upon my own resources i got through an hour in considering what to do next ultimately it came into my head from which i was anxious by any means to exclude angela and edwin that i would endeavour to recall my experience of inns and would try how long it lasted me  i stirred the fire moved my chair a little to one side of the screennot daring to go far for i knew the wind was waiting to make a rush at me i could hear it growlingand began  my first impressions of an inn dated from the nursery consequently i went back to the nursery for a startingpoint and found myself at the knee of a sallow woman with a fishy eye an aquiline nose and a green gown whose specially was a dismal narrative of a landlord by the roadside whose visitors unaccountably disappeared for many years until it was discovered that the pursuit of his life had been to convert them into pies  for the better devotion of himself to this branch of industry he had constructed a secret door behind the head of the bed and when the visitor oppressed with pie had fallen asleep this wicked landlord would look softly in with a lamp in one hand and a knife in the other would cut his throat and would make him into pies for which purpose he had coppers underneath a trapdoor always boiling and rolled out his pastry in the dead of the night  yet even he was not insensible to the stings of conscience for he never went to sleep without being heard to mutter too much pepper which was eventually the cause of his being brought to justice  i had no sooner disposed of this criminal than there started up another of the same period whose profession was originally housebreaking in the pursuit of which art he had had his right ear chopped off one night as he was burglariously getting in at a window by a brave and lovely servantmaid whom the aquilinenosed woman though not at all answering the description always mysteriously implied to be herself  after several years this brave and lovely servantmaid was married to the landlord of a country inn which landlord had this remarkable characteristic that he always wore a silk nightcap and never would on any consideration take it off  at last one night when he was fast asleep the brave and lovely woman lifted up his silk nightcap on the right side and found that he had no ear there upon which she sagaciously perceived that he was the clipped housebreaker who had married her with the intention of putting her to death  she immediately heated the poker and terminated his career for which she was taken to king george upon his throne and received the compliments of royalty on her great discretion and valour  this same narrator who had a ghoulish pleasure i have long been persuaded in terrifying me to the utmost confines of my reason had another authentic anecdote within her own experience founded i now believe upon raymond and agnes or the bleeding nun  she said it happened to her brotherinlaw who was immensely richwhich my father was not and immensely tallwhich my father was not  it was always a point with this ghoul to present my clearest relations and friends to my youthful mind under circumstances of disparaging contrast  the brotherinlaw was riding once through a forest on a magnificent horse we had no magnificent horse at our house attended by a favourite and valuable newfoundland dog we had no dog when he found himself benighted and came to an inn  a dark woman opened the door and he asked her if he could have a bed there  she answered yes and put his horse in the stable and took him into a room where there were two dark men  while he was at supper a parrot in the room began to talk saying blood blood  wipe up the blood  upon which one of the dark men wrung the parrots neck and said he was fond of roasted parrots and he meant to have this one for breakfast in the morning  after eating and drinking heartily the immensely rich tall brotherinlaw went up to bed but he was rather vexed because they had shut his dog in the stable saying that they never allowed dogs in the house  he sat very quiet for more than an hour thinking and thinking when just as his candle was burning out he heard a scratch at the door he opened the door and there was the newfoundland dog  the dog came softly in smelt about him went straight to some straw in the corner which the dark men had said covered apples tore the straw away and disclosed two sheets steeped in blood  just at that moment the candle went out and the brotherinlaw looking through a chink in the door saw the two dark men stealing upstairs one armed with a dagger that long about five feet the other carrying a chopper a sack and a spade  having no remembrance of the close of this adventure i suppose my faculties to have been always so frozen with terror at this stage of it that the power of listening stagnated within me for some quarter of an hour  these barbarous stories carried me sitting there on the hollytree hearth to the roadside inn renowned in my time in a sixpenny book with a folding plate representing in a central compartment of oval form the portrait of jonathan bradford and in four corner compartments four incidents of the tragedy with which the name is associatedcoloured with a hand at once so free and economical that the bloom of jonathans complexion passed without any pause into the breeches of the ostler and smearing itself off into the next division became rum in a bottle  then i remembered how the landlord was found at the murdered travellers bedside with his own knife at his feet and blood upon his hand how he was hanged for the murder notwithstanding his protestation that he had indeed come there to kill the traveller for his saddlebags but had been stricken motionless on finding him already slain and how the ostler years afterwards owned the deed  by this time i had made myself quite uncomfortable  i stirred the fire and stood with my back to it as long as i could bear the heat looking up at the darkness beyond the screen and at the wormy curtains creeping in and creeping out like the worms in the ballad of alonzo the brave and the fair imogene  there was an inn in the cathedral town where i went to school which had pleasanter recollections about it than any of these  i took it next  it was the inn where friends used to put up and where we used to go to see parents and to have salmon and fowls and be tipped  it had an ecclesiastical signthe mitreand a bar that seemed to be the next best thing to a bishopric it was so snug  i loved the landlords youngest daughter to distractionbut let that pass  it was in this inn that i was cried over by my rosy little sister because i had acquired a black eye in a fight  and though she had been that hollytree night for many a long year where all tears are dried the mitre softened me yet  to be continued tomorrow said i when i took my candle to go to bed but my bed took it upon itself to continue the train of thought that night  it carried me away like the enchanted carpet to a distant place though still in england and there alighting from a stagecoach at another inn in the snow as i had actually done some years before i repeated in my sleep a curious experience i had really had there  more than a year before i made the journey in the course of which i put up at that inn i had lost a very near and dear friend by death  every night since at home or away from home i had dreamed of that friend sometimes as still living sometimes as returning from the world of shadows to comfort me always as being beautiful placid and happy never in association with any approach to fear or distress  it was at a lonely inn in a wide moorland place that i halted to pass the night  when i had looked from my bedroom window over the waste of snow on which the moon was shining i sat down by my fire to write a letter  i had always until that hour kept it within my own breast that i dreamed every night of the dear lost one  but in the letter that i wrote i recorded the circumstance and added that i felt much interested in proving whether the subject of my dream would still be faithful to me traveltired and in that remote place  no  i lost the beloved figure of my vision in parting with the secret  my sleep has never looked upon it since in sixteen years but once  i was in italy and awoke or seemed to awake the wellremembered voice distinctly in my ears conversing with it  i entreated it as it rose above my bed and soared up to the vaulted roof of the old room to answer me a question i had asked touching the future life  my hands were still outstretched towards it as it vanished when i heard a bell ringing by the garden wall and a voice in the deep stillness of the night calling on all good christians to pray for the souls of the dead it being all souls eve  to return to the hollytree  when i awoke next day it was freezing hard and the lowering sky threatened more snow  my breakfast cleared away i drew my chair into its former place and with the fire getting so much the better of the landscape that i sat in twilight resumed my inn remembrances  that was a good inn down in wiltshire where i put up once in the days of the hard wiltshire ale and before all beer was bitterness  it was on the skirts of salisbury plain and the midnight wind that rattled my lattice window came moaning at me from stonehenge  there was a hangeron at that establishment a supernaturally preserved druid i believe him to have been and to be still with long white hair and a flinty blue eye always looking afar off who claimed to have been a shepherd and who seemed to be ever watching for the reappearance on the verge of the horizon of some ghostly flock of sheep that had been mutton for many ages  he was a man with a weird belief in him that no one could count the stones of stonehenge twice and make the same number of them likewise that any one who counted them three times nine times and then stood in the centre and said i dare would behold a tremendous apparition and be stricken dead  he pretended to have seen a bustard i suspect him to have been familiar with the dodo in manner following he was out upon the plain at the close of a late autumn day when he dimly discerned going on before him at a curious fitfully bounding pace what he at first supposed to be a gigumbrella that had been blown from some conveyance but what he presently believed to be a lean dwarf man upon a little pony  having followed this object for some distance without gaining on it and having called to it many times without receiving any answer he pursued it for miles and miles when at length coming up with it he discovered it to be the last bustard in great britain degenerated into a wingless state and running along the ground  resolved to capture him or perish in the attempt he closed with the bustard but the bustard who had formed a counterresolution that he should do neither threw him stunned him and was last seen making off due west  this weird main at that stage of metempsychosis may have been a sleepwalker or an enthusiast or a robber but i awoke one night to find him in the dark at my bedside repeating the athanasian creed in a terrific voice  i paid my bill next day and retired from the county with all possible precipitation  that was not a commonplace story which worked itself out at a little inn in switzerland while i was staying there  it was a very homely place in a village of one narrow zigzag street among mountains and you went in at the main door through the cowhouse and among the mules and the dogs and the fowls before ascending a great bare staircase to the rooms which were all of unpainted wood without plastering or paperinglike rough packingcases  outside there was nothing but the straggling street a little toy church with a coppercoloured steeple a pine forest a torrent mists and mountainsides  a young man belonging to this inn had disappeared eight weeks before it was wintertime and was supposed to have had some undiscovered love affair and to have gone for a soldier  he had got up in the night and dropped into the village street from the loft in which he slept with another man and he had done it so quietly that his companion and fellowlabourer had heard no movement when he was awakened in the morning and they said louis where is henri  they looked for him high and low in vain and gave him up  now outside this inn there stood as there stood outside every dwelling in the village a stack of firewood but the stack belonging to the inn was higher than any of the rest because the inn was the richest house and burnt the most fuel  it began to be noticed while they were looking high and low that a bantam cock part of the live stock of the inn put himself wonderfully out of his way to get to the top of this woodstack and that he would stay there for hours and hours crowing until he appeared in danger of splitting himself  five weeks went onsix weeksand still this terrible bantam neglecting his domestic affairs was always on the top of the woodstack crowing the very eyes out of his head  by this time it was perceived that louis had become inspired with a violent animosity towards the terrible bantam and one morning he was seen by a woman who sat nursing her goitre at a little window in a gleam of sun to catch up a rough billet of wood with a great oath hurl it at the terrible bantam crowing on the woodstack and bring him down dead  hereupon the woman with a sudden light in her mind stole round to the back of the woodstack and being a good climber as all those women are climbed up and soon was seen upon the summit screaming looking down the hollow within and crying seize louis the murderer  ring the church bell  here is the body  i saw the murderer that day and i saw him as i sat by my fire at the holly tree inn and i see him now lying shackled with cords on the stable litter among the mild eyes and the smoking breath of the cows waiting to be taken away by the police and stared at by the fearful village  a heavy animalthe dullest animal in the stableswith a stupid head and a lumpish face devoid of any trace of insensibility who had been within the knowledge of the murdered youth an embezzler of certain small moneys belonging to his master and who had taken this hopeful mode of putting a possible accuser out of his way  all of which he confessed next day like a sulky wretch who couldnt be troubled any more now that they had got hold of him and meant to make an end of him  i saw him once again on the day of my departure from the inn  in that canton the headsman still does his office with a sword and i came upon this murderer sitting bound to a chair with his eyes bandaged on a scaffold in a little marketplace  in that instant a great sword loaded with quicksilver in the thick part of the blade swept round him like a gust of wind or fire and there was no such creature in the world  my wonder was not that he was so suddenly dispatched but that any head was left unreaped within a radius of fifty yards of that tremendous sickle  that was a good inn too with the kind cheerful landlady and the honest landlord where i lived in the shadow of mont blanc and where one of the apartments has a zoological papering on the walls not so accurately joined but that the elephant occasionally rejoices in a tigers hind legs and tail while the lion puts on a trunk and tusks and the bear moulting as it were appears as to portions of himself like a leopard  i made several american friends at that inn who all called mont blanc mount blankexcept one goodhumoured gentleman of a very sociable nature who became on such intimate terms with it that he spoke of it familiarly as blank observing at breakfast blank looks pretty tall this morning or considerably doubting in the courtyard in the evening whether there warnt some goahead naters in our country sir that would make out the top of blank in a couple of hours from first startnow  once i passed a fortnight at an inn in the north of england where i was haunted by the ghost of a tremendous pie  it was a yorkshire pie like a fortan abandoned fort with nothing in it but the waiter had a fixed idea that it was a point of ceremony at every meal to put the pie on the table  after some days i tried to hint in several delicate ways that i considered the pie done with as for example by emptying fagends of glasses of wine into it putting cheeseplates and spoons into it as into a basket putting winebottles into it as into a cooler but always in vain the pie being invariably cleaned out again and brought up as before  at last beginning to be doubtful whether i was not the victim of a spectral illusion and whether my health and spirits might not sink under the horrors of an imaginary pie i cut a triangle out of it fully as large as the musical instrument of that name in a powerful orchestra human provision could not have foreseen the resultbut the waiter mended the pie  with some effectual species of cement he adroitly fitted the triangle in again and i paid my reckoning and fled  the hollytree was getting rather dismal  i made an overland expedition beyond the screen and penetrated as far as the fourth window  here i was driven back by stress of weather  arrived at my winterquarters once more i made up the fire and took another inn  it was in the remotest part of cornwall  a great annual miners feast was being holden at the inn when i and my travelling companions presented ourselves at night among the wild crowd that were dancing before it by torchlight  we had had a breakdown in the dark on a stony morass some miles away and i had the honour of leading one of the unharnessed posthorses  if any lady or gentleman on perusal of the present lines will take any very tall posthorse with his traces hanging about his legs and will conduct him by the bearingrein into the heart of a country dance of a hundred and fifty couples that lady or gentleman will then and only then form an adequate idea of the extent to which that posthorse will tread on his conductors toes  over and above which the posthorse finding three hundred people whirling about him will probably rear and also lash out with his hind legs in a manner incompatible with dignity or selfrespect on his conductors part  with such little drawbacks on my usually impressive aspect i appeared at this cornish inn to the unutterable wonder of the cornish miners  it was full and twenty times full and nobody could be received but the post horsethough to get rid of that noble animal was something  while my fellowtravellers and i were discussing how to pass the night and so much of the next day as must intervene before the jovial blacksmith and the jovial wheelwright would be in a condition to go out on the morass and mend the coach an honest man stepped forth from the crowd and proposed his unlet floor of two rooms with supper of eggs and bacon ale and punch  we joyfully accompanied him home to the strangest of clean houses where we were well entertained to the satisfaction of all parties  but the novel feature of the entertainment was that our host was a chairmaker and that the chairs assigned to us were mere frames altogether without bottoms of any sort so that we passed the evening on perches  nor was this the absurdest consequence for when we unbent at supper and any one of us gave way to laughter he forgot the peculiarity of his position and instantly disappeared  i myself doubled up into an attitude from which selfextrication was impossible was taken out of my frame like a clown in a comic pantomime who has tumbled into a tub five times by the tapers light during the eggs and bacon  the hollytree was fast reviving within me a sense of loneliness  i began to feel conscious that my subject would never carry on until i was dug out  i might be a week hereweeks  there was a story with a singular idea in it connected with an inn i once passed a night at in a picturesque old town on the welsh border  in a large doublebedded room of this inn there had been a suicide committed by poison in one bed while a tired traveller slept unconscious in the other  after that time the suicide bed was never used but the other constantly was the disused bedstead remaining in the room empty though as to all other respects in its old state  the story ran that whosoever slept in this room though never so entire a stranger from never so far off was invariably observed to come down in the morning with an impression that he smelt laudanum and that his mind always turned upon the subject of suicide to which whatever kind of man he might be he was certain to make some reference if he conversed with any one  this went on for years until it at length induced the landlord to take the disused bedstead down and bodily burn itbed hangings and all  the strange influence this was the story now changed to a fainter one but never changed afterwards  the occupant of that room with occasional but very rare exceptions would come down in the morning trying to recall a forgotten dream he had had in the night  the landlord on his mentioning his perplexity would suggest various commonplace subjects not one of which as he very well knew was the true subject  but the moment the landlord suggested poison the traveller started and cried yes  he never failed to accept that suggestion and he never recalled any more of the dream  this reminiscence brought the welsh inns in general before me with the women in their round hats and the harpers with their white beards venerable but humbugs i am afraid playing outside the door while i took my dinner  the transition was natural to the highland inns with the oatmeal bannocks the honey the venison steaks the trout from the loch the whisky and perhaps having the materials so temptingly at hand the athol brose  once was i coming south from the scottish highlands in hot haste hoping to change quickly at the station at the bottom of a certain wild historical glen when these eyes did with mortification see the landlord come out with a telescope and sweep the whole prospect for the horses which horses were away picking up their own living and did not heave in sight under four hours  having thought of the lochtrout i was taken by quick association to the anglers inns of england i have assisted at innumerable feats of angling by lying in the bottom of the boat whole summer days doing nothing with the greatest perseverance which i have generally found to be as effectual towards the taking of fish as the finest tackle and the utmost science and to the pleasant white clean flowerpotdecorated bedrooms of those inns overlooking the river and the ferry and the green ait and the churchspire and the country bridge and to the pearless emma with the bright eyes and the pretty smile who waited bless her with a natural grace that would have converted bluebeard  casting my eyes upon my hollytree fire i next discerned among the glowing coals the pictures of a score or more of those wonderful english postinginns which we are all so sorry to have lost which were so large and so comfortable and which were such monuments of british submission to rapacity and extortion  he who would see these houses pining away let him walk from basingstoke or even windsor to london by way of hounslow and moralise on their perishing remains the stables crumbling to dust unsettled labourers and wanderers bivouacking in the outhouses grass growing in the yards the rooms where erst so many hundred beds of down were made up let off to irish lodgers at eighteenpence a week a little illlooking beershop shrinking in the tap of former days burning coachhouse gates for firewood having one of its two windows bunged up as if it had received punishment in a fight with the railroad a low bandylegged brickmaking bulldog standing in the doorway  what could i next see in my fire so naturally as the new railwayhouse of these times near the dismal country station with nothing particular on draught but cold air and damp nothing worth mentioning in the larder but new mortar and no business doing beyond a conceited affectation of luggage in the hall then i came to the inns of paris with the pretty apartment of four pieces up one hundred and seventyfive waxed stairs the privilege of ringing the bell all day long without influencing anybodys mind or body but your own and the nottoomuchfordinner considering the price next to the provincial inns of france with the great churchtower rising above the courtyard the horsebells jingling merrily up and down the street beyond and the clocks of all descriptions in all the rooms which are never right unless taken at the precise minute when by getting exactly twelve hours too fast or too slow they unintentionally become so  away i went next to the lesser roadside inns of italy where all the dirty clothes in the house not in wear are always lying in your anteroom where the mosquitoes make a raisin pudding of your face in summer and the cold bites it blue in winter where you get what you can and forget what you cant where i should again like to be boiling my tea in a pockethandkerchief dumpling for want of a teapot  so to the old palace inns and old monastery inns in towns and cities of the same bright country with their massive quadrangular staircases whence you may look from among clustering pillars high into the blue vault of heaven with their stately banquetingrooms and vast refectories with their labyrinths of ghostly bedchambers and their glimpses into gorgeous streets that have no appearance of reality or possibility  so to the close little inns of the malaria districts with their pale attendants and their peculiar smell of never letting in the air  so to the immense fantastic inns of venice with the cry of the gondolier below as he skims the corner the grip of the watery odours on one particular little bit of the bridge of your nose which is never released while you stay there and the great bell of st marks cathedral tolling midnight  next i put up for a minute at the restless inns upon the rhine where your going to bed no matter at what hour appears to be the tocsin for everybody elses getting up and where in the tabledhote room at the end of the long table with several towers of babel on it at the other end all made of white plates one knot of stoutish men entirely dressed in jewels and dirt and having nothing else upon them will remain all night clinking glasses and singing about the river that flows and the grape that grows and rhine wine that beguiles and rhine woman that smiles and hi drink drink my friend and ho drink drink my brother and all the rest of it  i departed thence as a matter of course to other german inns where all the eatables are soddened down to the same flavour and where the mind is disturbed by the apparition of hot puddings and boiled cherries sweet and slab at awfully unexpected periods of the repast  after a draught of sparkling beer from a foaming glass jug and a glance of recognition through the windows of the student beerhouses at heidelberg and elsewhere i put out to sea for the inns of america with their four hundred beds apiece and their eight or nine hundred ladies and gentlemen at dinner every day  again i stood in the barrooms thereof taking my evening cobbler julep sling or cocktail again i listened to my friend the generalwhom i had known for five minutes in the course of which period he had made me intimate for life with two majors who again had made me intimate for life with three colonels who again had made me brother to twentytwo civiliansagain i say i listened to my friend the general leisurely expounding the resources of the establishment as to gentlemens morningroom sir ladies morningroom sir gentlemens eveningroom sir ladies evening room sir ladies and gentlemens evening reunitingroom sir music room sir readingroom sir over four hundred sleepingrooms sir and the entire planned and finited within twelve calendar months from the first clearing off of the old encumbrances on the plot at a cost of five hundred thousand dollars sir  again i found as to my individual way of thinking that the greater the more gorgeous and the more dollarous the establishment was the less desirable it was  nevertheless again i drank my cobbler julep sling or cocktail in all goodwill to my friend the general and my friends the majors colonels and civilians all full well knowing that whatever little motes my beamy eyes may have descried in theirs they belong to a kind generous largehearted and great people  i had been going on lately at a quick pace to keep my solitude out of my mind but here i broke down for good and gave up the subject  what was i to do  what was to become of me  into what extremity was i submissively to sink  supposing that like baron trenck i looked out for a mouse or spider and found one and beguiled my imprisonment by training it  even that might be dangerous with a view to the future  i might be so far gone when the road did come to be cut through the snow that on my way forth i might burst into tears and beseech like the prisoner who was released in his old age from the bastille to be taken back again to the five windows the ten curtains and the sinuous drapery  a desperate idea came into my head  under any other circumstances i should have rejected it but in the strait at which i was i held it fast  could i so far overcome the inherent bashfulness which withheld me from the landlords table and the company i might find there as to call up the boots and ask him to take a chairand something in a liquid formand talk to me  i could i would i did     second branchthe boots   where had he been in his time he repeated when i asked him the question  lord he had been everywhere  and what had he been  bless you he had been everything you could mention amost  seen a good deal  why of course he had  i should say so he could assure me if i only knew about a twentieth part of what had come in his way  why it would be easier for him he expected to tell what he hadnt seen than what he had  ah  a deal it would  what was the curiousest thing he had seen  well  he didnt know  he couldnt momently name what was the curiousest thing he had seenunless it was a unicorn and he see him once at a fair  but supposing a young gentleman not eight year old was to run away with a fine young woman of seven might i think that a queer start  certainly  then that was a start as he himself had had his blessed eyes on and he had cleaned the shoes they run away inand they was so little that he couldnt get his hand into em  master harry walmers father you see he lived at the elmses down away by shooters hill there six or seven miles from lunnon  he was a gentleman of spirit and goodlooking and held his head up when he walked and had what you may call fire about him  he wrote poetry and he rode and he ran and he cricketed and he danced and he acted and he done it all equally beautiful  he was uncommon proud of master harry as was his only child but he didnt spoil him neither  he was a gentleman that had a will of his own and a eye of his own and that would be minded  consequently though he made quite a companion of the fine bright boy and was delighted to see him so fond of reading his fairy books and was never tired of hearing him say my name is norval or hearing him sing his songs about young may moons is beaming love and when he as adores thee has left but the name and that still he kept the command over the child and the child was a child and its to be wished more of em was  how did boots happen to know all this  why through being undergardener  of course he couldnt be undergardener and be always about in the summertime near the windows on the lawn a mowing and sweeping and weeding and pruning and this and that without getting acquainted with the ways of the family  even supposing master harry hadnt come to him one morning early and said cobbs how should you spell norah if you was asked and then began cutting it in print all over the fence  he couldnt say he had taken particular notice of children before that but really it was pretty to see them two mites a going about the place together deep in love  and the courage of the boy  bless your soul hed have throwed off his little hat and tucked up his little sleeves and gone in at a lion he would if they had happened to meet one and she had been frightened of him  one day he stops along with her where boots was hoeing weeds in the gravel and says speaking up cobbs he says i like you  do you sir  im proud to hear it  yes i do cobbs  why do i like you do you think cobbs  dont know master harry i am sure  because norah likes you cobbs  indeed sir thats very gratifying  gratifying cobbs  its better than millions of the brightest diamonds to be liked by norah  certainly sir youre going away aint you cobbs  yes sir  would you like another situation cobbs  well sir i shouldnt object if it was a good inn  then cobbs says he you shall be our head gardener when we are married  and he tucks her in her little skyblue mantle under his arm and walks away  boots could assure me that it was better than a picter and equal to a play to see them babies with their long bright curling hair their sparkling eyes and their beautiful light tread a rambling about the garden deep in love  boots was of opinion that the birds believed they was birds and kept up with em singing to please em  sometimes they would creep under the tuliptree and would sit there with their arms round one anothers necks and their soft cheeks touching a reading about the prince and the dragon and the good and bad enchanters and the kings fair daughter  sometimes he would hear them planning about having a house in a forest keeping bees and a cow and living entirely on milk and honey  once he came upon them by the pond and heard master harry say adorable norah kiss me and say you love me to distraction or ill jump in headforemost  and boots made no question he would have done it if she hadnt complied  on the whole boots said it had a tendency to make him feel as if he was in love himselfonly he didnt exactly know who with  cobbs said master harry one evening when cobbs was watering the flowers i am going on a visit this present midsummer to my grandmammas at york  are you indeed sir  i hope youll have a pleasant time  i am going into yorkshire myself when i leave here  are you going to your grandmammas cobbs  no sir  i havent got such a thing  not as a grandmamma cobbs  no sir  the boy looked on at the watering of the flowers for a little while and then said i shall be very glad indeed to go cobbsnorahs going  youll be all right then sir says cobbs with your beautiful sweetheart by your side  cobbs returned the boy flushing i never let anybody joke about it when i can prevent them  it wasnt a joke sir says cobbs with humilitywasnt so meant  i am glad of that cobbs because i like you you know and youre going to live with uscobbs  sir  what do you think my grandmamma gives me when i go down there  i couldnt so much as make a guess sir  a bank of england fivepound note cobbs  whew says cobbs thats a spanking sum of money master harry  a person could do a good deal with such a sum of money as thatcouldnt a person cobbs  i believe you sir  cobbs said the boy ill tell you a secret  at norahs house they have been joking her about me and pretending to laugh at our being engagedpretending to make game of it cobbs  such sir says cobbs is the depravity of human natur  the boy looking exactly like his father stood for a few minutes with his glowing face towards the sunset and then departed with goodnight cobbs  im going in  if i was to ask boots how it happened that he was agoing to leave that place just at that present time well he couldnt rightly answer me  he did suppose he might have stayed there till now if he had been anyways inclined  but you see he was younger then and he wanted change thats what he wantedchange  mr walmers he said to him when he gave him notice of his intentions to leave cobbs he says have you anythink to complain of  i make the inquiry because if i find that any of my people really has anythink to complain of i wish to make it right if i can  no sir says cobbs thanking you sir i find myself as well sitiwated here as i could hope to be anywheres  the truth is sir that im agoing to seek my fortun  o indeed cobbs he says i hope you may find it  and boots could assure mewhich he did touching his hair with his bootjack as a salute in the way of his present callingthat he hadnt found it yet  well sir  boots left the elmses when his time was up and master harry he went down to the old ladys at york which old lady would have given that child the teeth out of her head if she had had any she was so wrapped up in him  what does that infant dofor infant you may call him and be within the markbut cut away from that old ladys with his norah on a expedition to go to gretna green and be married  sir boots was at this identical hollytree inn having left it several times since to better himself but always come back through one thing or another when one summer afternoon the coach drives up and out of the coach gets them two children  the guard says to our governor i dont quite make out these little passengers but the young gentlemans words was that they was to be brought here  the young gentleman gets out hands his lady out gives the guard something for himself says to our governor were to stop here tonight please  sittingroom and two bedrooms will be required  chops and cherrypudding for two and tucks her in her skyblue mantle under his arm and walks into the house much bolder than brass  boots leaves me to judge what the amazement of that establishment was when these two tiny creatures all alone by themselves was marched into the angelmuch more so when he who had seen them without their seeing him give the governor his views of the expedition they was upon cobbs says the governor if this is so i must set off myself to york and quiet their friends minds  in which case you must keep your eye upon em and humour em till i come back  but before i take these measures cobbs i should wish you to find from themselves whether your opinion is correct  sir to you says cobbs that shall be done directly  so boots goes upstairs to the angel and there he finds master harry on a enormous sofaimmense at any time but looking like the great bed of ware compared with hima drying the eyes of miss norah with his pocket hankecher  their little legs was entirely off the ground of course and it really is not possible for boots to express to me how small them children looked  its cobbs  its cobbs cries master harry and comes running to him and catching hold of his hand  miss norah comes running to him on tother side and catching hold of his tother hand and they both jump for joy  i see you a getting out sir says cobbs  i thought it was you  i thought i couldnt be mistaken in your height and figure  whats the object of your journey sirmatrimonial  we are going to be married cobbs at gretna green returned the boy we have run away on purpose  norah has been in rather low spirits cobbs but shell be happy now we have found you to be our friend  thank you sir and thank you miss says cobbs for your good opinion  did you bring any luggage with you sir  if i will believe boots when he gives me his word and honour upon it the lady had got a parasol a smellingbottle a round and a half of cold buttered toast eight peppermint drops and a hairbrushseemingly a dolls  the gentleman had got about half a dozen yards of string a knife three or four sheets of writingpaper folded up surprising small a orange and a chaney mug with his name upon it  what may be the exact natur of your plans sir says cobbs  to go on replied the boywhich the courage of that boy was something wonderfulin the morning and be married tomorrow  just so sir says cobbs  would it meet your views sir if i was to accompany you  when cobbs said this they both jumped for joy again and cried out oh yes yes cobbs  yes  well sir says cobbs  if you will excuse my having the freedom to give an opinion what i should recommend would be this  im acquainted with a pony sir which put in a pheayton that i could borrow would take you and mrs harry walmers junior myself driving if you approved to the end of your journey in a very short space of time  i am not altogether sure sir that this pony will be at liberty tomorrow but even if you had to wait over tomorrow for him it might be worth your while  as to the small account here sir in case you was to find yourself running at all short that dont signify because im a part proprietor of this inn and it could stand over  boots assures me that when they clapped their hands and jumped for joy again and called him good cobbs and dear cobbs and bent across him to kiss one another in the delight of their confiding hearts he felt himself the meanest rascal for deceiving em that ever was born  is there anything you want just at present sir says cobbs mortally ashamed of himself  we should like some cakes after dinner answered master harry folding his arms putting out one leg and looking straight at him and two applesand jam  with dinner we should like to have toastandwater but norah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at dessert  and so have i  it shall be ordered at the bar sir says cobbs and away he went  boots has the feeling as fresh upon him at this minute of speaking as he had then that he would far rather have had it out in halfadozen rounds with the governor than have combined with him and that he wished with all his heart there was any impossible place where those two babies could make an impossible marriage and live impossibly happy ever afterwards however as it couldnt be he went into the governors plans and the governor set off for york in half an hour  the way in which the women of that housewithout exceptionevery one of emmarried and singletook to that boy when they heard the story boots considers surprising  it was as much as he could do to keep em from dashing into the room and kissing him  they climbed up all sorts of places at the risk of their lives to look at him through a pane of glass  they was seven deep at the keyhole  they was out of their minds about him and his bold spirit  in the evening boots went into the room to see how the runaway couple was getting on  the gentleman was on the windowseat supporting the lady in his arms  she had tears upon her face and was lying very tired and half asleep with her head upon his shoulder  mrs harry walmers junior fatigued sir says cobbs  yes she is tired cobbs but she is not used to be away from home and she has been in low spirits again  cobbs do you think you could bring a biffin please  i ask your pardon sir says cobbs  what was it you  i think a norfolk biffin would rouse her cobbs  she is very fond of them  boots withdrew in search of the required restorative and when he brought it in the gentleman handed it to the lady and fed her with a spoon and took a little himself the lady being heavy with sleep and rather cross what should you think sir says cobbs of a chamber candlestick  the gentleman approved the chambermaid went first up the great staircase the lady in her skyblue mantle followed gallantly escorted by the gentleman the gentleman embraced her at her door and retired to his own apartment where boots softly locked him up  boots couldnt but feel with increased acuteness what a base deceiver he was when they consulted him at breakfast they had ordered sweet milk andwater and toast and currant jelly overnight about the pony  it really was as much as he could do he dont mind confessing to me to look them two young things in the face and think what a wicked old father of lies he had grown up to be  howsomever he went on a lying like a trojan about the pony  he told em that it did so unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped you see and that he couldnt be taken out in that state for fear it should strike to his inside  but that hed be finished clipping in the course of the day and that tomorrow morning at eight oclock the pheayton would be ready  bootss view of the whole case looking back on it in my room is that mrs harry walmers junior was beginning to give in  she hadnt had her hair curled when she went to bed and she didnt seem quite up to brushing it herself and its getting in her eyes put her out  but nothing put out master harry  he sat behind his breakfastcup a tearing away at the jelly as if he had been his own father  after breakfast boots is inclined to consider that they drawed soldiersat least he knows that many such was found in the fireplace all on horseback  in the course of the morning master harry rang the bellit was surprising how that there boy did carry onand said in a sprightly way cobbs is there any good walks in this neighbourhood  yes sir says cobbs  theres love lane  get out with you cobbsthat was that there boys expressionyoure joking  begging your pardon sir says cobbs there really is love lane  and a pleasant walk it is and proud shall i be to show it to yourself and mrs harry walmers junior  norah dear said master harry this is curious  we really ought to see love lane  put on your bonnet my sweetest darling and we will go there with cobbs  boots leaves me to judge what a beast he felt himself to be when that young pair told him as they all three jogged along together that they had made up their minds to give him two thousand guineas a year as head gardener on accounts of his being so true a friend to em  boots could have wished at the moment that the earth would have opened and swallowed him up he felt so mean with their beaming eyes a looking at him and believing him  well sir he turned the conversation as well as he could and he took em down love lane to the watermeadows and there master harry would have drowned himself in half a moment more a getting out a waterlily for herbut nothing daunted that boy  well sir they was tired out  all being so new and strange to em they was tired as tired could be  and they laid down on a bank of daisies like the children in the wood leastways meadows and fell asleep  boots dont knowperhaps i dobut never mind it dont signify either waywhy it made a man fit to make a fool of himself to see them two pretty babies a lying there in the clear still sunny day not dreaming half so hard when they was asleep as they done when they was awake  but lord when you come to think of yourself you know and what a game you have been up to ever since you was in your own cradle and what a poor sort of a chap you are and how its always either yesterday with you or else tomorrow and never today thats where it is  well sir they woke up at last and then one thing was getting pretty clear to boots namely that mrs harry walmerses juniors temper was on the move  when master harry took her round the waist she said he teased her so and when he says norah my young may moon your harry tease you she tells him yes and i want to go home  a biled fowl and baked breadandbutter pudding brought mrs walmers up a little but boots could have wished he must privately own to me to have seen her more sensible of the woice of love and less abandoning of herself to currants  however master harry he kept up and his noble heart was as fond as ever  mrs walmers turned very sleepy about dusk and began to cry  therefore mrs walmers went off to bed as per yesterday and master harry ditto repeated  about eleven or twelve at night comes back the governor in a chaise along with mr walmers and a elderly lady  mr walmers looks amused and very serious both at once and says to our missis we are much indebted to you maam for your kind care of our little children which we can never sufficiently acknowledge  pray maam where is my boy  our missis says cobbs has the dear child in charge sir  cobbs show forty  then he says to cobbs ah cobbs i am glad to see you  i understood you was here  and cobbs says yes sir  your most obedient sir  i may be surprised to hear boots say it perhaps but boots assures me that his heart beat like a hammer going upstairs  i beg your pardon sir says he while unlocking the door i hope you are not angry with master harry  for master harry is a fine boy sir and will do you credit and honour  and boots signifies to me that if the fine boys father had contradicted him in the daring state of mind in which he then was he thinks he should have fetched him a crack and taken the consequences  but mr walmers only says no cobbs  no my good fellow  thank you and the door being opened goes in  boots goes in too holding the light and he sees mr walmers go up to the bedside bend gently down and kiss the little sleeping face  then he stands looking at it for a minute looking wonderfully like it they do say he ran away with mrs walmers and then he gently shakes the little shoulder  harry my dear boy  harry  master harry starts up and looks at him  looks at cobbs too  such is the honour of that mite that he looks at cobbs to see whether he has brought him into trouble  i am not angry my child  i only want you to dress yourself and come home  yes pa  master harry dresses himself quickly  his breast begins to swell when he has nearly finished and it swells more and more as he stands at last a looking at his father his father standing a looking at him the quiet image of him  please may ithe spirit of that little creatur and the way he kept his rising tears downplease dear pamay ikiss norah before i go  you may my child  so he takes master harry in his hand and boots leads the way with the candle and they come to that other bedroom where the elderly lady is seated by the bed and poor little mrs harry walmers junior is fast asleep  there the father lifts the child up to the pillow and he lays his little face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor unconscious little mrs harry walmers junior and gently draws it to hima sight so touching to the chambermaids who are peeping through the door that one of them calls out its a shame to part em  but this chambermaid was always as boots informs me a softhearted one  not that there was any harm in that girl  far from it  finally boots says thats all about it  mr walmers drove away in the chaise having hold of master harrys hand  the elderly lady and mrs harry walmers junior that was never to be she married a captain long afterwards and died in india went off next day  in conclusion boots put it to me whether i hold with him in two opinions firstly that there are not many couples on their way to be married who are half as innocent of guile as those two children secondly that it would be a jolly good thing for a great many couples on their way to be married if they could only be stopped in time and brought back separately     third branchthe bill   i had been snowed up a whole week  the time had hung so lightly on my hands that i should have been in great doubt of the fact but for a piece of documentary evidence that lay upon my table  the road had been dug out of the snow on the previous day and the document in question was my bill  it testified emphatically to my having eaten and drunk and warmed myself and slept among the sheltering branches of the hollytree seven days and nights  i had yesterday allowed the road twentyfour hours to improve itself finding that i required that additional margin of time for the completion of my task  i had ordered my bill to be upon the table and a chaise to be at the door at eight oclock tomorrow evening  it was eight oclock tomorrow evening when i buckled up my travelling writingdesk in its leather case paid my bill and got on my warm coats and wrappers  of course no time now remained for my travelling on to add a frozen tear to the icicles which were doubtless hanging plentifully about the farmhouse where i had first seen angela  what i had to do was to get across to liverpool by the shortest open road there to meet my heavy baggage and embark  it was quite enough to do and i had not an hour too much time to do it in  i had taken leave of all my hollytree friendsalmost for the time being of my bashfulness tooand was standing for half a minute at the inn door watching the ostler as he took another turn at the cord which tied my portmanteau on the chaise when i saw lamps coming down towards the hollytree  the road was so padded with snow that no wheels were audible but all of us who were standing at the inn door saw lamps coming on and at a lively rate too between the walls of snow that had been heaped up on either side of the track  the chambermaid instantly divined how the case stood and called to the ostler tom this is a gretna job  the ostler knowing that her sex instinctively scented a marriage or anything in that direction rushed up the yard bawling next four out and in a moment the whole establishment was thrown into commotion  i had a melancholy interest in seeing the happy man who loved and was beloved and therefore instead of driving off at once i remained at the inn door when the fugitives drove up  a brighteyed fellow muffled in a mantle jumped out so briskly that he almost overthrew me  he turned to apologise and by heaven it was edwin  charley said he recoiling  gracious powers what do you do here  edwin said i recoiling gracious powers what do you do here  i struck my forehead as i said it and an insupportable blaze of light seemed to shoot before my eyes  he hurried me into the little parlour always kept with a slow fire in it and no poker where posting company waited while their horses were putting to and shutting the door said  charley forgive me  edwin i returned  was this well  when i loved her so dearly  when i had garnered up my heart so long  i could say no more  he was shocked when he saw how moved i was and made the cruel observation that he had not thought i should have taken it so much to heart  i looked at him  i reproached him no more  but i looked at him  my dear dear charley said he dont think ill of me i beseech you  i know you have a right to my utmost confidence and believe me you have ever had it until now  i abhor secrecy  its meanness is intolerable to me  but i and my dear girl have observed it for your sake  he and his dear girl  it steeled me  you have observed it for my sake sir said i wondering how his frank face could face it out so  yesand angelas said he  i found the room reeling round in an uncertain way like a labouring hummingtop  explain yourself said i holding on by one hand to an armchair  dear old darling charley returned edwin in his cordial manner consider  when you were going on so happily with angela why should i compromise you with the old gentleman by making you a party to our engagement and after he had declined my proposals to our secret intention  surely it was better that you should be able honourably to say he never took counsel with me never told me never breathed a word of it  if angela suspected it and showed me all the favour and support she couldgod bless her for a precious creature and a priceless wifei couldnt help that  neither i nor emmeline ever told her any more than we told you  and for the same good reason charley trust me for the same good reason and no other upon earth  emmeline was angelas cousin  lived with her  had been brought up with her  was her fathers ward  had property  emmeline is in the chaise my dear edwin said i embracing him with the greatest affection  my good fellow said he do you suppose i should be going to gretna green without her  i ran out with edwin i opened the chaise door i took emmeline in my arms i folded her to my heart  she was wrapped in soft white fur like the snowy landscape but was warm and young and lovely  i put their leaders to with my own hands i gave the boys a fivepound note apiece i cheered them as they drove away i drove the other way myself as hard as i could pelt  i never went to liverpool i never went to america i went straight back to london and i married angela  i have never until this time even to her disclosed the secret of my character and the mistrust and the mistaken journey into which it led me  when she and they and our eight children and their seveni mean edwin and emmelines whose oldest girl is old enough now to wear white for herself and to look very like her mother in itcome to read these pages as of course they will i shall hardly fail to be found out at last  never mind  i can bear it  i began at the hollytree by idle accident to associate the christmas time of year with human interest and with some inquiry into and some care for the lives of those by whom i find myself surrounded  i hope that i am none the worse for it and that no one near me or afar off is the worse for it  and i say may the green hollytree flourish striking its roots deep into our english ground and having its germinating qualities carried by the birds of heaven all over the world
