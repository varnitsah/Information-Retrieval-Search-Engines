91836337	when the sleeper wakes  by herbert george wells     chapter i insomnia  one afternoon at low water mr isbister a young artist lodging at boscastle walked from that place to the picturesque cove of pentargen desiring to examine the caves there halfway down the precipitous path to the pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock the hands of this man hung limply over his knees his eyes were red and staring before him and his face was wet with tears  he glanced round at isbisters footfall both men were disconcerted isbister the more so and to override the awkwardness of his involuntary pause he remarked with an air of mature conviction that the weather was hot for the time of year  very answered the stranger shortly hesitated a second and added in a colourless tone i cant sleep  isbister stopped abruptly no was all he said but his bearing conveyed his helpful impulse  it may sound incredible said the stranger turning weary eyes to isbisters face and emphasizing his words with a languid hand but i have had no sleepno sleep at all for six nights  had advice  yes bad advice for the most part drugs my nervous system they are all very well for the run of people its hard to explain i dare not take sufficiently powerful drugs  that makes it difficult said isbister  he stood helplessly in the narrow path perplexed what to do clearly the man wanted to talk an idea natural enough under the circumstances prompted him to keep the conversation going ive never suffered from sleeplessness myself he said in a tone of commonplace gossip but in those cases i have known people have usually found something  i dare make no experiments  he spoke wearily he gave a gesture of rejection and for a space both men were silent  exercise suggested isbister diffidently with a glance from his interlocutors face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore  that is what i have tried unwisely perhaps i have followed the coast day after dayfrom new quay it has only added muscular fatigue to the mental the cause of this unrest was overworktrouble there was something  he stopped as if from sheer fatigue he rubbed his forehead with a lean hand he resumed speech like one who talks to himself  i am a lone wolf a solitary man wandering through a world in which i have no part i am wifelesschildlesswho is it speaks of the childless as the dead twigs on the tree of life i am wifeless i childlessi could find no duty to do no desire even in my heart one thing at last i set myself to do  i said i will do this and to do it to overcome the inertia of this dull body i resorted to drugs great god ive had enough of drugs i dont know if you feel the heavy inconvenience of the body its exasperating demand of time from the mindtimelife live we only live in patches we have to eat and then comes the dull digestive complacenciesor irritations we have to take the air or else our thoughts grow sluggish stupid run into gulfs and blind alleys a thousand distractions arise from within and without and then comes drowsiness and sleep men seem to live for sleep how little of a mans day is his owneven at the best and then come those false friends those thug helpers the alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill restblack coffee cocaine  i see said isbister  i did my work said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation  and this is the price  yes  for a little while the two remained without speaking  you cannot imagine the craving for rest that i feela hunger and thirst for six long days since my work was done my mind has been a whirlpool swift unprogressive and incessant a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere spinning round swift and steady  he paused towards the gulf  you must sleep said isbister decisively and with an air of a remedy discovered certainly you must sleep  my mind is perfectly lucid it was never clearer but i know i am drawing towards the vortex presently  yes  you have seen things go down an eddy out of the light of the day out of this sweet world of sanitydown  but expostulated isbister  the man threw out a hand towards him and his eyes were wild and his voice suddenly high i shall kill myself if in no other wayat the foot of yonder dark precipice there where the waves are green and the white surge lifts and falls and that little thread of water trembles down there at any rate is  sleep  thats unreasonable said isbister startled at the mans hysterical gust of emotion drugs are better than that  there at any rate is sleep repeated the stranger not heeding him  isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex providence had indeed brought them together that afternoon its not a cert you know he remarked theres a cliff like that at lulworth coveas high anyhowand a little girl fell from top to bottom and lives todaysound and well  but those rocks there  one might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night broken bones grating as one shivered chill water splashing over you eh  their eyes met sorry to upset your ideals said isbister with a sense of devilmaycareish brilliance  but a suicide over that cliff or any cliff for the matter of that really as an artist he laughed its so damned amateurish  but the other thing said the sleepless man irritably the other thing no man can keep sane if night after night  have you been walking along this coast alone  yes  silly sort of thing to do if youll excuse my saying so alone as you say body fag is no cure for brain fag who told you to no wonder walking and the sun on your head heat fag solitude all the day long and then i suppose you go to bed and try very hardeh  isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully  look at these rocks cried the seated man with a sudden force of gesture look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever see the white spume rush into darkness under that great cliff and this blue vault with the blinding sun pouring from the dome of it it is your world you accept it you rejoice in it it warms and supports and delights you and for me  he turned his head and showed a ghastly face bloodshot pallid eyes and bloodless lips he spoke almost in a whisper it is the garment of my misery the whole world is the garment of my misery  isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them and back to that face of despair for a moment he was silent  he started and made a gesture of impatient rejection you get a nights sleep he said and you wont see much misery out here take my word for it  he was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter only half an hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored here was employment the bare thought of which was righteous selfapplause he took possession forthwith it seemed to him that the first need of this exhausted being was companionship he flung himself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the motionless seated figure and deployed forthwith into a skirmishing line of gossip  his hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy he stared dismally seaward and spoke only in answer to isbisters direct questionsand not to all of those but he made no sign of objection to this benevolent intrusion upon his despair  in a helpless way he seemed even grateful and when presently isbister feeling that his unsupported talk was losing vigour suggested that they should reascend the steep and return towards boscastle alleging the view into blackapit he submitted quietly halfway up he began talking to himself and abruptly turned a ghastly face on his helper what can be happening he asked with a gaunt illustrative hand what can be happening spin spin spin spin it goes round and round round and round for evermore  he stood with his hand circling  its all right old chap said isbister with the air of an old friend dont worry yourself trust to me  the man dropped his hand and turned again they went over the brow in single file and to the headland beyond penally with the sleepless man gesticulating ever and again and speaking fragmentary things concerning his whirling brain at the headland they stood for a space by the seat that looks into the dark mysteries of blackapit and then he sat down isbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened sufficiently for them to walk abreast he was enlarging upon the complex difficulty of making boscastle harbour in bad weather when suddenly and quite irrelevantly his companion interrupted him again  my head is not like what it was he said gesticulating for want of expressive phrases its not like what it was there is a sort of oppression a weight nonot drowsiness would god it were it is like a shadow a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly across something busy spin spin into the darkness the tumult of thought the confusion the eddy and eddy i cant express it i can hardly keep my mind on itsteadily enough to tell you  he stopped feebly  dont trouble old chap said isbister i think i can understand at any rate it dont matter very much just at present about telling me you know  the sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them isbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued and then he had a fresh idea come down to my room he said and try a pipe i can show you some sketches of this blackapit if youd care  the other rose obediently and followed him down the steep  several times isbister heard him stumble as they came down and his movements were slow and hesitating come in with me said isbister and try some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol if you take alcohol  the stranger hesitated at the garden gate he seemed no longer clearly aware of his actions i dont drink he said slowly coming up the garden path and after a moments interval repeated absently noi dont drink it goes round spin it goesspin  he stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one who sees nothing  then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair seemed almost to fall into it he leant forward with his brows on his hands and became motionless  presently he made a faint sound in his throat isbister moved about the room with the nervousness of an inexperienced host making little remarks that scarcely required answering he crossed the room to his portfolio placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock  i dont know if youd care to have supper with me he said with an unlighted cigarette in his handhis mind troubled with a design of the furtive administration of chloral only cold mutton you know but passing sweet welsh and a tart i believe he repeated this after momentary silence  the seated man made no answer isbister stopped match in hand regarding him  the stillness lengthened the match went out the cigarette was put down unlit the man was certainly very still isbister took up the portfolio opened it put it down hesitated seemed about to speak perhaps he whispered doubtfully presently he glanced at the door and back to the figure then he stole on tiptoe out of the room glancing at his companion after each elaborate pace  he closed the door noiselessly the house door was standing open and he went out beyond the porch and stood where the monkshood rose at the corner of the garden bed from this point he could see the stranger through the open window still and dim sitting head on hand he had not moved  a number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the artist curiously a boatman exchanged civilities with him he felt that possibly his circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and unaccountable smoking perhaps might seem more natural he drew pipe and pouch from his pocket filled the pipe slowly  i wonder he said with a scarcely perceptible loss of complacency at any rate we must give him a chance he struck a match in the virile way and proceeded to light his pipe  presently he heard his landlady behind him coming with his lamp lit from the kitchen he turned gesticulating with his pipe and stopped her at the door of his sittingroom he had some difficulty in explaining the situation in whispers for she did not know he had a visitor she retreated again with the lamp still a little mystified to judge from her manner and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the porch flushed and less at his ease  long after he had smoked out his pipe and when the bats were abroad his curiosity dominated his complex hesitations and he stole back into his darkling sittingroom he paused in the doorway the stranger was still in the same attitude dark against the window save for the singing of some sailors aboard one of the little slatecarrying ships in the harbour the evening was very still outside the spikes of monkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless against the shadow of the hillside something flashed into isbisters mind he started and leaning over the table listened an unpleasant suspicion grew stronger became conviction astonishment seized him and becamedread  no sound of breathing came from the seated figure  he crept slowly and noiselessly round the table pausing twice to listen at last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair he bent down until the two heads were ear to ear  then he bent still lower to look up at his visitors face he started violently and uttered an exclamation the eyes were void spaces of white  he looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled under the lids he was suddenly afraid overcome by the strangeness of the mans condition he took him by the shoulder and shook him are you asleep he said with his voice jumping into alto and again are you asleep  a conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead he suddenly became active and noisy strode across the room blundering against the table as he did so and rang the bell  please bring a light at once he said in the passage there is something wrong with my friend  then he returned to the motionless seated figure grasped the shoulder shook it and shouted the room was flooded with yellow glare as his astonished landlady entered with the light his face was white as he turned blinking towards her i must fetch a doctor at once he said it is either death or a fit is there a doctor in the village where is a doctor to be found     chapter ii the trance  the state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen lasted for an unprecedented length of time and then he passed slowly to the flaccid state to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose then it was his eyes could be closed  he was removed from the hotel to the boscastle surgery and from the surgery after some weeks to london but he still resisted every attempt at reanimation after a time for reasons that will appear later these attempts were discontinued for a great space he lay in that strange condition inert and still neither dead nor living but as it were suspended hanging midway between nothingness and existence his was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation a dreamless inanition a vast space of peace the tumult of his mind had swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence where was the man where is any man when insensibility takes hold of him  it seems only yesterday said isbister i remember it all as though it happened yesterdayclearer perhaps than if it had happened yesterday  it was the isbister of the last chapter but he was no longer a young man the hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the fashionable length was iron grey and clipped close and the face that had been pink and white was buff and ruddy he had a pointed beard shot with grey he talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill the summer of that year was unusually hot this was warming a london solicitor and next of kin to graham the man who had fallen into the trance and the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in london regarding his recumbent figure  it was a yellow figure lying lax upon a waterbed and clad in a flowing shirt a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard lean limbs and lank nails and about it was a case of thin glass this glass seemed to mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him he was a thing apart a strange isolated abnormality the two men stood close to the glass peering in  the thing gave me a shock said isbister i feel a queer sort of surprise even now when i think of his white eyes they were white you know rolled up coming here again brings it all back to me  have you never seen him since that time asked warming  often wanted to come said isbister but business nowadays is too serious a thing for much holiday keeping ive been in america most of the time  if i remember rightly said warming you were an artist  was and then i became a married man i saw it was all up with black and white very soonat least for a mediocre man and i jumped on to process those posters on the cliffs at dover are by my people  good posters admitted the solicitor though i was sorry to see them there  last as long as the cliffs if necessary exclaimed isbister with satisfaction the world changes when he fell asleep twenty years ago i was down at boscastle with a box of watercolours and a noble oldfashioned ambition i didnt expect that some day my pigments would glorify the whole blessed coast of england from lands end round again to the lizard luck comes to a man very often when hes not looking  warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck i just missed seeing you if i recollect aright  you came back by the trap that took me to camelford railway station it was close on the jubilee victorias jubilee because i remember the seats and flags in westminster and the row with the cabman at chelsea  the diamond jubilee it was said warming the second one  ah yes at the proper jubileethe fifty year affairi was down at wookeya boy i missed all that what a fuss we had with him my landlady wouldnt take him in wouldnt let him stayhe looked so queer when he was rigid we had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel and the boscastle doctorit wasnt the present chap but the gp before himwas at him until nearly two with me and the landlord holding lights and so forth  it was a cataleptic rigour at first wasnt it  stiffwherever you bent him he stuck you might have stood him on his head and hed have stopped i never saw such stiffness of course thishe indicated the prostrate figure by a movement of his headis quite different and of course the little doctorwhat was his name  smithers  smithers it waswas quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon according to all accounts the things he did even now it makes me feel allugh mustard snuff pricking and one of those beastly little things not dynamos  induction coils  yes you could see his muscles throb and jump and he twisted about there was just two flaring yellow candles and all the shadows were shivering and the little doctor nervous and putting on side and himstark and squirming in the most unnatural ways well it made me dream  pause  its a strange state said warming  its a sort of complete absence said isbister  heres the body empty not dead a bit and yet not alive its like a seat vacant and marked engaged no feeling no digestion no beating of the heartnot a flutter that doesnt make me feel as if there was a man present in a sense its more dead than death for these doctors tell me that even the hair has stopped growing now with the proper dead the hair will go on growing  i know said warming with a flash of pain in his expression  they peered through the glass again graham was indeed in a strange state in the flaccid phase of a trance but a trance unprecedented in medical history trances had lasted for as much as a year beforebut at the end of that time it had ever been waking or a death sometimes first one and then the other isbister noted the marks the physicians had made in injecting nourishment for that device had been resorted to to postpone collapse he pointed them out to warming who had been trying not to see them  and while he has been lying here said isbister with the zest of a life freely spent i have changed my plans in life married raised a family my eldest ladi hadnt begun to think of sons thenis an american citizen and looking forward to leaving harvard theres a touch of grey in my hair and this man not a day older nor wiser practically than i was in my downy days its curious to think of  warming turned and i have grown old too i played cricket with him when i was still only a lad and he looks a young man still yellow perhaps but that is a young man nevertheless  and theres been the war said isbister  from beginning to end  and these martians  ive understood said isbister after a pause that he had some moderate property of his own  that is so said warming he coughed primly as it happenshave charge of it  ah isbister thought hesitated and spoke no doubthis keep here is not expensiveno doubt it will have improvedaccumulated  it has he will wake up very much better offif he wakesthan when he slept  as a business man said isbister that thought has naturally been in my mind i have indeed sometimes thought that speaking commercially of course this sleep may be a very good thing for him that he knows what he is about so to speak in being insensible so long if he had lived straight on  i doubt if he would have premeditated as much said warming he was not a farsighted man in fact  yes  we differed on that point i stood to him somewhat in the relation of a guardian you have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise that occasionally a certain friction but even if that was the case there is a doubt whether he will ever wake this sleep exhausts slowly but it exhausts apparently he is sliding slowly very slowly and tediously down a long slope if you can understand me  it will be a pity to lose his surprise theres been a lot of change these twenty years its rip van winkle come real  its bellamy said warming there has been a lot of change certainly and among other changes i have changed i am an old man  isbister hesitated and then feigned a belated surprise i shouldnt have thought it  i was fortythree when his bankersyou remember you wired to his bankerssent on to me  i got their address from the cheque book in his pocket said isbister  well the addition is not difficult said warming  there was another pause and then isbister gave way to an unavoidable curiosity he may go on for years yet he said and had a moment of hesitation we have to consider that his affairs you know may fall some day into the hands ofsomeone else you know  that if you will believe me mr isbister is one of the problems most constantly before my mind we happen to beas a matter of fact there are no very trustworthy connections of ours it is a grotesque and unprecedented position  it is said isbister as a matter of fact its a case for a public trustee if only we had such a functionary  it seems to me its a case for some public body some practically undying guardian if he really is going on livingas the doctors some of them think as a matter of fact i have gone to one or two public men about it but so far nothing has been done  it wouldnt be a bad idea to hand him over to some public bodythe british museum trustees or the royal college of physicians sounds a bit odd of course but the whole situation is odd  the difficulty is to induce them to take him  red tape i suppose  partly  pause its a curious business certainly said isbister and compound interest has a way of mounting up  it has said warming and now the gold supplies are running short there is a tendency towards  appreciation  ive felt that said isbister with a grimace but it makes it better for him  if he wakes  if he wakes echoed isbister do you notice the pinchedill look of his nose and the way in which his eyelids sink  warming looked and thought for a space i doubt if he will wake he said at last  i never properly understood said isbister what it was brought this on he told me something about overstudy ive often been curious  he was a man of considerable gifts but spasmodic emotional he had grave domestic troubles divorced his wife in fact and it was as a relief from that i think that he took up politics of the rabid sort he was a fanatical radicala socialistor typical liberal as they used to call themselves of the advanced school energeticflightyundisciplined overwork upon a controversy did this for him i remember the pamphlet he wrotea curious production wild whirling stuff there were one or two prophecies some of them are already exploded some of them are established facts but for the most part to read such a thesis is to realise how full the world is of unanticipated things he will have much to learn much to unlearn when he wakes if ever a waking comes  id give anything to be there said isbister just to hear what he would say to it all  so would i said warming aye so would i with an old mans sudden turn to self pity but i shall never see him wake  he stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure he will never wake he said at last he sighed he will never wake again    chapter iii the awakening  but warming was wrong in that an awakening came  what a wonderfully complex thing this simple seeming unitythe self who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken the flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving rebuilding the dim first stirrings of the soul the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the subconscious the subconscious to dawning consciousness until at last we recognise ourselves again and as it happens to most of us after the nights sleep so it was with graham at the end of his vast slumber a dim cloud of sensation taking shape a cloudy dreariness and he found himself vaguely somewhere recumbent faint but alive  the pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs to occupy epochs gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time left vague perplexing memories strange creatures strange scenery as if from another planet there was a distinct impression too of a momentous conversation of a namehe could not tell what namethat was subsequently to recur of some queer longforgotten sensation of vein and muscle of a feeling of vast hopeless effort the effort of a man near drowning in darkness then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes  graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar thing  it was something white the edge of something a frame of wood he moved his head slightly following the contour of this shape it went up beyond the top of his eyes he tried to think where he might be did it matter seeing he was so wretched the colour of his thoughts was a dark depression he felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn he had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding  the movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness he supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valleybut he could not recall that white edge he must have slept he remembered now that he had wanted to sleep he recalled the cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something about talking to a passerby  how long had he slept what was that sound of pattering feet and that rise and fall like the murmur of breakers on pebbles he put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it and touched some smooth hard surface like glass this was so unexpected that it startled him extremely quite suddenly he rolled over stared for a moment and struggled into a sitting position the effort was unexpectedly difficult and it left him giddy and weakand amazed  he rubbed his eyes the riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mind was quite clearevidently his sleep had benefited him he was not in a bed at all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress in a trough of dark glass the mattress was partly transparent a fact he observed with a strange sense of insecurity and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly about his armand he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellowwas bound a curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below and this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass as it seemed to him a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention in the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus for the most part quite strange appliances though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable  the slightly greenish tint of the glasslike substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance and with a very large and simple white archway facing him close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture a table covered with a silvery cloth silvery like the side of a fish a couple of graceful chairs and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them a bottle and two glasses he realised that he was intensely hungry  he could see no human being and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment he had miscalculated his strength however and staggered and put his hand against the glasslike pane before him to steady himself for a moment it resisted his hand bending outward like a distended bladder then it broke with a slight report and vanisheda pricked bubble he reeled out into the general space of the hall greatly astonished he caught at the table to save himself knocking one of the glasses to the floorit rang but did not breakand sat down in one of the armchairs  when he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and dranka colourless liquid it was but not water with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus he put down the vessel and looked about him  the apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed the archway he saw led to a flight of steps going downward without the intermediation of a door to a spacious transverse passage this passage ran between polished pillars of some whiteveined substance of deep ultramarine and along it came the sound of human movements and voices and a deep undeviating droning note he sat now fully awake listening alertly forgetting the viands in his attention  then with a shock he remembered that he was naked and casting about him for covering saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him this he wrapped about him and sat down again trembling  his mind was still a surging perplexity clearly he had slept and had been removed in his sleep but here and who were those people the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars boscastle he poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid  what was this placethis place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive he looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment unstained by ornament and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light and as he looked a steady sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed and came again and passed beat beat that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air  he would have called out but only a little sound came into his throat then he stood up and with the uncertain steps of a drunkard made his way towards the archway he staggered down the steps tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars  the passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze a space like the interior of some gigantic building beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms the tumult of voices rose now loud and clear and on the balcony and with their backs to him gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation were three figures richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings the noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony and once it seemed the top of a banner passed and once some brightly coloured object a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps flashed athwart the space and fell the shouts sounded like english there was a reiteration of wake he heard some indistinct shrill cry and abruptly the three men began laughing   ha ha ha laughed onea redhaired man in a short purple robe when the sleeper wakeswhen  he turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage his face changed the whole man changed became rigid the other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless their faces assumed an expression of consternation an expression that deepened into awe  suddenly grahams knees bent beneath him his arm against the pillar collapsed limply he staggered forward and fell upon his face    chapter iv the sound of a tumult  grahams last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing of bells he learnt afterwards that he was insensible hanging between life and death for the better part of an hour when he recovered his senses he was back on his translucent couch and there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat the dark apparatus he perceived had been removed from his arm which was bandaged the white framework was still about him but the greenish transparent substance that had filled it was altogether gone a man in a deep violet robe one of those who had been on the balcony was looking keenly into his face  remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds that suggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting together something seemed to fall across this tumult a door suddenly closed  graham moved his head what does this all mean he said slowly where am i  he saw the redhaired man who had been first to discover him a voice seemed to be asking what he had said and was abruptly stilled  the man in violet answered in a soft voice speaking english with a slightly foreign accent or so at least it seemed to the sleepers ears you are quite safe you were brought hither from where you fell asleep it is quite safe you have been here some timesleeping in a trance  he said something further that graham could not hear and a little phial was handed across to him graham felt a cooling spray a fragrant mist played over his forehead for a moment and his sense of refreshment increased he closed his eyes in satisfaction  better asked the man in violet as grahams eyes reopened he was a pleasantfaced man of thirty perhaps with a pointed flaxen beard and a clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe  yes said graham  you have been asleep some time in a cataleptic trance you have heard catalepsy it may seem strange to you at first but i can assure you everything is well  graham did not answer but these words served their reassuring purpose his eyes went from face to face of the three people about him they were regarding him strangely he knew he ought to be somewhere in cornwall but he could not square these things with that impression  a matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at boscastle recurred a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected he cleared his throat  have you wired my cousin he asked e warming 27 chancery lane  they were all assiduous to hear but he had to repeat it what an odd blurr in his accent whispered the redhaired man wire sir said the young man with the flaxen beard evidently puzzled  he means send an electric telegram volunteered the third a pleasantfaced youth of nineteen or twenty the flaxenbearded man gave a cry of comprehension how stupid of me you may be sure everything shall be done sir he said to graham i am afraid it would be difficult towire to your cousin he is not in london now but dont trouble about arrangements yet you have been asleep a very long time and the important thing is to get over that sir graham concluded the word was sir but this man pronounced it sire  oh said graham and became quiet  it was all very puzzling but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about yet they were odd and the room was odd it seemed he was in some newly established place he had a sudden flash of suspicion surely this wasnt some hall of public exhibition if it was he would give warming a piece of his mind but it scarcely had that character and in a place of public exhibition he would not have discovered himself naked  then suddenly quite abruptly he realised what had happened there was no perceptible interval of suspicion no dawn to his knowledge abruptly he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval as if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that peered into his he looked at them strangely full of intense emotion it seemed they read his eyes he framed his lips to speak and could not a queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery he looked at his bare feet regarding then silently his impulse to speak passed he was trembling exceedingly  they gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty taste and the assurance of returning strength grew  thatthat makes me feel better he said hoarsely and there were murmurs of respectful approval he knew now quite clearly he made to speak again and again he could not  he pressed his throat and tried a third time  how long he asked in a level voice how long have i been asleep  some considerable time said the flaxenbearded man glancing quickly at the others  how long  a very long time  yesyes said graham suddenly testy but i wantis itit issome years many years there was somethingi forget what i feelconfused but you he sobbed you need not fence with me how long  he stopped breathing irregularly he squeezed his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer  they spoke in undertones  five or six he asked faintly more  very much more than that  morel  more  he looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles of his face he looked his question  many years said the man with the red beard  graham struggled into a sitting position he wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand many years he repeated he shut his eyes tight opened them and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar thing to another  how many years he asked  you must be prepared to be surprised  well  more than a gross of years  he was irritated at the strange word more than a what  two of them spoke together some quick remarks that were made about decimal he did not catch  how long did you say asked graham how long dont look like that tell me  among the remarks in an undertone his ear caught six words more than a couple of centuries   what he cried turning on the youth who he thought had spoken who says what was that a couple of centuries  yes said the man with the red beard two hundred years  graham repeated the words he had been prepared to hear of a vast repose and yet these concrete centuries defeated him  two hundred years he said again with the figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind and then oh but  they said nothing  youdid you say  two hundred years two centuries of years said the man with the red beard  there was a pause graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had heard was indeed true  but it cant be he said querulously i am dreaming trances trances dont last that is not rightthis is a joke you have played upon me tell mesome days ago perhaps i was walking along the coast of cornwall  his voice failed him  the man with the flaxen beard hesitated im not very strong in history sir he said weakly and glanced at the others  that was it sir said the youngster boscastle in the old duchy of cornwallits in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows there is a house there still i have been there  boscastle graham turned his eyes to the youngster that was itboscastle little boscastle i fell asleepsomewhere there i dont exactly remember i dont exactly remember  he pressed his brows and whispered more than two hundred years  he began to speak quickly with a twitching face but his heart was cold within him but if it is two hundred years every soul i know every human being that ever i saw or spoke to before i went to sleep must be dead  they did not answer him  the queen and the royal family her ministers of church and state high and low rich and poor one with another  is there england still  thats a comfort is there london e this is london eh and you are my assistantcustodian assistantcustodian and these eh assistantcustodians to  he sat with a gaunt stare on his face but why am i here no dont talk be quiet let me  he sat silent rubbed his eyes and uncovering them found another little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him he took the dose it was almost immediately sustaining directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly  presently he looked at their faces suddenly laughed through his tears a little foolishly buttwohundredyears he said he grimaced hysterically and covered up his face again  after a space he grew calm he sat up his hands hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same attitude in which isbister had found him on the cliff at pentargen his attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice the footsteps of an advancing personage what are you doing why was i not warned surely you could tell someone will suffer for this the man must be kept quiet are the doorways closed all the doorways he must be kept perfectly quiet he must not be told has he been told anything  the man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark and graham looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short fat and thickset beardless man with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes gave his face an oddly formidable expression he scowled momentarily at graham and then his regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard these others he said in a voice of extreme irritation you had better go  go said the redbearded man  certainlygo now but see the doorways are closed as you go  the two men addressed turned obediently after one reluctant glance at graham and instead of going through the archway as he expected walked straight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway and then came a strange thing a long strip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap hung over the two retreating men and fell again and immediately graham was alone with the new comer and the purplerobed man with the flaxen beard  for a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of graham but proceeded to interrogate the otherobviously his subordinateupon the treatment of their charge he spoke clearly but in phrases only partially intelligible to graham the awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him he was evidently profoundly excited  you must not confuse his mind by telling him things he repeated again and again you must not confuse his mind  his questions answered he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression  feel queer he asked  very  the world what you see of it seems strange to you  i suppose i have to live in it strange as it seems  i suppose so now  in the first place hadnt i better have some clothes  they said the thickset man and stopped and the flaxenbearded man met his eye and went away you will very speedily have clothes said the thickset man  is it true indeed that i have been asleep two hundred asked graham  they have told you that have they two hundred and three as a matter of fact  graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth he sat silent for a moment and then asked a question is there a mill or dynamo near here he did not wait for an answer things have changed tremendously i suppose he said  what is that shouting he asked abruptly  nothing said the thickset man impatiently its people youll understand better laterperhaps as you say things have changed he spoke shortly his brows were knit and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in an emergency we must get you clothes and so forth at any rate better wait here until some can come no one will come near you you want shaving  graham rubbed his chin  the man with the flaxen beard came back towards them turned suddenly listened for a moment lifted his eyebrows at the older man and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony the tumult of shouting grew louder and the thickset man turned and listened also he cursed suddenly under his breath and turned his eyes upon graham with an unfriendly expression it was a surge of many voices rising and falling shouting and screaming and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult  then he perceived repeated again and again a certain formula for a time he doubted his ears but surely these were the words show us the sleeper show us the sleeper  the thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway  wild he cried how do they know do they know or is it guessing  there was perhaps an answer  i cant come said the thickset man i have him to see to but shout from the balcony  there was an inaudible reply  say he is not awake anything i leave it to you  he came hurrying back to graham you must have clothes at once he said you cannot stop hereand it will be impossible to  he rushed away graham shouting unanswered questions after him in a moment he was back  i cant tell you what is happening it is too complex to explain in a moment you shall have your clothes made yesin a moment and then i can take you away from here you will find out our troubles soon enough  but those voices they were shouting  something about the sleeperthats you they have some twisted idea i dont know what it is i know nothing  a shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room he listened for a moment regarding a ball of crystal nodded and said a few indistinct words then he walked to the wall through which the two men had vanished it rolled up again like a curtain and he stood waiting  graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restoratives had given him he thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other his head no longer swam he could scarcely credit his rapid recovery he sat feeling his limbs  the man with the flaxen beard reentered from the archway and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man and a lean greybearded man carrying a roll and wearing a tightlyfitting costume of dark green appeared therein  this is the tailor said the thickset man with an introductory gesture it will never do for you to wear that black i cannot understand how it got here but i shall i shall you will be as rapid as possible he said to the tailor  the man in green bowed and advancing seated himself by graham on the bed his manner was calm but his eyes were full of curiosity you will find the fashions altered sire he said he glanced from under his brows at the thickset man  he opened the roller with a quick movement and a confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his knees you lived sire in a period essentially cylindricalthe victorian with a tendency to the hemisphere in hats circular curves always now he flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a keyless watch whirled the knob and beholda little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial walking and turning the tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white satin that is my conception of your immediate treatment he said  the thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of graham  we have very little time he said  trust me said the tailor my machine follows what do you think of this  what is that asked the man from the nineteenth century  in your days they showed you a fashionplate said the tailor but this is our modern development see here the little figure repeated its evolutions but in a different costume or this and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to the dial the tailor was very quick in his movements and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things  it rumbled again and a crophaired anaemic lad with features of the chinese type clad in coarse pale blue canvas appeared together with a complicated machine which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the room incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped graham was invited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some instructions to the crophaired lad who answered in guttural tones and with words graham did not recognise the boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little discs pulling them out until the discs were flat against the body of graham one at each shoulder blade one at the elbows one at the neck and so forth so that at last there were perhaps two score of them upon his body and limbs at the same time some other person entered the room by the lift behind graham the tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faintsounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine and in another moment he was knocking up the levers and graham was released the tailor replaced his cloak of black and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid graham saw over the rim of the glass a palefaced young man regarding him with a singular fixity   the thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully and now turned and went through the archway towards the balcony from which the noise of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences the cropheaded lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine then they ran the entire thing on its easy noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall they made some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift  what is that doing asked graham pointing with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer is thatsome sort of forcelaid on  yes said the man with the flaxen beard  who is that he indicated the archway behind him  the man in purple stroked his little beard hesitated and answered in an undertone he is howard your chief guardian you see sireits a little difficult to explain the council appoints a guardian and assistants this hall has under certain restrictions been public in order that people might satisfy themselves we have barred the doorways for the first time but i thinkif you dont mind i will leave him to explain  odd said graham guardian council then turning his back on the new comer he asked in an undertone why is this man glaring at me is he a mesmerist  mesmerist he is a capillotomist  capillotomist  yesone of the chief his yearly fee is sixdoz lions  it sounded sheer nonsense graham snatched at the last phrase with an unsteady mind sixdoz lions he said  didnt you have lions i suppose not you had the old pounds they are our monetary units  but what was that you saidsixdoz  yes six dozen sire of course things even these little things have altered you lived in the days of the decimal system the arab systemtens and little hundreds and thousands we have eleven numerals now we have single figures for both ten and eleven two figures for a dozen and a dozen dozen makes a gross a great hundred you know a dozen gross a dozand and a dozand dozand a myriad very simple  i suppose so said graham but about this capwhat was it  the man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder  here are your clothes he said graham turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow smiling and holding some palpably new garments over his arm the cropheaded boy by means of one finger was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had arrived graham stared at the completed suit you dont mean to say  just made said the tailor he dropped the garments at the feet of graham walked to the bed on which graham had so recently been lying flung out the translucent mattress and turned up the looking glass as he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner the man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway  the tailor was assisting graham into a dark purple combination garment stockings vest and pants in one as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony they began speaking quickly in an undertone their bearing had an unmistakable quality of anxiety over the purple undergarment came a i complex but graceful garment of bluish white and i graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself sallowfaced unshaven and shaggy still but at least naked no longer and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful  i must shave he said regarding himself in the glass  in a moment said howard  the persistent stare ceased the young man closed his eyes reopened them and with a lean hand extended advanced on graham then he stopped with his hand slowly gesticulating and looked about him  a seat said howard impatiently and in a moment the flaxenbearded man had a chair behind graham sit down please said howard  graham hesitated and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw the glint of steel  dont you understand sire cried the flaxenbearded man with hurried politeness he is going to cut your hair  oh cried graham enlightened but you called him  a capillotomistprecisely he is one of the finest artists in the world  graham sat down abruptly the flaxenbearded man disappeared the capillotomist came forward with graceful gestures examined grahams ears and surveyed him felt the back of his head and would have sat down again to regard him but for howards audible impatience forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements he shaved grahams chin clipped his moustache and cut and arranged his hair all this he did without a word with something of the rapt air of a poet inspired and as soon as he had finished graham was handed a pair of shoes  suddenly a loud voice shoutedit seemed from a piece of machinery in the cornerat onceat once the people know all over the city work is being stopped work is being stopped wait for nothing but come  this shout appeared to perturb howard exceedingly by his gestures it seemed to graham that he hesitated between two directions abruptly he went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little crystal ball as he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the archway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound roared as if it were sweeping past and fell again as if receding swiftly it drew graham after it with an irresistible attraction he glanced at the thickset man and then obeyed his impulse in two strides he was down the steps and in the passage and in a score he was out upon the balcony upon which  the three men had been standing    chapter v the moving ways  he went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward an exclamation of surprise at his appearance and the movements of a number of people came from the spacious area below  his first impression was of overwhelming architecture the place into which he looked was an aisle of titanic buildings curving spaciously in either direction overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge width of the place and a tracery of translucent material shut out the sky gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down through the girders and wires here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables a cliff of edifice hung above him he perceived as he glanced upward and the opposite facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings circular perforations balconies buttresses turret projections myriads of vast windows and an intricate scheme of architectural relief athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering here and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the opposite side of the space and even as graham noted these a remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention this little figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher fastening of one of these festoons hanging forward from a little ledge of masonry and handling some wellnigh invisible strings dependent from the line then suddenly with a swoop that sent grahams heart into his mouth this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round opening on the hither side of the way graham had been looking up as he came out upon the balcony and the things he saw above and opposed to him had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else then suddenly he discovered the roadway it was not a roadway at all as graham understood such things for in the nineteenth century the only roads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth jostling rivulets of vehicles between narrow footways but this roadway was three hundred feet across and it moved it moved all save the middle the lowest part for a moment the motion dazzled his mind then he understood  under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to grahams right an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century express train an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures of the street upon it were seats and here and there little kiosks but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein from this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended to the centre of the space each moved to the right each perceptibly slower than the one above it but the difference in pace was small enough to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent and so walk uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle way beyond this middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with varying pace to grahams left and seated in crowds upon the two widest and swiftest platforms or stepping from one to another down the steps or swarming over the central space was an innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people  you must not stop here shouted howard suddenly at his side you must come away at once  graham made no answer he heard without hearing the platforms ran with a roar and the people were shouting he perceived women and girls with flowing hair beautifully robed with bands crossing between the breasts these first came out of the confusion then he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale blue that the tailors boy had worn he became aware of cries of the sleeper what has happened to the sleeper and it seemed as though the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of human faces and then still more thickly he saw pointing fingers he perceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blueclad people some sort of struggle had sprung into life people seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on either side and carried away against their will they would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the confusion and run back towards the conflict  it is the sleeper verily it is the sleeper shouted voices that is never the sleeper shouted others more and more faces were turned to him at the intervals along this central area graham noted openings pits apparently the heads of staircases going down with people ascending out of them and descending into them the struggle it seemed centred about the one of these nearest to him people were running down the moving platforms to this leaping dexterously from platform to platform the clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide their interest between this point and the balcony a number of sturdy little figures clad in a uniform of bright red and working methodically together were employed it seemed in preventing access to this descending staircase about them a crowd was rapidly accumulating their brilliant colour contrasted vividly with the whitishblue of their antagonists for the struggle was indisputable  he saw these things with howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm and then suddenly howard was gone and he stood alone  he perceived that the cries of the sleeper grew in volume and that the people on the nearer platform were standing up the nearer swifter platform he perceived was empty to the right of him and far across the space the platform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded and passing away bare with incredible swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space before his eyes a dense swaying mass of people and the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous incessant clamour the sleeper the sleeper and yells and cheers a waving of garments and cries of stop the ways they were also crying another name strange to graham it sounded like ostrog the slower platforms were soon thick with active people running against the movement so as to keep themselves opposite to him  stop the ways they cried agile figures ran up swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest to him were borne rapidly past him shouting strange unintelligible things and ran back obliquely to the central way one thing he distinguished it is indeed the sleeper it is indeed the sleeper they testified  for a space graham stood without a movement then he became vividly aware that all this concerned him he was pleased at his wonderful popularity he bowed and seeking a gesture of longer range waved his arm he was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked the tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence he became aware of crowded balconies of men sliding along ropes of men in trapezelike seats hurling athwart the space he heard voices behind him a number of people descending the steps through the archway he suddenly perceived that his guardian howard was back again and gripping his arm painfully and shouting inaudibly in his ear  he turned and howards face was white come back he heard they will stop the ways the whole city will be in confusion  he perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars behind howard the redhaired man the man with the flaxen beard a tall man in vivid vermilion a crowd of others in red carrying staves and all these people had anxious eager faces  get him away cried howard  but why said graham i dont see  you must come away said the man in red in a resolute voice his face and eyes were resolute too grahams glances went from face to face and he was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life compulsion some one gripped his arm he was being dragged away it seemed as though the tumult suddenly became two as if half the shouts that had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the passages of the great building behind him marvelling and confused feeling an impotent desire to resist graham was half led half thrust along the passage of blue pillars and suddenly he found himself alone with howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward    chapter vi the hall of the atlas  from the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when graham found himself in the lift was altogether barely five minutes and as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched everything with wonder with a sense of the irrational with something of the quality of a realistic dream he was still detached an astonished spectator still but half involved in life what he had seen and especially the last crowded tumult framed in the setting of the balcony had a spectacular turn like a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre i dont understand he said what was the trouble my mind is in a whirl why were they shouting what is the danger  we have our troubles said howard his eyes avoided grahams enquiry this is a time of unrest and in fact your appearance your waking just now has a sort of connexion  he spoke jerkily like a man not quite sure of his breathing he stopped abruptly  i dont understand said graham  it will be clearer later said howard  he glanced uneasily upward as though he found the progress of the lift slow  i shall understand better no doubt when i have seen my way about a little said graham puzzled it will beit is bound to be perplexing at present it is all so strange anything seems possible anything in the details even your counting i understand is different  the lift stopped and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passage between high walls along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables  what a huge place this is said graham is it all one building what place is it  this is one of the city ways for various public services light and so forth  was it a social troublethatin the great roadway place how are you governed have you still a police several said howard  several  about fourteen  i dont understand  very probably not our social order will probably seem very complex to you to tell you the truth i dont understand it myself very clearly nobody does you will perhapsbye and bye we have to go to the council  grahams attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his inquiries and the people in the passages and halls they were traversing for a moment his mind would be concentrated upon howard and the halting answers he made and then he would lose the thread in response to some vivid unexpected impression along the passages in the halls half the people seemed to be men in the red uniform the pale blue canvas that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear invariably these men looked at him and saluted him and howard as they passed  he had a clear vision of entering a long corridor and there were a number of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class he saw no teacher but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice proceeded the girls regarded him and his conductor he thought with curiosity and astonishment but he was hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the gathering he judged they knew howard and not himself and that they wondered who he was this howard it seemed was a person of importance but then he was also merely grahams guardian that was odd  there came a passage in twilight and into this passage a footway hung so that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon but no more of them then vague impressions of galleries and of casual astonished passersby turning round to stare after the two of them with their redclad guard  the stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary he was speedily fatigued by this excessive haste he asked howard to slacken his speed presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great street space but this was glazed and did not open and they were too high for him to see the moving platforms below but he saw people going to and fro along cables and along strange fraillooking ridges  and thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it they crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass so clear that it made him giddy even to remember it the floor of it also was of glass from his memory of the cliffs between new quay and boscastle so remote in time and so recent in his experience it seemed to him that they must be near four hundred feet above the moving ways he stopped looked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes minute and foreshortened struggling and gesticulating still towards the little balcony far below a little toy balcony it seemed where he had so recently been standing a thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of light obscured everything a man seated in a little openwork cradle shot by from some point still higher than the little narrow bridge rushing down a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling graham stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in a great circular opening below and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle  along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots this broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony and went pouring down the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central area these men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons they seemed to be striking and thrusting a great shouting cries of wrath screaming burst out and came up to graham faint and thin go on cried howard laying hands on him  another man rushed down a cable graham suddenly glanced up to see whence he came and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of windmills and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky then howard had thrust him forward across the bridge and he was in a little narrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns  i want to see more of that cried graham resisting  no no cried howard still gripping his arm  this way you must go this way and the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce his orders  some negroes in a curious wasplike uniform of black and yellow appeared down the passage and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed a door to graham and led the way through it graham found himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber the attendant in black and yellow crossed this thrust up a second shutter and stood waiting  this place had the appearance of an anteroom he saw a number of people in the central space and at the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the top of a flight of steps heavily curtained but giving a glimpse of some still larger hall beyond he perceived white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about those portals  as they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below the sleeper and was aware of a turning of heads a hum of observation they entered another little passage in the wall of this antechamber and then he found himself on an ironrailed gallery of metal that passed round the side of the great hall he had already seen through the curtains he entered the place at the corner so that he received the fullest impression of its huge proportions the black in the wasp uniform stood aside like a welltrained servant and closed the valve behind him  compared with any of the places graham had see thus far this second hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness on a pedestal at the remote end and more brilliantly lit than any other object was a gigantic white figure of atlas strong and strenuous the globe upon his bowed shoulders it was the first thing to strike his attention it was so vast so patiently and painfully real so white and simple save for this figure and for a dais in the centre the wide floor of the place was a shining vacancy the dais was remote in the greatness of the area it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group of seven men who stood about a table on it and gave an inkling of its proportions they were all dressed in white robes they seemed to have arisen that moment from their seats and they were regarding graham steadfastly at the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances  howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mighty labouring figure then he stopped the two men in red who had followed them into the gallery came and stood on either hand of graham  you must remain here murmured howard for a few moments and without waiting for a reply hurried away along the gallery  but why began graham  he moved as if to follow howard and found his path obstructed by one of the men in red you have to wait here sire said the man in red  why  orders sire  whose orders  our orders sire  graham looked his exasperation  what place is this he said presently who are those men  they are the lords of the council sire  what council  the council  oh said graham and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other man went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white who stood watching him and whispering together  the council he perceived there were now eight though how the newcomer had arrived he had not observed they made no gestures of greeting they stood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might have stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly floated into view what council could it be that gathered there that little body of men beneath the significant white atlas secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness and why should he be brought to them and be looked at strangely and spoken of inaudibly howard appeared beneath walking quickly across the polished floor towards them as he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar movements apparently of a ceremonious nature then he ascended the steps of the dais and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table  graham watched that visible inaudible conversation occasionally one of the whiterobed men would glance towards him he strained his ears in vain the gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated he glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants when he looked again howard was extending his hands and moving his head like a man who protests he was interrupted it seemed by one of the whiterobed men rapping the table  the conversation lasted an interminable time to grahams sense his eyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the council sat thence they wandered at last to the walls of the hall it was decorated in long painted panels of a quasijapanese type many of them very beautiful these panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark metal which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries and the great structural lines of the interior the facile grace of these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre of the scheme grahams eyes came back to the council and howard was descending the steps as he drew nearer his features could be distinguished and graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his cheeks his countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared along the gallery  this way he said concisely and they went on in silence to a little door that opened at their approach the two men in red stopped on either side of this door howard and graham passed in and graham glancing back saw the whiterobed council still standing in a close group and looking at him then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud and for the first time since his awakening he was in silence the floor even was noiseless to his feet  howard opened another door and they were in the first of two contiguous chambers furnished in white and green what council was that began graham what were they discussing what have they to do with me howard closed the door carefully heaved a huge sigh and said something in an undertone he walked slanting ways across the room and turned blowing out his cheeks again ugh he grunted a man relieved  graham stood regarding him  you must understand began howard abruptly avoiding grahams eyes that our social order is very complex a half explanation a bare unqualified statement would give you false impressions as a matter of factit is a case of compound interest partlyyour small fortune and the fortune of your cousin warming which was left to youand certain other beginningshave become very considerable and in other ways that will be hard for you to understand you have become a person of significanceof very considerable significanceinvolved in the worlds affairs  he stopped  yes said graham  we have grave social troubles  yes  things have come to such a pass that in fact is advisable to seclude you here  keep me prisoner exclaimed graham  wellto ask you to keep in seclusion  graham turned on him this is strange he said  no harm will be done you  no harm  but you must be kept here  while i learn my position i presume  precisely  very well then begin why harm  not now  why not  it is too long a story sire  all the more reason i should begin at once you say i am a person of importance what was that shouting i heard why is a great multitude shouting and excited because my trance is over and who are the men in white in that huge council chamber  all in good time sire said howard but not crudely not crudely this is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind your awakening no one expected your awakening the council is consulting  what council  the council you saw  graham made a petulant movement this is not right he said i should be told what is happening  you must wait really you must wait  graham sat down abruptly i suppose since i have waited so long to resume life he said that i must wait a little longer  that is better said howard yes that is much better and i must leave you alone for a space while i attend the discussion in the council i am sorry  he went towards the noiseless door hesitated and vanished  graham walked to the door tried it found it securely fastened in some way he never came to understand turned about paced the room restlessly made the circuit of the room and sat down he remained sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow biting his finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions of this first hour of awakened life the vast mechanical spaces the endless series of chambers and passages the great struggle that roared and splashed through these strange ways the little group of remote unsympathetic men beneath the colossal atlas howards mysterious behaviour there was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in his minda vast inheritance perhaps misappliedof some unprecedented importance and opportunity what had he to do and this rooms secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment  it came into grahams mind with irresistible conviction that this series of magnificent impressions was a dream he tried to shut his eyes and succeeded but that timehonoured device led to no awakening  presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments of the two small rooms in which he found himself  in a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished he was clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white with a little greyshot beard trimmed to a point and his hair its blackness streaked now with bands of grey arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but graceful manner he seemed a man of fiveandforty perhaps for a moment he did not perceive this was himself  a flash of laughter came with the recognition to call on old warming like this he exclaimed and make him take me out to lunch  then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiar acquaintances of his early manhood and in the midst of his amusement realised that every soul with whom he might jest had died many score of years ago the thought smote him abruptly and keenly he stopped short the expression of his face changed to a white consternation  the tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of that wonderful street reasserted itself the shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid and those remote inaudible unfriendly councilors in white he felt himself a little figure very small and ineffectual pitifully conspicuous and all about him the world wasstrange    chapter vii in the silent rooms  presently graham resumed his examination of his apartments curiosity kept him moving in spite of his fatigue the inner room he perceived was high and its ceiling dome shaped with an oblong aperture in the centre opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating apparently driving the air up the shaft the faint humming note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place as these vans sprang up one after the other graham could get transient glimpses of the sky he was surprised to see a star  this drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the cornices there were no windows and he began to recall that along all the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with howard he had observed no windows at all had there been windows there were windows on the street indeed but were they for light or was the whole city lit day and night for evermore so that there was no night there  and another thing dawned upon him there was no fireplace in either room was the season summer and were these merely summer apartments or was the whole city uniformly heated or cooled he became interested in these questions began examining the smooth texture of the walls the simply constructed bed the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom service was practically abolished and over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament a bare grace of form and colour that he found very pleasing to the eye there were several very comfortable chairs a light table on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses and two plates bearing a clear substance like jelly then he noticed there were no books no newspapers no writing materials the world has changed indeed he said  he observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized with the decorative scheme of the room and in the centre of this side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a white smooth face to the room a chair faced this he had a transitory idea that these cylinders might be books or a modern substitute for books but at first it did not seem so  the lettering on the cylinders puzzled him at first sight it seemed like russian then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated english about certain of the words                     oi man huwdbi kin  forced itself on him as the man who would be king phonetic spelling he said he remembered reading a story with that title then he recalled the story vividly one of the best stories in the world but this thing before him was not a book as he understood it he puzzled out the titles of two adjacent cylinders the heart of darkness he had never heard of before nor the madonna of the futureno doubt if they were indeed stories they were by post victorian authors  he puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that he opened a sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within and on the upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell he pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased he became aware of voices and music and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face he suddenly realised what this might be and stepped back to regard it  on the flat surface was now a little picture very vividly coloured and in this picture were figures that moved not only did they move but they were conversing in clear small voices it was exactly like reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube his interest was seized at once by the situation which presented a man pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant woman both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so strange to graham i have worked said the man but what have you been doing  ah said graham he forgot everything else and sat down in the chair within five minutes he heard himself named heard when the sleeper wakes used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement and passed himself by a thing remote and incredible but in a little while he knew those two people like intimate friends  at last the miniature drama came to an end and the square face of the apparatus was blank again  it was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see unscrupulous pleasure seeking energetic subtle a world too of dire economic struggle there were allusions he did not understand incidents that conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals flashes of dubious enlightenment the blue canvas that bulked so largely in his first impression of the city ways appeared again and again as the costume of the common people he had no doubt the story was contemporary and its intense realism was undeniable and the end had been a tragedy that oppressed him he sat staring at the blankness  he started and rubbed his eyes he had been so absorbed in the latterday substitute for a novel that he awoke to the little green and white room with more than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening  he stood up and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland the clearness of the kinetoscope drama passed and the struggle in the vast place of streets the ambiguous council the swift phases of his waking hour came back these people had spoken of the council with suggestions of a vague universality of power and they had spoken of the sleeper it had not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the sleeper he had to recall precisely what they had said  he walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of the revolving fan as the fan swept round a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery came in rhythmic eddies all else was silence   though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments he perceived the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blueblack almost with a dust of little stars  he resumed his examination of the rooms he could find no way of opening the padded door no bell nor other means of calling for attendance his feeling of wonder was in abeyance but he was curious anxious for information he wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things he tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him presently he became restless and eager for information for distraction for fresh sensations  he went back to the apparatus in the other room and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing the cylinders by others as he did so it came into his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the language so that it was still clear and understandable after two hundred years the haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia at first it was beautiful and then it was sensuous he presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of the story of tannhauser the music was unfamiliar but the rendering was realistic and with a contemporary unfamiliarity tannhauser did not go to a venusberg but to a pleasure city what was a pleasure city a dream surely the fancy of a fantastic voluptuous writer  he became interested curious the story developed with a flavour of strangely twisted sentimentality suddenly he did not like it he liked it less as it proceeded  he had a revulsion of feeling these were no pictures no idealisations but photographed realities he wanted no more of the twentysecond century venusberg he forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth century art and gave way to an archaic indignation he rose angry and half ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude he pulled forward the apparatus and with some violence sought for a means of stopping its action something snapped a violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the thing was still when he attempted next day to replace these tannhauser cylinders by another pair he found the apparatus broken  he struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro struggling with intolerable vast impressions the things he had derived from the cylinders and the things he had seen conflicted confused him it seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times we were making the future he said and hardly any of us troubled to think what future we were making and here it is  what have they got to what has been done how do i come into the midst of it all the vastness of street and house he was prepared for the multitudes of people but conflicts in the city ways and the systematised sensuality of a class of rich men  he thought of bellamy the hero of whose socialistic utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience but here was no utopia no socialistic state he had already seen enough to realise that the ancient antithesis of luxury waste and sensuality on the one hand and abject poverty on the other still prevailed he knew enough of the essential factors of life to understand that correlation and not only were the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the street gigantic but the voices he had heard in the ways the uneasiness of howard the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent what country was he in still england it seemed and yet strangely unenglish his mind glanced at the rest of the world and saw only an enigmatical veil  he prowled about his apartment examining everything as a caged animal might do he felt very tired felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of rest he listened for long spaces under the ventilator to catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the city  he began to talk to himself two hundred and three years he said to himself over and over again laughing stupidly then i am two hundred and thirtythree years old the oldest inhabitant surely they havent reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the rule of the oldest my claims are indisputable mumble mumble i remember the bulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday tis a great age ha ha he was surprised at first to hear himself laughing and then laughed again deliberately and louder then he realised that he was behaving foolishly steady he said steady  his pacing became more regular this new world he said i dont understand it why but it is all why  i suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things let me try and remember just how it began  he was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first thirty years had become he remembered fragments for the most part trivial moments things of no great importance that he had observed his boyhood seemed the most accessible at first he recalled school books and certain lessons in mensuration then he revived the more salient features of his life memories of the wife long since dead her magic influence now gone beyond corruption of his rivals and friends and betrayers of the swift decision of this issue and that and then of his last years of misery of fluctuating resolves and at last of his strenuous studies in a little while he perceived he had it all again dim perhaps like metal long laid aside but in no way defective or injured capable of repolishing and the hue of it was a deepening misery was it worth repolishing by a miracle he had been lifted out of a life that had become intolerable  he reverted to his present condition he wrestled with the facts in vain it became an inextricable tangle he saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn an old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his memory i must sleep he said it appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distress and from the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs he went to the strange little bed lay down and was presently asleep  he was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments before he left them for he remained imprisoned for three days during that time no one except howard entered his prison the marvel of his fate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his survival he had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this unaccountable solitude howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids and light and pleasant foods quite strange to graham he always closed the door carefully as he entered on matters of detail he was increasingly obliging but the bearing of graham on the great issues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond the soundproof walls that enclosed him he would not elucidate he evaded as politely as possible every question on the position of affairs in the outer world  and in those three days grahams incessant thoughts went far and wide all that he had seen all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing worked together in his mind almost every possible interpretation of his position he debatedeven as it chanced the right interpretation things that presently happened to him came to him at last credible by virtue of this seclusion when at length the moment of his release arrived it found him prepared  howards bearing went far to deepen grahams impression of his own strange importance the door between its opening and closing seemed to admit with him a breath of momentous happening his enquiries became more definite and searching howard retreated through protests and difficulties the awakening was unforeseen he repeated it happened to have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion  to explain it i must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years protested howard  the thing is this said graham you are afraid of something i shall do in some way i am arbitratori might be arbitrator  it is not that but you havei may tell you this muchthe automatic increase of your property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands and in certain other ways you have influence with your eighteenth century notions  nineteenth century corrected graham  with your old world notions anyhow ignorant as you are of every feature of our state  am i a fool  certainly not  do i seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly  you were never expected to act at all no one counted on your awakening no one dreamt you would ever awake the council had surrounded you with antiseptic conditions as a matter of fact we thought that you were deada mere arrest of decay andbut it is too complex we dare not suddenlywhile you are still half awake  it wont do said graham suppose it is as you saywhy am i not being crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibilities am i any wiser now than two days ago if it is two days when i awoke  howard pulled his lip  i am beginning to feelevery hour i feel more clearlya sense of complex concealment of which you are the salient point is this council or committee or whatever they are cooking the accounts of my estate is that it  that note of suspicion said howard  ugh said graham now mark my words it will be ill for those who have put me here it will be ill i am alive make no doubt of it i am alive every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more vigorous no more quiescence i am a man come back to life and i want to live  live  howards face lit with an idea he came towards graham and spoke in an easy confidential tone  the council secludes you here for your good you are restless naturallyan energetic man you find it dull here but we are anxious that everything you may desireevery desireevery sort of desire there may be something is there any sort of company  he paused meaningly  yes said graham thoughtfully there is  ah now we have treated you neglectfully  the crowds in yonder streets of yours  that said howard i am afraid but  graham began pacing the room howard stood near the door watching him the implication of howards suggestion was only half evident to graham company suppose he were to accept the proposal demand some sort of company would there be any possibilities of gathering from the conversation of this additional person some vague inkling of the struggle that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment he meditated again and the suggestion took colour he turned on howard abruptly  what do you mean by company  howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders human beings he said with a curious smile on his heavy face  our social ideas he said have a certain increased liberality perhaps in comparison with your times if a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as thisby feminine society for instance we think it no scandal we have cleared our minds of formulae there is in our city a class a necessary class no longer despiseddiscreet  graham stopped dead  it would pass the time said howard it is a thing i should perhaps have thought of before but as a matter of fact so much is happening  he indicated the exterior world  graham hesitated for a moment the figure of a possible woman that his imagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense attraction then he flashed into anger  no he shouted  he began striding rapidly up and down the room  everything you say everything you do convinces meof some great issue in which i am concerned i do not want to pass the time as you call it yes i know desire and indulgence are life in a senseand death extinction in my life before i slept i had worked out that pitiful question i will not begin again there is a city a multitude and meanwhile i am here like a rabbit in a bag  his rage surged high he choked for a moment and began to wave his clenched fists he gave way to an anger fit he swore archaic curses his gestures had the quality of physical threats  i do not know who your party may be i am in the dark and you keep me in the dark but i know this that i am secluded here for no good purpose for no good purpose i warn you i warn you of the consequences once i come at my power  he realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself he stopped howard stood regarding him with a curious expression  i take it this is a message to the council said howard  graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man fell or stun him it must have shown upon his face at any rate howards movement was quick in a second the noiseless door had closed again and the man from the nineteenth century was alone  for a moment he stood rigid with clenched hands half raised then he flung them down what a fool i have been he said and gave way to his anger again stamping about the room and shouting curses for a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy raging at his position at his own folly at the knaves who had imprisoned him he did this because he did not want to look calmly at his position he clung to his angerbecause he was afraid of fear  presently he found himself reasoning with himself this imprisonment was unaccountable but no doubt the legal formsnew legal formsof the time permitted it it must of course be legal these people were two hundred years further on in the march of civilisation than the victorian generation it was not likely they would be lesshumane yet they had cleared their minds of formulae was humanity a formula as well as chastity  his imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him the attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions though for the most part logically valid were quite unavailing why should anything be done to me  if the worst comes to the worst he found himself saying at last i can give up what they want but what do they want and why dont they ask me for it instead of cooping me up  he returned to his former preoccupation with the councils possible intentions he began to reconsider the details of howards behaviour sinister glances inexplicable hesitations then for a time his mind circled about the idea of escaping from these rooms but whither could he escape into this vast crowded world he would be worse off than a saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century london and besides how could anyone escape from these rooms  how can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me  he thought of the tumult the great social trouble of which he was so unaccountably the axis a text irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent came floating up out of the darkness of his memory this also a council had said  it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people    chapter viii the roof spaces  as the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and permitted glimpses of the night dim sounds drifted in thereby and graham standing underneath wrestling darkly with the unknown powers that imprisoned him and which he had now deliberately challenged was startled by the sound of a voice  he peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation dark and dim the face and shoulders of a man regarding him when a dark hand was extended the swift fan struck it swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor dripping silently  graham looked down and there were spots of blood at his feet he looked up again in a strange excitement the figure had gone  he remained motionlesshis every sense intent upon the flickering patch of darkness for outside it was high night he became aware of some faint remote dark specks floating lightly through the outer air they came down towards him fitfully eddyingly and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan a gleam of light flickered the specks flashed white and then the darkness came again warmed and lit as he was he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him  graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again he saw the head of a man pass near there was a sound of whispering then a smart blow on some metallic substance effort voices and the vans stopped a gust of snowflakes whirled into the room and vanished before they touched the floor dont be afraid said a voice  graham stood under the fan who are you he whispered  for a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan and then the head of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening his face appeared nearly inverted to graham his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes of snow upon it his arm went up into the darkness holding something unseen he had a youthful face and bright eyes and the veins of his forehead were swollen he seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his position  for several seconds neither he nor graham spoke  you were the sleeper said the stranger at last  yes said graham what do you want with me  i come from ostrog sire  ostrog  the man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was towards graham he appeared to be listening suddenly there was a hasty exclamation and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the sweep of the released fan and when graham peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly falling snow  it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the ventilator but at last came the same metallic interference again the fans stopped and the face reappeared graham had remained all this time in the same place alert and tremulously excited  who are you what do you want he said  we want to speak to you sire said the intruder  we wanti cant hold the thing we have been trying to find a way to you these three days  is it rescue whispered graham escape  yes sire if you will  you are my partythe party of the sleeper  yes sire  what am i to do said graham  there was a struggle the strangers arm appeared and his hand was bleeding his knees came into view over the edge of the funnel stand away from me he said and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and one shoulder at grahams feet the released ventilator whirled noisily the stranger rolled over sprang up nimbly and stood panting hand to a bruised shoulder and with his bright eyes on graham  you are indeed the sleeper he said i saw you asleep when it was the law that anyone might see you  i am the man who was in the trance said graham they have imprisoned me here i have been here since i awokeat least three days  the intruder seemed about to speak heard something glanced swiftly at the door and suddenly left graham and ran towards it shouting quick incoherent words a bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand and he began tap tap a quick succession of blows upon the hinges mind cried a voice oh the voice came from above  graham glanced up saw the soles of two feet ducked was struck on the shoulder by one of them and a heavy weight bore him to the earth he fell on his knees and forward and the weight went over his head he knelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him  i did not see you sire panted the man he rose and assisted graham to arise are you hurt sire he panted a succession of heavy blows on the ventilator began something fell close to grahams face and a shivering edge of white metal danced fell over and lay flat upon the floor  what is this cried graham confused and looking at the ventilator who are you what are you going to do remember i understand nothing  stand back said the stranger and drew him from under the ventilator as another fragment of metal fell heavily  we want you to come sire panted the newcomer and graham glancing at his face again saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his forehead and a couple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom your people call for you  come where my people  to the hall about the markets your life is in danger here we have spies we learned but just in time the council has decidedthis very dayeither to drug or kill you and everything is ready the people are drilled the windvane police the engineers and half the waygearers are with us we have the halls crowdedshouting the whole city shouts against the council we have arms he wiped the blood with his hand your life here is not worth but why arms  the people have risen to protect you sire what  he turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing with his teeth graham saw the latter start back gesticulate to them to conceal themselves and move as if to hide behind the opening door  as he did so howard appeared a little tray in one hand and his heavy face downcast he started looked up the door slammed behind him the tray tilted sideways and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear he went down like a felled tree and lay as he fell athwart the floor of the outer room the man who had struck him bent hastily studied his face for a moment rose and returned to his work at the door  your poison said a voice in grahams ear  then abruptly they were in darkness the innumerable cornice lights had been extinguished graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily three knelt on the fan some dim thinga ladder was being lowered through the opening and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light  he had a moment of hesitation but the manner of these men their swift alacrity their words marched so completely with his own fears of the council with his idea and hope of a rescue that it lasted not a moment and his people awaited him  i do not understand he said i trust tell me what to do  the man with the cut brow gripped grahams arm  clamber up the ladder he whispered quick they will have heard  graham felt for the ladder with extended hands put his foot on the lower rung and turning his head saw over the shoulder of the nearest man in the yellow flicker of the light the firstcomer astride over howard and still working at the door graham turned to the ladder again and was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above and then he was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating funnel  he shivered he was aware of a great difference in the temperature half a dozen men stood about him and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and melted for a moment it was dark then for a flash a ghastly violet white and then everything was dark again  he saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which had replaced the miscellaneous houses streets and open spaces of victorian london the place upon which he stood was level with huge serpentine cables lying athwart it in every direction the circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snowfall and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful white light smote up from below touched the snow eddies with a transient glitter and made an evanescent spectre in the night and here and there low down some vaguely outlined winddriven mechanism flickered with livid sparks  all this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood about him someone threw a thick soft cloak of furlike texture about him and fastened it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders things were said briefly decisively someone thrust him forward  before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm this way said this shape urging him along and pointed graham across the flat roof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light graham obeyed  mind said a voice as graham stumbled against a cable between them and not across them said the voice and we must hurry  where are the people said graham the people you said awaited me  the stranger did not answer he left grahams arm as the path grew narrower and led the way with rapid strides graham followed blindly in a minute he found himself running are the others coming he panted but received no reply his companion glanced back and ran on they came to a sort of pathway of open metalwork transverse to the direction they had come and they turned aside to follow this graham looked back but the snowstorm had hidden the others  come on said his guide running now they drew near a little windmill spinning high in the air stoop said grahams guide and they avoided an endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane this way and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow between two low walls of metal that presently rose waist high i will go first said the guide graham drew his cloak about him and followed then suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side graham peeped over the side once and the gulf was black for a moment he regretted his flight he dared not look again and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow  then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow and for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that went to and fro underneath he hesitated at this unstable looking substance but his guide ran on unheeding and so they came to and clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass round this they went far below a number of people seemed to be dancing and music filtered through the dome graham fancied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm and his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of haste they clambered panting to a space of huge windmills one so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow they hurried for a time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports and came at last above a place of moving platforms like the place into which graham had looked from the balcony they crawled across the sloping transparency that covered this street of platforms crawling on hands and knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall  for the most part the glass was bedewed and graham saw only hazy suggestions of the forms below but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was clear and he found himself looking sheerly down upon it all for awhile in spite of the urgency of his guide he gave way to vertigo and lay spreadeagled on the glass sick and paralysed far below mere stirring specks and dots went the people of the unsleeping city in their perpetual daylight and the moving platforms ran on their incessant journey messengers and men on unknown businesses shot along the drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowded with men it was like peering into a gigantic glass hive and it lay vertically below him with only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall the street showed warm and lit and graham was wet now to the skin with thawing snow and his feet were numbed with cold for a space he could not move  come on cried his guide with terror in his voice come on  graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort  over the ridge following his guides example he turned about and slid backward down the opposite slope very swiftly amid a little avalanche of snow while he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some broken gap should come in his way at the edge he stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush thanking heaven for an opaque footing again his guide was already clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse  through the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast windmills and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced with a deafening sound it was a mechanical shrilling of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously from every point of the compass  they have missed us already cried grahams guide in an accent of terror and suddenly with a blinding flash the night became day  above the driving snow from the summits of the windwheels appeared vast masts carrying globes of livid light they receded in illimitable vistas in every direction as far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall they glared  get on this cried grahams conductor and thrust him forward to a long grating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly sloping expanses of snow it felt warm to grahams benurrled feet and a faint eddy of steam rose from it  come on shouted his guide ten yards off and without waiting ran swiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the next range of windwheels graham recovering from his astonishment followed as fast convinced of his imminent capture  in a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black shadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels grahams conductor ran on for some time and suddenly darted sideways and vanished into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge support in another moment graham was beside him  they cowered panting and stared out  the scene upon which graham looked was very wild and strange the snow had now almost ceased only a belated flake passed now and again across the picture but the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly white broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable darkness vast ungainly titans of shadow all about them huge metallic structures iron girders inhumanly vast as it seemed to him interlaced and the edges of windwheels scarcely moving in the lull i passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up into a luminous haze wherever the snowspangled light struck down beams and girders and incessant bands running with a halting indomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black and with all that mighty activity with an omnipresent sense of motive and design this snowclad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save themselves seemed as trackless and deserted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessible alpine snowfield  they will be chasing us cried the leader we are scarcely halfway there yet cold as it is we must hide here for a spaceat least until it snows more thickly again  his teeth chattered in his head  where are the markets asked graham staring out where are all the people  the other made no answer   look whispered graham crouched close and became very still  the snow had suddenly become thick again and sliding with the whirling eddies out of the black pit of the sky came something vague and large and very swift it came down in a steep curve and swept round wide wings extended and a trail of white condensing steam behind it rose with an easy swiftness and went gliding up the air swept horizontally forward in a wide curve and vanished again in the steaming specks of snow and through the ribs of its body graham saw two little men very minute and active searching the snowy areas about him as it seemed to him with field glasses for a second they were clear then hazy through a thick whirl of snow then small and distant and in a minute they were gone  now cried his companion come  he pulled grahams sleeve and incontinently the two were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork beneath the windwheels graham running blindly collided with his leader who had turned back on him suddenly he found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm it extended as far as he could see right and left it seemed to cut off their progress in either direction  do as i do whispered his guide he lay down and crawled to the edge thrust his head over and twisted until one leg hung he seemed to feel for something with his foot found it and went sliding over the edge into the gulf his head reappeared it is a ledge he whispered in the dark all the way along do as i did  graham hesitated went down upon all fours crawled to the edge and peered into a velvety blackness for a sickly moment he had courage neither to go on nor retreat then he sat and hung his leg down felt his guides hands pulling at him had a horrible sensation of sliding over the edge into the unfathomable splashed and felt himself in a slushy gutter impenetrably dark  this way whispered the voice and he began crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw pressing himself against the wall they continued along it for some minutes he seemed to pass through a hundred stages of misery to pass minute after minute through a hundred degrees of cold damp and exhaustion in a little while he ceased to feel his hands and feet  the gutter sloped downwards he observed that they were now many feet below the edge of the buildings rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts of blinddrawn windows rose above them they came to the end of a cable fastened above one of these white windows dimly visible and dropping into impenetrable shadows suddenly his hand came against his guides  still whispered the latter very softly  he looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of snowflecked greyblue sky in a moment it was hidden again  keep still they were just turning  for awhile both were motionless then grahams companion stood up and reaching towards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle  what is that asked graham  the only answer was a faint cry the man crouched motionless graham peered and saw his face dimly he was staring down the long ribbon of sky and graham following his eyes saw the flying machine small and faint and remote then he saw that the wings spread on either side that it headed towards them that every moment it grew larger it was following the edge of the chasm towards them  the mans movements became convulsive he thrust two cross bars into grahams hand graham could not see them he ascertained their form by feeling they were slung by thin cords to the cable on the cord were hand grips of some soft elastic substance put the cross between your legs whispered the guide hysterically and grip the holdfasts grip tightly grip  graham did as he was told  jump said the voice in heavens name jump  for one momentous second graham could not speak he was glad afterwards that darkness hid his face he said nothing he began to tremble violently he looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky as it rushed upon him  jump jumpin gods name or they will have us cried grahams guide and in the violence of his passion thrust him forward  graham tottered convulsively gave a sobbing cry a cry in spite of himself and then as the flying machine swept over them fell forward into the pit of that darkness seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes with the clutch of death something cracked something rapped smartly against a wall he heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its rope he heard the aeronauts shout he felt a pair of knees digging into his back he was sweeping headlong through the air falling through the air all his strength was in his hands he would have screamed but he had no breath  he shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter he recognised the great passage with the running ways the hanging lights and interlacing girders they rushed upward and by him he had a momentary impression of a great circular aperture yawning to swallow him up  he was in the dark again falling falling gripping with aching hands and behold a clap of sound a burst of light and he was in a brightly lit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet the people his people a proscenium a stage rushed up towards him and his cable swept down to a circular aperture to the right of this he felt he was travelling slower and suddenly very much slower he distinguished shouts of saved the master he is safe the stage rushed up towards him with rapidly diminishing swiftness then  he heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified and this shout was echoed by a shout from below he felt that he was no longer gliding along the cable but falling with it there was a tumult of yells screams and cries he felt something soft against his extended hand and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm  he wanted to be still and the people were lifting him he believed afterwards he was carried to the platform and given some drink but he was never sure he did not notice what became of his guide when his mind was clear again he was on his feet eager hands were assisting him to stand he was in a big alcove occupying the position that in his previous experience had been devoted to the lower boxes if this was indeed a theatre  a mighty tumult was in his ears a thunderous roar the shouting of a countless multitude it is the sleeper the sleeper is with us  the sleeper is with us the masterthe owner the master is with us he is safe  graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people he saw no individuals he was conscious of a froth of pink faces of waving arms and garments he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over him buoying him up there were balconies galleries great archways giving remoter perspectives and everywhere people a vast arena of people densely packed and cheering across the nearer space lay the collapsed cable like a huge snake it had been cut by the men of the flying machine at its upper end and had crumpled down into the hall men seemed to be hauling this out of the way but the whole effect was vague the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices  he stood unsteadily and looked at those about him someone supported him by one arm let me go into a little room he said weeping a little room and could say no more a man in black stepped forward took his disengaged arm he was aware of officious men opening a door before him someone guided him to a seat he staggered he sat down heavily and covered his face with his hands he was trembling violently his nervous control was at an end he was relieved of his cloak he could not remember how his purple hose he saw were black with wet people were running about him things were happening but for some time he gave no heed to them  he had escaped a myriad of cries told him that he was safe these were the people who were on his side for a space he sobbed for breath and then he sat still with his face covered the air was full of the shouting of innumerable men    chapter ix the people march  he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiositywere fixed on him her lips trembled apart a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some clumsy explanation  he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly he grasped the arm of this shouting person  tell me he cried who am i who am i  the others came nearer to hear his words who am i his eyes searched their faces  they have told him nothing cried the girl  tell me tell me cried graham  you are the master of the earth you are owner of half the world  he did not believe he heard aright he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i have been awake three daysa prisoner three days i judge there is some struggle between a number of people in this cityit is london  yes said the younger man  and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me in some way it has to do with me why i dont know drugs it seems to me that while i have slept the world has gone mad i have gone mad  who are those councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me  to keep you insensible said the man in yellow  to prevent your interference  but why  because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name  the sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted the people in the little room could not hear each other shout  graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him but who is ostrog he said  he is the organiserthe organiser of the revolt our leaderin your name  in my nameand you why is he not here  hehas deputed us i am his brotherhis halfbrother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent he is at the windvane offices directing the people are marching  in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannised at last even  in my name my name master  the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder indignant and vociferous a high penetrating voice under his red aquiline nose and bushy moustache no one expected you to wake no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotise you kill you  again the hall dominated everything  ostrog is at the windvane offices ready even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning   the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our organisations ready we shall seize the flying stages even now he may be doing that then  this public theatre bawled the man in yellow is only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled men  we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader their police have gone from the streets and are massed in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rockingthey cannot trust even their drilled men  hear the people calling to you  grahams mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few the white council from which he had just escaped and on the other monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him but why these things should be so he could not understand  the door opened lincolns voice was swept away and drowned and a rush of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence  graham glanced towards the open doorway and saw a tall oblong picture of the hall beyond a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth he met the wonder and expectation of the girls eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed for a space he did not recognise the influence that was transforming him but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of what was required of him  lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ a woven texture of sounds full of trumpets full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating timetramp tramp  he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him a vast welter of fluttering colour swaying to the music  wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them  this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtlyfolding mantle hung from his shoulders he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed and eager as she was an embodiment of the song he emerged in the alcove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincolns hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people  the hall was a vast and intricate spacegalleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by three men her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called that enigmatical word ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feetmarking time tramp tramp tramp tramp the green weapons waved flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled he remembered he had to shout march his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host were bearded men old men youths fluttering robed barearmed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant blue a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blueclad negro a shrivelled woman in yellow then a group of tall fairhaired whitefaced blueclad men pushed theatrically past him he noted two chinamen a tall sallow darkhaired shiningeyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences  faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulated to him shouted inaudible personal things most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broad stream passed before him to the right tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waved onward the faces poured by more abundantly   tramp tramp tramp tramp at lincolns pressure he turned towards the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand attendants intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him went the backs of the guards in blackthree and three and three he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up to him he did not know whither he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall tramp tramp tramp tramp    chapter x the battle of the darkness  he was no longer in the hall he was marching along a gallery overhanging one of the great streets of the moving platforms that traversed the city before him and behind him tramped his guards the whole concave of the moving ways below was a congested mass of people marching tramping to the left shouting waving hands and arms pouring along a huge vista shouting as they came into view shouting as they passed shouting as they receded until the globes of electric light receding in perspective dropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bare heads tramp tramp tramp tramp  the song roared up to graham now no longer upborne by music but coarse and noisy and the beating of the marching feet tramp tramp tramp tramp interwove with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the undisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways  abruptly he noted a contrast the buildings on the opposite side of the way seemed deserted the cables and bridges that laced across the aisle were empty and shadowy it came into grahams mind that these also should have swarmed with people  he felt a curious emotionthrobbingvery fast he stopped again the guards before him marched on those about him stopped as he did he saw the direction of their faces the throbbing had something to do with the lights he too looked up  at first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights simply an isolated phenomenon having no bearing on the things below each huge globe of blinding whiteness was as it were clutched compressed in a systole that was followed by a transitory diastole and again a systole like a tightening grip darkness light darkness in rapid alternation  graham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to do with the people below the appearance of the houses and ways the appearance of the packed masses changed became a confusion of vivid lights and leaping shadows he saw a multitude of shadows had sprung into aggressive existence seemed rushing up broadening widening growing with steady swiftnessto leap suddenly back and return reinforced the song and the tramping had ceased the unanimous march he discovered was arrested there were eddies a flow sideways shouts of the lights voices were crying together one thing the lights cried these voices the lights he looked down in this dancing death of the lights the area of the street had suddenly become a monstrous struggle the huge white globes became purplewhite purple with a reddish glow flickered flickered faster and faster fluttered between light and extinction ceased to flicker and became mere fading specks of glowing red in a vast obscurity in ten seconds the extinction was accomplished and there was only this roaring darkness a black monstrosity that had suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of men  he felt invisible forms about him his arms were gripped something rapped sharply against his shin a voice bawled in his ear it is all rightall right  graham shook off the paralysis of his first astonishment he struck his forehead against lincolns and bawled what is this darkness  the council has cut the currents that light the city we must waitstop the people will go on they will  his voice was drowned voices were shouting save the sleeper take care of the sleeper a guard stumbled against graham and hurt his hand by an inadvertent blow of his weapon a wild tumult tossed and whirled about him growing as it seemed louder denser more furious each moment fragments of recognisable sounds drove towards him were whirled away from him as his mind reached out to grasp them voices seemed to be shouting conflicting orders other voices answered there were suddenly a succession of piercing screams close beneath them  a voice bawled in his ear the red police and receded forthwith beyond his questions  a crackling sound grew to distinctness and there with a leaping of faint flashes along the edge of the further ways by their light graham saw the heads and bodies of a number of men armed with weapons like those of his guards leap into an instants dim visibility the whole area began to crackle to flash with little instantaneous streaks of light and abruptly the darkness rolled back like a curtain  a glare of light dazzled his eyes a vast seething expanse of struggling men confused his mind a shout a burst of cheering came across the ways he looked up to see the source of the light a man hung far overhead from the upper part of a cable holding by a rope the blinding star that had driven the darkness back he wore a red uniform  grahams eyes fell to the ways again a wedge of red a little way along the vista caught his eye he saw it was a dense mass of redclad men jammed the higher further way their backs against the pitiless cliff of building and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists they were fighting weapons flashed and rose and fell heads vanished at the edge of the contest and other heads replaced them the little flashes from the green weapons became little jets of smoky grey while the light lasted  abruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways were an inky darkness once more a tumultuous mystery  he felt something thrusting against him he was being pushed along the gallery someone was shoutingit might be at him he was too confused to hear he was thrust against the wall and a number of people blundered past him it seemed to him that his guards were struggling with one another  suddenly the cablehung starholder appeared again and the whole scene was white and dazzling the band of redcoats seemed broader and nearer its apex was halfway down the ways towards the central aisle and raising his eyes graham saw that a number of these men had also appeared now in the darkened lower galleries of the opposite building and were firing over the heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of people on the lower ways the meaning of these things dawned upon him the march of the people had come upon an ambush at the very outset thrown into confusion by the extinction of the lights they were now being attacked by the red police then he became aware that he was standing alone that his guards and lincoln were along the gallery in the direction along which he had come before the darkness fell he saw they were gesticulating to him wildly running back towards him a great shouting came from across the ways then it seemed as though the whole face of the darkened building opposite was lined and speckled with redclad men and they were pointing over to him and shouting the sleeper save the sleeper shouted a multitude of throats  something struck the wall above his head he looked up at the impact and saw a starshaped splash of silvery metal he saw lincoln near him felt his arm gripped then pat pat he had been missed twice  for a moment he did not understand this the street was hidden everything was hidden as he looked the second flare had burned out  lincoln had gripped graham by the arm was lugging him along the gallery before the next light he cried his haste was contagious grahams instinct of selfpreservation overcame the paralysis of his incredulous astonishment he became for a time the blind creature of the fear of death he ran stumbling because of the uncertainty of the darkness blundered into his guards as they turned to run with him haste was his one desire to escape this perilous gallery upon which he was exposed a third glare came close on its predecessors with it came a great shouting across the ways an answering tumult from the ways the redcoats below he saw had now almost gained the central passage their countless faces turned towards him and they shouted the white facade opposite was densely stippled with red all these wonderful things concerned him turned upon him as a pivot these were the guards of the council attempting to recapture him  lucky it was for him that these shots were the first fired in anger for a hundred and fifty years he heard bullets whacking over his head felt a splash of molten metal sting his ear and perceived without looking that the whole opposite facade an unmasked ambuscade of red police was crowded and bawling and firing at him  down went one of his guards before him and graham unable to stop leapt the writhing body  in another second he had plunged unhurt into a black passage and incontinently someone coming it may be in a transverse direction blundered violently into him he was hurling down a staircase in absolute darkness he reeled and was struck again and came against a wall with his hands he was crushed by a weight of struggling bodies whirled round and thrust to the right a vast pressure pinned him he could not breathe his ribs seemed cracking he felt a momentary relaxation and then the whole mass of people moving together bore him back towards the great theatre from which he had so recently come  there were moments when his feet did not touch the ground then he was staggering and shoving he heard shouts of they are coming and a muffled cry close to him his foot blundered against something soft he heard a hoarse scream under foot he heard shouts of the sleeper but he was too confused to speak he heard the green weapons crackling for a space he lost his individual will became an atom in a panic blind unthinking mechanical he thrust and pressed back and writhed in the pressure kicked presently against a step and found himself ascending a slope and abruptly the faces all about him leapt out of the black visible ghastlywhite and astonished terrified perspiring in a livid glare one face a young mans was very near to him not twenty inches away at the time it was but a passing incident of no emotional value but afterwards it came back to him in his dreams for this young man wedged upright in the crowd for a time had been shot and was already dead  a fourth white star must have been lit by the man on the cable its light came glaring in through vast windows and arches and showed graham that he was now one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back across the lower area of the great theatre this time the picture was livid and fragmentary slashed and barred with black shadows he saw that quite near to him the red guards were fighting their way through the people he could not tell whether they saw him he looked for lincoln and his guards he saw lincoln near the stage of the theatre surrounded in a crowd of blackbadged revolutionaries lifted up and staring to and fro as if seeking him graham perceived that he himself was near the opposite edge of the crowd that behind him separated by a barrier sloped the now vacant seats of the theatre a sudden idea came to him and he began fighting his way towards the barrier as he reached it the glare came to an end  in a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that not only impeded his movements but made him conspicuous and had slipped it from his shoulders he heard someone trip in its folds in another he was scaling the barrier and had dropped into the blackness on the further side then feeling his way he came to the lower end of an ascending gangway in the darkness the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices lulled then suddenly he came to an unexpected step and tripped and fell as he did so pools and islands amidst the darkness about him leapt to vivid light again the uproar surged louder and the glare of the fifth white star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre walls  he rolled over among some seats heard a shouting and the whirring rattle of weapons struggled up and was knocked back again perceived that a number of blackbadged men were all about him firing at the rebels below leaping from seat to seat crouching among the seats to reload instinctively he crouched amidst the seats as stray shots ripped the pneumatic cushions and cut bright slashes on their soft metal frames instinctively he marked the direction of the gangways the most plausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil of darkness fell again  a young man in faded blue garments came vaulting over the seats hullo he said with his flying feet within six inches of the crouching sleepers face  he stared without any sign of recognition turned to fire fired and shouting to hell with the council was about to fire again then it seemed to graham that the half of this mans neck had vanished a drop of moisture fell on grahams cheek the green weapon stopped half raised for a moment the man stood still with his face suddenly expressionless then he began to slant forward his knees bent man and darkness fell together at the sound of his fall graham rose up and ran for his life until a step down to the gangway tripped him he scrambled to his feet turned up the gangway and ran on  when the sixth star glared he was already close to the yawning throat of a passage he ran on the swifter for the light entered the passage and turned a corner into absolute night again he was knocked sideways rolled over and recovered his feet he found himself one of a crowd of invisible fugitives pressing in one direction his one thought now was their thought also to escape out of this fighting he thrust and struck staggered ran was wedged tightly lost ground and then was clear again  for some minutes he was running through the darkness along a winding passage and then he crossed some wide and open space passed down a long incline and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place many people were shouting they are coming the guards are coming they are firing get out of the fighting the guards are firing it will be safe in seventh way along here to seventh way there were women and children in the crowd as well as men men called names to him the crowd converged on an archway passed through a short throat and emerged on a wider space again lit dimly the black figures about him spread out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series of steps he followed the people dispersed to the right and left he perceived that he was no longer in a crowd he stopped near the highest step before him on that level were groups of seats and a little kiosk he went up to this and stopping in the shadow of its eaves looked about him panting  everything was vague and gray but he recognised that these great steps were a series of platforms of the ways now motionless again the platform slanted up on either side and the tall buildings rose beyond vast dim ghosts their inscriptions and advertisements indistinctly seen and up through the girders and cables was a faint interrupted ribbon of pallid sky a number of people hurried by from their shouts and voices it seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting other less noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows  from very far away down the street he could hear the sound of a struggle but it was evident to him that this was not the street into which the theatre opened that former fight it seemed had suddenly dropped out of sound and hearing andgrotesque thoughtthey were fighting for him  for a space he was like a man who pauses in the reading of a vivid book and suddenly doubts what he has been taking unquestioningly at that time he had little mind for details the whole effect was a huge astonishment oddly enough while the flight from the council prison the great crowd in the hall and the attack of the red police upon the swarming people were clearly present in his mind it cost him an effort to piece in his awakening and to revive the meditative interval of the silent rooms at first his memory leapt these things and took him back to the cascade at pentargen quivering in the wind and all the sombre splendours of the sunlit cornish coast the contrast touched everything with unreality and then the gap filled and he began to comprehend his position  it was no longer absolutely a riddle as it had been in the silent rooms at least he had the strange bare outline now he was in some way the owner of half the world and great political parties were fighting to possess him on the one hand was the white council with its red police set resolutely it seemed on the usurpation of his property and perhaps his murder on the other the revolution that had liberated him with this unseen ostrog as its leader and the whole of this gigantic city was convulsed by their struggle frantic development of his world i do not understand he cried i do not understand  he had slipped out between the contending parties into this liberty of the twilight what would happen next what was happening he figured the redclad men as busily hunting him driving the blackbadged revolutionists before them  at any rate chance had given him a breathing space he could lurk unchallenged by the passersby and watch the course of things his eye followed up the intricate dim immensity of the twilight buildings and it came to him as a thing infinitely wonderful that above there the sun was rising and the world was lit and glowing with the old familiar light of day in a little while he had recovered his breath his clothing had already dried upon him from the snow  he wandered for miles along these twilight ways speaking to no one accosted by no onea dark figure among dark figuresthe coveted man out of the past the inestimable unintentional owner of half the world wherever there were lights or dense crowds or exceptional excitement he was afraid of recognition and watched and turned back or went up and down by the middle stairways into some transverse system of ways at a lower or higher level and though he came on no more fighting the whole city stirred with battle once he had to run to avoid a marching multitude of men that swept the street everyone abroad seemed involved for the most part they were men and they carried what he judged were weapons it seemed as though the struggle was concentrated mainly in the quarter of the city from which he came ever and again a distant roaring the remote suggestion of that conflict reached his ears then his caution and his curiosity struggled together but his caution prevailed and he continued wandering away from the fightingso far as he could judge he went unmolested unsuspected through the dark after a time he ceased to hear even a remote echo of the battle fewer and fewer people passed him until at last the titanic streets became deserted the frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh he seemed to have come to a district of vacant warehouses solitude crept upon himhis pace slackened  he became aware of a growing fatigue at times he would turn aside and seat himself on one of the numerous seats of the upper ways but a feverish restlessness the knowledge of his vital implication in his struggle would not let him rest in any place for long was the struggle on his behalf alone  and then in a desolate place came the shock of an earthquakea roaring and thunderinga mighty wind of cold air pouring through the city the smash of glass the slip and thud of falling masonrya series of gigantic concussions a mass of glass and ironwork fell from the remote roofs into the middle gallery not a hundred yards away from him and in the distance were shouts and running he too was startled to an aimless activity and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back  a man came running towards him his selfcontrol returned what have they blown up asked the man breathlessly that was an explosion and before graham could speak he had hurried on  the great buildings rose dimly veiled by a perplexing twilight albeit the rivulet of sky above was now bright with day he noted many strange features understanding none at the time he even spelt out many of the inscriptions in phonetic lettering but what profits it to decipher a confusion of oddlooking letters resolving itself after painful strain of eye and mind into here is eadhamite or labour bureaulittle side grotesque thought that in all probability some or all of these clifflike houses were his  the perversity of his experience came to him vividly in actual fact he had made such a leap in time as romancers have imagined again and again and that fact realised he had been prepared his mind had as it were seated itself for a spectacle and no spectacle but a great vague danger unsympathetic shadows and veils of darkness somewhere through the labyrinthine obscurity his death sought him would he after all be killed before he saw it might be that even at the next shadowy corner his destruction ambushed a great desire to see a great longing to know arose in him  he became fearful of corners it seemed to him that there was safety in concealment where could he hide to be inconspicuous when the lights returned at last he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the higher ways conceiving he was alone there  he squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes suppose when he looked again he found the dark through of parallel ways and that intolerable altitude of edifice gone suppose he were to discover the whole story of these last few days the awakening the shouting multitudes the darkness and the fighting a phantasmagoria a new and more vivid sort of dream it must be a dream it was so inconsecutive so reasonless why were the people fighting for him why should this saner world regard him as owner and master  so he thought sitting blinded and then he looked again half hoping in spite of his ears to see some familiar aspect of the life of the nineteenth century to see perhaps the little harbour of boscastle about him the cliffs of pentargen or the bedroom of his home but fact takes no heed of human hopes a squad of men with a black banner tramped athwart the nearer shadows intent on conflict and beyond rose that giddy wall of frontage vast and dark with the dim incomprehensible lettering showing faintly on its face  it is no dream he said no dream and he bowed his face upon his hands    chapter xi the old man who knew everything  he was startled by a cough close at hand  he turned sharply and peering saw a small hunchedup figure sitting a couple of yards off in the shadow of the enclosure  have ye any news asked the highpitched wheezy voice of a very old man  graham hesitated none he said  i stay here till the lights come again said the old man these blue scoundrels are everywhereeverywhere  grahams answer was inarticulate assent he tried to see the old man but the darkness hid his face he wanted very much to respond to talk but he did not know how to begin  dark and damnable said the old man suddenly dark and damnable turned out of my room among all these dangers  thats hard ventured graham thats hard on you  darkness an old man lost in the darkness and all the world gone mad war and fighting the police beaten and rogues abroad why dont they bring some negroes to protect us no more dark passages for me i fell over a dead man  youre safer with company said the old man if its company of the right sort and peered frankly he rose suddenly and came towards graham  apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory the old man sat down as if relieved to be no longer alone eh he said but this is a terrible time war and fighting and the dead lying theremen strong men dying in the dark sons i have three sons god knows where they are tonight  the voice ceased then repeated quavering god knows where they are tonight  graham stood revolving a question that should not betray his ignorance again the old mans voice ended the pause  this ostrog will win he said he will win and what the world will be like under him no one can tell my sons are under the windvanes all three one of my daughtersinlaw was his mistress for a while his mistress were not common people though theyve sent me to wander tonight and take my chance i knew what was going on before most people but this darkness and to fall over a dead body suddenly in the dark  his wheezy breathing could be heard  ostrog said graham  the greatest boss the world has ever seen said the voice  graham ransacked his mind the council has few friends among the people he hazarded  few friends and poor ones at that theyve had their time eh they should have kept to the clever ones but twice they held election and ostrog and now it has burst out and nothing can stay it nothing can stay it twice they rejected ostrogostrog the boss i heard of his rages at the timehe was terrible heaven save them for nothing on earth can now he has raised the labour companies upon them no one else would have dared all the blue canvas armed and marching he will go through with it he will go through  he was silent for a little while this sleeper he said and stopped  yes said graham well  the senile voice sank to a confidential whisper the dim pale face came close the real sleeper  yes said graham  died years ago  what said graham sharply  years ago died years ago  you dont say so said graham  i do i do say so he died this sleeper whos woke upthey changed in the night a poor drugged insensible creature but i mustnt tell all i know i mustnt tell all i know  for a little while he muttered inaudibly his secret was too much for him i dont know the ones that put him to sleepthat was before my timebut i know the man who injected the stimulants and woke him again it was ten to onewake or kill wake or kill ostrogs way  graham was so astonished at these things that he had to interrupt to make the old man repeat his words to requestion vaguely before he was sure of the meaning and folly of what he heard and his awakening had not been natural was that an old mans senile superstition too or had it any truth in it feeling in the dark corners of his memory he presently came on something that might conceivably be an impression of some such stimulating effect it dawned upon him that he had happened upon a lucky encounter that at last he might learn something of the new age the old man wheezed a while and spat and then the piping reminiscent voice resumed  the first time they rejected him ive followed it all  rejected whom said graham the sleeper  sleeper no ostrog he was terribleterrible and he was promised then promised certainly the next time fools they werenot to be more afraid of him now all the citys his millstone and such as we dust ground upon it dust ground upon it until he set to workthe workers cut each others throats and murdered a chinaman or a labour policeman at times and left the rest of us in peace dead bodies robbing darkness such a thing hasnt been this gross of years ehbut tis ill on small folks when the great fall out its ill  did you saythere had not been whatfor a gross of years  eh said the old man  the old man said something about clipping his words and made him repeat this a third time fighting and slaying and weapons in hand and fools bawling freedom and the like said the old man not in all my life has there been that these are like the old daysfor surewhen the paris people broke outthree gross of years ago thats what i mean hasnt been but its the worlds way it had to come back i know i know this five years ostrog has been working and there has been trouble and trouble and hunger and threats and high talk and arms blue canvas and murmurs no one safe everything sliding and slipping and now here we are revolt and fighting and the council come to its end  you are rather wellinformed on these things said graham  i know what i hear it isnt all babble machine with me  no said graham wondering what babble machine might be and you are certain this ostrogyou are certain ostrog organised this rebellion and arranged for the waking of the sleeper just to assert himselfbecause he was not elected to the council  everyone knows that i should think said the old man exceptjust fools he meant to be master somehow in the council or not everyone who knows anything knows that and here we are with dead bodies lying in the dark why where have you been if you havent heard all about the trouble between ostrog and the verneys and what do you think the troubles are about the sleeper eh you think the sleepers real and woke of his own accordeh  im a dull man older than i look and forgetful said graham lots of things that have happenedespecially of late years if i was the sleeper to tell you the truth i couldnt know less about them  eh said the voice old are you you dont sound so very old but its not everyone keeps his memory to my time of lifetruly but these notorious things but youre not so old as menot nearly so old as me well i ought not to judge other men by myself perhaps im youngfor so old a man maybe youre old for so young  thats it said graham and ive a queer history i know very little and history practically i know no history the sleeper and julius caesar are all the same to me its interesting to hear you talk of these things  i know a few things said the old man i know a thing or two but hark  the two men became silent listening there was heavy thud a concussion that made their seat shiver the passersby stopped shouted to one another the old man was full of questions he shouted to a man who passed near graham emboldened by his example got up and accosted others none knew what had happened  he returned to the seat and found the old man muttering vague interrogations in an undertone for a while they said nothing to one another  the sense of this gigantic struggle so near and yet so remote oppressed grahams imagination was this old man right was the report of the people right and were the revolutionaries winning or were they all in error and were the red guards driving all before them at any time the flood of warfare might pour into this silent quarter of the city and seize upon him again it behooved him to learn all he could while there was time he turned suddenly to the old man with a question and left it unsaid but his motion moved the old man to speech again  eh but how things work together said the old man this sleeper that all the fools put their trust in ive the whole history of iti was always a good one for histories when i was a boyim that oldi used to read printed books youd hardly think it likely youve seen nonethey rot and dust soand the sanitary company burns them to make ashlarite but they were convenient in their dirty way oh i learnt a lot these newfangled babble machinesthey dont seem newfangled to you ehtheyre easy to hear easy to forget but ive traced all the sleeper business from the first   you will scarcely believe it said graham slowly im so ignorantive been so preoccupied in my own little affairs my circumstances have been so oddi know nothing of this sleepers history who was he  eh said the old man i know i know he was a poor nobody and set on a playful woman poor soul and he fell into a trance theres the old things they had those brown thingssilver photographsstill showing him as he lay a gross and a half years agoa gross and a half of years  set on a playful woman poor soul said graham softly to himself and then aloud yeswell go on  you must know he had a cousin named warming a solitary man without children who made a big fortune speculating in roadsthe first eadhamite roads but surely youve heard no why he bought all the patent rights and made a big company in those days there were grosses of grosses of separate businesses and business companies grosses of grosses his roads killed the railroadsthe old thingsin two dozen years he bought up and eadhamited the tracks and because he didnt want to break up his great property or let in shareholders he left it all to the sleeper and put it under a board of trustees that he had picked and trained he knew then the sleeper wouldnt wake that he would go on sleeping sleeping till he died he knew that quite well and plump a man in the united states who had lost two sons in a boat accident followed that up with another great bequest his trustees found themselves with a dozen myriads of lionsworth or more of property at the very beginning  what was his name  graham  no i meanthat americans  isbister  isbister cried graham why i dont even know the name  of course not said the old man of course not people dont learn much in the schools nowadays but i know all about him he was a rich american who went from england and he left the sleeper even more than warming how he made it that i dont know something about pictures by machinery but he made it and left it and so the council had its start it was just a council of trustees at first  and how did it grow  ehbut youre not up to things money attracts moneyand twelve brains are better than one they played it cleverly they worked politics with money and kept on adding to the money by working currency and tariffs they grewthey grew and for years the twelve trustees hid the growing of the sleepers estate under double names and company titles and all that the council spread by title deed mortgage share every political party every newspaper they bought if you listen to the old stories you will see the council growing and growing billions and billions of lions at lastthe sleepers estate and all growing out of a whimout of this warmings will and an accident to isbisters sons  men are strange said the old man the strange thing to me is how the council worked together so long as many as twelve but they worked in cliques from the first and theyve slipped back in my young days speaking of the council was like an ignorant man speaking of god we didnt think they could do wrong we didnt know of their women and all that or else ive got wiser  men are strange said the old man here are you young and ignorant and mesevendy years old and i might reasonably be forgettingexplaining it all to you short and clear  sevendy he said sevendy and i hear and seehear better than i see and reason clearly and keep myself up to all the happenings of things sevendy  life is strange i was twaindy before ostrog was a baby i remember him long before hed pushed his way to the head of the wind vanes control ive seen many changes eh ive worn the blue and at last ive come to see this crush and darkness and tumult and dead men carried by in heaps on the ways and all his doing all his doing  his voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of ostrog  graham thought let me see he said if i have it right  he extended a hand and ticked off points upon his fingers the sleeper has been asleep  changed said the old man  perhaps and meanwhile the sleepers property grew in the hands of twelve trustees until it swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of the world the twelve trusteesby virtue of this property have become virtually masters of the world because they are the paying powerjust as the old english parliament used to be  eh said the old man thats sothats a good comparison youre not so  and now this ostroghas suddenly revolutionised the world by waking the sleeperwhom no one but the superstitious common people had ever dreamt would wake againraising the sleeper to claim his property from the council after all these years  the old man endorsed this statement with a cough its strange he said to meet a man who learns these things for the first time tonight  aye said graham its strange  have you been in a pleasure city said the old man all my life ive longed he laughed even now he said i could enjoy a little fun enjoy seeing things anyhow he mumbled a sentence graham did not understand  the sleeperwhen did he awake said graham suddenly  three days ago  where is he  ostrog has him he escaped from the council not four hours ago my dear sir where were you at the time he was in the hall of the marketswhere the fighting has been all the city was screaming about it all the babble machines everywhere it was shouted even the fools who speak for the council were admitting it everyone was rushing off to see himeveryone was getting arms were you drunk or asleep and even then but youre joking surely youre pretending it was to stop the shouting of the babble machines and prevent the people gathering that they turned off the electricityand put this damned darkness upon us do you mean to say  i had heard the sleeper was rescued said graham butto come back a minute are you sure ostrog has him  he wont let him go said the old man  and the sleeper are you sure he is not genuine i have never heard  so all the fools think so they think as if there wasnt a thousand things that were never heard i know ostrog too well for that did i tell you in a way im a sort of relation of ostrogs a sort of relation through my daughterinlaw   i suppose  well  i suppose theres no chance of this sleeper asserting himself i suppose hes certain to be a puppetin ostrogs hands or the councils as soon as the struggle is over  in ostrogs handscertainly why shouldnt he be a puppet look at his position everything done for him every pleasure possible why should he want to assert himself  what are these pleasure cities said graham abruptly  the old man made him repeat the question when at last he was assured of grahams words he nudged him violently thats too much said he youre poking fun at an old man ive been suspecting you know more than you pretend  perhaps i do said graham but no why should i go on acting no i do not know what a pleasure city is  the old man laughed in an intimate way  what is more i do not know how to read your letters i do not know what money you use i do not know what foreign countries there are i do not know where i am i cannot count i do not know where to get food nor drink nor shelter  come come said the old man if you had a glass of drink now would you put it in your ear or your eye  i want you to tell me all these things  he he well gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun a withered hand caressed grahams arm for a moment silk well well but all the same i wish i was the man who was put up as the sleeper hell have a fine time of it all the pomp and pleasure hes a queer looking face when they used to let anyone go to see him ive got tickets and been the image of the real one as the photographs show him this substitute used to be yellow but hell get fed up its a queer world think of the luck of it the luck of it i expect hell be sent to capri its the best fun for a greener  his cough overtook him again then he began mumbling enviously of pleasures and strange delights the luck of it the luck of it all my life ive been in london hoping to get my chance  but you dont know that the sleeper died said graham suddenly  the old man made him repeat his words  men dont live beyond ten dozen its not in the order of things said the old man im not a fool fools may believe it but not me  graham became angry with the old mans assurance whether you are a fool or not he said it happens you are wrong about the sleeper  eh  you are wrong about the sleeper i havent told you before but i will tell you now you are wrong about the sleeper  how do you know i thought you didnt know anythingnot even about pleasure cities  graham paused  you dont know said the old man how are you to know its very few men  i am the sleeper  he had to repeat it  there was a brief pause theres a silly thing to say sir if youll excuse me it might get you into trouble in a time like this said the old man graham slightly dashed repeated his assertion  i was saying i was the sleeper that years and years ago i did indeed fall asleep in a little stonebuilt village in the days when there were hedgerows and villages and inns and all the countryside cut up into little pieces little fields have you never heard of those days and it is ii who speak to youwho awakened again these four days since  four days sincethe sleeper but theyve got the sleeper they have him and they wont let him go nonsense youve been talking sensibly enough up to now i can see it as though i was there there will be lincoln like a keeper just behind him they wont let him go about alone trust them youre a queer fellow one of these fun pokers i see now why you have been clipping your words so oddly but  he stopped abruptly and graham could see his gesture  as if ostrog would let the sleeper run about alone no youre telling that to the wrong man altogether eh as if i should believe whats your game and besides weve been talking of the sleeper  graham stood up listen he said i am the sleeper  youre an odd man said the old man to sit here in the dark talking clipped and telling a lie of that sort but  grahams exasperation fell to laughter it is preposterous he cried preposterous the dream must end it gets wilder and wilder here am iin this damned twilighti never knew a dream in twilight beforean anachronism by two hundred years and trying to persuade an old fool that i am myself and meanwhileugh  he moved in gusty irritation and went striding in a moment the old man was pursuing him eh but dont go cried the old man im an old fool i know dont go dont leave me in all this darkness  graham hesitated stopped suddenly the folly of telling his secret flashed into his mind  i didnt mean to offend youdisbelieving you said the old man coming near its no manner of harm call yourself the sleeper if it pleases you tis a foolish trick  graham hesitated turned abruptly and went on his way  for a time he heard the old mans hobbling pursuit and his wheezy cries receding but at last the darkness swallowed him and graham saw him no more    chapter xii ostrog  graham could now take a clearer view of his position for a long time yet he wandered but after the talk of the old man his discovery of this ostrog was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision one thing was evident those who were at the headquarters of the revolt had succeeded very admirably in suppressing the fact of his disappearance but every moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of his recapture by the council  presently a man stopped before him have you heard he said  no said graham starting  near a dozand said the man a dozand men and hurried on  a number of men and a girl passed in the darkness gesticulating and shouting capitulated given up a dozand of men two dozand of men ostrog hurrah ostrog hurrah these cries receded became indistinct  other shouting men followed for a time his attention was absorbed in the fragments of speech he heard he had a doubt whether all were speaking english scraps floated to him scraps like pigeon english like nigger dialect blurred and mangled distortions he dared accost no one with questions the impression the people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the old mans faith in ostrog it was only slowly he could bring himself to believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat of the council that the council which had pursued him with such power and vigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict and if that was so how did it affect him several times he hesitated on the verge of fundamental questions once he turned and walked for a long way after a little man of rotund inviting outline but he was unable to master confidence to address him  it was only slowly that it came to him that he might ask for the windvane offices whatever the windvane offices might be his first enquiry simply resulted in a direction to go on towards westminster his second led to the discovery of a short cut in which he was speedily lost he was told to leave the ways to which he had hitherto confined himself knowing no other means of transitand to plunge down one of the middle staircases into the blackness of a crossway thereupon came some trivial adventures chief of these an ambiguous encounter with a gruffvoiced invisible creature speaking in a strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue a thick flow of speech with the drifting corpses of english words therein the dialect of the latterday vile then another voice drew near a girls voice singing tralala tralala she spoke to graham her english touched with something of the same quality she professed to have lost her sister she blundered needlessly into him he thought caught hold of him and laughed but a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseen again  the sounds about him increased stumbling people passed him speaking excitedly they have surrendered the council surely not the council they are saying so in the ways the passage seemed wider suddenly the wall fell away he was in a great space and people were stirring remotely he inquired his way of an indistinct figure strike straight across said a womans voice he left his guiding wall and in a moment had stumbled against a little table on which were utensils of glass grahams eyes now attuned to darkness made out a long vista with pallid tables on either side he went down this at one or two of the tables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eating there were people then cool enough to dine or daring enough to steal a meal in spite of social convulsion and darkness far off and high up he presently saw a pallid light of a semicircular shape as he approached this a black edge came up and hid it he stumbled at steps and found himself in a gallery he heard a sobbing and found two scared little girls crouched by a railing these children became silent at the near sound of feet he tried to console them but they were very still until he left them then as he receded he could hear them sobbing again  presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase and near a wide opening he saw a dim twilight above this and ascended out of the blackness into a street of moving ways again along this a disorderly swarm of people marched shouting they were singing snatches of the song of the revolt most of them out of tune here and there torches flared creating brief hysterical shadows he asked his way and was twice puzzled by that same thick dialect his third attempt won an answer he could understand he was two miles from the windvane offices in westminster but the way was easy to follow  when at last he did approach the district of the windvane offices it seemed to him from the cheering processions that came marching along the ways from the tumult of rejoicing and finally from the restoration of the lighting of the city that the overthrow of the council must already be accomplished and still no news of his absence came to his ears  the reillumination of the city came with startling abruptness suddenly he stood blinking all about him men halted dazzled and the world was incandescent the light found him already upon the outskirts of the excited crowds that choked the ways near the windvane offices and the sense of visibility and exposure that came with it turned his colourless intention of joining ostrog to a keen anxiety  for a time he was jostled obstructed and endangered by men hoarse and weary with cheering his name some of them bandaged and bloody in his cause the frontage of the windvane offices was illuminated by some moving picture but what it was he could not see because in spite of his strenuous attempts the density of the crowd prevented his approaching it from the fragments of speech he caught he judged it conveyed news of the fighting about the council house ignorance and indecision made him slow and ineffective in his movements for a time he could not conceive how he was to get within the unbroken facade of this place he made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of people until he realised that the descending staircase of the central way led to the interior of the buildings this gave him a goal but the crowding in the central path was so dense that it was long before he could reach it and even then he encountered intricate obstruction and had an hour of vivid argument first in this guard room and then in that before he could get a note taken to the one man of all men who was most eager to see him his story was laughed to scorn at one place and wiser for that when at last he reached a second stairway he professed simply to have news of extraordinary importance for ostrog what it was he would not say they sent his note reluctantly for a long time he waited in a little room at the foot of the lift shaft and thither at last came lincoln eager apologetic astonished he stopped in the doorway scrutinising graham then rushed forward effusively  yes he cried it is you and you are not dead  graham made a brief explanation  my brother is waiting explained lincoln he is alone in the windvane offices we feared you had been killed in the theatre he doubtedand things are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling them thereor he would have come to you  they ascended a lift passed along a narrow passage crossed a great hall empty save for two hurrying messengers and entered a comparatively little room whose only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc of cloudy shifting grey hung by cables from the wall there lincoln left graham for a space and he remained alone without understanding the shifting smoky shapes that drove slowly across this disc  his attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly it was cheering the frantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd a roaring exultation this ended as sharply as it had begun like a sound heard between the opening and shutting of a door in the outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and a melodious clinking as if a loose chain was running over the teeth of a wheel  then he heard the voice of a woman the rustle of unseen garments it is ostrog he heard her say a little bell rang fitfully and then everything was still again  presently came voices footsteps and movement without the footsteps of some one person detached itself from the other sounds and drew near firm evenly measured steps the curtain lifted slowly a tall whitehaired man clad in garments of cream coloured silk appeared regarding graham from under his raised arm  for a moment the white form remained holding the curtain then dropped it and stood before it grahams first impression was of a very broad forehead very pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows an aquiline nose and a heavilylined resolute mouth the folds of flesh over the eyes the drooping of the corners of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing and said the man was old graham rose to his feet instinctively and for a moment the two men stood in silence regarding each other  you are ostrog said graham  i am ostrog  the boss  so i am called  graham felt the inconvenience of the silence i have to thank you chiefly i understand for my safety he said presently  we were afraid you were killed said ostrog  or sent to sleep againfor ever we have been doing everything to keep our secretthe secret of your disappearance where have you been how did you get here  graham told him briefly  ostrog listened in silence  he smiled faintly do you know what i was doing when they came to tell me you had come  how can i guess  preparing your double  my double  a man as like you as we could find we were going to hypnotise him to save him the difficulty of acting it was imperative the whole of this revolt depends on the idea that you are awake alive and with us even now a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring to see you they do not trust you know of coursesomething of your position  very little said graham  it is like this ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned you are absolute owner he said of more than half the world as a result of that you are practically king your powers are limited in many intricate ways but you are the figure head the popular symbol of government this white council the council of trustees as it is called  i have heard the vague outline of these things  i wondered  i came upon a garrulous old man  i see our massesthe word comes from your daysyou know of course that we still have massesregard you as our actual ruler just as a great number of people in your days regarded the crown as the ruler they are discontentedthe masses all over the earthwith the rule of your trustees for the most part it is the old discontent the old quarrel of the common man with his commonnessthe misery of work and discipline and unfitness but your trustees have ruled ill in certain matters in the administration of the labour companies for example they have been unwise they have given endless opportunities already we of the popular party were agitating for reformswhen your waking came came if it had been contrived it could not have come more opportunity he smiled the public mind making no allowance for your years of quiescence had already hit on the thought of waking you and appealing to you andflash  he indicated the outbreak by a gesture and graham moved his head to show that he understood  the council muddledquarreled they always do they could not decide what to do with you you know how they imprisoned you  i see i see and nowwe win  we win indeed we win tonight in five swift hours suddenly we struck everywhere the windvane people the labour company and its millions burst the bonds we got the pull of the aeropiles  he paused yes said graham guessing that aeropile meant flying machine  that was of course essential or they could have got away all the city rose every third man almost was in it all the blue all the public services save only just a few aeronauts and about half the red police you were rescued and their own police of the waysnot half of them could be massed at the council househave been broken up disarmed or killed all london is oursnow only the council house remains  half of those who remain to them of the red police were lost in that foolish attempt to recapture you they lost their heads when they lost you they flung all they had at the theatre we cut them off from the council house there truly tonight has been a night of victory everywhere your star has blazed a day agothe white council ruled as it has ruled for a gross of years for a century and a half of years and then with only a little whispering a covert arming here and there suddenlyso  i am very ignorant said graham i suppose i do not clearly understand the conditions of this fighting if you could explain where is the council where is the fight  ostrog stepped across the room something clicked and suddenly save for an oval glow they were in darkness for a moment graham was puzzled  then he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken depth and colour had assumed the appearance of an oval window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar scene  at the first glance he was unable to guess what this scene might be it was a daylight scene the daylight of a wintry day grey and clear across the picture and halfway as it seemed between him and the remoter view a stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically then he perceived that the rows of great windwheels he saw the wide intervals the occasional gulfs of darkness were akin to those through which he had fled from the council house he distinguished an orderly file of red figures marching across an open space between files of men in black and realised before ostrog spoke that he was looking down on the upper surface of latterday london the overnight snows had gone he judged that this mirror was some modern replacement of the camera obscura but that matter was not explained to him he saw that though the file of red figures was trotting from left to right yet they were passing out of the picture to the left he wondered momentarily and then saw that the picture was passing slowly panorama fashion across the oval  in a moment you will see the fighting said ostrog at his elbow those fellows in red you notice are prisoners this is the roof space of londonall the houses are practically continuous now the streets and public squares are covered in the gaps and chasms of your time have disappeared  something out of focus obliterated half the picture its form suggested a man there was a gleam of metal a flash something that swept across the oval as the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye and the picture was clear again and now graham beheld men running down among the windwheels pointing weapons from which jetted out little smoky flashes they swarmed thicker and thicker to the right gesticulatingit might be they were shouting but of that the picture told nothing they and the windwheels passed slowly and steadily across the field of the mirror  now said ostrog comes the council house and slowly a black edge crept into view and gathered grahams attention soon it was no longer an edge but a cavity a huge blackened space amidst the clustering edifices and from it thin spires of smoke rose into the pallid winter sky gaunt ruinous masses of the building mighty truncated piers and girders rose dismally out of this cavernous darkness and over these vestiges of some splendid place countless minute men were clambering leaping swarming  this is the council house said ostrog their last stronghold and the fools wasted enough ammunition to hold out for a month in blowing up the buildings all about themto stop our attack you heard the smash it shattered half the brittle glass in the city  and while he spoke graham saw that beyond this sea of ruins overhanging it and rising to a great height was a ragged mass of white building this mass had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of its surroundings black gaps marked the passages the disaster had torn apart big halls had been slashed open and the decoration of their interiors showed dismally in the wintry dawn and down the jagged wall hung festoons of divided cables and twisted ends of lines and metallic rods and amidst all the vast details moved little red specks the redclothed defenders of the council every now and then faint flashes illuminated the bleak shadows at the first sight it seemed to graham that an attack upon this isolated white building was in progress but then he perceived that the party of the revolt was not advancing but sheltered amidst the colossal wreckage that encircled this last ragged stronghold of the redgarbed men was keeping up a fitful firing  and not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the ventilating fans in a little chamber within that remote building wondering what was happening in the world  looking more attentively as this warlike episode moved silently across the centre of the mirror graham saw that the white building was surrounded on every side by ruins and ostrog proceeded to describe in concise phrases how its defenders had sought by such destruction to isolate themselves from a storm he spoke of the loss of men that huge downfall had entailed in an indifferent tone he indicated an improvised mortuary among the wreckage showed ambulances swarming like cheesemites along a ruinous groove that had once been a street of moving ways he was more interested in pointing out the parts of the council house the distribution of the besiegers in a little while the civil contest that had convulsed london was no longer a mystery to graham it was no tumultuous revolt had occurred that night no equal warfare but a splendidly organised coup detat ostrogs grasp of details was astonishing he seemed to know the business of even the smallest knot of black and red specks that crawled amidst these places  he stretched a huge black arm across the luminous picture and showed the room whence graham had escaped and across the chasm of ruins the course of his flight graham recognised the gulf across which the gutter ran and the windwheels where he had crouched from the flying machine the rest of his path had succumbed to the explosion he looked again at the council house and it was already half hidden and on the right a hillside with a cluster of domes and pinnacles hazy dim and distant was gliding into view  and the council is really overthrown he said  overthrown said ostrog  and i is it indeed true that i  you are master of the world  but that white flag  that is the flag of the councilthe flag of the rule of the world it will fall the fight is over their attack on the theatre was their last frantic struggle they have only a thousand men or so and some of these men will be disloyal they have little ammunition and we are reviving the ancient arts we are casting guns  buthelp is this city the world  practically this is all they have left to them of their empire abroad the cities have either revolted with us or wait the issue your awakening has perplexed them paralysed them  but havent the council flying machines why is there no fighting with them  they had but the greater part of the aeronauts were in the revolt with us they wouldnt take the risk of fighting on our side but they would not stir against us we had to get a pull with the aeronauts quite half were with us and the others knew it directly they knew you had got away those looking for you dropped we killed the man who shot at youan hour ago and we occupied the flying stages at the outset in every city we could and so stopped and captured the airplanes and as for the little flying machines that turned outfor some didwe kept up too straight and steady a fire for them to get near the council house if they dropped they couldnt rise again because theres no clear space about there for them to get up several we have smashed several others have dropped and surrendered the rest have gone off to the continent to find a friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out most of these men were only too glad to be taken prisoner and kept out of harms way upsetting in a flying machine isnt a very attractive prospect theres no chance for the council that way its days are done  he laughed and turned to the oval reflection again to show graham what he meant by flying stages even the four nearer ones were remote and obscured by a thin morning haze but graham could perceive they were very vast structures judged even by the standard of the things about them  and then as these dim shapes passed to the left there came again the sight of the expanse across which the disarmed men in red had been marching and then the black ruins and then again the beleaguered white fastness of the council it appeared no longer a ghostly pile but glowing amber in the sunlight for a cloud shadow had passed about it the pigmy struggle still hung in suspense but now the red defenders were no longer firing  so in a dusky stillness the man from the nineteenth century saw the closing scene of the great revolt the forcible establishment of his rule with a quality of startling discovery it came to him that this was his world and not that other he had left behind that this was no spectacle to culminate and cease that in this world lay whatever life was still before him lay all his duties and dangers and responsibilities he turned with fresh questions ostrog began to answer them and then broke off abruptly but these things i must explain more fully later at present there areduties the people are coming by the moving ways towards this ward from every part of the citythe markets and theatres are densely crowded you are just in time for them they are clamouring to see you and abroad they want to see you paris new york chicago denver caprithousands of cities are up and in a tumult undecided and clamouring to see you they have clamoured that you should be awakened for years and now it is done they will scarcely believe  but surelyi cant go  ostrog answered from the other side of the room and the picture on the oval disc paled and vanished as the light jerked back again there are kinetotelephotographs he said as you bow to the people hereall over the world myriads of myriads of people packed and still in darkened halls will see you also in black and white of coursenot like this and you will hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting in the hall  and there is an optical contrivance we shall use said ostrog used by some of the posturers and women dancers it may be novel to you you stand in a very bright light and they see not you but a magnified image of you thrown on a screenso that even the furtherest man in the remotest gallery can if he chooses count your eyelashes  graham clutched desperately at one of the questions in his mind what is the population of london  eight and twaindy myriads  eight and what  more than thirtythree millions  these figures went beyond grahams imagination you will be expected to say something said ostrog not what you used to call a speech but what our people call a wordjust one sentence six or seven words something formal if i might suggest i have awakened and my heart is with you that is the sort of thing they want  what was that asked graham  i am awakened and my heart is with you and bowbow royally but first we must get you black robesfor black is your colour do you mind and then they will disperse to their homes  graham hesitated i am in your hands he said  ostrog was clearly of that opinion he thought for a moment turned to the curtain and called brief directions to some unseen attendants almost immediately a black robe the very fellow of the black robe graham had worn in the theatre was brought and as he threw it about his shoulders there came from the room without the shrilling of a highpitched bell ostrog turned in interrogation to the attendant then suddenly seemed to change his mind pulled the curtain aside and disappeared  for a moment graham stood with the deferential attendant listening to ostrogs retreating steps there was a sound of quick question and answer and of men running the curtain was snatched back and ostrog reappeared his massive face glowing with excitement he crossed the room in a stride clicked the room into darkness gripped grahams arm and pointed to the mirror  even as we turned away he said  graham saw his index finger black and colossal above the mirrored council house for a moment he did not understand and then he perceived that the flagstaff that had carried the white banner was bare  do you mean he began  the council has surrendered its rule is at an end for evermore  look and ostrog pointed to a coil of black that crept in little jerks up the vacant flagstaff unfolding as it rose  the oval picture paled as lincoln pulled the curtain aside and entered  they are clamourous he said  ostrog kept his grip of grahams arm  we have raised the people he said we have given them arms for today at least their wishes must be law  lincoln held the curtain open for graham and ostrog to pass through  on his way to the markets graham had a transitory glance of a long narrow whitewalled room in which men in the universal blue canvas were carrying covered things like biers and about which men in medical purple hurried to and fro from this room came groans and wailing he had an impression of an empty bloodstained couch of men on other couches bandaged and bloodstained it was just a glimpse from a railed footway and then a buttress hid the place and they were going on towards the markets  the roar of the multitude was near now it leapt to thunder and arresting his attention a fluttering of black banners the waving of blue canvas and brown rags and the swarming vastness of the theatre near the public markets came into view down a long passage the picture opened out he perceived they were entering the great theatre of his first appearance the great theatre he had last seen as a chequerwork of glare and blackness in his flight from the red police this time he entered it along a gallery at a level high above the stage the place was now brilliantly lit again he sought the gangway up which he had fled but he could not tell it from among its dozens of fellows nor could he see anything of the smashed seats deflated cushions and such like traces of the fight because of the density of the people except the stage the whole place was closely packed looking down the effect was a vast area of stippled pink each dot a still upturned face regarding him at his appearance with ostrog the cheering died away the singing died away a common interest stilled and unified the disorder it seemed as though every individual of those myriads was watching him    chapter xiii the end of the old order   so far as graham was able to judge it was near midday when the white banner of the council fell but some hours had to elapse before it was possible to effect the formal capitulation and so after he had spoken his word he retired to his new apartments in the windvane offices the continuous excitement of the last twelve hours had left him inordinately fatigued even his curiosity was exhausted for a space he sat inert and passive with open eyes and for a space he slept he was roused by two medical attendants come prepared with stimulants to sustain him through the next occasion after he had taken their drugs and bathed by their advice in cold water he felt a rapid return of interest and energy and was presently able and willing to accompany ostrog through several miles as it seemed of passages lifts and slides to the closing scene of the white councils rule  the way ran deviously through a maze of buildings they came at last to a passage that curved about and showed broadening before him an oblong opening clouds hot with sunset and the ragged skyline of the ruinous council house a tumult of shouts came drifting up to him in another moment they had come out high up on the brow of the cliff of torn buildings that overhung the wreckage the vast area opened to grahams eyes none the less strange and wonderful for the remote view he had had of it in the oval mirror  this rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the better part of a mile to its outer edge it was gold lit on the left hand catching the sunlight and below and to the right clear and cold in the shadow above the shadowy grey council house that stood in the midst of it the great black banner of the surrender still hung in sluggish folds against the blazing sunset severed rooms halls and passages gaped strangely broken masses of metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage vast masses of twisted cable dropped like tangled seaweed and from its base came a tumult of innumerable voices violent concussions and the sound of trumpets all about this great white pile was a ring of desolation the smashed and blackened masses the gaunt foundations and ruinous lumber of the fabric that had been destroyed by the councils orders skeletons of girders titanic masses of wall forests of stout pillars amongst the sombre wreckage beneath running water flashed and glistened and far away across the space out of the midst of a vague vast mass of buildings there thrust the twisted end of a watermain two hundred feet in the air thunderously spouting a shining cascade and everywhere great multitudes of people  wherever there was space and foothold people swarmed little people small and minutely clear except where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold they clambered up the tottering walls they clung in wreaths and groups about the highstanding pillars they swarmed along the edges of the circle of ruins the air was full of their shouting and were pressing and swaying towards the central space  the upper storeys of the council house seemed deserted not a human being was visible only the drooping banner of the surrender hung heavily against the light the dead were within the council house or hidden by the swarming people or carried away graham could see only a few neglected bodies in gaps and corners of the ruins and amidst the flowing water  will you let them see you sire said ostrog they are very anxious to see you  graham hesitated and then walked forward to where the broken verge of wall dropped sheer he i stood looking down a lonely tall black figure against the sky  very slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him and as they did so little bands of blackuniformed men appeared remotely thrusting through the crowds towards the council house he saw little black heads become pink looking at him saw by that means a wave of recognition sweep across the space it occurred to him that he should accord them some recognition he held up his arm then pointed to the council house and dropped his hand the voices below became unanimous gathered volume came up to him as multitudinous wavelets of cheering  the western sky was a pallid bluish green and jupiter shone high in the south before the capitulation was accomplished above was a slow insensible change the advance of night serene and beautiful below was hurry excitement conflicting orders pauses spasmodic developments of organisation a vast ascending clamour and confusion before the council came out toiling perspiring men directed by a conflict of shouts carried forth hundreds of those who had perished in the handtohand conflict within those long passages and chambers  guards in black lined the way that the council would come and as far as the eye could reach into the hazy blue twilight of the ruins and swarming now at every possible point in the captured council house and along the shattered cliff of its circumadjacent buildings were innumerable people and their voices even when they were not cheering were as the soughing of the sea upon a pebble beach ostrog had chosen a huge commanding pile of crushed and overthrown masonry and on this a stage of timbers and metal girders was being hastily constructed its essential parts were complete but humming and clangorous machinery still glared fitfully in the shadows beneath this temporary edifice  the stage had a small higher portion on which graham stood with ostrog and lincoln close beside him a little in advance of a group of minor officers a broader lower stage surrounded this quarter deck and on this were the blackuniformed guards of the revolt armed with the little green weapons whose very names graham still did not know those standing about him perceived that his eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming people in the twilight ruins about him to the darkling mass of the white council house whence the trustees would presently come and to the gaunt cliffs of ruin that encircled him and so back to the people the voices of the crowd swelled to a deafening tumult  he saw the councillors first afar off in the glare of one of the temporary lights that marked their path a little group of white figures blinking in a black archway in the council house they had been in darkness he watched them approaching drawing nearer past first this blazing electric star and then that the minatory roar of the crowd over whom their power had lasted for a hundred and fifty years marched along beside them as they drew still nearer their faces came out weary white and anxious he saw them blinking up through the glare about him and ostrog he contrasted their strange cold looks in the hall of atlas presently he could recognise several of them the man who had rapped the table at howard a burly man with a red beard and one delicatefeatured short dark man with a peculiarly long skull he noted that two were whispering together and looking behind him at ostrog next there came a tall dark and handsome man walking downcast abruptly he glanced up his eyes touched graham for a moment and passed beyond him to ostrog the way that had been made for them was so contrived that they had to march past and curve about before they came to the sloping path of planks that ascended to the stage where their surrender was to be made  the master the master god and the master shouted the people to hell with the council graham looked at their multitudes receding beyond counting into a shouting haze and then at ostrog beside him white and steadfast and still his eye went again to the little group of white councillors and then he looked up at the familiar quiet stars overhead the marvellous element in his fate was suddenly vivid could that be his indeed that little life in his memory two hundred years gone byand this as well    chapter xiv from the crows nest  and so after strange delays and through an avenue of doubt and battle this man from the nineteenth century came at last to his position at the head of that complex world  at first when he rose from the long deep sleep that followed his rescue and the surrender of the council he did not recognise his surroundings by an effort he gained a clue in his mind and all that had happened came back to him at first with a quality of insincerity like a story heard like something read out of a book and even before his memories were clear the exultation of his escape the wonder of his prominence were back in his mind he was owner of half the world master of the earth this new great age was in the completest sense his he no longer hoped to discover his experiences a dream he became anxious now to convince himself that they were real  an obsequious valet assisted him to dress under the direction of a dignified chief attendant a little man whose face proclaimed him japanese albeit he spoke english like an englishman from the latter he learnt something of the state of affairs already the revolution was an accepted fact already business was being resumed throughout the city abroad the downfall of the council had been received for the most part with delight nowhere was the council popular and the thousand cities of western america after two hundred years still jealous of new york london and the east had risen almost unanimously two days before at the news of grahams imprisonment paris was fighting within itself the rest of the world hung in suspense  while he was breaking his fast the sound of a telephone bell jetted from a corner and his chief attendant called his attention to the voice of ostrog making polite enquiries graham interrupted his refreshment to reply very shortly lincoln arrived and graham at once expressed a strong desire to talk to people and to be shown more of the new life that was opening before him lincoln informed him that in three hours time a representative gathering of officials and their wives would be held in the state apartments of the windvane chief grahams desire to traverse the ways of the city was however at present impossible because of the enormous excitement of the people it was however quite possible for him to take a birds eye view of the city from the crows nest of the windvane keeper to this accordingly graham was conducted by his attendant lincoln with a graceful compliment to the attendant apologised for not accompanying them on account of the present pressure of administrative work  higher even than the most gigantic windwheels hung this crows nest a clear thousand feet above the roofs a little discshaped speck on a spear of metallic filigree cable stayed to its summit graham was drawn in a little wirehung cradle halfway down the frailseeming stem was a light gallery about which hung a cluster of tubesminute they looked from aboverotating slowly on the ring of its outer rail these were the specula en rapport with the windvane keepers mirrors in one of which ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule his japanese attendant ascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering questions  it was a day full of the promise and quality of spring the touch of the wind warmed the sky was an intense blue and the vast expanse of london shone dazzling under the morning sun the air was clear of smoke and haze sweet as the air of a mountain glen  save for the irregular oval of ruins about the house of the council and the black flag of the surrender that fluttered there the mighty city seen from above showed few signs of the swift revolution that had to his imagination in one night and one day changed the destinies of the world a multitude of people still swarmed over these ruins and the huge openwork stagings in the distance from which started in times of peace the service of aeroplanes to the various great cities of europe and america were also black with the victors across a narrow way of planking raised on trestles that crossed the ruins a crowd of workmen were busy restoring the connection between the cables and wires of the council house and the rest of the city preparatory to the transfer thither of ostrogs headquarters from the windvane buildings  for the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed so vast was its serenity in comparison with the areas of disturbance that presently graham looking beyond them could almost forget the thousands of men lying out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasisubterranean labyrinth dead or dying of the overnight wounds forget the improvised wards with the hosts of surgeons nurses and bearers feverishly busy forget indeed all the wonder consternation and novelty under the electric lights down there in the hidden ways of the anthill he knew that the revolution triumphed that black everywhere carried the day black favours black banners black festoons across the streets and out here under the fresh sunlight beyond the crater of the fight as if nothing had happened to the earth the forest of wind vanes that had grown from one or two while the council had ruled roared peacefully upon their incessant duty  far away spiked jagged and indented by the wind vanes the surrey hills rose blue and faint to the north and nearer the sharp contours of highgate and muswell hill were similarly jagged and all over the countryside he knew on every crest and hill where once the hedges had interlaced and cottages churches inns and farmhouses had nestled among their trees wind wheels similar to those he saw and bearing like vast advertisements gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new age cast their whirling shadows and stored incessantly the energy that flowed away incessantly through all the arteries of the city and underneath these wandered the countless flocks and herds of the british food trust with their lonely guards and keepers  not a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of gigantic shapes below st pauls he knew survived and many of the old buildings in westminster embedded out of sight arched over and covered in among the giant growths of this great age the themes too made no fall and gleam of silver to break the wilderness of the city the thirsty water mains drank up every drop of its waters before they reached the walls its bed and estuary scoured and sunken was now a canal of sea water and a race of grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials of trade from the pool thereby beneath the very feet of the workers faint and dim in the eastward between earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal shipping in the pool for all the heavy traffic for which there was no need of haste came in gigantic sailing ships from the ends of the earth and the heavy goods for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a smaller swifter sort  and to the south over the hills came vast aqueducts with sea water for the sewers and in three separate directions ran pallid linesthe roads stippled with moving grey specks on the first occasion that offered he was determined to go out and see these roads that would come after the flying ship he was presently to try his attendant officer described them as a pair of gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide each one for the traffic going in one direction and made of a substance called eadhamitean artificial substance so far as he could gather resembling toughened glass along this shot a strange traffic of narrow rubbershod vehicles great single wheels two and four wheeled vehicles sweeping along at velocities of from one to six miles a minute railroads had vanished a few embankments remained as rustcrowned trenches here and there some few formed the cores of eadhamite ways  among the first things to strike his attention had been the great fleets of advertisement balloons and kites that receded in irregular vistas northward and southward along the lines of the aeroplane journeys no aeroplanes were to be seen their passages had ceased and only one littleseeming aeropile circled high in the blue distance above the surrey hills an unimpressive soaring speck  a thing graham had already learnt and which he found very hard to imagine was that nearly all the towns in the country and almost all the villages had disappeared here and there only he understood some gigantic hotellike edifice stood amid square miles of some single cultivation and preserved the name of a townas bournemouth wareham or swanage yet the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable such a change had been the old order had dotted the country with farmhouses and every two or three miles was the ruling landlords estate and the place of the inn and cobbler the grocers shop and churchthe village every eight miles or so was the country town where lawyer corn merchant woolstapler saddler veterinary surgeon doctor draper milliner and so forth lived every eight milessimply because that eight mile marketing journey four there and back was as much as was comfortable for the farmer but directly the railways came into play and after them the light railways and all the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons and horses and so soon as the high roads began to be made of wood and rubber and eadhamite and all sorts of elastic durable substancesthe necessity of having such frequent market towns disappeared and the big towns grew they drew the worker with the gravitational force of seemingly endless work the employer with their suggestions of an infinite ocean of labour  and as the standard of comfort rose as the complexity of the mechanism of living increased life in the country had become more and more costly or narrow and impossible the disappearance of vicar and squire the extinction of the general practitioner by the city specialist had robbed the village of its last touch of culture after telephone kinematograph and phonograph had replaced newspaper book schoolmaster and letter to live outside the range of the electric cables was to live an isolated savage in the country were neither means of being clothed nor fed according to the refined conceptions of the time no efficient doctors for an emergency no company and no pursuits  moreover mechanical appliances in agriculture made one engineer the equivalent of thirty labourers so inverting the condition of the city clerk in the days when london was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly foulness of its air the labourers now came hurrying by road or air to the city and its life and delights at night to leave it again in the morning the city had swallowed up humanity man had entered upon a new stage in his development first had come the nomad the hunter then had followed the agriculturist of the agricultural state whose towns and cities and ports were but the headquarters and markets of the countryside and now logical consequence of an epoch of invention was this huge new aggregation of men save london there were only four other cities in britainedinburgh portsmouth manchester and shrewsbury such things as these simple statements of fact though they were to contemporary men strained grahams imagination to picture and when he glanced over beyond there at the strange things that existed on the continent it failed him altogether  he had a vision of city beyond city cities on great plains cities beside great rivers vast cities along the sea margin cities girdled by snowy mountains over a great part of the earth the english tongue was spoken taken together with its spanish american and hindoo and negro and pidgin dialects it was the everyday language of twothirds of the people of the earth on the continent save as remote and curious survivals three other languages alone held swaygerman which reached to antioch and genoa and jostled spanishenglish at gdiz a gallicised russian which met the indian english in persia and kurdistan and the pidgin english in pekin and french still clear and brilliant the language of lucidity which shared the mediterranean with the indian english and german and reached through a negro dialect to the congo  and everywhere now through the cityset earth save in the administered black belt territories of the tropics the same cosmopolitan social organisation prevailed and everywhere from pole to equator his property and his responsibilities extended the whole world was civilised the whole world dwelt in cities the whole world was property over the british empire and throughout america his ownership was scarcely disguised congress and parliament were usually regarded as antique curious gatherings and even in the two empires of russia and germany the influence of his wealth was conceivably of enormous weight there of course came problemspossibilities but uplifted as he was even russia and germany seemed sufficiently remote and of the quality of the black belt administration and of what that might mean for him he thought after the fashion of his former days not at all that it should hang like a threat over the spacious vision before him could not enter his nineteenth century mind but his mind turned at once from the scenery to the thought of a vanished dread what of the yellow peril he asked and asano made him explain the chinese spectre had vanished chinaman and european were at peace the twentieth century had discovered with reluctant certainty that the average chinaman was as civilised more moral and far more intelligent than the average european serf and had repeated on a gigantic scale the fraternisation of scot and englishman that happened in the seventeenth century as asano put it they thought it over they found we were white men after all graham turned again to the view and his thoughts took a new direction  out of the dim southwest glittering and strange voluptuous and in some way terrible shone those pleasure cities of which the kinematographphonograph and the old man in the street had spoken strange places reminiscent of the legendary sybaris cities of art and beauty mercenary art and mercenary beauty sterile wonderful cities of motion and music whither repaired all who profited by the fierce inglorious economic struggle that went on in the glaring labyrinth below  fierce he knew it was how fierce he could judge from the fact that these latterday people referred back to the england of the nineteenth century as the figure of an idyllic easygoing life he turned his eyes to the scene immediately before him again trying to conceive the big factories of that intricate maze  northward he knew were the potters makers not only of earthenware and china but of the kindred pastes and compounds a subtler mineralogical chemistry had devised there were the makers of statuettes and wall ornaments and much intricate furniture there too were the factories where feverishly competitive authors devised their phonograph discourses and advertisements and arranged the groupings and developments for their perpetually startling and novel kinematographic dramatic works thence too flashed the worldwide messages the worldwide falsehoods of the newstellers the chargers of the telephonic machines that had replaced the newspapers of the past  to the westward beyond the smashed council house were the voluminous offices of municipal control and government and to the eastward towards the port the trading quarters the huge public markets the theatres houses of resort betting palaces miles of billiard saloons baseball and football circuses wild beast rings and the innumerable temples of the christian and quasichristian sects the mahomedans buddhists gnostics spook worshippers the incubus worshippers the furniture worshippers and so forth and to the south again a vast manufacture of textiles pickles wines and condiments and from point to point tore the countless multitudes along the roaring mechanical ways a gigantic hive of which the winds were tireless servants and the ceaseless windvanes an appropriate crown and symbol  he thought of the unprecedented population that had been sucked up by this sponge of halls and galleriesthe thirtythree million lives that were playing out each its own brief ineffectual drama below him and the complacency that the brightness of the day and the space and splendour of the view and above all the sense of his own importance had begotten dwindled and perished looking down from this height over the city it became at last possible to conceive this overwhelming multitude of thirtythree millions the reality of the responsibility he would take upon himself the vastness of the human maelstrom over which his slender kingship hung  he tried to figure the individual life it astonished him to realise how little the common man had changed in spite of the visible change in his conditions life and property indeed were secure from violence almost all over the world zymotic diseases bacterial diseases of all sorts had practically vanished everyone had a sufficiency of food and clothing was warmed in the city ways and sheltered from the weatherso much the almost mechanical progress of science and the physical organisation of society had accomplished but the crowd he was already beginning to discover was a crowd still helpless in the hands of demagogue and organiser individually cowardly individually swayed by appetite collectively incalculable the memory of countless figures in pale blue canvas came before his mind millions of such men and women below him he knew had never been out of the city had never seen beyond the little round of unintelligent grudging participation in the worlds business and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier pleasures he thought of the hopes of his vanished contemporaries and for a moment the dream of london in morriss quaint old news from nowhere and the perfect land of hudsons beautiful crystal ageappeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite loss he thought of his own hopes  for in the latter days of that passionate life that lay now so far behind him the conception of a free and equal manhood had become a very real thing to him he had hoped as indeed his age had hoped rashly taking it for granted that the sacrifice of the many to the few would some day cease that a day was near when every child born of woman should have a fair and assured chance of happiness and here after two hundred years the same hope still unfulfilled cried passionately through the city after two hundred years he knew greater than ever grown with the city to gigantic proportions were poverty and helpless labour and all the sorrows of his time  already he knew something of the history of the intervening years he had heard now of the moral decay that had followed the collapse of supernatural religion in the minds of ignoble man the decline of public honour the ascendency of wealth for men who had lost their belief in god had still kept their faith in property and wealth ruled a venial world  his japanese attendant asano in expounding the political history of the intervening two centuries drew an apt image from a seed eaten by insect parasites first there is the original seed ripening vigorously enough and then comes some insect and lays an egg under the skin and behold in a little while the seed is a hollow shape with an active grub inside that has eaten out its substance and then comes some secondary parasite some ichneumon fly and lays an egg within this grub and behold that too is a hollow shape and the new living thing is inside its predecessors skin which itself is snug within the seed coat and the seed coat still keeps its shape most people think it a seed still and for all one knows it may still think itself a seed vigorous and alive your victorian kingdom said asano was like thatkingship with the heart eaten out the landownersthe barons and gentrybegan ages ago with king john there were lapses but they beheaded king charles and ended practically with king george mere husk of a king the real power in the hands of their parliament but the parliamentthe organ of the landholding tenantruling gentrydid not keep its power long the change had already come in the nineteenth century the franchises had been broadened until it included masses of ignorant men urban myriads who went in their featureless thousands to vote together and the natural consequence of a swarming constituency is the rule of the party organisation power was passing even in the victorian time to the party machinery secret complex and corrupt very speedily power was in the hands of great men of business who financed the machines a time came when the real power and interest of the empire rested visibly between the two party councils ruling by newspapers and electoral organisationstwo small groups of rich and able men working at first in opposition then presently together  there was a reaction of a genteel ineffectual sort there were numberless books in existence asano said to prove thatthe publication of some of them was as early as grahams sleepa whole literature of reaction in fact the party of the reaction seems to have locked itself into its study and rebelled with unflinching determinationon paper the urgent necessity of either capturing or depriving the party councils of power is a common suggestion underlying all the thoughtful work of the early twentieth century both in america and england in most of these things america was a little earlier than england though both countries drove the same way  that counterrevolution never came it could never organise and keep pure there was not enough of the old sentimentality the old faith in righteousness left among men any organisation that became big enough to influence the polls became complex enough to be undermined broken up or bought outright by capable rich men socialistic and popular reactionary and purity parties were all at last mere stock exchange counters selling their principles to pay for their electioneering and the great concern of the rich was naturally to keep property intact the board clear for the game of trade just as the feudal concern had been to keep the board clear for hunting and war the whole world was exploited a battle field of businesses and financial convulsions the scourge of currency manipulation tariff wars made more human misery during the twentieth centurybecause the wretchedness was dreary life instead of speedy deaththan had war pestilence and famine in the darkest hours of earlier history  his own part in the development of this time he now knew clearly enough through the successive phases in the development of this mechanical civilisation aiding and presently directing its development there had grown a new power the council the board of his trustees at first it had been a mere chance union of the millions of isbister and warming a mere property holding company the creation of two childless testators whims but the collective talent of its first constitution had speedily guided it to a vast influence until by title deed loan and share under a hundred disguises and pseudonyms it had ramified through the fabric of the american and english states  wielding an enormous influence and patronage the council had early assumed a political aspect and in its development it had continually used its wealth to tip the beam of political decisions and its political advantages to grasp yet more and more wealth at last the party organisations of two hemispheres were in its hands it became an inner council of political control its last struggle was with the tacit alliance of the great jewish families but these families were linked only by a feeble sentiment at any time inheritance might fling a huge fragment of their resources to a minor a woman or a fool marriages and legacies alienated hundreds of thousands at one blow the council had no such breach in its continuity steadily steadfastly it grew  the original council was not simply twelve men of exceptional ability they fused it was a council of genius it struck boldly for riches for political influence and the two subserved each other with amazing foresight it spent great sums of money on the art of flying holding that invention back against an hour foreseen it used the patent laws and a thousand halflegal expedients to hamper all investigators who refused to work with it in the old days it never missed a capable man it paid his price its policy in those days was vigorousunerring and against it as it grew steadily and incessantly was only the chaotic selfish rule of the casually rich in a hundred years graham had become almost exclusive owner of africa of south america of france of london of england and all its influencefor all practical purposes that isa power in north americathen the dominant power in america the council bought and organised china drilled asia crippled the old world empires undermined them financially fought and defeated them  and this spreading usurpation of the world was so dexterously performeda proteushundreds of banks companies syndicates masked the councils operationsthat it was already far advanced before common men suspected the tyranny that had come the council never hesitated never faltered means of communication land buildings governments municipalities the territorial companies of the tropics every human enterprise it gathered greedily and it drilled and marshalled its men its railway police its roadway police its house guards and drain and cable guards its hosts of landworkers their unions it did not fight but it undermined and betrayed and bought them it bought the world at last and finally its culminating stroke was the introduction of flying  when the council in conflict with the workers in some of its huge monopolies did something flagrantly illegal and that without even the ordinary civility of bribery the old law alarmed for the profits of its complaisance looked about it for weapons but there were no more armies no fighting navies the age of peace had come the only possible war ships were the great steam vessels of the councils navigation trust the police forces they controlled the police of the railways of the ships of their agricultural estates their timekeepers and orderkeepers outnumbered the neglected little forces of the old country and municipal organisations ten to one and they produced flying machines there were men alive still who could remember the last great debate in the london house of commonsthe legal party the party against the council was in a minority but it made a desperate fightand how the members came crowding out upon the terrace to see these great unfamiliar winged shapes circling quietly overhead the council had soared to its power the last sham of a democracy that had permitted unlimited irresponsible property was at an end  within one hundred and fifty years of grahams falling asleep his council had thrown off its disguises and ruled openly supreme in his name elections had become a cheerful formality a septennial folly an ancient unmeaning custom a social parliament as ineffectual as the convocation of the established church in victorian times assembled now and then and a legitimate king of england disinherited drunken and witless played foolishly in a secondrate musichall so the magnificent dream of the nineteenth century the noble project of universal individual liberty and universal happiness touched by a disease of honour crippled by a superstition of absolute property crippled by the religious feuds that had robbed the common citizens of education robbed men of standards of conduct and brought the sanctions of morality to utter contempt had worked itself out in the face of invention and ignoble enterprise first to a warring plutocracy and finally to the rule of a supreme plutocrat his council at last had ceased even to trouble to have its decrees endorsed by the constitutional authorities and he a motionless sunken yellowskinned figure had lain neither dead nor living recognisably and immediately master of the earth and awoke at last to find himselfmaster of that inheritance awoke to stand under the cloudless empty sky and gaze down upon the greatness of his dominion  to what end had he awakened was this city this hive of hopeless toilers the final refutation of his ancient hopes or was the fire of liberty the fire that had blazed and waned in the years of his past life still smouldering below there he thought of the stir and impulse of the song of the revolution was that song merely the trick of a demagogue to be forgotten when its purpose was served was the hope that still stirred within him only the memory of abandoned things the vestige of a creed outworn or had it a wider meaning an import interwoven with the destiny of man to what end had he awakened what was there for him to do humanity was spread below him like a map he thought of the millions and millions of humanity following each other unceasingly for ever out of the darkness of nonexistence into the darkness of death to what end aim there must be but it transcended his power of thought he saw for the first time clearly his own infinite littleness saw stark and terrible the tragic contrast of human strength and the craving of the human heart for that little while he knew himself for the petty accident he was and knew therewith the greatness of his desire and suddenly his littleness was intolerable his aspiration was intolerable and there came to him an irresistible impulse to pray and he prayed he prayed vague incoherent contradictory things his soul strained up through time and space and all the fleeting multitudinous confusion of being towards somethinghe scarcely knew whattowards something that could comprehend his striving and endure  a man and a woman were far below on a roof space to the southward enjoying the freshness of the morning air the man had brought out a perspective glass to spy upon the council house and he was showing her how to use it presently their curiosity was satisfied they could see no traces of bloodshed from their position and after a survey of the empty sky she came round to the crows nest and there she saw two little black figures so small it was hard to believe they were men one who watched and one who gesticulated with hands outstretched to the silent emptiness of heaven  she handed the glass to the man he looked and exclaimed  i believe it is the master yes i am sure it is the master  he lowered the glass and looked at her waving his hands about almost as if he was praying i wonder what he is up to worshipping the sun there werent parses in this country in his time were there  he looked again hes stopped it now it was a chance attitude i suppose he put down the glass and became meditative he wont have anything to do but enjoy himselfjust enjoy himself ostrog will boss the show of course ostrog will have to because of keeping all these labourer fools in bounds them and their song and got it all by sleeping dear eyesjust sleeping its a wonderful world    chapter xv prominent people  the state apartments of the wind vane keeper would have seemed astonishingly intricate to graham had he entered them fresh from his nineteenth century life but already he was growing accustomed to the scale of the new time they can scarcely be described as halls and rooms seeing that a complicated system of arches bridges passages and galleries divided and united every part of the great space he came out through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a plateau of landing at the head of a flight of very broad and gentle steps with men and women far more brilliantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen ascending and descending from this position he looked down a vista of intricate ornament in lustreless white and mauve and purple spanned by bridges that seemed wrought of porcelain and filigree and terminating far off in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens  glancing upward he saw tier above tier of ascending galleries with faces looking down upon him the air was full of the babble of innumerable voices and of a music that descended from above a gay and exhilarating music whose source he never discovered  the central aisle was thick with people but by no means uncomfortably crowded altogether that assembly must have numbered many thousands they were brilliantly even fantastically dressed the men as fancifully as the women for the sobering influence of the puritan conception of dignity upon masculine dress had long since passed away the hair of the men too though it was rarely worn long was commonly curled in a manner that suggested the barber and baldness had vanished from the earth frizzy straightcut masses that would have charmed rossetti abounded and one gentleman who was pointed out to graham under the mysterious title of an amorist wore his hair in two becoming plaits a la marguerite the pigtail was in evidence it would seem that citizens of chinese extraction were no longer ashamed of their race there was little uniformity of fashion apparent in the forms of clothing worn the more shapely men displayed their symmetry in trunk hose and here were puffs and slashes and there a cloak and there a robe the fashions of the days of leo the tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence but the aesthetic conceptions of the far east were also patent masculine embonpoint which in victorian times would have been subjected to the tightly buttoned perils the ruthless exaggeration of tightlegged tightarmed evening dress now formed but the basis of a wealth of dignity and drooping folds graceful slenderness abounded also to graham a typically stiff man from a typically stiff period not only did these men seem altogether too graceful in person but altogether too expressive in their vividly expressive faces they gesticulated they expressed surprise interest amusement above all they expressed the emotions excited in their minds by the ladies about them with astonishing frankness even at the first glance it was evident that women were in a great majority  the ladies in the company of these gentlemen displayed in dress bearing and manner alike less emphasis and more intricacy some affected a classical simplicity of robing and subtlety of fold after the fashion of the first french empire and flashed conquering arms and shoulders as graham passed others had closelyfitting dresses without seam or belt at the waist sometimes with long folds falling from the shoulders the delightful confidences of evening dress had not been diminished by the passage of two centuries  everyones movements seemed graceful graham remarked to lincoln that he saw men as raphaels cartoons walking and lincoln told him that the attainment of an appropriate set of gestures was part of every rich persons education the masters entry was greeted with a sort of tittering applause but these people showed their distinguished manners by not crowding upon him nor annoying him by any persistent scrutiny as he descended the steps towards the floor of the aisle  he had already learnt from lincoln that these were the leaders of existing london society almost every person there that night was either a powerful official or the immediate connexion of a powerful official many had returned from the european pleasure cities expressly to welcome him the aeronautic authorities whose defection had played a part in the overthrow of the council only second to grahams were very prominent and so too was the wind vane control amongst others there were several of the more prominent officers of the food trust the controller of the european piggeries had a particularly melancholy and interesting countenance and a daintily cynical manner a bishop in full canonicals passed athwart grahams vision conversing with a gentleman dressed exactly like the traditional chaucer including even the laurel wreath  who is that he asked almost involuntarily  the bishop of london said lincoln  nothe other i mean  poet laureate  you still  he doesnt make poetry of course hes a cousin of wottonone of the councillors but hes one of the red rose royalistsa delightful cluband they keep up the tradition of these things  asano told me there was a king  the king doesnt belong they had to expel him its the stuart blood i suppose but really  too much  far too much  graham did not quite follow all this but it seemed part of the general inversion of the new age he bowed condescendingly to his first introduction it was evident that subtle distinctions of class prevailed even in this assembly that only to a small proportion of the guests to an inner group did lincoln consider it appropriate to introduce him this first introduction was the master aeronaut a man whose suntanned face contrasted oddly with the delicate complexions about him just at present his critical defection from the council made him a very important person indeed  his manner contrasted very favourably according to grahams ideas with the general bearing he made a few commonplace remarks assurances of loyalty and frank inquiries about the masters health his manner was breezy his accent lacked the easy staccato of latterday english he made it admirably clear to graham that he was a bluff aerial doghe used that phrasethat there was no nonsense about him that he was a thoroughly manly fellow and oldfashioned at that that he didnt profess to know much and that what he did not know was not worth knowing he made a manly bow ostentatiously free from obsequiousness and passed  i am glad to see that type endures said graham  phonographs and kinematographs said lincoln a little spitefully he has studied from the life graham glanced at the burly form again it was oddly reminiscent  as a matter of fact we bought him said lincoln partly and partly he was afraid of ostrog everything rested with him  he turned sharply to introduce the surveyorgeneral of the public school trust this person was a willowy figure in a bluegrey academic gown he beamed down upon graham through pincenez of a victorian pattern and illustrated his remarks by gestures of a beautifully manicured hand graham was immediately interested in this gentlemans functions and asked him a number of singularly direct questions the surveyorgeneral seemed quietly amused at the masters fundamental bluntness he was a little vague as to the monopoly of education his company possessed it was done by contract with the syndicate that ran the numerous london municipalities but he waxed enthusiastic over educational progress since the victorian times we have conquered cram he said completely conquered cramthere is not an examination left in the world arent you glad  how do you get the work done asked graham  we make it attractiveas attractive as possible and if it does not attract thenwe let it go we cover an immense field  he proceeded to details and they had a lengthy conversation the surveyorgeneral mentioned the names of pestalozzi and froebel with profound respect although he displayed no intimacy with their epochmaking works graham learnt that university extension still existed in a modified form there is a certain type of girl for example said the surveyorgeneral dilating with a sense of his usefulness with a perfect passion for severe studieswhen they are not too difficult you know we cater for them by the thousand at this moment he said with a napoleonic touch nearly five hundred phonographs are lecturing in different parts of london on the influence exercised by plato and swift on the love affairs of shelley hazlitt and burns and afterwards they write essays on the lectures and the names in order of merit are put in conspicuous places you see how your little germ has grown the illiterate middleclass of your days has quite passed away  about the public elementary schools said graham do you control them  the surveyorgeneral did entirely now graham in his later democratic days had taken a keen interest in these and his questioning quickened certain casual phrases that had fallen from the old man with whom he had talked in the darkness recurred to him the surveyorgeneral in effect endorsed the old mans words we have abolished cram he said a phrase graham was beginning to interpret as the abolition of all sustained work the surveyorgeneral became sentimental we try and make the elementary schools very pleasant for the little children they will have to work so soon just a few simple principlesobedienceindustry  you teach them very little  why should we it only leads to trouble and discontent we amuse them even as it isthere are troublesagitations where the labourers get the ideas one cannot tell they tell one another there are socialistic dreamsanarchy even agitators will get to work among them i take iti have always taken itthat my foremost duty is to fight against popular discontent why should people be made unhappy  i wonder said graham thoughtfully but there are a great many things i want to know  lincoln who had stood watching grahams face throughout the conversation intervened there are others he said in an undertone  the surveyorgeneral of schools gesticulated himself away perhaps said lincoln intercepting a casual glance you would like to know some of these ladies  the daughter of the manager of the piggeries of the european food trust was a particularly charming little person with red hair and animated blue eyes lincoln left him awhile to converse with her and she displayed herself as quite an enthusiast for the dear old times as she called them that had seen the beginning of his trance as she talked she smiled and her eyes smiled in a manner that demanded reciprocity  i have tried she said countless timesto imagine those old romantic days and to you they are memories how strange and crowded the world must seem to you i have seen photographs and pictures of the old times the little isolated houses built of bricks made out of burnt mud and all black with soot from your fires the railway bridges the simple advertisements the solemn savage puritanical men in strange black coats and those tall hats of theirs iron railway trains on iron bridges overhead horses and cattle and even dogs running half wild about the streets and suddenly you have come into this  into this said graham  out of your lifeout of all that was familiar  the old life was not a happy one said graham i do not regret that  she looked at him quickly there was a brief pause she sighed encouragingly no  no said graham it was a little lifeand unmeaning but this we thought the world complex and crowded and civilised enough yet i seealthough in this world i am barely four days oldlooking back on my own time that it was a queer barbaric timethe mere beginning of this new order the mere beginning of this new order you will find it hard to understand how little i know  you may ask me what you like she said smiling at him  then tell me who these people are im still very much in the dark about them its puzzling are there any generals  men in hats and feathers  of course not no i suppose they are the men who control the great public businesses who is that distinguished looking man  that hes a most important officer that is morden he is managing director of the antibilious pill company i have heard that his workers sometimes turn out a myriad myriad pills a day in the twentyfour hours fancy a myriad myriad  a myriad myriad no wonder he looks proud said graham pills what a wonderful time it is that man in purple  he is not quite one of the inner circle you know but we like him he is really clever and very amusing he is one of the heads of the medical faculty of our london university all medical men you know are shareholders in the medical faculty company and wear that purple you have to beto be qualified but of course people who are paid by fees for doing something she smiled away the social pretensions of all such people  are any of your great artists or authors here  no authors they are mostly such queer peopleand so preoccupied about themselves and they quarrel so dreadfully they will fight some of them for precedence on staircases dreadful isnt it but i think wraysbury the fashionable capillotomist is here from capri  capillotomist said graham ah i remember an artist why not  we have to cultivate him she said apologetically our heads are in his hands she smiled  graham hesitated at the invited compliment but his glance was expressive have the arts grown with the rest of civilised things he said who are your great painters  she looked at him doubtfully then laughed for a moment she said i thought you meant she laughed again you mean of course those good men you used to think so much of because they could cover great spaces of canvas with oilcolours great oblongs and people used to put the things in gilt frames and hang them up in rows in their square rooms we havent any people grew tired of that sort of thing  but what did you think i meant  she put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow was above suspicion and smiled and looked very arch and pretty and inviting and here and she indicated her eyelid  graham had an adventurous moment then a grotesque memory of a picture he had somewhere seen of uncle toby and the widow flashed across his mind an archaic shame came upon him he became acutely aware that he was visible to a great number of interested people i see he remarked inadequately he turned awkwardly away from her fascinating facility he looked about him to meet a number of eyes that immediately occupied themselves with other things possibly he coloured a little who is that talking with the lady in saffron he asked avoiding her eyes  the person in question he learnt was one of the great organisers of the american theatres just fresh from a gigantic production at mexico his face reminded graham of a bust of caligula another striking looking man was the black labour master the phrase at the time made no deep impression but afterwards it recurredthe black labour master the little lady in no degree embarrassed pointed out to him a charming little woman as one of the subsidiary wives of the anglican bishop of london she added encomiums on the episcopal couragehitherto there had been a rule of clerical monogamyneither a natural nor an expedient condition of things why should the natural development of the affections be dwarfed and restricted because a man is a priest  and bye the bye she added are you an anglican graham was on the verge of hesitating inquiries about the status of a subsidiary wife apparently an euphemistic phrase when lincolns return broke off this very suggestive and interesting conversation they crossed the aisle to where a tall man in crimson and two charming persons in burmese costume as it seemed to him awaited him diffidently from their civilities he passed to other presentations  in a little while his multitudinous impressions began to organise themselves into a general effect at first the glitter of the gathering had raised all the democrat in graham he had felt hostile and satirical but it is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of courteous regard soon the music the light the play of colours the shining arms and shoulders about him the touch of hands the transient interest of smiling faces the frothing sound of skillfully modulated voices the atmosphere of compliment interest and respect had woven together into a fabric of indisputable pleasure graham for a time forgot his spacious resolutions he gave way insensibly to the intoxication of me position that was conceded him his manner became less conscious more convincingly regal his feet walked assuredly the black robe fell with a bolder fold and pride ennobled his voice after all this was a brilliant interesting world  his glance went approvingly over the shifting colours of the people it rested here and there in kindly criticism upon a face presently it occurred to him that he owed some apology to the charming little person with the red hair and blue eyes he felt guilty of a clumsy snub it was not princely to ignore her advances even if his policy necessitated their rejection he wondered if he should see her again and suddenly a little thing touched all the glamour of this brilliant gathering and changed its quality  he looked up and saw passing across a bridge of porcelain and looking down upon him a face that was almost immediately hidden the face of the girl he had seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre after his escape from the council and she was looking with much the same expression of curious expectation of uncertain intentness upon his proceedings for the moment he did not remember when he had seen her and then with recognition came a vague memory of the stirring emotions of their first encounter but the dancing web of melody about him kept the air of that great marching song from his memory  the lady to whom he was talking repeated her remark and graham recalled himself to the quasiregal flirtation upon which he was engaged  but from that moment a vague restlessness a feeling that grew to dissatisfaction came into his mind he was troubled as if by some half forgotten duty by the sense of things important slipping from him amidst this light and brilliance the attraction that these bright ladies who crowded about him were beginning to exercise ceased he no longer made vague and clumsy responses to the subtly amorous advances that he was now assured were being made to him and his eyes wandered for another sight of that face that had appealed so strongly to his sense of beauty but he did not see her again until he was awaiting lincolns return to leave this assembly in answer to his request lincoln had promised that an attempt should be made to fly that afternoon if the weather permitted he had gone to make certain necessary arrangements  graham was in one of the upper galleries in conversation with a brighteyed lady on the subject of eadhamitethe subject was his choice and not hers he had interrupted her warm assurances of personal devotion with a matteroffact inquiry he found her as he had already found several other latterday women that night less well informed than charming suddenly struggling against the eddying drift of nearer melody the song of the revolt the great song he had heard in the hall hoarse and massive came beating down to him  he glanced up startled and perceived above him an oeil de boeuf through which this song had come and beyond the upper courses of cable the blue haze and the pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways he heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease but now he perceived quite clearly the drone and tumult of the moving platforms and a murmur of many people he had a vague persuasion that he could not account for a sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a huge crowd must be watching this place in which their master amused himself he wondered what they might be thinking  though the song had stopped so abruptly though the special music of this gathering reasserted itself the motif of the marching song once it had begun lingered in his mind  the brighteyed lady was still struggling with the mysteries of eadhamite when he perceived the girl he had seen in the theatre again she was coming now along the gallery towards him he saw her first before she saw him she was dressed in a faintly luminous grey her dark hair about her brows was like a cloud and as he saw her the cold light from the circular opening into the ways fell upon her downcast face  the lady in trouble about the eadhamite saw the change in his expression and grasped her opportunity to escape would you care to know that girl sire she asked boldly she is helen wottona niece of ostrogs she knows a great many serious things she is one of the most serious persons alive i am sure you will like her  in another moment graham was talking to the girl and the brighteyed lady had fluttered away  i remember you quite well said graham you were in that little room when all the people were singing and beating time with their feet before i walked across the hall  her momentary embarrassment passed she looked up at him and her face was steady it was wonderful she said hesitated and spoke with a sudden effort all those people would have died for you sire countless people did die for you that night  her face glowed she glanced swiftly aside to see that no other heard her words  lincoln appeared some way off along the gallery making his way through the press towards them she saw him and turned to graham strangely eager with a swift change to confidence and intimacy sire she said quickly i cannot tell you now and here but the common people are very unhappy they are oppressedthey are misgoverned do not forget the people who faced deathdeath that you might live  i know nothing began graham  i cannot tell you now  lincolns face appeared close to them he bowed an apology to the girl  you find the new world pleasant sire asked lincoln with smiling deference and indicating the space and splendour of the gathering by one comprehensive gesture at any rate you find it changed  yes said graham changed and yet after all not so greatly changed  wait till you are in the air said lincoln the wind has fallen even now an aeropile awaits you  the girls attitude awaited dismissal  graham glanced at her face was on the verge of a question found a warning in her expression bowed to her and turned to accompany lincoln     chapter xvi the aerophile  for a while as graham went through the passages of the windvane offices with lincoln he was preoccupied but by an effort he attended to the things which lincoln was saying soon his preoccupation vanished lincoln was talking of flying graham had a strong desire to know more of this new human attainment he began to ply lincoln with questions he had followed the crude beginnings of aerial navigation very keenly in his previous life he was delighted to find the familiar names of maxim and pilcher langley and chanute and above all of the aerial protomartyr lillienthal still honoured by men  even during his previous life two lines of investigation had pointed clearly to two distinct types of contrivance as possible and both of these had been realised on the one hand was the great enginedriven aeroplane a double row of horizontal floats with a big aerial screw behind and on the other the nimbler aeropile the aeroplanes flew safely only in a calm or moderate wind and sudden storms occurrences that were now accurately predictable rendered them for all practical purposes useless they were built of enormous sizethe usual stretch of wing being six hundred feet or more and the length of the fabric a thousand feet they were for passenger traffic alone the lightly swung car they carried was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in length it was hung in a peculiar manner in order to minimise the complex vibration that even a moderate wind produced and for the same reason the little seats within the careach passenger remained seated during the voyagewere slung with great freedom of movement the starting of the mechanism was only possible from a gigantic car on the rail of a specially constructed stage graham had seen these vast stages the flying stages from the crows nest very well six huge blank areas they were with a giant carrier stage on each  the choice of descent was equally circumscribed an accurately plane surface being needed for safe grounding apart from the destruction that would have been caused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and metal and the impossibility of its rising again the concussion of an irregular surface a treeset hillside for instance or an embankment would be sufficient to pierce or damage the framework to smash the ribs of the body and perhaps kill those aboard  at first graham felt disappointed with these cumbersome contrivances but he speedily grasped the fact that smaller machines would have been unremunerative for the simple reason that their carrying power would be disproportionately diminished with diminished size moreover the huge size of these things enabled themand it was a consideration of primary importanceto traverse the air at enormous speeds and so run no risks of unanticipated weather the briefest journey performed that from london to paris took about threequarters of an hour but the velocity attained was not high the leap to new york occupied about two hours and by timing oneself carefully at the intermediate stations it was possible in quiet weather to go around the world in a day  the little aeropiles as for no particular reason they were distinctively called were of an altogether different type several of these were going to and fro in the air they were designed to carry only one or two persons and their manufacture and maintenance was so costly as to render them the monopoly of the richer sort of people their sails which were brilliantly coloured consisted only of two pairs of lateral air floats in the same plane and of a screw behind their small size rendered a descent in any open space neither difficult nor disagreeable and it was possible to attach pneumatic wheels or even the ordinary motors for terrestrial tragic to them and so carry them to a convenient starting place they required a special sort of swift car to throw them into the air but such a car was efficient in any open place clear of high buildings or trees human aeronautics graham perceived were evidently still a long way behind the instinctive gift of the albatross or the flycatcher one great influence that might have brought the aeropile to a more rapid perfection had been withheld these inventions had never been used in warfare the last great international struggle had occurred before the usurpation of the council  the flying stages of london were collected together in an irregular crescent on the southern side of the river they formed three groups of two each and retained the names of ancient suburban hills or villages they were named in order roehampton wimbledon park streatham norwood blackheath and shooters hill they were uniform structures rising high above the general roof surfaces each was about four thousand yards long and a thousand broad and constructed of the compound of aluminium and iron that had replaced iron in architecture their higher tiers formed an openwork of girders through which lifts and staircases ascended the upper surface was a uniform expanse with portionsthe starting carriersthat could be raised and were then able to run on very slightly inclined rails to the end of the fabric save for any aeropiles or aeroplanes that were in port these open surfaces were kept clear for arrivals  during the adjustment of the aeroplanes it was the custom for passengers to wait in the system of theatres restaurants newsrooms and places of pleasure and indulgence of various sorts that interwove with the prosperous shops below this portion of london was in consequence commonly the gayest of all its districts with something of the meretricious gaiety of a seaport or city of hotels and for those who took a more serious view of aeronautics the religious quarters had flung out an attractive colony of devotional chapels while a host of brilliant medical establishments competed to supply physical preparatives for the journey at various levels through the mass of chambers and passages beneath these ran in addition to the main moving ways of the city which laced and gathered here a complex system of special passages and lifts and slides for the convenient interchange of people and luggage between stage and stage and a distinctive feature of the architecture of this section was the ostentatious massiveness of the metal piers and girders that everywhere broke the vistas and spanned the halls and passages crowding and twining up to meet the weight of the stages and the weighty impact of the aeroplanes overhead  graham went to the flying stages by the public ways he was accompanied by asano his japanese attendant lincoln was called away by ostrog who was busy with his administrative concerns a strong guard of the windvane police awaited the master outside the windvane offices and they cleared a space for him on the upper moving platform his passage to the flying stages was unexpected nevertheless a considerable crowd gathered and followed him to his destination as he went along he could hear the people shouting his name and saw numberless men and women and children in blue come swarming up the staircases in the central path gesticulating and shouting he could not hear what they shouted he was struck again by the evident existence of a vulgar dialect among the poor of the city when at last he descended his guards were immediately surrounded by a dense excited crowd afterwards it occurred to him that some had attempted to reach him with petitions his guards cleared a passage for him with difficulty  he found an aeropile in charge of an aeronaut awaiting him on the westward stage seen close this mechanism was no longer small as it lay on its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage its aluminium body skeleton was as big as the hull of a twentyton yacht its lateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of a bees wing and made of some sort of glassy artificial membrane cast their shadow over many hundreds of square yards the chairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle within the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle the passengers chair was protected by a windguard and guarded about with metallic rods carrying air cushions it could if desired be completely closed in but graham was anxious for novel experiences and desired that it should be left open the aeronaut sat behind a glass that sheltered his face the passenger could secure himself firmly in his seat and this was almost unavoidable on landing or he could move along by means of a little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine where his personal luggage his wraps and restoratives were placed and which also with the seats served as a makeweight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the propeller at the stern  the engine was very simple in appearance asano pointing out the parts of this apparatus to him told him that like the gasengine of victorian days it was of the explosive type burning a small drop of a substance called fomile at each stroke it consisted simply of reservoir and piston about the long fluted crank of the propeller shaft so much graham saw of the machine  the flying stage about him was empty save for asano and their suite of attendants directed by the aeronaut he placed himself in his seat he then drank a mixture containing ergota dose he learnt invariably administered to those about to fly and designed to counteract the possible effect of diminished air pressure upon the system having done so he declared himself ready for the journey asano took the empty glass from him stepped through the bars of the hull and stood below on the stage waving his hand suddenly he seemed to slide along the stage to the right and vanish  the engine was beating the propeller spinning and for a second the stage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally past grahams eye then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly he gripped the little rods on either side of him instinctively he felt himself moving upward heard the air whistle over the top of the wind screen the propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic impulsesone two three pause one two threewhich the engineer controlled very delicately the machine began a quivering vibration that continued throughout the flight and the roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller he looked from the face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine looking sideways there was nothing very startling in what he sawa rapid funicular railway might have given the same sensations he recognised the council house and the highgate ridge and then he looked straight down between his feet  for a moment physical terror possessed him a passionate sense of insecurity he held tight for a second or so he could not lift his eyes some hundred feet or more sheer below him was one of the big windvanes of southwest london and beyond it the southernmost flying stage crowded with little black dots these things seemed to be falling away from him for a second he had an impulse to pursue the earth he set his teeth he lifted his eyes by a muscular effort and the moment of panic passed  he remained for a space with his teeth set hard his eyes staring into the sky throb throb throbbeat went the engine throb throb throbbeat he gripped his bars tightly glanced at the aeronaut and saw a smile upon his suntanned face he smiled in returnperhaps a little artificially a little strange at first he shouted before he recalled his dignity but he dared not look down again for some time he stared over the aeronauts head to where a rim of vague blue horizon crept up the sky for a little while he could not banish the thought of possible accidents from his mind throb throb throbbeat suppose some trivial screw went wrong in that supporting engine suppose he made a grim effort to dismiss all such suppositions after a while they did at least abandon the foreground of his thoughts and up he went steadily higher and higher into the clear air  once the mental shock of moving unsupported through the air was over his sensations ceased to be unpleasant became very speedily pleasurable he had been warned of air sickness but he found the pulsating movement of the aeropile as it drove up the faint southwest breeze was very little in excess of the pitching of a boat head on to broad rollers in a moderate gale and he was constitutionally a good sailor and the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration he looked up and saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds his eye came cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky for a space he watched these then going lower and less apprehensively he saw the slender figure of the windvane keepers crows nest shining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment as his eye fell with more confidence now there came a blue line of hills and then london already to leeward an intricate space of roofing its near edge came sharp and clear and banished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise for the boundary of london was like a wall like a cliff a steep fall of three or four hundred feet a frontage broken only by terraces here and there a complex decorative facade  that gradual passage of town into country through an extensive sponge of suburbs which was so characteristic a feature of the great cities of the nineteenth century existed no longer nothing remained of it but a waste of ruins here variegated and dense with thickets of the heterogeneous growths that had once adorned the gardens of the belt interspersed among levelled brown patches of sown ground and verdant stretches of winter greens the latter even spread among the vestiges of houses but for the most part the reefs and skerries of ruins the wreckage of suburban villas stood among their streets and roads queer islands amidst the levelled expanses of green and brown abandoned indeed by the inhabitants years since but too substantial it seemed to be cleared out of the way of the wholesale horticultural mechanisms of the time  the vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed amidst the countless cells of crumbling house walls and broke along the foot of the city wall in a surf of bramble and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses here and there gaudy pleasure palaces towered amidst the puny remains of victorian times and cable ways slanted to them from the city that winter day they seemed deserted deserted too were the artificial gardens among the ruins the city limits were indeed as sharply defined as in the ancient days when the gates were shut at nightfall and the robber foreman prowled to the very walls a huge semicircular throat poured out a vigorous traffic upon the eadhamite bath road so the first prospect of the world beyond the city flashed on graham and dwindled and when at last he could look vertically downward again he saw below him the vegetable fields of the thames valleyinnumerable minute oblongs of ruddy brown intersected by shining threads the sewage ditches  his exhilaration increased rapidly became a sort of intoxication he found himself drawing deep breaths of air laughing aloud desiring to shout after a time that desire became too strong for him and he shouted  the machine had now risen as high as was customary with aeropiles and they began to curve about towards the south steering graham perceived was effected by the opening or closing of one or two thin strips of membrane in one or other of the otherwise rigid wings and by the movement of the whole engine backward or forward along its supports the aeronaut set the engine gliding slowly forward along its rail and opened the valve of the leeward wing until the stem of the aeropile was horizontal and pointing southward and in that direction they drove with a slight list to leeward and with a slow alternation of movement first a short sharp ascent and then a long downward glide that was very swift and pleasing during these downward glides the propellor was inactive altogether these ascents gave graham a glorious sense of successful effort the descents through the rarefied air were beyond all experience he wanted never to leave the upper air again  for a time he was intent upon the minute details of the landscape that ran swiftly northward beneath him its minute clear detail pleased him exceedingly he was impressed by the ruin of the houses that had once dotted the country by the vast treeless expanse of country from which all farms and villages had gone save for crumbling ruins he had known the thing was so but seeing it so was an altogether different matter he tried to make out places he had known within the hollow basin of the world below but at first he could distinguish no data now that the thames valley was left behind soon however they were driving over a sharp chalk hill that he recognised as the guildford hogs back because of the familiar outline of the gorge at its eastward end and because of the ruins of the town that rose steeply on either lip of this gorge and from that he made out other points leith hill the sandy wastes of aldershot and so forth the downs escarpment was set with gigantic slowmoving windwheels save where the broad eadhamite portsmouth road thickly dotted with rushing shapes followed the course of the old railway the gorge of the wey was choked with thickets  the whole expanse of the downs escarpment so far as the grey haze permitted him to see was set with windwheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger brother they stirred with a stately motion before the southwest wind and here and there were patches dotted with the sheep of the british food trust and here and there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black then rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the wealden heights the line of hindhead pitch hill and leith hill with a second row of windwheels that seemed striving to rob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze the purple heather was speckled with yellow gorse and on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded before a couple of mounted men swiftly these swept behind and dwindled and lost colour and became scarce moving specks that were swallowed up in haze  and when these had vanished in the distance graham heard a peewit wailing close at hand he perceived he was now above the south downs and staring over his shoulder saw the battlements of portsmouth landing stage towering over the ridge of portsdown hill in another moment there came into sight a spread of shipping like floating cities the little white cliffs of the needles dwarfed and sunlit and the grey and glittering waters of the narrow sea they seemed to leap the solent in a moment and in a few seconds the isle of wight was running past and then beneath him spread a wider and wide extent of sea here purple with the shadow of a cloud here grey here a burnished mirror and here a spread of cloudy greenish blue the isle of wight grew smaller and smaller in a few more minutes a strip of grey haze detached itself from other strips that were clouds descended out of the sky and became a coastlinesunlit and pleasantthe coast of northern france it rose it took colour became definite and detailed and the counterpart of the downland of england was speeding by below  in a little time as it seemed paris came above the horizon and hung there for a space and sank out of sight again as the aeropile circled about to the north again but he perceived the eiffel tower still standing and beside it a huge dome surmounted by a pinpoint colossus and he perceived too though he did not understand it at the time a slanting drift of smoke the aeronaut said something about trouble in the underways that graham did not heed at the time but he marked the minarets and towers and slender masses that streamed skyward above the city windvanes and knew that in the matter of grace at least paris still kept in front of her larger rival and even as he looked a pale blue shape ascended very swiftly from the city like a dead leaf driving up before a gale it curved round and soared towards them growing rapidly larger and larger the aeronaut was saying something what said graham loath to take his eyes from this aeroplane sire bawled the aeronaut pointing  they rose and curved about northward as it drew nearer nearer it came and nearer larger and larger the throb throb throbbeat of the aeropiles flight that had seemed so potent and so swift suddenly appeared slow by comparison with this tremendous rush how great the monster seemed how swift and steady it passed quite closely beneath them driving along silently a vast spread of wirenetted translucent wings a thing alive graham had a momentary glimpse of the rows and rows of wrappedup passengers slung in their little cradles behind windscreens of a whiteclothed engineer crawling against the gale along a ladder way of spouting engines beating together of the whirling wind screw and of a wide waste of wing he exulted in the sight and in an instant the thing had passed  it rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the rush of its flight it fell and grew smaller scarcely had they moved as it seemed before it was again only a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky this was the aeroplane that went to and fro between london and paris in fair weather and in peaceful times it came and went four times a day  they beat across the channel slowly as it seemed now to grahams enlarged ideas and beachy head rose greyly to the left of them  land called the aeronaut his voice small against the whistling of the air over the windscreen  not yet bawled graham laughing not land yet i want to learn more of this machine  i meant said the aeronaut  i want to learn more of this machine repeated graham  im coming to you he said and had flung himself free of his chair and taken a step along the guarded rail between them he stopped for a moment and his colour changed and his hands tightened another step and he was clinging close to the aeronaut he felt a weight on his shoulder the pressure of the air his hat was a whirling speck behind the wind came in gusts over his windscreen and blew his hair in streamers past his cheek the aeronaut made some hasty adjustments for the shifting of the centres of gravity and pressure  i want to have these things explained said graham what do you do when you move that engine forward  the aeronaut hesitated then he answered they are complex sire  i dont mind shouted graham i dont mind  there was a moments pause aeronautics is the secretthe privilege  i know but im the master and i mean to know he laughed full of this novel realisation of power that was his gift from the upper air  the aeropile curved about and the keen fresh wind cut across grahams face and his garment lugged at his body as the stem pointed round to the west the two men looked into each others eyes  sire there are rules  not where i am concerned said graham you seem to forget  the aeronaut scrutinised his face no he said i do not forget sire but in all the earthno man who is not a sworn aeronauthas ever a chance they come as passengers  i have heard something of the sort but im not going to argue these points do you know why i have slept two hundred years to fly  sire said the aeronaut the rulesif i break the rules  graham waved the penalties aside  then if you will watch me  no said graham swaying and gripping tight as the machine lifted its nose again for an ascent thats not my game i want to do it myself do it myself if i smash for it no i will see i am going to clamber by this to come and share your seat steady i mean to fly of my own accord if i smash at the end of it i will have something to pay for my sleep of all other things in my past it was my dream to fly nowkeep your balance  a dozen spies are watching me sire  grahams temper was at end perhaps he chose it should be he swore he swung himself round the intervening mass of levers and the aeropile swayed  am i master of the earth he said or is your society now take your hands off those levers and hold my wrists yesso and now how do we turn her nose down to the glide  sire said the aeronaut  what is it  you will protect me  lord yes if i have to burn london now  and with that promise graham bought his first lesson in aerial navigation its clearly to your advantage this journey he said with a loud laughfor the air was like strong wineto teach me quickly and well do i pull this ah so hullo  back sire back  backright onetwothreegood god ah up she goes but this is living  and now the machine began to dance the strangest figures in the air now it would sweep round a spiral of scarcely a hundred yards diameter now it would rush up into the air and swoop down again steeply swiftly falling like a hawk to recover in a rushing loop that swept it high again in one of these descents it seemed driving straight at the drifting park of balloons in the southeast and only curved about and cleared them by a sudden recovery of dexterity the extraordinary swiftness and smoothness of the motion the extraordinary effect of the rarefied air upon his constitution threw graham into a careless fury  but at last a queer incident came to sober him to send him flying down once more to the crowded life below with all its dark insoluble riddles as he swooped came a tap and something flying past and a drop like a drop of rain then as he went on down he saw something like a white rag whirling down in his wake what was that he asked i did not see  the aeronaut glanced and then clutched at the lever to recover for they were sweeping down when the aeropile was rising again he drew a deep breath and replied that and he indicated the white thing still fluttering down was a swan  i never saw it said graham  the aeronaut made no answer and graham saw little drops upon his forehead  they drove horizontally while graham clambered back to the passengers place out of the lash of the wind and then came a swift rush down with the windscrew whirling to check their fall and the flying stage growing broad and dark before them the sun sinking over the chalk hills in the west fell with them and left the sky a blaze of gold  soon men could be seen as little specks he heard a noise coming up to meet him a noise like the sound of waves upon a pebbly beach and saw that the roofs about the flying stage were dark with his people rejoicing over his safe return a dark mass was crushed together under the stage a darkness stippled with innumerable faces and quivering with the minute oscillation of waved white handkerchiefs and waving hands    chapter xvii three days  lincoln awaited graham in an apartment beneath the flying stages he seemed curious to learn all that had happened pleased to hear of the extraordinary delight and interest which graham took in flying graham was in a mood of enthusiasm i must learn to fly he cried i must master that i pity all poor souls who have died without this opportunity the sweet swift air it is the most wonderful experience in the world  you will find our new times full of wonderful experiences said lincoln i do not know what you will care to do now we have music that may seem novel  for the present said graham flying holds me let me learn more of that your aeronaut was saying there is some trades union objection to ones learning  there is i believe said lincoln but for you if you would like to occupy yourself with that we can make you a sworn aeronaut tomorrow  graham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his sensations for a while and as for affairs he asked abruptly how are things going on  lincoln waved affairs aside ostrog will tell you that tomorrow he said everything is settling down the revolution accomplishes itself all over the world friction is inevitable here and there of course but your rule is assured you may rest secure with things in ostrogs hands  would it be possible for me to be made a sworn aeronaut as you call it forthwithbefore i sleep said graham pacing then i could be at it the very first thing tomorrow again  it would be possible said lincoln thoughtfully quite possible indeed it shall be done he laughed i came prepared to suggest amusements but you have found one for yourself i will telephone to the aeronautical offices from here and we will return to your apartments in the windvane control by the time you have dined the aeronauts will be able to come you dont think that after you have dined you might prefer he paused  yes said graham  we had prepared a show of dancersthey have been brought from the capri theatre  i hate ballets said graham shortly always did that other thats not what i want to see we had dancers in the old days for the matter of that they had them in ancient egypt but flying  true said lincoln though our dancers  they can afford to wait said graham they can afford to wait i know im not a latin theres questions i want to ask some expertabout your machinery im keen i want no distractions  you have the world to choose from said lincoln whatever you want is yours  asano appeared and under the escort of a strong guard they returned through the city streets to grahams apartments far larger crowds had assembled to witness his return than his departure had gathered and the shouts and cheering of these masses of people sometimes drowned lincolns answers to the endless questions grahams aerial journey had suggested at first graham had acknowledged the cheering and cries of the crowd by bows and gestures but lincoln warned him that such a recognition would be considered incorrect behaviour graham already a little wearied by rhythmic civilities ignored his subjects for the remainder of his public progress  directly they arrived at his apartments asano departed in search of kinematographic renderings of machinery in motion and lincoln despatched grahams commands for models of machines and small machines to illustrate the various mechanical advances of the last two centuries the little group of appliances for telegraphic communication attracted the master so strongly that his delightfully prepared dinner served by a number of charmingly dexterous girls waited for a space the habit of smoking had almost ceased from the face of the earth but when he expressed a wish for that indulgence inquiries were made and some excellent cigars were discovered in florida and sent to him by pneumatic dispatch while the dinner was still in progress afterwards came the aeronauts and a feast of ingenious wonders in the hands of a latterday engineer for the time at any rate the neat dexterity of counting and numbering machines building machines spinning engines patent doorways explosive motors grain and water elevators slaughterhouse machines and harvesting appliances was more fascinating to graham than any bayadere we were savages was his refrain we were savages we were in the stone agecompared with this and what else have you  there came also practical psychologists with some very interesting developments in the art of hypnotism the names of milne bramwell fechner liebault william james myers and gurney he found bore a value now that would have astonished their contemporaries several practical applications of psychology were now in general use it had largely superseded drugs antiseptics and anaesthetics in medicine was employed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration a real enlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in this direction the feats of calculating boys the wonders as graham had been wont to regard them of mesmerisers were now within the range of anyone who could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist long ago the old examination methods in education had been destroyed by these expedients instead of years of study candidates had substituted a few weeks of trances and during the trances expert coaches had simply to repeat all the points necessary for adequate answering adding a suggestion of the post hypnotic recollection of these points in process mathematics particularly this aid had been of singular service and it was now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manual dexterity as were still to be found in fact all operations conducted under finite rules of a quasimechanical sort that is were now systematically relieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion and brought to an unexampled pitch of accuracy little children of the labouring classes so soon as they were of sufficient age to be hypnotised were thus converted into beautifully punctual and trustworthy machine minders and released forthwith from the long long thoughts of youth aeronautical pupils who gave way to giddiness could be relieved from their imaginary terrors in every street were hypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind if anyone desired to remember a name a series of numbers a song or a speech it could be done by this method and conversely memories could be effaced habits removed and desires eradicateda sort of psychic surgery was in fact in general use indignities humbling experiences were thus forgotten amorous widows would obliterate their previous husbands angry lovers release themselves from their slavery to graft desires however was still impossible and the facts of thought transference were yet unsystematised the psychologists illustrated their expositions with some astounding experiments in mnemonics made through the agency of a troupe of palefaced children in blue  graham like most of the people of his former time distrusted the hypnotist or he might then and there have eased his mind of many painful preoccupations but in spite of lincolns assurances he held to the old theory that to be hypnotised was in some way the surrender of his personality the abdication of his will at the banquet of wonderful experiences that was beginning he wanted very keenly to remain absolutely himself  the next day and another day and yet another day passed in such interests as these each day graham spent many hours in the glorious entertainment of flying on the third day he soared across middle france and within sight of the snowclad alps these vigorous exercises gave him restful sleep and each day saw a great stride in his health from the spiritless anaemia of his first awakening and whenever he was not in the air and awake lincoln was assiduous in the cause of his amusement all that was novel and curious in contemporary invention was brought to him until at last his appetite for novelty was wellnigh glutted one might fill a dozen inconsecutive volumes with the strange things they exhibited each afternoon he held his court for an hour or so he speedily found his interest in his contemporaries becoming personal and intimate at first he had been alert chiefly for unfamiliarity and peculiarity any foppishness in their dress any discordance with his preconceptions of nobility in their status and manners had jarred upon him and it was remarkable to him how soon that strangeness and the faint hostility that arose from it disappeared how soon he came to appreciate the true perspective of his position and see the old victorian days remote and quaint he found himself particularly amused by the redhaired daughter of the manager of the european piggeries on the second day after dinner he made the acquaintance of a latterday dancing girl and found her an astonishing artist and after that more hypnotic wonders on the third day lincoln was moved to suggest that the master should repair to a pleasure city but this graham declined nor would he accept the services of the hypnotists in his aeronautical experiments the link of locality held him to london he found a perpetual wonder in topographical identifications that he would have missed abroad hereor a hundred feet below here he could say i used to eat my midday cutlets during my london university days underneath here was waterloo and the perpetual hunt for confusing trains often have i stood waiting down there bag in hand and stared up into the sky above the forest of signals little thinking i should walk some day a hundred yards in the air and now in that very sky that was once a grey smoke canopy i circle in an aeropile  during those three days graham was so occupied with such distractions that the vast political movements in progress outside his quarters had but a small share of his attention those about him told him little daily came ostrog the boss his grand vizier his mayor of the palace to report in vague terms the steady establishment of his rule a little trouble soon to be settled in this city a slight disturbance in that the song of the social revolt came to him no more he never learned that it had been forbidden in the municipal limits and all the great emotions of the crows nest slumbered in his mind  but on the second and third of the three days he found himself in spite of his interest in the daughter of the pig manager or it may be by reason of the thoughts her conversation suggested remembering the girl helen wotton who had spoken to him so oddly at the windvane keepers gathering the impression she had made was a deep one albeit the incessant surprise of novel circumstances had kept him from brooding upon it for a space but now her memory was coming to its own he wondered what she had meant by those broken halfforgotten sentences the picture of her eyes and the earnest passion of her face became more vivid as his mechanical interests faded her beauty came compellingly between him and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion but he did not see her again until three full days were past    chapter xviii graham remembers  she came upon him at last in a little gallery that ran from the wind vane offices toward his state apartments the gallery was long and narrow with a series of recesses each with an arched fenestration that looked upon a court of palms he came upon her suddenly in one of these recesses she was seated she turned her head at the sound of his footsteps and started at the sight of him every touch of colour vanished from her face she rose instantly made a step toward him as if to address him and hesitated he stopped and stood still expectant then he perceived that a nervous tumult silenced her perceived too that she must have sought speech with him to be waiting for him in this place  he felt a regal impulse to assist her i have wanted to see you he said a few days ago you wanted to tell me somethingyou wanted to tell me of the people what was it you had to tell me  she looked at him with troubled eyes  you said the people were unhappy  for a moment she was silent still  it must have seemed strange to you she said abruptly  it did and yet  it was an impulse  well  that is all  she looked at him with a face of hesitation she spoke with an effort you forget she said drawing a deep breath  what  the people  do you mean  you forget the people  he looked interrogative  yes i know you are surprised for you do not understand what you are you do not know the things that are happening  well  you do not understand  not clearly perhaps buttell me  she turned to him with sudden resolution it is so hard to explain i have meant to i have wanted to and nowi cannot i am not ready with words but about youthere is something it is wonder your sleepyour awakening these things are miracles to me at leastand to all the common people you who lived and suffered and died you who were a common citizen wake again live again to find yourself master almost of the earth  master of the earth he said so they tell me but try and imagine how little i know of it  citiestruststhe labour company  principalities powers dominionsthe power and the glory yes i have heard them shout i know i am master king if you wish with ostrog the boss  he paused  she turned upon him and surveyed his face with a curious scrutiny well  he smiled to take the responsibility  that is what we have begun to fear for a moment she said no more no she said slowly you will take the responsibility you will take the responsibility the people look to you  she spoke softly listen for at least half the years of your sleepin every generationmultitudes of people in every generation greater multitudes of people have prayed that you might awakeprayed  graham moved to speak and did not  she hesitated and a faint colour crept back to her cheek do you know that you have been to myriadsking arthur barbarossathe king who would come in his own good time and put the world right for them  i suppose the imagination of the people  have you not heard our proverb when the sleeper wakes while you lay insensible and motionless therethousands came thousands every first of the month you lay in state with a white robe upon you and the people filed by you when i was a little girl i saw you like that with your face white and calm  she turned her face from him and looked steadfastly at the painted wall before her her voice fell when i was a little girl i used to look at your faceit seemed to me fixed and waiting like the patience of god  that is what we thought of you she said that is how you seemed to us  she turned shining eyes to him her voice was clear and strong in the city in the earth a myriad myriad men and women are waiting to see what you will do full of strange incredible expectations  yes  ostrogno onecan take that responsibility  graham looked at her in surprise at her face lit with emotion she seemed at first to have spoken with an effort and to have fired herself by speaking  do you think she said that you who have lived that little life so far away in the past you who have fallen into and risen out of this miracle of sleepdo you think that the wonder and reverence and hope of half the world has gathered about you only that you may live another little life that you may shift the responsibility to any other man  i know how great this kingship of mine is he said haltingly i know how great it seems but is it real it is incredibledreamlike is it real or is it only a great delusion  it is real she said if you dare  after all like all kingship my kingship is belief it is an illusion in the minds of men  if you dare she said  but    countless men she said and while it is in their mindsthey will obey  but i know nothing that is what i had in mind i know nothing and these othersthe councillors ostrog they are wiser cooler they know so much every detail and indeed what are these miseries of which you speak what am i to know do you mean  he stopped blankly  i am still hardly more than a girl she said but to me the world seems full of wretchedness the world has altered since your day altered very strangely i have prayed that i might see you and tell you these things the world has changed as if a canker had seized itand robbed life ofeverything worth having  she turned a flushed face upon him moving suddenly your days were the days of freedom yesi have thought i have been made to think for my lifehas not been happy men are no longer freeno greater no better than the men of your time that is not all this cityis a prison every city now is a prison mammon grips the key in his hand myriads countless myriads toil from the cradle to the grave is that right is that to befor ever yes far worse than in your time all about us beneath us sorrow and pain all the shallow delight of such life as you find about you is separated by just a little from a life of wretchedness beyond any telling yes the poor know itthey know they suffer these countless multitudes who faced death for you two nights since you owe your life to them  yes said graham slowly yes i owe my life to them  you come she said from the days when this new tyranny of the cities was scarcely beginning it is a tyrannya tyranny in your days the feudal war lords had gone and the new lordship of wealth had still to come half the men in the world still lived out upon the free countryside the cities had still to devour them i have heard the stories out of the old booksthere was nobility common men led lives of love and faithfulness thenthey did a thousand things and youyou come from that time  it was not but never mind how is it now  gain and the pleasure cities or slaveryunthanked unhonoured slavery  slavery he said  slavery  you dont mean to say that human beings are chattels  worse that is what i want you to know what i want you to see i know you do not know they will keep things from you they will take you presently to a pleasure city but you have noticed men and women and children in pale blue canvas with thin yellow faces and dull eyes  everywhere  speaking a horrible dialect coarse and weak  i have heard it  they are the slavesyour slaves they are the slaves of the labour company you own  the labour company in some waythat is familiar ah now i remember i saw it when i was wandering about the city after the lights returned great fronts of buildings coloured pale blue do you really mean  yes how can i explain it to you of course the blue uniform struck you nearly a third of our people wear itmore assume it now every day this labour company has grown imperceptibly  what is this labour company asked graham  in the old times how did you manage with starving people  there was the workhousewhich the parishes maintained  workhouse yesthere was something in our history lessons i remember now the labour company ousted the workhouse it grewpartlyout of somethingyou perhaps may remember itan emotional religious organisation called the salvation armythat became a business company in the first place it was almost a charity to save people from workhouse rigours now i come to think of it it was one of the earliest properties your trustees acquired they bought the salvation army and reconstructed it as this the idea in the first place was to give work to starving homeless people  yes  nowadays there are no workhouses no refuges and charities nothing but that company its offices are everywhere that blue is its colour and any man woman or child who comes to be hungry and weary and with neither home nor friend nor resort must go to the company in the endor seek some way of death the euthanasy is beyond their meansfor the poor there is no easy death and at any hour in the day or night there is food shelter and a blue uniform for all comersthat is the first condition of the companys incorporationand in return for a days shelter the company extracts a days work and then returns the visitors proper clothing and sends him or her out again  yes  perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you in your days men starved in your streets that was bad but they diedmen these people in blue the proverb runs blue canvas once and ever the company trades in their labour and it has taken care to assure itself of the supply people come to it starving and helplessthey eat and sleep for a night and day theywork for a day and at the end of the day they go out again if they have worked well they have a penny or soenough for a theatre or a cheap dancing place or a kinematograph story or a dinner or a bet they wander about after that is spent begging is prevented by the police of the ways besides no one gives they come back again the next day or the day afterbrought back by the same incapacity that brought them first at last their proper clothing wears out or their rags get so shabby that they are ashamed then they must work for months to get fresh if they want fresh a great number of children are born under the companys care the mother owes them a month thereafterthe children they cherish and educate until they are fourteen and they pay two years service you may be sure these children are educated for the blue canvas and so it is the company works  and none are destitute in the city  none they are either in blue canvas or in prison  if they will not work  most people will work at that pitch and the company has powers there are stages of unpleasantness in the workstoppage of foodand a man or woman who has refused to work once is known by a thumbmarking system in the companys offices all over the world besides who can leave the city poor to go to paris costs two lions and for insubordination there are the prisonsdark and miserableout of sight below there are prisons now for many things  and a third of the people wear this blue canvas  more than a third toilers living without pride or delight or hope with the stories of pleasure cities ringing in their ears mocking their shameful lives their privations and hardships too poor even for the euthanasy the rich mans refuge from life dumb crippled millions countless millions all the world about ignorant of anything but limitations and unsatisfied desires they are born they are thwarted and they die that is the state to which we have come  for a space graham sat downcast  but there has been a revolution he said all these things will be changed ostrog  that is our hope that is the hope of the world but ostrog will not do it he is a politician to him it seems things must be like this he does not mind he takes it for granted all the rich all the influential all who are happy come at last to take these miseries for granted they use the people in their politics they live in ease by their degradation but youyou who come from a happier ageit is to you the people look to you  he looked at her face her eyes were bright with unshed tears he felt a rush of emotion for a moment he forgot this city he forgot the race and all those vague remote voices in the immediate humanity of her beauty  but what am i to do he said with his eyes upon her  rule she answered bending towards him and speaking in a low tone rule the world as it has never been ruled for the good and happiness of men for you might rule ityou could rule it  the people are stirring all over the world the people are stirring it wants but a wordbut a word from youto bring them all together even the middle sort of people are restless unhappy  they are not telling you the things that are happening the people will not go back to their drudgerythey refuse to be disarmed ostrog has awakened something greater than he dreamt ofhe has awakened hopes  his heart was beating fast he tried to seem judicial to weigh considerations  they only want their leader she said  and then  you could do what you wouldthe world is yours  he sat no longer regarding her presently he spoke the old dreams and the thing i have dreamt liberty happiness are they dreams could one manone man his voice sank and ceased  not one man but all mengive them only a leader to speak the desire of their hearts  he shook his head and for a time there was silence  he looked up suddenly and their eyes met i have not your faith he said i have not your youth i am here with power that mocks me nolet me speak i want to donot righti have not the strength for thatbut something rather right than wrong it will bring no millennium but i am resolved now that i will rule what you have said has awakened me you are right ostrog must know his place and i will learn one thing i promise you this labour slavery shall end  and you will rule  yes provided there is one thing  yes  that you will help me  ia girl  yes does it not occur to you i am absolutely alone  she started and for an instant her eyes had pity need you ask whether i will help you she said  she stood before him beautiful worshipful and her enthusiasm and the greatness of their theme was like a great gulf fixed between them to touch her to clasp her hand was a thing beyond hope then i will rule indeed he said slowly i will rule he paused with you  there came a tense silence and then the beating a clock striking the hour she made him no answer graham rose  even now he said ostrog will be waiting he hesitated facing her when i have asked him certain questions there is much i do not know it may be that i will go to see with my own eyes the things of which you have spoken and when i return  i shall know of your going and coming i will wait for you here again  he stood for a moment regarding her  i knew she said and stopped  he waited but she said no more they regarded one another steadfastly questioningly and then he turned from her towards the wind vane office    chapter xix ostrogs point of view  graham found ostrog waiting to give a formal account of his days stewardship on previous occasions he had passed over this ceremony as speedily as possible in order to resume his aerial experiences but now he began to ask quick short questions he was very anxious to take up his empire forthwith ostrog brought flattering reports of the development of affairs abroad in paris and berlin graham perceived that he was saying there had been trouble not organised resistance indeed but insubordinate proceedings after all these years said ostrog when graham pressed enquiries the commune has lifted its head again that is the real nature of the struggle to be explicit but order had been restored in these cities graham the more deliberately judicial for the stirring emotions he felt asked if there had been any fighting a little said ostrog in one quarter only but the senegalese division of our african agricultural policethe consolidated african companies have a very well drilled policewas ready and so were the aeroplanes we expected a little trouble in the continental cities and in america but things are very quiet in america they are satisfied with the overthrow of the council for the time   why should you expect trouble asked graham abruptly  there is a lot of discontentsocial discontent  the labour company  you are learning said ostrog with a touch of surprise yes it is chiefly the discontent with the labour company it was that discontent supplied the motive force of this overthrowthat and your awakening  yes  ostrog smiled he became explicit we had to stir up their discontent we had to revive the old ideals of universal happinessall men equalall men happyno luxury that everyone may not shareideas that have slumbered for two hundred years you know that we had to revive these ideals impossible as they arein order to overthrow the council and now  well  our revolution is accomplished and the council is overthrown and people whom we have stirred up remain surging there was scarcely enough fighting we made promises of course it is extraordinary how violently and rapidly this vague outofdate humanitarianism has revived and spread we who sowed the seed even have been astonished in paris as i saywe have had to call in a little external help  and here  there is trouble multitudes will not go back to work there is a general strike half the factories are empty and the people are swarming in the ways they are talking of a commune men in silk and satin have been insulted in the streets the blue canvas is expecting all sorts of things from you of course there is no need for you to trouble we are setting the babble machines to work with counter suggestions in the cause of law and order we must keep the grip tight that is all  graham thought he perceived a way of asserting himself but he spoke with restraint  even to the pitch of bringing a negro police he said  they are useful said ostrog they are fine loyal brutes with no wash of ideas in their headssuch as our rabble has the council should have had them as police of the ways and things might have been different of course there is nothing to fear except rioting and wreckage you can manage your own wings now and you can soar away to capri if there is any smoke or fuss we have the pull of all the great things the aeronauts are privileged and rich the closest trades union in the world and so are the engineers of the wind vanes we have the air and the mastery of the air is the mastery of the earth no one of any ability is organising against us they have no leadersonly the sectional leaders of the secret society we organised before your very opportune awakening mere busy bodies and sentimentalists they are and bitterly jealous of each other none of them is man enough for a central figure the only trouble will be a disorganised upheaval to be frankthat may happen but it wont interrupt your aeronautics the days when the people could make revolutions are past  i suppose they are said graham i suppose they are he mused this world of yours has been full of surprises to me in the old days we dreamt of a wonderful democratic life of a time when all men would be equal and happy  ostrog looked at him steadfastly the day of democracy is past he said past for ever that day began with the bowmen of crecy it ended when marching infantry when common men in masses ceased to win the battles of the world when costly cannon great ironclads and strategic railways became the means of power today is the day of wealth wealth now is power as it never was power beforeit commands earth and sea and sky all power is for those who can handle wealth you must accept facts and these are facts the world for the crowd the crowd as ruler even in your days that creed had been tried and condemned today it has only one believera multiplex silly onethe mall in the crowd  graham did not answer immediately he stood lost in sombre preoccupations  no said ostrog the day of the common man is past on the open countryside one man is as good as another or nearly as good the earlier aristocracy had a precarious tenure of strength and audacity they were temperedtempered there were insurrections duels riots the first real aristocracy the first permanent aristocracy came in with castles and armour and vanished before the musket and bow but this is the second aristocracy the real one those days of gunpowder and democracy were only an eddy in the stream the common man now is a helpless unit in these days we have this great machine of the city and an organisation complex beyond his understanding  yet said graham there is something resists something you are holding downsomething that stirs and presses  you will see said ostrog with a forced smile that would brush these difficult questions aside i have not roused the force to destroy myselftrust me  i wonder said graham  ostrog stared  must the world go this way said graham with his emotions at the speaking point must it indeed go in this way have all our hopes been vain  what do you mean said ostrog hopes  i came from a democratic age and i find an aristocratic tyranny  wellbut you are the chief tyrant  graham shook his head  well said ostrog take the general question it is the way that change has always travelled aristocracy the prevalence of the bestthe suffering and extinction of the unfit and so to better things  but aristocracy those people i met  oh not those said ostrog but for the most part they go to their death vice and pleasure they have no children that sort of stuff will die out if the world keeps to one road that is if there is no turning back an easy road to excess convenient euthanasia for the pleasure seekers singed in the flame that is the way to improve the race  pleasant extinction said graham yet he thought for an instant there is that other thingthe crowd the great mass of poor men will that die out that will not die out and it suffers its suffering is a force that even you  ostrog moved impatiently and when he spoke he spoke rather less evenly than before  dont you trouble about these things he said everything will be settled in a few days now the crowd is a huge foolish beast what if it does not die out even if it does not die it can still be tamed and driven i have no sympathy with servile men you heard those people shouting and singing two nights ago they were taught that song if you had taken any man there in cold blood and asked why he shouted he could not have told you they think they are shouting for you that they are loyal and devoted to you just then they were ready to slaughter the council todaythey are already murmuring against those who have overthrown the council  no no said graham they shouted because their lives were dreary without joy or pride and because in mein methey hoped  and what was their hope what is their hope what right have they to hope they work ill and they want the reward of those who work well the hope of mankindwhat is it that some day the overman may come that some day the inferior the weak and the bestial may be subdued or eliminated subdued if not eliminated the world is no place for the bad the stupid the enervated their dutyits a fine duty toois to die the death of the failure that is the path by which the beast rose to manhood by which man goes on to higher things  ostrog took a pace seemed to think and turned on graham i can imagine how this great world state of ours seems to a victorian englishman you regret all the old forms of representative governmenttheir spectres still haunt the world the voting councils and parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery you feel moved against our pleasure cities i might have thought of thathad i not been busy but you will learn better the people are mad with envythey would be in sympathy with you even in the streets now they clamour to destroy the pleasure cities but the pleasure cities are the excretory organs of the state attractive places that year after year draw together all that is weak and vicious all that is lascivious and lazy all the easy roguery of the world to a graceful destruction they go there they have their time they die childless all the pretty silly lascivious women die childless and mankind is the better if the people were sane they would not envy the rich their way of death and you would emancipate the silly brainless workers that we have enslaved and try to make their lives easy and pleasant again just as they have sunk to what they are fit for he smiled a smile that irritated graham oddly you will learn better i know those ideas in my boyhood i read your shelley and dreamt of liberty there is no liberty save wisdom and self control liberty is withinnot without it is each mans own affair supposewhich is impossiblethat these swarming yelping fools in blue get the upper hand of us what then they will only fall to other masters so long as there are sheep nature will insist on beasts of prey it would mean but a few hundred years delay the coming of the aristocrat is fatal and assured the end will be the overmanfor all the mad protests of humanity let them revolt let them win and kill me and my like others will ariseother masters the end will be the same  i wonder said graham doggedly  for a moment he stood downcast  but i must see these things for myself he said suddenly assuming a tone of confident mastery only by seeing can i understand i must learn that is what i want to tell you ostrog i do not want to be king in a pleasure city that is not my pleasure i have spent enough time with aeronauticsand those other things i must learn how people live now how the common life has developed then i shall understand these things better i must learn how common people livethe labour people more especiallyhow they work marry bear children die  you get that from our realistic novelists suggested ostrog suddenly preoccupied  i want reality said graham not realism  there are difficulties said ostrog and thought  on the whole perhaps  i did not expect  i had thought and yet perhaps you say you want to go through the ways of the city and see the common people  suddenly he came to some conclusion you would need to go disguised he said the city is intensely excited and the discovery of your presence among them might create a fearful tumult still this wish of yours to go into this citythis idea of yours yes now i think the thing over it seems to me not altogether it can be contrived if you would really find an interest in that you are of course master you can go soon if you like a disguise for this excursion asano will be able to manage he would go with you after all it is not a bad idea of yours  you will not want to consult me in any matter asked graham suddenly struck by an odd suspicion  oh dear no no i think you may trust affairs to me for a time at any rate said ostrog smiling even if we differ  graham glanced at him sharply  there is no fighting likely to happen soon he asked abruptly  certainly not  i have been thinking about these negroes i dont believe the people intend any hostility to me and after all i am the master i do not want any negroes brought to london it is an archaic prejudice perhaps but i have peculiar feelings about europeans and the subject races even about paris  ostrog stood watching him from under his drooping brows i am not bringing negroes to london he said slowly but if  you are not to bring armed negroes to london whatever happens said graham in that matter i am quite decided  ostrog after a pause decided not to speak and bowed deferentially    chapter xx in the city ways  and that night unknown and unsuspected graham dressed in the costume of an inferior windvane official keeping holiday and accompanied by asano in labour company canvas surveyed the city through which he had wandered when it was veiled in darkness but now he saw it lit and waking a whirlpool of life in spite of the surging and swaying of the forces of revolution in spite of the unusual discontent the mutterings of the greater struggle of which the first revolt was but the prelude the myriad streams of commerce still flowed wide and strong he knew now something of the dimensions and quality of the new age but he was not prepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed view for the torrent of colour and vivid impressions that poured past him  this was his first real contact with the people of these latter days he realised that all that had gone before saving his glimpses of the public theatres and markets had had its element of seclusion had been a movement within the comparatively narrow political quarter that all his previous experiences had revolved immediately about the question of his own position but here was the city at the busiest hours of night the people to a large extent returned to their own immediate interests the resumption of the real informal life he common habits of the new time  they emerged at first into a street whose opposite ways were crowded with the blue canvas liveries this swarm graham saw was a portion of a processionit was odd to see a procession parading the city seated they carried banners of coarse red stuff with red letters no disarmament said the banners for the most part in crudely daubed letters and with variant spelling and why should we disarm no disarming no disarming banner after banner went by a stream of banners flowing past and at last at the end the song of the revolt and a noisy band of strange instruments they all ought to be at work said asano they have had no food these two days or they have stolen it  presently asano made a detour to avoid the congested crowd that gaped upon the occasional passage of dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary the gleanings after deaths harvest of the first revolt  that night few people were sleeping everyone was abroad a vast excitement perpetual crowds perpetually changing surrounded graham his mind was confused and darkened by an incessant tumult by the cries and enigmatical fragments of the social struggle that was as yet only beginning everywhere festoons and banners of black and strange decorations intensified the quality of his popularity everywhere he caught snatches of that crude thick dialect that served the illiterate class the class that is beyond the reach of phonograph culture in their commonplace intercourse everywhere this trouble of disarmament was in the air with a quality of immediate stress of which he had no inkling during his seclusion in the windvane quarter he perceived that as soon as he returned he must discuss this with ostrog this and the greater issues of which it was the expression in a far more conclusive way than he had so far done perpetually that night even in the earlier hours of their wanderings about the city the spirit of unrest and revolt swamped his attention to the exclusion of countless strange things he might otherwise have observed  this preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary yet amidst so much that was strange and vivid no subject however personal and insistent could exert undivided sway there were spaces when the revolutionary movement passed clean out of his mind was drawn aside like a curtain from before some startling new aspect of the time helen had swayed his mind to this intense earnestness of enquiry but there came times when she even receded beyond his conscious thoughts at one moment for example he found they were traversing the religious quarter for the easy transit about the city afforded by the moving ways rendered sporadic churches and chapels no longer necessaryand his attention was vividly arrested by the facade of one of the christian sects  they were travelling seated on one of the swift upper ways the place leapt upon them at a bend and advanced rapidly towards them it was covered with inscriptions from top to base in vivid white and blue save where a vast and glaring kinematograph transparency presented a realistic new testament scene and where a vast festoon of black to show that the popular religion followed the popular politics hung across the lettering graham had already become familiar with the phonotype writing and these inscriptions arrested him being to his sense for the most part almost incredible blasphemy among the less offensive were salvation on the first floor and turn to the right put your money on your maker the sharpest conversion in london expert operators look slippy what christ would say to the sleeperjoin the uptodate saints be a christianwithout hindrance to your present occupation all the brightest bishops on the bench tonight and prices as usual brisk blessings for busy business men  but this is appalling said graham as that deafening scream of mercantile piety towered above them  what is appalling asked his little officer apparently seeking vainly for anything unusual in this shrieking enamel  this surely the essence of religion is reverence  oh that asano looked at graham does it shock you he said in the tone of one who makes a discovery i suppose it would of course i had forgotten nowadays the competition for attention is so keen and people simply havent the leisure to attend to their souls you know as they used to do he smiled in the old days you had quiet sabbaths and the countryside though somewhere ive read of sunday afternoons that  but that said graham glancing back at the receding blue and white that is surely not the only  there are hundreds of different ways but of course if a sect doesnt tell it doesnt pay worship has moved with the times there are high class sects with quieter wayscostly incense and personal attentions and all that these people are extremely popular and prosperous they pay several dozen lions for those apartments to the councilto you i should say  graham still felt a difficulty with the coinage and this mention of a dozen lions brought him abruptly to that matter in a moment the screaming temples and their swarming touts were forgotten in this new interest a turn of a phrase suggested and an answer confirmed the idea that gold and silver were both demonetised that stamped gold which had begun its reign amidst the merchants of phoenicia was at last dethroned the change had been graduated but swift brought about by an extension of the system of cheques that had even in his previous life already practically superseded gold in all the larger business transactions the common traffic of the city the common currency indeed of all the world was conducted by means of the little brown green and pink council cheques for small amounts printed with a blank payee asano had several with him and at the first opportunity he supplied the gaps in his set they were printed not on tearable paper but on a semitransparent fabric of silken flexibility interwoven with silk across them all sprawled a facsimile of grahams signature his first encounter with the curves and turns of that familiar autograph for two hundred and three years  some intermediary experiences made no impression sufficiently vivid to prevent the matter of the disarmament claiming his thoughts again a blurred picture of a theosophist temple that promised miracles in enormous letters of unsteady fire was least submerged perhaps but then came the view of the dining hall in northumberland avenue that interested him very greatly  by the energy and thought of asano he was able to view this place from a little screened gallery reserved for the attendants of the tables the building was pervaded by a distant muffled hooting piping and bawling of which he did not at first understand the import but which recalled a certain mysterious leathery voice he had heard after the resumption of the lights on the night of his solitary wandering  he had grown accustomed now to vastness and great numbers of people nevertheless this spectacle held him for a long time it was as he watched the table service more immediately beneath and interspersed with many questions and answers concerning details that the realisation of the full significance of the feast of several thousand people came to him   it was his constant surprise to find that points that one might have expected to strike vividly at the very outset never occurred to him until some trivial detail suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the obvious thing he had overlooked in this matter for instance it had not occurred to him that this continuity of the city this exclusion of weather these vast halls and ways involved the disappearance of the household that the typical victorian home the little brick cell containing kitchen and scullery living rooms and bedrooms had save for the ruins that diversified the countryside vanished as surely as the wattle hut but now he saw what had indeed been manifest from the first that london regarded as a living place was no longer an aggregation of houses but a prodigious hotel an hotel with a thousand classes of accommodation thousands of dining halls chapels theatres markets and places of assembly a synthesis of enterprises of which he chiefly was the owner people had their sleeping rooms with it might be antechambers rooms that were always sanitary at least whatever the degree of comfort and privacy and for the rest they lived much as many people had lived in the newmade giant hotels of the victorian days eating reading thinking playing conversing all in places of public resort going to their work in the industrial quarters of the city or doing business in their offices in the trading section  he perceived at once how necessarily this state of affairs had developed from the victorian city the fundamental reason for the modern city had ever been the economy of cooperation the chief thing to prevent the merging of the separate households in his own generation was simply the still imperfect civilisation of the people the strong barbaric pride passions and prejudices the jealousies rivalries and violence of the middle and lower classes which had necessitated the entire separation of contiguous households but the change the taming of the people had been in rapid progress even then in his brief thirty years of previous life he had seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming meals from home the casually patronised horsebox coffeehouse had given place to the open and crowded aerated bread shop for instance womens clubs had had their beginning and an immense development of reading rooms lounges and libraries had witnessed to the growth of social confidence these promises had by this time attained to their complete fulfillment the locked and barred household had passed away  these people below him belonged he learnt to the lower middle class the class just above the blue labourers a class so accustomed in the victorian period to feed with every precaution of privacy that its members when occasion confronted them with a public meal would usually hide their embarrassment under horseplay or a markedly militant demeanour but these gaily if lightly dressed people below albeit vivacious hurried and uncommunicative were dexterously mannered and certainly quite at their ease with regard to one another  he noted a slight significant thing the table as far as he could see was and remained delightfully neat there was nothing to parallel the confusion the broadcast crumbs the splashes of viand and condiment the overturned drink and displaced ornaments which would have marked the stormy progress of the victorian meal the table furniture was very different there were no ornaments no flowers and the table was without a cloth being made he learnt of a solid substance having the texture and appearance of damask he discerned that this damask substance was patterned with gracefully designed trade advertisements  in a sort of recess before each diner was a complete apparatus of porcelain and metal there was one plate of white porcelain and by means of taps for hot and cold volatile fluids the diner washed this himself between the courses he also washed his elegant white metal knife and fork and spoon as occasion required  soup and the chemical wine that was the common drink were delivered by similar taps and the remaining covers travelled automatically in tastefully arranged dishes down the table along silver rails the diner stopped these and helped himself at his discretion they appeared at a little door at one end of the table and vanished at the other that turn of democratic sentiment in decay that ugly pride of menial souls which renders equals loth to wait on one another was very strong he found among these people he was so preoccupied with these details that it was only just as he was leaving the place that he remarked the huge advertisement dioramas that marched majestically along the upper walls and proclaimed the most remarkable commodities  beyond this place they came into a crowded hall and he discovered the cause of the noise that had perplexed him they paused at a turnstile at which a payment was made  grahams attention was immediately arrested by a violent loud hoot followed by a vast leathery voice the master is sleeping peacefully it said vociferately he is in excellent health he is going to devote the rest of his life to aeronautics he says women are more beautiful than ever galloop wow our wonderful civilisation astonishes him beyond measure beyond all measure galloop he puts great trust in boss ostrog absolute confidence in boss ostrog ostrog is to be his chief minister is authorised to remove or reinstate public officersall patronage will be in his hands all patronage in the hands of boss ostrog the councillors have been sent back to their own prison above the council house  graham stopped at the first sentence and looking up beheld a foolish trumpet face from which this was brayed this was the general intelligence machine for a space it seemed to be gathering breath and a regular throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible then it trumpeted galloop galloop and broke out again  paris is now pacified all resistance is over galloop the black police hold every position of importance in the city they fought with great bravery singing songs written in praise of their ancestors by the poet kipling once or twice they got out of hand and tortured and mutilated wounded and captured insurgents men and women moraldont go rebelling haha galloop galloop they are lively fellows lively brave fellows let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog of this city yah banderlog filth of the earth galloop galloop  the voice ceased there was a confused murmur of disapproval among the crowd damned niggers a man began to harangue near them is this the masters doing brothers is this the masters doing  black police said graham what is that you dont mean  asano touched his arm and gave him a warning look and forthwith another of these mechanisms i screamed deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill voice yahaha yahah yap hear a live paper yelp live paper yaha shocking outrage in paris yahahah the parisians exasperated by the black police to the pitch of assassination dreadful reprisals savage times come again blood blood yaha the nearer babble machine hooted stupendously galloop galloop drowned the end of the sentence and proceeded in a rather flatter note than before with novel comments on the horrors of disorder law and order must be maintained said the nearer babble machine  but began graham  dont ask questions here said asano or you will be involved in an argument  then let us go on said graham for i want to know more of this  as he and his companion pushed their way through the excited crowd that swarmed beneath these voices towards the exit graham conceived more clearly the proportion and features of this room altogether great and small there must have been nearly a thousand of these erections piping hooting bawling and gabbling in that great space each with its crowd of excited listeners the majority of them men dressed in blue canvas there were all sizes of machines from the little gossipping mechanisms that chuckled out mechanical sarcasm in odd corners through a number of grades to such fiftyfoot giants as that which had first hooted over graham  this place was unusually crowded because of the intense public interest in the course of affairs in paris evidently the struggle had been much more savage than ostrog had represented it all the mechanisms were discoursing upon that topic and the repetition of the people made the huge hive buzz with such phrases as lynched policemen women burnt alive fuzzy wuzzy but does the master allow such things asked a man near him is this the beginning of the masters rule  is this the beginning of the masters rule for a long time after he had left the place the hooting whistling and braying of the machines pursued him galloop galloop yahahah yaha yap yaha is this the beginning of the masters rule  directly they were out upon the ways he began to question asano closely on the nature of the parisian struggle this disarmament what was their trouble what does it all mean asano seemed chiefly anxious to reassure him that it was all right but these outrages you cannot have an omelette said asano without breaking eggs it is only the rough people only in one part of the city all the rest is all right the parisian labourers are the wildest in the world except ours  what the londoners  no the japanese they have to be kept in order but burning women alive  a commune said asano they would rob you of your property they would do away with property and give the world over to mob rule you are master the world is yours but there will be no commune here there is no need for black police here  and every consideration has been shown it is their own negroesfrench speaking negroes senegal regiments and niger and timbuctoo  regiments said graham i thought there was only one  no said asano and glanced at him there is more than one  graham felt unpleasantly helpless  i did not think he began and stopped abruptly he went off at a tangent to ask for information about these babble machines for the most part the crowd present had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed and graham learnt that so far as the more prosperous classes were concerned in all the more comfortable private apartments of the city were fixed babble machines that would speak directly a lever was pulled the tenant of the apartment could connect this with the cables of any of the great news syndicates that he preferred when he learnt this presently he demanded the reason of their absence from his own suite of apartments asano stared i never thought he said ostrog must have had them removed  graham stared how was i to know he exclaimed  perhaps he thought they would annoy you said asano  they must be replaced directly i return said graham after an interval  he found a difficulty in understanding that this news room and the dining hall were not great central places that such establishments were repeated almost beyond counting all over the city but ever and again during the nights expedition his ears in some new quarter would pick out from the tumult of the ways the peculiar hooting of the organ of boss ostrog galloop galloop or the shrill yahaha yaha yaphear a live paper yelp of its chief rival  repeated too everywhere were such creches as the one he now entered it was reached by a lift and by a glass bridge that flung across the dining hall and traversed the ways at a slight upward angle to enter the first section of the place necessitated the use of his solvent signature under asanos direction they were immediately attended to by a man in a violet robe and gold clasp the insignia of practising medical men he perceived from this mans manner that his identity was known and proceeded to ask questions on the strange arrangements of the place without reserve  on either side of the passage which was silent and padded as if to deaden the footfall were narrow little doors their size and arrangement suggestive of the cells of a victorian prison but the upper portion of each door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that had enclosed him at his awakening and within dimly seen lay in every case a very young baby in a little nest of wadding elaborate apparatus watched the atmosphere and rang a bell far away in the central office at the slightest departure from the optimum of temperature and moisture a system of such creches had almost entirely replaced the hazardous adventures of the oldworld nursing the attendant presently called grahams attention to the wet nurses a vista of mechanical figures with arms shoulders and breasts of astonishingly realistic modelling articulation and texture but mere brass tripods below and having in the place of features a flat disc bearing advertisements likely to be of interest to mothers  of all the strange things that graham came upon that night none jarred more upon his habits of thought than this place the spectacle of the little pink creatures their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague first movements left alone without embrace or endearment was wholly repugnant to him the attendant doctor was of a different opinion his statistical evidence showed beyond dispute that in the victorian times the most dangerous passage of life was the arms of the mother that there human mortality had ever been most terrible on the other hand this creche company the international creche syndicate lost not onehalf per cent of the million babies or so that formed its peculiar care but grahams prejudice was too strong even for those figures  along one of the many passages of the place they presently came upon a young couple in the usual blue canvas peering through the transparency and laughing hysterically at the bald head of their firstborn grahams face must have showed his estimate of them for their merriment ceased and they looked abashed but this little incident accentuated his sudden realisation of the gulf between his habits of thought and the ways of the new age he passed on to the crawling rooms and the kindergarten perplexed and distressed he found the endless long playrooms were empty the latterday children at least still spent their nights in sleep as they went through these the little officer pointed out the nature of the toys developments of those devised by that inspired sentimentalist froebel there were nurses here but much was done by machines that sang and danced and dandled  graham was still not clear upon many points but so many orphans he said perplexed reverting to a first misconception and learnt again that they were not orphans  so soon as they had left the creche he began to speak of the horror the babies in their incubating cases had caused him is motherhood gone he said was it a cant surely it was an instinct this seems so unnaturalabominable almost  along here we shall come to the dancing place said asano by way of reply it is sure to be crowded in spite of all the political unrest it will be crowded the women take no great interest in politicsexcept a few here and there you will see the mothersmost young women in london are mothers in that class it is considered a creditable thing to have one childa proof of animation few middle class people have more than one with the labour company it is different as for motherhood they still take an immense pride in the children they come here to look at them quite often  then do you mean that the population of the world  is falling yes except among the people under the labour company they are reckless  the air was suddenly dancing with music and down a way they approached obliquely set with gorgeous pillars as it seemed of clear amethyst flowed a concourse of gay people and a tumult of merry cries and laughter he saw curled heads wreathed brows and a happy intricate flutter of gamboge pass triumphant across the picture  you will see said asano with a faint smile the world has changed in a moment you will see the mothers of the new age come this way we shall see those yonder again very soon  they ascended a certain height in a swift lift and changed to a slower one as they went on the music grew upon them until it was near and full and splendid and moving with its glorious intricacies they could distinguish the beat of innumerable dancing feet they made a payment at a turnstile and emerged upon the wide gallery that overlooked the dancing place and upon the full enchantment of sound and sight  here said asano are the fathers and mothers of the little ones you saw  the hall was not so richly decorated as that of the atlas but saving that it was for its size the most splendid graham had seen the beautiful white limbed figures that supported the galleries reminded him once more of the restored magnificence of sculpture they seemed to writhe in engaging attitudes their faces laughed the source of the music that filled the place was hidden and the whole vast shining floor was thick with dancing couples look at them said the little officer see how much they show of motherhood  the gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge of a huge screen that cut the dancing hall on one side from a sort of outer hall that showed through broad arches the incessant onward rush of the city ways in this outer hall was a great crowd of less brilliantly dressed people as numerous almost as those who danced within the great majority wearing the blue uniform of the labour company that was now so familiar to graham too poor to pass the turnstiles to the festival they were yet unable to keep away from the sound of its seductions some of them even had cleared spaces and were dancing also fluttering their rags in the air some shouted as they danced jests and odd allusions graham did not understand once someone began whistling the refrain of the revolutionary song but it seemed as though that beginning was promptly suppressed the corner was dark and graham could not see he turned to the hall again above the caryatidae were marble busts of men whom that age esteemed great moral emancipators and pioneers for the most part their names were strange to graham though he recognised grant allen le gallienne nietzsche shelley and goodwin great black festoons and eloquent sentiments reinforced the huge inscription that partially defaced the upper end of the dancing place and asserted that the festival of the awakening was in progress  myriads are taking holiday or staying from work because of that quite apart from the labourers who refuse to go back said asano these people are always ready for holidays  graham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over looking down at the dancers save for two or three remote whispering couples who had stolen apart he and his guide had the gallery to themselves a warm breath of scent and vitality came up to him both men and women below were lightly clad barearmed opennecked as the universal warmth of the city permitted the hair of the men was often a mass of effeminate curls their chins were always shaven and many of them had flushed or coloured cheeks many of the women were very pretty and all were dressed with elaborate coquetry as they swept by beneath he saw ecstatic faces with eyes half closed in pleasure  what sort of people are these he asked abruptly  workersprosperous workers what you would have called the middle class independent tradesmen with little separate businesses have vanished long ago but there are store servers managers engineers of a hundred sorts tonight is a holiday of course and every dancing place in the city will be crowded and every place of worship  butthe women  the same theres a thousand forms of work for women now but you had the beginning of the independent workingwoman in your days most women are independent now most of these are married more or lessthere are a number of methods of contractand that gives them more money and enables them to enjoy themselves  i see said graham looking at the flushed faces the flash and swirl of movement and still thinking of that nightmare of pink helpless limbs and these aremothers  most of them  the more i see of these things the more complex i find your problems this for instance is a surprise that news from paris was a surprise  in a little while he spoke again  these are mothers presently i suppose i shall get into the modern way of seeing things i have old habits of mind clinging about mehabits based i suppose on needs that are over and done with of course in our time a woman was supposed not only to bear children but to cherish them to devote herself to them to educate themall the essentials of moral and mental education a child owed its mother or went without quite a number i admit went without nowadays clearly there is no more need for such care than if they were butterflies i see that only there was an idealthat figure of a grave patient woman silently and serenely mistress of a home mother and maker of mento love her was a sort of worship  he stopped and repeated a sort of worship  ideals change said the little man as needs change  graham awoke from an instant reverie and asano repeated his words grahams mind returned to the thing at hand  of course i see the perfect reasonableness of this restraint soberness the matured thought the unselfish a act they are necessities of the barbarous state the life of dangers dourness is mans tribute to unconquered nature but man has conquered nature now for all practical purposeshis political affairs are managed by bosses with a black policeand life is joyous  he looked at the dancers again joyous he said  there are weary moments said the little officer reflectively  they all look young down there i should be visibly the oldest man and in my own time i should have passed as middleaged  they are young there are few old people in this class in the work cities  how is that  old peoples lives are not so pleasant as they used to be unless they are rich to hire lovers and helpers and we have an institution called euthanasy  ah that euthanasy said graham the easy death  the easy death it is the last pleasure the euthanasy company does it well people will pay the sumit is a costly thinglong beforehand go off to some pleasure city and return impoverished and weary very weary  there is a lot left for me to understand said graham after a pause yet i see the logic of it all our array of angry virtues and sour restraints was the consequence of danger and insecurity the stoic the puritan even in my time were vanishing types in the old days man was armed against pain now he is eager for pleasure there lies the difference civilisation has driven pain and danger so far offfor welltodo people and only welltodo people matter now i have been asleep two hundred years  for a minute they leant on the balustrading following the intricate evolution of the dance indeed the scene was very beautiful  before god said graham suddenly i would rather be a wounded sentinel freezing in the snow than one of these painted fools  in the snow said asano one might think differently  i am uncivilised said graham not heeding him that is the trouble i am primitivepalaeolithic their fountain of rage and fear and anger is sealed and closed the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and easy and delightful you must bear with my nineteenth century shocks and disgusts these people you say are skilled workers and so forth and while these dance men are fightingmen are dying in paris to keep the worldthat they may dance  asano smiled faintly for that matter men are dying in london he said  there was a moments silence  where do these sleep asked graham  above and belowan intricate warren  and where do they work this isthe domestic life  you will see little work tonight half the workers are out or under arms half these people are keeping holiday but we will go to the work places if you wish it  for a time graham watched the dancers then suddenly turned away i want to see the workers i have seen enough of these he said  asano led the way along the gallery across the dancing hall presently they came to a transverse passage that brought a breath of fresher colder air  asano glanced at this passage as they went past stopped went back to it and turned to graham with a smile here sire he said is somethingwill be familiar to you at leastand yet but i will not tell you come  he led the way along a closed passage that presently became cold the reverberation of their feet told that this passage was a bridge they came into a circular gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather and so reached a circular chamber which seemed familiar though graham could not recall distinctly when he had entered it before in this was a ladderthe first ladder he had seen since his awakeningup which they went and came into a high dark cold place in which was another almost vertical ladder this they ascended graham still perplexed  but at the top he understood and recognized the metallic bars to which he clung he was in the cage under the ball of st pauls the dome rose but a little way above the general contour of the city into the still twilight and sloped away shining greasily under a few distant lights into a circumambient ditch of darkness  out between the bars he looked upon the windclear northern sky and saw the starry constellations all unchanged capella hung in the west vega was rising and the seven glittering points of the great bear swept overhead in their stately circle about the pole  he saw these stars in a clear gap of sky to the east and south the great circular shapes of complaining windwheels blotted out the heavens so that the glare about the council house was hidden to the southwest hung orion showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery of ironwork and interlacing shapes above a dazzling coruscation of lights a bellowing and siren screaming that came from the flying stages warned the world that one of the aeroplanes was ready to start he remained for a space gazing towards the glaring stage then his eyes went back to the northward constellations  for a long time he was silent this he said at last smiling in the shadow seems the strangest thing of all to stand in the dome of saint pauls and look once more upon these familiar silent stars  thence graham was taken by asano along devious ways to the great gambling and business quarters where the bulk of the fortunes in the city were lost and made it impressed him as a wellnigh interminable series of very high halls surrounded by tiers upon tiers of galleries into which opened thousands of offices and traversed by a complicated multitude of bridges footways aerial motor rails and trapeze and cable leaps and here more than anywhere the note of vehement vitality of uncontrollable hasty activity rose high everywhere was violent advertisement until his brain swam at the tumult of light and colour and babble machines of a peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filled the air with strenuous squealing and an idiotic slang skin your eyes and slide gewhoop bonanza gollipers come and hark  the place seemed to him to be dense with people either profoundly agitated or swelling with obscure cunning yet he learnt that the place was comparatively empty that the great political convulsion of the last few days had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum in one huge place were long avenues of roulette tables each with an excited undignified crowd about it in another a yelping babel of whitefaced women and rednecked leatherylunged men bought and sold the shares of an absolutely fictitious business undertaking which every five minutes paid a dividend of ten per cent and cancelled a certain proportion of its shares by means of a lottery wheel  these business activities were prosecuted with an energy that readily passed into violence and graham approaching a dense crowd found at its centre a couple of prominent merchants in violent controversy with teeth and nails on some delicate point of business etiquette something still remained in life to be fought for further he had a shock at a vehement announcement in phonetic letters of scarlet flame each twice the height of a man that we assure the propraietr we assure the propraietr  whos the proprietor he asked  you    but what do they assure me he asked what do they assure me  didnt you have assurance  graham thought insurance  yesinsurance i remember that was the older word they are insuring your life dozands of people are taking out policies myriads of lions are being put on you and further on other people are buying annuities they do that on everybody who is at all prominent look there  a crowd of people surged and roared and graham saw a vast black screen suddenly illuminated in still larger letters of burning purple anuetes on the propraietrx 5 pr g the people began to boo and shout at this a number of hard breathing wildeyed men came running past clawing with hooked fingers at the air there was a furious crush about a little doorway  asano did a brief calculation seventeen per cent per annum is their annuity on you they would not pay so much per cent if they could see you now sire but they do not know your own annuities used to be a very safe investment but now you are sheer gambling of course this is probably a desperate bid i doubt if people will get their money  the crowd of wouldbe annuitants grew so thick about them that for some time they could move neither forward no backward graham noticed what appeared to him to be a high proportion of women among the speculators and was reminded again of the economical independence of their sex they seemed remarkably well able to take care of themselves in the crowd using their elbows with particular skill as he learnt to his cost one curlyheaded person caught in the pressure for a space looked steadfastly at him several times almost as if she recognized him and then edging deliberately towards him touched his hand with her arm in a scarcely accidental manner and made it plain by a look as ancient as chaldea that he had found favour in her eyes and then a lank greybearded man perspiring copiously in a noble passion of selfhelp blind to all earthly things save that glaring bait thrust between them in a cataclysmal rush towards that alluring x 5 pr g  i want to get out of this said graham to asano this is not what i came to see show me the workers i want to see the people in blue these parasitic lunatics  he found himself wedged in a struggling mass c people and this hopeful sentence went unfinished    chapter xxi the under side  from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done on their way the platforms crossed the thames twice and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blueclad men the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which bigwheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labour company was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks the largeness and the lightness of the big pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out the picture  presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuitmaking place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers among the incandescent lakes of crude eadhamite the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child  many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation but wherever there was work it was being done by slowmoving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the workplaces and the orangeclad labour police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latterday workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen who were directing their labours the burly labourers of the victorian times had followed the dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine the latterday labourer male as well as female was essentially a machineminder and feeder a servant and attendant or an artist under direction  the women in comparison with those graham remembered were as a class distinctly plain and flatchested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendours and delights and at last to the euthanasy and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of grahams former life the newly aggregated labouring mass had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality now it was differentiating into a distinct class with a moral and physical difference of its owneven with a dialect of its own  they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways  beyond the blazing lakes of eadhamite he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow had the oddest effect  the work was beautifully executed but without any strength of modelling or drawing for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night they were stripped and examined before they left the premises of the company in spite of every precaution the labour policeman told them in a depressed tone the company was not infrequently robbed  beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby and next these were men and women busied together upon the slabs of copper net that formed the basis of cloisonne tiles many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologised to graham for the offence of their faces but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement that suddenly stared him in the face  she might have done better with herself than that said asano  graham made some indignant comments  but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years  they continued along one of the lower galleries of this cloisonne factory and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of whitewashed wall every now and then one would stop to cough  a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to grahams mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky the men worked in silence under the supervision of two of the labour police their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing  stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed and first one and then all the whitestained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing  and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things but why should the gentle reader be depressed surely to a refined nature our present world is distressing enough without bothering ourselves about these miseries to come we shall not suffer anyhow our children may but what is that to us that walk left on grahams mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery the roar and rattle of belt and armature of illlit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pinpoint lights and here the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery and here unprecedented reeks and everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation  once and again and again a third time graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again when he saw a number of blueclad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labour police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms  they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices and suddenly came men running and along the platforms and about the ways everywhere was a shouting and crying then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran  what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police  asanos face was white and astonished he hesitated looked at grahams face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano  graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms toward him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrogs doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse and a thin foam dropped from his ugly shouting mouth he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave  for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed  suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent his heart began to beat fast and strong  it has come he said i might have known the hour has come  he thought swiftly what am i to do  go back to the council house said asano  why should i not appeal the people are here  you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them  suppose this is only a rumour  it sounds true said asano  let us have the facts said graham  asano shrugged his shoulders we had better get towards the council house he cried that is where they will swarm even now the ruins may be impassable  graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him  they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano accosted a labourer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech  what did he say asked graham  he knows little but he told me that the black police would have arrived here before the people knewhad not someone in the windvane offices learnt he said a girl  a girl not  he said a girlhe did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins  and then another thing was shouted something that turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street to your wards to your wards every man get arms every man to his ward    chapter xxii the struggle in the council house  as asano and graham hurried along to the ruins about the council house they saw everywhere the excitement of the people rising to your wards to your wards everywhere men and women in blue were hurrying from unknown subterranean employments up the staircases of the middle pathat one place graham saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee besieged by a crowd of shouting men at another a couple of men in the hated yellow uniform of the labour police pursued by a gathering crowd fled precipitately along the swift way that went in the opposite direction  the cries of to your wards became at last a continuous shouting as they drew near the government quarter many of the shouts were unintelligible ostrog has betrayed us one man bawled in a hoarse voice again and again dinning that refrain into grahams ear until it haunted him this person stayed close beside graham and asano on the swift way shouting to the people who swarmed on the lower platforms as he rushed past them his cry about ostrog alternated with some incomprehensible orders presently he went leaping down and disappeared  grahams mind was filled with the din his plans were vague and unformed he had one picture of some commanding position from which he could address the multitudes another of meeting ostrog face to face he was full of rage of tense muscular excitement his hands gripped his lips were pressed together  the way to the council house across the ruins was impassable but asano met that difficulty and took graham into the premises of the central postoffice the postoffice was nominally at work but the blueclothed porters moved sluggishly or had stopped to stare through the arches of their galleries at the shouting men who were going by outside every man to his ward every man to his ward here by asanos advice graham revealed his identity  they crossed to the council house by a cable cradle already in the brief interval since the capitulation of the councillors a great change had been wrought in the appearance of the ruins the spurting cascades of the ruptured sea watermains had been captured and tamed and huge temporary pipes ran overhead along a flimsy looking fabric of girders the sky was laced with restored cables and wires that served the council house and a mass of new fabric with cranes and other building machines going to and fro upon it projected to the left of the white pile  the moving ways that ran across this area had been restored albeit for once running under the open sky these were the ways that graham had seen from the little balcony in the hour of his awakening not nine days since and the hall of his trance had been on the further side where now shapeless piles of smashed and shattered masonry were heaped together  it was already high day and the sun was shining brightly out of their tall caverns of blue electric light came the swift ways crowded with multitudes of people who poured off them and gathered ever denser over the wreckage and confusion of the ruins the air was full of their shouting and they were pressing and swaying towards the central building for the most part that shouting mass consisted of shapeless swarms but here and there graham could see that a rude discipline struggled to establish itself and every voice clamoured for order in the chaos to your wards every man to his ward  the cable carried them into a hall which graham recognised as the antechamber to the hall of the atlas about the gallery of which he had walked days ago with howard to show himself to the vanished council an hour from his awakening now the place was empty except for two cable attendants these men seemed hugely astonished to recognise the sleeper in the man who swung down from the cross seat  where is helen wotton he demanded where is helen wotton  they did not know  then where is ostrog i must see ostrog forthwith he has disobeyed me i have come back to take things out of his hands without waiting for asano he went straight across the place ascended the steps at the further end and pulling the curtain aside found himself facing the perpetually labouring titan  the hall was empty its appearance had changed very greatly since his first sight of it it had suffered serious injury in the violent struggle of the first outbreak on the right hand side of the great figure the upper half of the wall had been torn away for nearly two hundred feet of its length and a sheet of the same glassy film that had enclosed graham at his awakening had been drawn across the gap this deadened but did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside wards wards wards they seemed to be saying through it there were visible the beams and supports of metal scaffoldings that rose and fell according to the requirements of a great crowd of workmen an idle building machine with lank arms of red painted metal that caught the still plastic blocks of mineral paste and swung them neatly into position stretched gauntly across this green tinted picture on it were still a number of workmen staring at the crowd below for a moment he stood regarding these things and asano overtook him  ostrog said asano will be in the small offices beyond there the little man looked livid now and his eyes searched grahams face  they had scarcely advanced ten paces from the curtain before a little panel to the left of the atlas rolled up and ostrog accompanied by lincoln and followed by two black and yellow clad negroes appeared crossing the remote corner of the hall towards a second panel that was raised and open ostrog shouted graham and at the sound of his voice the little party turned astonished  ostrog said something to lincoln and advanced alone  graham was the first to speak his voice was loud and dictatorial what is this i hear he asked are you bringing negroes hereto keep the people down  it is none too soon said ostrog they have been getting out of hand more and more since the revolt i underestimated  do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the way  on the way as it is you have seen the peopleoutside  no wonder butafter what was said you have taken too much on yourself ostrog  ostrog said nothing but drew nearer  these negroes must not come to london said graham i am master and they shall not come  ostrog glanced at lincoln who at once came towards them with his two attendants close behind him why not asked ostrog  white men must be mastered by white men besides  the negroes are only an instrument  but that is not the question i am the master i mean to be the master and i tell you these negroes shall not come  the people  i believe in the people  because you are an anachronism you are a man out of the pastan accident you are owner perhaps of half the property in the world but you are not master you do not know enough to be master  he glanced at lincoln again i know now what you thinki can guess something of what you mean to do even now it is not too late to warn you you dream of human equalityof a socialistic orderyou have all those wornout dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and vivid in your mind and you would rule this age that you do not understand  listen said graham you can hear ita sound like the sea not voicesbut a voice do you altogether understand  we taught them that said ostrog  perhaps can you teach them to forget it but enough of this these negroes must not come  there was a pause and ostrog looked him in the eyes  they will he said  i forbid it said graham  they have started  i will not have it  no said ostrog sorry as i am to follow the method of the council for your own goodyou must not side with disorder and now that you are here it was kind of you to come here  lincoln laid his hand on grahams shoulder abruptly graham realized the enormity of his blunder in coming to the council house he turned towards the curtains that separated the hall from the antechamber the clutching hand of asano intervened in another moment lincoln had grasped grahams cloak  he turned and struck at lincolns face and incontinently a negro had him by collar and arm he wrenched himself away his sleeve tore noisily and he stumbled back to be tripped by the other attendant then he struck the ground heavily and he was staring at the distant ceiling of the hall  he shouted rolled over struggling fiercely clutched an attendants leg and threw him headlong and struggled to his feet  lincoln appeared before him went down heavily again with a blow under the point of the jaw and lay still graham made two strides stumbled and then ostrogs arm was round his neck he was pulled over backward fell heavily and his arms were pinned to the ground after a few violent efforts he ceased to struggle and lay staring at ostrogs heaving throat  youarea prisoner panted ostrog exulting youwere rather a foolto come back  graham turned his head about and perceived through the irregular green window in the walls of the hall the men who had been working the building cranes gesticulating excitedly to the people below them they had seen  ostrog followed his eyes and started he shouted something to lincoln but lincoln did not move a bullet smashed among the mouldings above the atlas the two sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched across this gap were rent the edges of the torn aperture darkened curved ran rapidly towards the framework and in a moment the council chamber stood open to the air a chilly gust blew in by the gap bringing with it a war of voices from the ruinous spaces without an elvish babblement save the master what are they doing to the master the master is betrayed  and then he realised that ostrogs attention was distracted that ostrogs grip had relaxed and wrenching his arms free he struggled to his knees in another moment he had thrust ostrog back and he was on one foot his hand gripping ostrogs throat and ostrogs hands clutching the silk about his neck but now men were coming towards them from the daismen whose intentions he misunderstood he had a glimpse of someone running in the distance towards the curtains of the antechamber and then ostrog had slipped from him and these newcomers were upon him to his infinite astonishment they seized him they obeyed the shouts of ostrog  he was lugged a dozen yards before he realised that they were not friendsthat they were dragging him towards the open panel when he saw this he pulled back he tried to fling himself down he shouted for help with all his strength and this time there were answering cries  the grip upon his neck relaxed and behold in the lower corner of the rent upon the wall first one and then a number of little black figures appeared shouting and waving arms they came leaping down from the gap into the light gallery that had led to the silent rooms they ran along it so near were they that graham could see the weapons in their hands then ostrog was shouting in his ear to the men who held him and once more he was struggling with all his strength against their endeavours to thrust him towards the opening that yawned to receive him they cant come down panted ostrog they darent fire its all right well save him from them yet  for long minutes as it seemed to graham that inglorious struggle continued his clothes were rent in a dozen places he was covered in dust one hand had been trodden upon he could hear the shouts of his supporters and once he heard shots he could feel his strength giving way feel his efforts wild and aimless but no help came and surely irresistibly that black yawning opening came nearer  the pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up he saw ostrogs grey head receding and perceived that he was no longer held he turned about and came full into a man in black one of the green weapons cracked close to him a drift of pungent smoke came into his face and a steel blade flashed the huge chamber span about him  he saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black and yellow attendants not three yards from his face then hands were upon him again  he was being pulled in two directions now it seemed as though people were shouting to him he wanted to understand and could not someone was clutching about his thighs he was being hoisted in spite of his vigorous efforts he understood suddenly he ceased to struggle he was lifted up on mens shoulders and carried away from that devouring panel ten thousand throats were cheering  he saw men in blue and black hurrying after the retreating ostrogites and firing lifted up he saw now across the whole expanse of the hall beneath the atlas image saw that he was being carried towards the raised platform in the centre of the place the far end of the hall was already full of people running towards him they were looking at him and cheering  he became aware that a sort of bodyguard surrounded him active men about him shouted vague orders he saw close at hand the black moustached man in yellow who had been among those who had greeted him in the public theatre shouting directions the hall was already densely packed with swaying people the little metal gallery sagged with a shouting load the curtains at the end had been torn away and the antechamber was revealed densely crowded he could scarcely make the man near him hear for the tumult about them where has ostrog gone he asked  the man he questioned pointed over the heads towards the lower panels about the hall on the side opposite the gap they stood open and armed men blue clad with black sashes were running through them and vanishing into the chambers and passages beyond it seemed to graham that a sound of firing drifted through the riot he was carried in a staggering curve across the great hall towards an opening beneath the gap  he perceived men working with a sort of rude discipline to keep the crowd off him to make a space clear about him he passed out of the hall and saw a crude new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue sky he was swung down to his feet someone gripped his arm and guided him he found the man in yellow close at hand they were taking him up a narrow stairway of brick and close at hand rose the great red painted masses the cranes and levers and the still engines of the big building machine  he was at the top of the steps he was hurried across a narrow railed footway and suddenly with a vast shouting the amphitheatre of ruins opened again before him the master is with us the master the master the shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave broke against the distant cliff of ruins and came back in a welter of cries the master is on our side  graham perceived that he was no longer encompassed by people that he was standing upon a little temporary platform of white metal part of a flimsy seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of the council house over all the huge expanse of the ruins swayed and eddied the shouting people and here and there the black banners of the revolutionary societies ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of organisation in the chaos up the steep stairs of wall and scaffolding by which his rescuers had reached the opening in the atlas chamber clung a solid crowd and little energetic black figures clinging to pillars and projections were strenuous to induce these congested masses to stir behind him at a higher point on the scaffolding a number of men struggled upwards with the flapping folds of a huge black standard through the yawning gap in the walls below him he could look down upon the packed attentive multitudes in the hall of the atlas the distant flying stages to the south came out bright and vivid brought nearer as it seemed by an unusual translucency of the air a solitary aeropile beat up from the central stage as if to meet the coming aeroplanes  what had become of ostrog asked graham and even as he spoke he saw that all eyes were turned from him towards the crest of the council house building he looked also in this direction of universal attention for a moment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of a wall hard and clear against the sky then in the shadow he perceived the interior of a room and recognised with a start the green and white decorations of his former prison and coming quickly across this opened room and up to the very verge of the cliff of the ruins came a little white clad figure followed by two other smaller seeming figures in black and yellow he heard the man beside him exclaim ostrog and turned to ask a question but he never did because of the startled exclamation of another of those who were with him and a lank finger suddenly pointing he looked and behold the aeropile that had been rising from the flying stage when last he had looked in that direction was driving towards them the swift steady flight was still novel enough to hold his attention  nearer it came growing rapidly larger and larger until it had swept over the further edge of the ruins and into view of the dense multitudes below it drooped across the space and rose and passed overhead rising to clear the mass of the council house a filmy translucent shape with the solitary aeronaut peering down through its ribs it vanished beyond the skyline of the ruins  graham transferred his attention to ostrog he was signalling with his hands and his attendants busy breaking down the wall beside him in another moment the aeropile came into view again a little thing far away coming round in a wide curve and going slower  then suddenly the man in yellow shouted what are they doing what are the people doing why is ostrog left there why is he not captured they will lift himthe aeropile will lift him ah  the exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins the rattling sound of the green weapons drifted across the intervening gulf to graham and looking down he saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running along one of the galleries that lay open to the air below the promontory upon which ostrog stood they fired as they ran at men unseen and then emerged a number of pale blue figures in pursuit these minute fighting figures had the oddest effect they seemed as they ran like little model soldiers in a toy this queer appearance of a house cut open gave that struggle amidst furniture and passages a quality of unreality it was perhaps two hundred yards away from him and very nearly fifty above the heads in the ruins below the black and yellow men ran into an open archway and turned and fired a volley one of the blue pursuers striding forward close to the edge flung up his arms staggered sideways seemed to grahams sense to hang over the edge for several seconds and fell headlong down graham saw him strike a projecting corner fly out head over heels head over heels and vanish behind the red arm of the building machine  and then a shadow came between graham and the sun he looked up and the sky was clear but he knew the aeropile had passed ostrog had vanished the man in yellow thrust before him zealous and perspiring pointing and blatent  they are grounding cried the man in yellow they are grounding tell the people to fire at him tell them to fire at him  graham could not understand he heard loud voices repeating these enigmatical orders  suddenly over the edge of the ruins he saw the prow of the aeropile come gliding and stop with a jerk in a moment graham understood that the thing had grounded in order that ostrog might escape by it he saw a blue haze climbing out of the gulf perceived that the people below him were now firing up at the projecting stem  a man beside him cheered hoarsely and he saw that the blue rebels had gained the archway that had been contested by the men in black and yellow a moment before and were running in a continual stream along the open passage  and suddenly the aeropile slipped over the edge of the council house and fell it dropped tilting at an angle of fortyfive degrees and dropping so steeply that it seemed to graham it seemed perhaps to most of these below that it could not possibly rise again  it fell so closely past him that he could see ostrog clutching the guides of the seat with his grey hair streaming see the whitefaced aeronaut wrenching over the lever that drove the engine along its guides he heard the apprehensive vague cry of innumerable men below  graham clutched the railing before him and gasped the second seemed an age the lower fan of the aeropile passed within an ace of touching the people who yelled and screamed and trampled one another below  and then it rose  for a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear the opposite cliff and then that it could not possibly clear the windwheel that rotated beyond  and behold it was clear and soaring still heeling sideways upward upward into the windswept sky  the suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of exasperation as the swarming people realised that ostrog had escaped them with belated activity they renewed their fire until the rattling wove into a roar until the whole area became dim and blue and the air pungent with the thin smoke of their weapons  too late the aeropile dwindled smaller and smaller and curved about and swept gracefully downward to the flying stage from which it had so lately risen ostrog had escaped  for a while a confused babblement arose from the ruins and then the universal attention came back to graham perched high among the scaffolding he saw the faces of the people turned towards him heard their shouts at his rescue from the throat of the ways came the song of the revolt spreading like a breeze across that swaying sea of men  the little group of men about him shouted congratulations on his escape the man in yellow was close to him with a set face and shining eyes and the song was rising louder and louder tramp tramp tramp tramp  slowly the realisation came of the full meaning of these things to him the perception of the swift change in his position ostrog who had stood beside him whenever he had faced that shouting multitude before was beyond therethe antagonist there was no one to rule for him any longer even the people about him the leaders and organisers of the multitude looked to see what he would do looked to him to act awaited his orders he was king indeed his puppet reign was at an end  he was very intent to do the thing that was expected of him his nerves and muscles were quivering his mind was perhaps a little confused but he felt neither fear nor anger his hand that had been trodden upon throbbed and was hot he was a little nervous about his bearing he knew he was not afraid but he was anxious not to seem afraid in his former life he had often been more excited in playing games of skill he was desirous of immediate action he knew he must not think too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggle about him lest he should be paralysed by the sense of its intricacy over there those square blue shapes the flying stages meant ostrog against ostrog he was fighting for the world    chapter xxiii while the aeroplanes were coming  for a time the master of the earth was not even master of his own mind even his will seemed a will not his own his own acts surprised him and were but a part of the confusion of strange experiences that poured across his being these things were definite the aeroplanes were coming helen wotton had warned the people of their coming and he was master of the earth each of these facts seemed struggling for complete possession of his thoughts they protruded from a background of swarming halls elevated passages rooms jammed with ward leaders in council kinematograph and telephone rooms and windows looking out on a seething sea of marching men the man in yellow and men whom he fancied were called ward leaders were either propelling him forward or following him obediently it was hard to tell perhaps they were doing a little of both perhaps some power unseen and unsuspected propelled them all he was aware that he was going to make a proclamation to the people of the earth aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind as the thing he meant to say many little things happened and then he found himself with the man in yellow entering a little room where this proclamation of his was to be made  this room was grotesquely latterday in its appointments in the centre was a bright oval lit by shaded electric lights from above the rest was in shadow and the double finely fitting doors through which he came from the swarming hall of the atlas made the place very still the dead thud of these as they closed behind him the sudden cessation of the tumult in which he had been living for hours the quivering circle of light the whispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely visible attendants in the shadows had a strange effect upon graham the huge ears of a phonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words the black eyes of great photographic cameras awaited his beginning beyond metal rods and coils glittered dimly and something whirled about with a droning hum he walked into the centre of the light and his shadow drew together black and sharp to a little blot at his feet  the vague shape of the thing he meant to say was already in his mind but this silence this isolation the sudden withdrawal from that contagious crowd this silent audience of gaping glaring machines had not been in his anticipation all his supports seemed withdrawn together he seemed to have dropped into this suddenly suddenly to have discovered himself in a moment he was changed he found that he now feared to be inadequate he feared to be theatrical he feared the quality of his voice the quality of his wit astonished he turned to the man in yellow with a propitiatory gesture for a moment he said i must wait i did not think it would be like this i must think of the thing i have to say  while he was still hesitating there came an agitated messenger with news that the foremost aeroplanes were passing over arawan  arawan he said where is that but anyhow they are coming they will be here when  by twilight  great god in only a few hours what news of the flying stages he asked  the people of the southwest wards are ready  ready  he turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses again  i suppose it must be a sort of speech would to god i knew certainly the thing that should be said aeroplanes at arawan they must have started before the main fleet and the people only ready surely  oh what does it matter whether i speak well or ill he said and felt the light grow brighter  he had framed some vague sentence of democratic sentiment when suddenly doubts overwhelmed him his belief in his heroic quality and calling he found had altogether lost its assured conviction the picture of a little strutting futility in a windy waste of incomprehensible destinies replaced it abruptly it was perfectly clear to him that this revolt against ostrog was premature foredoomed to failure the impulse of passionate inadequacy against inevitable things he thought of that swift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop of fate towards him he was astonished that he could have seen things in any other light in that final emergency he debated thrust debate resolutely aside determined at all costs to go through with the thing he had undertaken and he could find no word to begin even as he stood awkward hesitating with an indiscrete apology for his inability trembling on his lips came the noise of many people crying out the running to and fro of feet wait cried someone and a door opened she is coming said the voices graham turned and the watching lights waned  through the open doorway he saw a slight grey figure advancing across a spacious hall his heart leapt it was helen wotton behind and about her marched a riot of applause the man in yellow came out of the nearer shadows into the circle of light  this is the girl who told us what ostrog had dune he said  her face was aflame and the heavy coils of her black hair fell about her shoulders the folds of the soft silk robe she wore streamed from her and floated in the rhythm of her advance she drew nearer and nearer and his heart was beating fast all his doubts were gone the shadow of the doorway fell athwart her face and she was near him you have not betrayed us she cried you are with us  where have you been said graham  at the office of the southwest wards until ten minutes since i did not know you had returned i went to the office of the southwest wards to find the ward leaders in order that they might tell the people  i came back so soon as i heard  i knew she cried knew you would be with us and it was iit was i that told them they have risen all the world is rising the people have awakened thank god that i did not act in vain you are master still  you told them he said slowly and he saw that in spite of her steady eyes her lips trembled and her throat rose and fell  i told them i knew of the order i was here i heard that the negroes were to come to london to guard you and to keep the people downto keep you a prisoner and i stopped it i came out and told the people and you are master still  graham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras the vast listening ears and back to her face i am master still he said slowly and the swift rush of a fleet of aeroplanes passed across his thoughts  and you did this you who are the niece of ostrog  for you she cried for you that you for whom the world has waited should not be cheated of your power  graham stood for a space wordless regarding her his doubts and questionings had fled before her presence he remembered the things that he had meant to say he faced the cameras again and the light about him grew brighter he turned again towards her  you have saved me he said you have saved my power and the battle is beginning god knows what this night will seebut not dishonour  he paused he addressed himself to the unseen multitudes who stared upon him through those grotesque black eyes at first he spoke slowly men and women of the new age he said you have arisen to do battle for the race there is no easy victory before us  he stopped to gather words the thoughts that had been in his mind before she came returned but transfigured no longer touched with the shadow of a possible irrelevance this night is a beginning he cried this battle that is coming this battle that rushes upon us tonight is only a beginning all your lives it may be you must fight take no thought though i am beaten though i am utterly overthrown  he found the thing in his mind too vague for words he paused momentarily and broke into vague exhortations and then a rush of speech came upon him much that he said was but the humanitarian commonplace of a vanished age but the conviction of his voice touched it to vitality he stated the case of the old days to the people of the new age to the woman at his side i come out of the past to you he said with the memory of an age that hoped my age was an age of dreamsof beginnings an age of noble hopes throughout the world we had made an end of slavery throughout the world we had spread the desire and anticipation that wars might cease that all men and women might live nobly in freedom and peace  so we hoped in the days that are past and what of those hopes how is it with man after two hundred years  great cities vast powers a collective greatness beyond our dreams for that we did not work and that has come but how is it with the little lives that make up this greater life how is it with the common lives as it has ever beensorrow and labour lives cramped and unfulfilled lives tempted by power tempted by wealth and gone to waste and folly the old faiths have faded and changed the new faith is there a new faith  things that he had long wished to believe he found that he believed he plunged at belief and seized it and clung for a time at her level he spoke gustily in broken incomplete sentences but with all his heart and strength of this new faith within him he spoke of the greatness of selfabnegation of his belief in an immortal life of humanity in which we live and move and have our being his voice rose and fell and the recording appliances hummed their hurried applause dim attendants watched him out of the shadow through all those doubtful places his sense of that silent spectator beside him sustained his sincerity for a few glorious moments he was carried away he felt no doubt of his heroic quality no doubt of his heroic words he had it all straight and plain his eloquence limped no longer and at last he made an end to speaking here and now he cried i make my will all that is mine in the world i give to the people of the world all that is mine in the world i give to the people of the world i give it to you and myself i give to you and as god wills i will live for you or i will die  he ended with a florid gesture and turned about he found the light of his present exaltation reflected in the face of the girl their eyes met her eyes were swimming with tears of enthusiasm they seemed to be urged towards each other they clasped hands and stood gripped facing one another in an eloquent silence she whispered i knew she whispered i knew he could not speak he crushed her hand in his his mind was the theatre of gigantic passions   the man in yellow was beside them neither had noted his coming he was saying that the southwest wards were marching i never expected it so soon he cried they have done wonders you must send them a word to help them on their way  graham dropped helens hand and stared at him absentmindedly then with a start he returned to his previous preoccupation about the flying stages  yes he said that is good that is good he weighed a message tell themwell done south west  he turned his eyes to helen wotton again his face expressed his struggle between conflicting ideas we must capture the flying stages he explained unless we can do that they will land negroes at all costs we must prevent that  he felt even as he spoke that this was not what had been in his mind before the interruption he saw a touch of surprise in her eyes she seemed about to speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice  it occurred to graham that she expected him to lead these marching people that that was the thing he had to do he made the offer abruptly he addressed the man in yellow but he spoke to her he saw her face respond here i am doing nothing he said  it is impossible protested the man in yellow  it is a fight in a warren your place is here  he explained elaborately he motioned towards the room where graham must wait he insisted no other course was possible we must know where you are he said at any moment a crisis may arise needing your presence and decision the room was a luxurious little apartment with news machines and a broken mirror that had once been en rapport with the crows nest specula it seemed a matter of course to graham that helen should stop with him  a picture had drifted through his mind of such a vast dramatic struggle as the masses in the ruins had suggested but here was no spectacular battlefield such as he imagined instead was seclusionand suspense it was only as the afternoon wore on that he pieced together a truer picture of the fight that was raging inaudibly and invisibly within four miles of him beneath the roehampton stage a strange and unprecedented contest it was a battle that was a hundred thousand little battles a battle in a sponge of ways and channels fought out of sight of sky or sun under the electric glare fought out in a vast confusion by multitudes untrained in arms led chiefly by acclamation multitudes dulled by mindless labour and enervated by the tradition of two hundred years of servile security against multitudes demoralised by lives of venial privilege and sensual indulgence they had no artillery no differentiation into this force or that the only weapon on either side was the little green metal carbine whose secret manufacture and sudden distribution in enormous quantities had been one of ostrogs culminating moves against the council few had had any experience with this weapon many had never discharged one many who carried it came unprovided with ammunition never was wilder firing in the history of warfare it was a battle of amateurs a hideous experimental warfare armed rioters fighting armed rioters armed rioters swept forward by the words and fury of a song by the tramping sympathy of their numbers pouring in countless myriads towards the smaller ways the disabled lifts the galleries slippery with blood the halls and passages choked with smoke beneath the flying stages to learn there when retreat was hopeless the ancient mysteries of warfare and overhead save for a few sharpshooters upon the roof spaces and for a few bands and threads of vapour that multiplied and darkened towards the evening the day was a clear serenity ostrog it seems had no bombs at command and in all the earlier phases of the battle the aeropiles played no part not the smallest cloud was there to break the empty brilliance of the sky it seemed as though it held itself vacant until the aeroplanes should come  ever and again there was news of these drawing nearer from this mediterranean port and then that and presently from the south of france but of the new guns that ostrog had made and which were known to be in the city came no news in spite of grahams urgency nor any report of successes from the dense felt of fighting strands about the flying stages section after section of the labour societies reported itself assembled reported itself marching and vanished from knowledge into the labyrinth of that warfare what was happening there even the busy ward leaders did not know in spite of the opening and closing of doors the hasty messengers the ringing of bells and the perpetual clitterclack of recording implements graham felt isolated strangely inactive inoperative  their isolation seemed at times the strangest the most unexpected of all the things that had happened since his awakening it had something of the quality of that inactivity that comes in dreams a tumult the stupendous realisation of a world struggle between ostrog and himself and then this confined quiet little room with its mouthpieces and bells and broken mirror  now the door would be closed and they were alone together they seemed sharply marked off then from all the unprecedented world storm that rushed together without vividly aware of one another only concerned with one another then the door would open again messengers would enter or a sharp bell would stab their quiet privacy and it was like a window in a well built brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a hurricane the dark hurry and tumult the stress and vehemence of the battle rushed in and overwhelmed them they were no longer persons but mere spectators mere impressions of a tremendous convulsion they became unreal even to themselves miniatures of personality indescribably small and the two antagonistic realities the only realities in being were first the city that throbbed and roared yonder in a belated frenzy of defence and secondly the aeroplanes hurling inexorably towards them over the round shoulder of the world  at first their mood had been one of exalted confidence a great pride had possessed them a pride in one another for the greatness of the issues they had challenged at first he had walked the room eloquent with a transitory persuasion of his tremendous destiny but slowly uneasy intimations of their coming defeat touched his spirit there came a long period in which they were alone he changed his theme became egotistical spoke of the wonder of his sleep of the little life of his memories remote yet minute and clear like something seen through an inverted operaglass and all the brief play of desires and errors that had made his former life she said little but the emotion in her face followed the tones in his voice and it seemed to him he had at last a perfect understanding he reverted from pure reminiscence to that sense of greatness she imposed upon him and through it all this destiny was before me he said this vast inheritance of which i did not dream  insensibly their heroic preoccupation with the revolutionary struggle passed to the question of their relationship he began to question her she told him of the days before his awakening spoke with a brief vividness of the girlish dreams that had given a bias to her life of the incredulous emotions his awakening had aroused she told him too of a tragic circumstance of her girlhood that had darkened her life quickened her sense of injustice and opened her heart prematurely to the wider sorrows of the world for a little time so far as he was concerned the great war about them was but the vast ennobling background to these personal things  in an instant these personal relations were submerged there came messengers to tell that a great fleet of aeroplanes was rushing between the sky and avignon he went to the crystal dial in the corner and assured himself that the thing was so he went to the chart room and consulted a map to measure the distances of avignon new arawan and london he made swift calculations he went to the room of the ward leaders to ask for news of the fight for the stagesand there was no one there after a time he came back to her  his face had changed it had dawned upon him that the struggle was perhaps more than half over that ostrog was holding his own that the arrival of the aeroplanes would mean a panic that might leave him helpless a chance phrase in the message had given him a glimpse of the reality that came each of these soaring giants bore its thousand half savage negroes to the death grapple of the city suddenly his humanitarian enthusiasm showed flimsy only two of the ward leaders were in their room when presently he repaired thither the hall of the atlas seemed empty he fancied a change in the bearing of the attendants in the outer rooms a sombre disillusionment darkened his mind she looked at him anxiously when he returned to her  no news he said with an assumed carelessness in answer to her eyes  then he was moved to frankness or ratherbad news we are losing we are gaining no ground and the aeroplanes draw nearer and nearer  he walked the length of the room and turned  unless we can capture those flying stages in the next hourthere will be horrible things we shall be beaten  no she said we have justicewe have the people we have god on our side  ostrog has disciplinehe has plans do you know out there just now i felt when i heard that these aeroplanes were a stage nearer i felt as if i were fighting the machinery of fate  she made no answer for a while we have done right she said at last  he looked at her doubtfully we have done what we could but does this depend upon us is it not an older sin a wider sin  what do you mean she asked  these blacks are savages ruled by force used as force and they have been under the rule of the whites two hundred years is it not a race quarrel the race sinnedthe race pays  but these labourers these poor people of london  vicarious atonement to stand wrong is to share the guilt  she looked keenly at him astonished at the new aspect he presented  without came the shrill ringing of a bell the sound of feet and the gabble of a phonographic message the man in yellow appeared yes said graham  they are at vichy  where are the attendants who were in the great hall of the atlas asked graham abruptly  presently the babble machine rang again we may win yet said the man in yellow going out to it if only we can find where ostrog has hidden his guns everything hangs on that now perhaps this  graham followed him but the only news was of the aeroplanes they had reached orleans  graham returned to helen no news he said no news  and we can do nothing  nothing  he paced impatiently suddenly the swift anger that was his nature swept upon him curse this complex world he cried and all the inventions of men that a man must die like a rat in a snare and never see his foe oh for one blow  he turned with an abrupt change in his manner thats nonsense he said i am a savage  he paced and stopped after all london and paris are only two cities all the temperate zone has risen what if london is doomed and paris destroyed these are but accidents again came the mockery of news to call him to fresh enquiries he returned with a graver face and sat down beside her  the end must be near he said the people it seems have fought and died in tens of thousands the ways about roehampton must be like a smoked beehive and they have died in vain they are still only at the sub stage the aeroplanes are near paris even were a gleam of success to come now there would be nothing to do there would be no time to do anything before they were upon us the guns that might have saved us are mislaid mislaid think of the disorder of things think of this foolish tumult that cannot even find its weapons oh for one aeropilejust one for the want of that i am beaten humanity is beaten and our cause is lost my kingship my headlong foolish kingship will not last a night and i have egged on the people to fight  they would have fought anyhow  i doubt it i have come among them  no she cried not that if defeat comesif you die but even that cannot be it cannot be after all these years  ah we have meant well butdo you indeed believe  if they defeat you she cried you have spoken your word has gone like a great wind through the world fanning liberty into a flame what if the flame sputters a little nothing can change the spoken word your message will have gone forth  to what end it may be it may be you know i said when you told me of these things dear god but that was scarcely a score of hours agoi said that i had not your faith wellat any rate there is nothing to do now  you have not my faith do you mean you are sorry  no he said hurriedly no before godno his voice changed but i thinki have been indiscreet i knew littlei grasped too hastily  he paused he was ashamed of this avowal there is one thing that makes up for all i have known you across this gulf of time i have come to you the rest is done it is done with you too it has been something moreor something less  he paused with his face searching hers and without clamoured the unheeded message that the aeroplanes were rising into the sky of amiens  she put her hand to her throat and her lips were white she stared before her as if she saw some horrible possibility suddenly her features changed oh but i have been honest she cried and then have i been honest i loved the world and freedom i hated cruelty and oppression surely it was that  yes he said yes and we have done what it lay in us to do we have given our message our message we have started armageddon but now now that we have it may be our last hour together now that all these greater things are done  he stopped she sat in silence her face was a white riddle  for a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir outside a running to and fro and cries then helen started to an attitude of tense attention it is she cried and stood up speechless incredulous triumphant and graham too heard metallic voices were shouting victory yes it was victory he stood up also with the light of a desperate hope in his eyes  bursting through the curtains appeared the man in yellow startled and dishevelled with excitement victory he cried victory the people are winning ostrogs people have collapsed  she rose victory and her voice was hoarse and faint  what do you mean asked graham tell me what  we have driven them out of the under galleries at norwood streatham is afire and burning wildly and roehampton is ours oursand we have taken the aeropile that lay thereon  for an instant graham and helen stood in silence their hearts were beating fast they looked at one another for one last moment there gleamed in graham his dream of empire of kingship with helen by his side it gleamed and passed  a shrill bell rang an agitated greyheaded man appeared from the room of the ward leaders it is all over he cried  what matters it now that we have roehampton the aeroplanes have been sighted at boulogne  the channel said the man in yellow he calculated swiftly half an hour  they still have three of the flying stages said the old man  those guns cried graham  we cannot mount themin half an hour  do you mean they are found  too late said the old man  if we could stop them another hour cried the man in yellow  nothing can stop them now said the old man they have near a hundred aeroplanes in the first fleet  another hour asked graham  to be so near said the ward leader now that we have found those guns to be so near if once we could get them out upon the roof spaces  how long would that take asked graham suddenly  an hourcertainly  too late cried the ward leader too late  is it too late said graham even now an hour  he had suddenly perceived a possibility he tried to speak calmly but his face was white there is one chance you said there was an aeropile  on the roehampton stage sire  smashed  no it is lying crossways to the carrier it might be got upon the guideseasily but there is no aeronaut  graham glanced at the two men and then at helen he spoke after a long pause we have no aeronauts  none  the aeroplanes are clumsy he said thoughtfully compared with the aeropiles  he turned suddenly to helen his decision was made i must do it  do what  go to this flying stageto this aeropile  what do you mean  i am an aeronaut after all those days for which you reproached me were not wasted  he turned to the old man in yellow put the aeropile upon the guides  the man in yellow hesitated  what do you mean to do cried helen  this aeropileit is a chance  you dont mean  to fightyes to fight in the air i have thought before an aeroplane is a clumsy thing a resolute man  butnever since flying began cried the man in yellow  there has been no need but now the time has come tell them nowsend them my messageto put it upon the guides  the old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow nodded and hurried out  helen made a step towards graham her face was white buthow can one fight you will be killed  perhaps yet not to do itor to let someone else attempt it  he stopped he could speak no more he swept the alternative aside by a gesture and they stood looking at one another  you are right she said at last in a low tone you are right if it can be done must go  those days for not altogether  he moved a step towards her and she stepped back her white face struggled against him and resisted him no she gasped i cannot bear go now  he extended his hands stupidly she clenched her fists go now she cried go now  he hesitated and understood he threw his hands up in a queer halftheatrical gesture he had no word to say he turned from her  the man in yellow moved towards the door with clumsy belated tact but graham stepped past him he went striding through the room where the ward leader bawled at a telephone directing that the aeropile should be put upon the guides  the man in yellow glanced at helens still figure hesitated and hurried after him graham did not once look back he did not speak until the curtain of the antechamber of the great hall fell behind him then he turned his head with curt swift directions upon his bloodless lips    chapter xxiv the coming of the aeroplanes  two men in pale blue were lying in the irregular line that stretched along the edge of the captured roehampton stage from end to end grasping their carbines and peering into the shadows of the stage called wimbledon park now and then they spoke to one another they spoke the mutilated english of their class and period the fire of the ostrogites had dwindled and ceased and few of the enemy had been seen for some time but the echoes of the fight that was going on now far below in the lower galleries of that stage came every now and then between the staccato of shots from the popular side one of these men was describing to the other how he had seen a man down below there dodge behind a girder and had aimed at a guess and hit him cleanly as he dodged too far hes down there still said the marksman see that little patch yes between those bars a few yards behind them lay a dead stranger face upward to the sky with the blue canvas of his jacket smoldering in a circle about the neat bullet hole on his chest close beside him a wounded man with a leg swathed about sat with an expressionless face and watched the progress of that burning gigantic behind them athwart the carrier lay the captured aeropile  i cant see him now said the second man in a ton of provocation  the marksman became foulmouthed and highvoiced in his earnest endeavour to make things plain and suddenly interrupting him came a noisy shouting from the substage  whats going on now he said and raised himself on one arm to stare at the stairheads in the central groove of the stage a number of blue figures were coming up these and swarming across the stage to the aeropile  we dont want all these fools said his friend they only crowd up and spoil shots what are they after  sshtheyre shouting something  the two men listened the swarming newcomers had crowded densely about the aeropile three ward leaders conspicuous by their black mantles and badges clambered into the body and appeared above it the rank and file flung themselves upon the vans gripping hold of the edges until the entire outline of the thing was manned in some places three deep one of the marksmen knelt up theyre putting it on the carrierthats what theyre after  he rose to his feet his friend rose also whats the good said his friend weve got no aeronauts  thats what theyre doing anyhow he looked at his rifle looked at the struggling crowd and suddenly turning to the wounded man mind these mate he said handing his carbine and cartridge belt and in a moment he was running towards the aeropile for a quarter of an hour he was a perspiring titan lugging thrusting shouting and heeding shouts and then the thing was done and he stood with a multitude of others cheering their own achievement by this time he knew what indeed everyone in the city knew that the master raw learner though he was intended to fly this machine himself was coming even now to take control of it would let no other man attempt it he who takes the greatest danger he who bears the heaviest burden that man is king so the master was reported to have spoken and even as this man cheered and while the beads of sweat still chased one another from the disorder of his hair he heard the thunder of a greater tumult and in fitful snatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song he saw through a gap in the people that a thick stream of heads still poured up the stairway the master is coming shouted voices the master is coming and the crowd about him grew denser and denser he began to thrust himself towards the central groove the master is coming the sleeper the master god and the master roared the voices  and suddenly quite close to him were the black uniforms of the revolutionary guard and for the first and last time in his life he saw graham saw him quite nearly a tall dark man in a flowing black robe with a white resolute face and eyes fixed steadfastly before him a man who for all the little things about him held neither ears nor eyes nor thoughts for all his days that man remembered the passing of grahams bloodless face in a moment it had gone and he was fighting in the swaying crowd a lad weeping with terror thrust against him pressing towards the stairways yelling clear for the aeropile the bell that clears the flying stage became a loud unmelodious clanging  with that clanging in his ears graham drew near the aeropile marched into the shadow of its tilting wing he became aware that a number of people about him were offering to accompany him and waved their offers aside he wanted to think how one started the engine the bell clanged faster and faster and the feet of the retreating people roared faster and louder the man in yellow was assisting him to mount through the ribs of the body he clambered into the aeronauts place fixing himself very carefully and deliberately what was it the man in yellow was pointing to two aeropiles driving upward in the southern sky no doubt they were looking for the coming aeroplanes thatpresentlythe thing to do now was to start things were being shouted at him questions warnings they bothered him he wanted to think about the aeropile to recall every item of his previous experience he waved the people from him saw the man in yellow dropping off through the ribs saw the crowd cleft down the line of the girders by his gesture  for a moment he was motionless staring at the levers the wheel by which the engine shifted and all the delicate appliances of which he knew so little his eye caught a spirit level with the bubble towards him and he remembered something spent a dozen seconds in swinging the engine forward until the bubble floated in the centre of the tube he noted that the people were not shouting knew they watched his deliberation a bullet smashed on the bar above his head who fired was the line clear of people he stood up to see and sat down again  in another second the propeller was spinning and he was rushing down the guides he gripped the wheel and swung the engine back to lift the stem then it was the people shouted in a moment he was throbbing with the quiver of the engine and the shouts dwindled swiftly behind rushed down to silence the wind whistled over the edges of the screen and the world sank away from him very swiftly  throb throb throbthrob throb throb up he drove he fancied himself free of all excitement felt cool and deliberate he lifted the stem still more opened one valve on his left wing and swept round and up he looked down with a steady head and up one of the ostrogite aeropiles was driving across his course so that he drove obliquely towards it and would pass below it at a steep angle its little aeronauts were peering down at him what did they mean to do his mind became active one he saw held a weapon pointing seemed prepared to fire what did they think he meant to do in a moment he understood their tactics and his resolution was taken his momentary lethargy was past he opened two more valves to his left swung round end on to this hostile machine closed his valves and shot straight at it stem and windscreen shielding him from the shot they tilted a little as if to clear him he flung up his stem  throb throb throbpausethrob throbhe set his teeth his face into an involuntary grimace and crash he struck it he struck upward beneath the nearer wing  very slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up he saw the full breadth of it and then it slid downward out of his sight  he felt his stem going down his hands tightened on the levers whirled and rammed the engine back he felt the jerk of a clearance the nose of the machine jerked upward steeply and for a moment he seemed to be lying on his back the machine was reeling and staggering it seemed to be dancing on its screw he made a huge effort hung for a moment on the levers and slowly the engine came forward again he was driving upward but no longer so steeply he gasped for a moment and flung himself at the levers again the wind whistled about him one further effort and he was almost level he could breathe he turned his head for the first time to see what had become of his antagonists turned back to the levers for a moment and looked again for a moment he could have believed they were annihilated and then he saw between the two stages to the east was a chasm and down this something a slender edge fell swiftly and vanished as a sixpence falls down a crack  at first he did not understand and then a wild joy possessed him he shouted at the top of his voice an inarticulate shout and drove higher and higher up the sky throb throb throb pause throb throb throb where was the other aeropile he thought they too as he looked round the empty heavens he had a momentary fear that this machine had risen above him and then he saw it alighting on the norwood stage they had meant shooting to risk being rammed headlong two thousand feet in the air was beyond their latterday courage the combat was declined  for a little while he circled then swooped in a steep descent towards the westward stage throb throb throb throb throb throb the twilight was creeping on apace the smoke from the streatham stage that had been so dense and dark was now a pillar of fire and all the laced curves of the moving ways and the translucent roofs and domes and the chasms between the buildings were glowing softly now lit by the tempered radiance of the electric light that the glare of the way overpowered the three efficient stages that the ostrogites heldfor wimbledon park was useless because of the fire from roehampton and streatham was a furnacewere glowing with guide lights for the coming aeroplanes as he swept over the roehampton stage he saw the dark masses of the people thereon he heard a clap of frantic cheering heard a bullet from the wimbledon park stage tweet through the air and went beating up above the surrey wastes he felt a breath of wind from the southwest and lifted his westward wing as he had learnt to do and so drove upward heeling into the rare swift upper air throb throb throbthrob throb throb  up he drove and up to that pulsating rhythm until the country beneath was blue and indistinct and london spread like a little map traced in light like the mere model of a city near the brim of the horizon the southwest was a sky of sapphire over the shadowy rim of the world and ever as he drove upward the multitude of stars increased  and behold in the southward low down and glittering swiftly nearer were two little patches of nebulous light and then two more and then a nebulous glow of swiftly driving shapes presently he could count them there were four and twenty the first fleet of aeroplanes had come beyond appeared a yet greater glow  he swept round in a half circle staring at this advancing fleet it flew in a wedgelike shape a triangular flight of gigantic phosphorescent shapes sweeping nearer through the lower air he made a swift calculation of their pace and spun the little wheel that brought the engine forward he touched a lever and the throbbing effort of the engine ceased he began to fall fell swifter and swifter he aimed at the apex of the wedge he dropped like a stone through the whistling air it seemed scarce a second from that soaring moment before he struck the foremost aeroplane  no man of all that black multitude saw the coming of his fate no man among them dreamt of the hawk that struck downward upon him out of the sky those who were not limp in the agonies of airsickness were craning their black necks and staring to see the filmy city that was rising out of the haze the rich and splendid city to which massa boss had brought their obedient muscles bright teeth gleamed and the glossy faces shone they had heard of paris they knew they were to have lordly times among the poor white trash and suddenly graham struck them  he had aimed at the body of the aeroplane but at the very last instant a better idea had flashed into his mind he twisted about and struck near the edge of the starboard wing with all his accumulated weight he was jerked back as he struck his prow went gliding across its smooth expanse towards the rim he felt the forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his aeropile along with it and for a moment that seemed an age he could not tell what was happening he heard a thousand throats yelling and perceived that his machine was balanced on the edge of the gigantic float and driving down down glanced over his shoulder and saw the backbone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up he had a vision through the ribs of sliding chairs staring faces and hands clutching at the tilting guide bars the fenestrations in the further float flashed open as the aeronaut tried to right her beyond he saw a second aeroplane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling fellow the broad area of swaying wings seemed to jerk upward he felt his aeropile had dropped clear that the monstrous fabric clean overturned hung like a sloping wall above him  he did not clearly understand that he had struck the side float of the aeroplane and slipped off but he perceived that he was flying free on the down glide and rapidly nearing earth what had he done his heart throbbed like a noisy engine in his throat and for a perilous instant he could not move his levers because of the paralysis of his hands he wrenched the levers to throw his engine back fought for two seconds against the weight of it felt himself righting driving horizontally set the engine beating again  he looked upward and saw two aeroplanes glide shouting far overhead looked back and saw the main body of the fleet opening out and rushing upward and outward saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on and strike like a gigantic knifeblade along the windwheels below it  he put down his stern and looked again he drove up heedless of his direction as he watched he saw the windvanes give saw the huge fabric strike the earth saw its downward vans crumple with the weight of its descent and then the whole mass turned over and smashed upside down upon the sloping wheels throb throb throb pause suddenly from the heaving wreckage a thin tongue of white fire licked up towards the zenith and then he was aware of a huge mass flying through the air towards him and turned upwards just in time to escape the chargeif it was a chargeof a second aeroplane it whirled by below sucked him down a fathom and nearly turned him over in the gust of its close passage  he became aware of three others rushing towards him aware of the urgent necessity of beating above them aeroplanes were all about him circling wildly to avoid him as it seemed they drove past him above below eastward and westward far away to the westward was the sound of a collision and two falling flares far away to the southward a second squadron was coming steadily he beat upward presently all the aeroplanes were below him but for a moment he doubted the height he had of them and did not swoop again and then he came down upon a second victim and all its load of soldiers saw him coming the big machine heeled and swayed as the fear maddened men scrambled to the stern for their weapons a score of bullets sung through the air and there flashed a star in the thick glass windscreen that protected him the aeroplane slowed and dropped to foil his stroke and dropped too low just in time he saw the windwheels of bromley hill rushing up towards him and spun about and up as the aeroplane he had chased crashed among them all its voices wove into a felt of yelling the great fabric seemed to be standing on end for a second among the heeling and splintering vans and then it flew to pieces huge splinters came flying through the air its engines burst like shells a hot rush of flame shot overhead into the darkling sky  two he cried with a bomb from overhead bursting as it fell and forthwith he was beating up again a glorious exhilaration possessed him now a giant activity his troubles about humanity about his inadequacy were gone for ever he was a man in battle rejoicing in his power aeroplanes seemed radiating from him in every direction intent only upon avoiding him the yelling of their packed passengers came in short gusts as they swept by he chose his third quarry struck hastily and did but turn it on edge it escaped him to smash against the tall cliff of london wall flying from that impact he skimmed the darkling ground so nearly he could see a frightened rabbit bolting up a slope he jerked up steeply and found himself driving over south london with the air about him vacant to the right of him a wild riot of signal rockets from the ostrogites banged tumultuously in the sky to the south the wreckage of half a dozen air ships flamed and east and west and north the air ships fled before him they drove away to the east and north and went about in the south for they could not pause in the air in their present confusion any attempt at evolution would have meant disastrous collisions he could scarcely realize the thing he had done in every quarter aeroplanes were receding they were receding they dwindled smaller and smaller they were in flight  he passed two hundred feet or so above the roehampton stage it was black with people and noisy with their frantic shouting but why was the wimbledon park stage black and cheering too the smoke and flame of streatham now hid the three further stages he curved about and rose to see them and the northern quarters first came the square masses of shooters hill into sight from behind the smoke lit and orderly with the aeroplane that had landed and its disembarking negroes then came blackheath and then under the corner of the reek the norwood stage on blackheath no aeroplane had landed but an aeropile lay upon the guides norwood was covered by a swarm of little figures running to and fro in a passionate confusion why abruptly he understood the stubborn defence of the flying stages was over the people were pouring into the underways of these last strongholds of ostrogs usurpation and then from far away on the northern border of the city full of glorious import to him came a sound a signal a note of triumph the leaden thud of a gun his lips fell apart his face was disturbed with emotion  he drew an immense breath they win he shouted to the empty air the people win the sound of a second gun came like an answer and then he saw the aeropile on blackheath was running down its guides to launch it lifted clean and rose it shot up into the air driving straight southward and away from him  in an instant it came to him what this meant it must needs be ostrog in flight he shouted and dropped towards it he had the momentum of his elevation and fell slanting down the air and very swiftly it rose steeply at his approach he allowed for its velocity and drove straight upon it  it suddenly became a mere flat edge and behold he was past it and driving headlong down with all the force of his futile blow  he was furiously angry he reeled the engine back along its shaft and went circling up he saw ostrogs machine beating up a spiral before him he rose straight towards it won above it by virtue of the impetus of his swoop and by the advantage and weight of a man he dropped headlongdropped and missed again as he rushed past he saw the face of ostrogs aeronaut confident and cool and in ostrogs attitude a wincing resolution ostrog was looking steadfastly away from himto the south he realized with a gleam of wrath how bungling his flight must be below he saw the croyden hills he jerked upward and once more he gained on his enemy  he glanced over his shoulder and his attention was arrested by a strange thing the eastward stage the one on shooters hill appeared to lift a flash changing to a tall grey shape a cowled figure of smoke and dust jerked into the air for a moment this cowled figure stood motionless dropping huge masses of metal from its shoulders and then it began to uncoil a dense head of smoke the people had blown it up aeroplane and all as suddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang up from the norwood stage and even as he stared at this came a dead report and the air wave of the first explosion struck him he was flung up and sideways  for a moment the aeropile fell nearly edgewise with her nose down and seemed to hesitate whether to overset altogether he stood on his windshield wrenching the wheel that swayed up over his head and then the shock of the second explosion took his machine sideways  he found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his machine and the air was blowing past him and upward he seemed to be hanging quite still in the air with the wind blowing up past him it occurred to him that he was falling then he was sure that he was falling he could not look down  he found himself recapitulating with incredible swiftness all that had happened since his awakening the days of doubt the days of empire and at last the tumultuous discovery of ostrogs calculated treachery he was beaten but london was saved london was saved  the thought had a quality of utter unreality who was he why was he holding so tightly with his hands why could he not leave go in such a fall as this countless dreams have ended but in a moment he would wake  his thoughts ran swifter and swifter he wondered if he should see helen again it seemed so unreasonable that he should not see her again it must be a dream yet surely he would meet her she at least was real she was real he would wake and meet her  although he could not look at it he was suddenly aware that the earth was very near
