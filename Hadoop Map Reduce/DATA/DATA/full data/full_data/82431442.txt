jerome copyright 1908 by dodd mead  company published september 1908     the soul of nicholas snyders or the miser of zandam  once upon a time in zandam which is by the zuider zee there lived a wicked man named nicholas snyders he was mean and hard and cruel and loved but one thing in the world and that was gold and even that not for its own sake he loved the power gold gave himthe power to tyrannize and to oppress the power to cause suffering at his will they said he had no soul but there they were wrong all men ownor to speak more correctly are owned bya soul and the soul of nicholas snyders was an evil soul he lived in the old windmill which still is standing on the quay with only little christina to wait upon him and keep house for him christina was an orphan whose parents had died in debt nicholas to christinas everlasting gratitude had cleared their memoryit cost but a few hundred florinsin consideration that christina should work for him without wages christina formed his entire household and only one willing visitor ever darkened his door the widow toelast dame toelast was rich and almost as great a miser as nicholas himself why should not we two marry nicholas had once croaked to the widow toelast together we should be masters of all zandam dame toelast had answered with a cackling laugh but nicholas was never in haste  one afternoon nicholas snyders sat alone at his desk in the centre of the great semicircular room that took up half the ground floor of the windmill and that served him for an office and there came a knocking at the outer door  come in cried nicholas snyders he spoke in a tone quite kind for nicholas snyders he felt so sure it was jan knocking at the doorjan van der voort the young sailor now master of his own ship come to demand of him the hand of little christina in anticipation nicholas snyders tasted the joy of dashing jans hopes to the ground of hearing him plead then rave of watching the growing pallor that would overspread jans handsome face as nicholas would point by point explain to him the consequences of defiancehow firstly jans old mother should be turned out of her home his old father put into prison for debt how secondly jan himself should be pursued without remorse his ship be bought over his head before he could complete the purchase the interview would afford to nicholas snyders sport after his own soul since jans return the day before he had been looking forward to it therefore feeling sure it was jan he cried come in quite cheerily  but it was not jan it was somebody nicholas snyders had never set eyes on before and neither after that one visit did nicholas snyders ever set eyes upon him again the light was fading and nicholas snyders was not the man to light candles before they were needed so that he was never able to describe with any precision the strangers appearance nicholas thought he seemed an old man but alert in all his movements while his eyesthe one thing about him nicholas saw with any clearnesswere curiously bright and piercing  who are you asked nicholas snyders taking no pains to disguise his disappointment  i am a pedlar answered the stranger his voice was clear and not unmusical with just the suspicion of roguishness behind  not wanting anything answered nicholas snyders drily shut the door and be careful of the step  but instead the stranger took a chair and drew it nearer and himself in shadow looked straight into nicholas snyders face and laughed  are you quite sure nicholas snyders are you quite sure there is nothing you require  nothing growled nicholas snydersexcept the sight of your back the stranger bent forward and with his long lean hand touched nicholas snyders playfully upon the knee wouldnt you like a soul nicholas snyders he asked  think of it continued the strange pedlar before nicholas could recover power of speech for forty years you have drunk the joy of being mean and cruel are you not tired of the taste nicholas snyders wouldnt you like a change think of it nicholas snydersthe joy of being loved of hearing yourself blessed instead of cursed wouldnt it be good fun nicholas snydersjust by way of a change if you dont like it you can return and be yourself again  what nicholas snyders recalling all things afterwards could never understand was why he sat there listening in patience to the strangers talk for at the time it seemed to him the jesting of a wandering fool but something about the stranger had impressed him  i have it with me continued the odd pedlar and as for price the stranger made a gesture indicating dismissal of all sordid details i look for my reward in watching the result of the experiment i am something of a philosopher i take an interest in these matters see the stranger dived between his legs and produced from his pack a silver flask of cunning workmanship and laid it on the table  its flavour is not unpleasant explained the stranger a little bitter but one does not drink it by the goblet a wineglassful such as one would of old tokay while the mind of both is fixed on the same thought may my soul pass into him may his pass into me the operation is quite simple the secret lies within the drug the stranger patted the quaint flask as though it had been some little dog  you will say who will exchange souls with nicholas snyders the stranger appeared to have come prepared with an answer to all questions my friend you are rich you need not fear it is the possession men value the least of all they have choose your soul and drive your bargain i leave that to you with one word of counsel only you will find the young readier than the oldthe young to whom the world promises all things for gold choose you a fine fair fresh young soul nicholas snyders and choose it quickly your hair is somewhat grey my friend taste before you die the joy of living  the strange pedlar laughed and rising closed his pack nicholas snyders neither moved nor spoke until with the soft clanging of the massive door his senses returned to him then seizing the flask the stranger had left behind him he sprang from his chair meaning to fling it after him into the street but the flashing of the firelight on its burnished surface stayed his hand  after all the case is of value nicholas chuckled and put the flask aside and lighting the two tall candles buried himself again in his greenbound ledger yet still from time to time nicholas snyders eye would wander to where the silver flask remained half hidden among dusty papers and later there came again a knocking at the door and this time it really was young jan who entered  jan held out his great hand across the littered desk  we parted in anger nicholas snyders it was my fault you were in the right i ask you to forgive me i was poor it was selfish of me to wish the little maid to share with me my poverty but now i am no longer poor  sit down responded nicholas in kindly tone i have heard of it so now you are master and the owner of your shipyour very own  my very own after one more voyage laughed jan i have burgomaster allarts promise  a promise is not a performance hinted nicholas burgomaster allart is not a rich man a higher bid might tempt him another might step in between you and become the owner  jan only laughed why that would be the work of an enemy which god be praised i do not think that i possess  lucky lad commented nicholas so few of us are without enemies and your parents jan will they live with you  we wished it answered jan both christina and i but the mother is feeble the old mill has grown into her life  i can understand agreed nicholas the old vine torn from the old wall withers and your father jan people will gossip the mill is paying  jan shook his head it never will again and the debts haunt him but all that as i tell him is a thing of the past his creditors have agreed to look to me and wait  all of them queried nicholas  all of them i could discover laughed jan  nicholas snyders pushed back his chair and looked at jan with a smile upon his wrinkled face and so you and christina have arranged it all  with your consent sir answered jan  you will wait for that asked nicholas  we should like to have it sir jan smiled but the tone of his voice fell agreeably on nicholas snyders ear nicholas snyders loved best beating the dog that growled and showed its teeth  better not wait for that said nicholas snyders you might have to wait long  jan rose an angry flush upon his face so nothing changes you nicholas snyders have it your own way then  you will marry her in spite of me  in spite of you and of your friends the fiends and of your master the devil flung out jan for jan had a soul that was generous and brave and tender and excessively shorttempered even the best of souls have their failings  i am sorry said old nicholas  i am glad to hear it answered jan  i am sorry for your mother explained nicholas the poor dame i fear will be homeless in her old age the mortgage shall be foreclosed jan on your weddingday i am sorry for your father jan his creditors janyou have overlooked just one i am sorry for him jan prison has always been his dread i am sorry even for you my young friend you will have to begin life over again burgomaster allart is in the hollow of my hand i have but to say the word your ship is mine i wish you joy of your bride my young friend you must love her very dearlyyou will be paying a high price for her  it was nicholas snyders grin that maddened jan he sought for something that thrown straight at the wicked mouth should silence it and by chance his hand lighted on the pedlars silver flask in the same instance nicholas snyders hand had closed upon it also the grin had died away  sit down commanded nicholas snyders let us talk further and there was that in his voice that compelled the younger mans obedience  you wonder jan why i seek always anger and hatred i wonder at times myself why do generous thoughts never come to me as to other men listen jan i am in a whimsical mood such things cannot be but it is a whim of mine to think it might have been sell me your soul jan sell me your soul that i too may taste this love and gladness that i hear about for a little while jan only for a little while and i will give you all you desire  the old man seized his pen and wrote  see jan the ship is yours beyond mishap the mill goes free your father may hold up his head again and all i ask jan is that you drink to me willing the while that your soul may go from you and become the soul of old nicholas snydersfor a little while jan only for a little while  with feverish hands the old man had drawn the stopper from the pedlars flagon had poured the wine into twin glasses jans inclination was to laugh but the old mans eagerness was almost frenzy surely he was mad but that would not make less binding the paper he had signed a true man does not jest with his soul but the face of christina was shining down on jan from out the gloom  you will mean it whispered nicholas snyders  may my soul pass from me and enter into nicholas snyders answered jan replacing his empty glass upon the table and the two stood looking for a moment into one anothers eyes  and the high candles on the littered desk flickered and went out as though a breath had blown them first one and then the other  i must be getting home came the voice of jan from the darkness why did you blow out the candles  we can light them again from the fire answered nicholas he did not add that he had meant to ask that same question of jan he thrust them among the glowing logs first one and then the other and the shadows crept back into their corners  you will not stop and see christina asked nicholas  not tonight answered jan  the paper that i signed nicholas reminded himyou have it  i had forgotten it jan answered  the old man took it from the desk and handed it to him jan thrust it into his pocket and went out nicholas bolted the door behind him and returned to his desk sat long there his elbow resting on the open ledger  nicholas pushed the ledger aside and laughed what foolery as if such things could be the fellow must have bewitched me  nicholas crossed to the fire and warmed his hands before the blaze still i am glad he is going to marry the little lass a good lad a good lad  nicholas must have fallen asleep before the fire when he opened his eyes it was to meet the grey dawn he felt cold stiff hungry and decidedly cross why had not christina woke him up and given him his supper did she think he had intended to pass the night on a wooden chair the girl was an idiot he would go upstairs and tell her through the door just what he thought of her  his way upstairs led through the kitchen to his astonishment there sat christina asleep before the burntout grate  upon my word muttered nicholas to himself people in this house dont seem to know what beds are for  but it was not christina so nicholas told himself christina had the look of a frightened rabbit it had always irritated him this girl even in her sleep wore an impertinent expressiona delightfully impertinent expression besides this girl was prettymarvellously pretty indeed so pretty a girl nicholas had never seen in all his life before why had the girls when nicholas was young been so entirely different a sudden bitterness seized nicholas it was as though he had just learnt that long ago without knowing it he had been robbed  the child must be cold nicholas fetched his furlined cloak and wrapped it about her  there was something else he ought to do the idea came to him while drawing the cloak around her shoulders very gently not to disturb hersomething he wanted to do if only he could think what it was the girls lips were parted she appeared to be speaking to him asking him to do this thingor telling him not to do it nicholas could not be sure which half a dozen times he turned away and half a dozen times stole back to where she sat sleeping with that delightfully impertinent expression on her face her lips parted but what she wanted or what it was he wanted nicholas could not think  perhaps christina would know perhaps christina would know who she was and how she got there nicholas climbed the stairs swearing at them for creaking  christinas door was open no one was in the room the bed had not been slept upon nicholas descended the creaking stairs  the girl was still asleep could it be christina herself nicholas examined the delicious features one by one never before so far as he could recollect had he seen the girl yet around her necknicholas had not noticed it beforelay christinas locket rising and falling as she breathed nicholas knew it well the one thing belonging to her mother christina had insisted on keeping the one thing about which she had ever defied him she would never have parted with that locket it must be christina herself but what had happened to her or to himself remembrance rushed in upon him the odd pedlar the scene with jan but surely all that had been a dream yet there upon the littered desk still stood the pedlars silver flask together with the twin stained glasses  nicholas tried to think but his brain was in a whirl a ray of sunshine streaming through the window fell across the dusty room nicholas had never seen the sun that he could recollect involuntarily he stretched his hands towards it felt a pang of grief when it vanished leaving only the grey light he drew the rusty bolts flung open the great door a strange world lay before him a new world of lights and shadows that wooed him with their beautya world of low soft voices that called to him there came to him again that bitter sense of having been robbed  i could have been so happy all these years murmured old nicholas to himself it is just the little town i could have lovedso quaint so quiet so homelike i might have had friends old cronies children of my own maybe  a vision of the sleeping christina flashed before his eyes she had come to him a child feeling only gratitude towards him had he had eyes with which to see her all things might have been different  was it too late he is not so oldnot so very old new life is in his veins she still loves jan but that was the jan of yesterday in the future jans every word and deed will be prompted by the evil soul that was once the soul of nicholas snydersthat nicholas snyders remembers well can any woman love that let the case be as handsome as you will  ought he as an honest man to keep the soul he had won from jan by what might be called a trick yes it had been a fair bargain and jan had taken his price besides it was not as if jan had fashioned his own soul these things are chance why should one man be given gold and another be given parched peas he has as much right to jans soul as jan ever had he is wiser he can do more good with it it was jans soul that loved christina let jans soul win her if it can and jans soul listening to the argument could not think of a word to offer in opposition  christina was still asleep when nicholas reentered the kitchen he lighted the fire and cooked the breakfast and then aroused her gently there was no doubt it was christina the moment her eyes rested on old nicholas there came back to her the frightened rabbit look that had always irritated him it irritated him now but the irritation was against himself  you were sleeping so soundly when i came in last night christina commenced  and you were afraid to wake me nicholas interrupted her you thought the old curmudgeon would be cross listen christina you paid off yesterday the last debt your father owed it was to an old sailori had not been able to find him before not a cent more do you owe and there remains to you out of your wages a hundred florins it is yours whenever you like to ask me for it  christina could not understand neither then nor during the days that followed nor did nicholas enlighten her for the soul of jan had entered into a very wise old man who knew that the best way to live down the past is to live boldly the present all that christina could be sure of was that the old nicholas snyders had mysteriously vanished that in his place remained a new nicholas who looked at her with kindly eyesfrank and honest compelling confidence though nicholas never said so it came to christina that she herself her sweet example her ennobling influence it was that had wrought this wondrous change and to christina the explanation seemed not impossibleseemed even pleasing  the sight of his littered desk was hateful to him starting early in the morning nicholas would disappear for the entire day returning in the evening tired but cheerful bringing with him flowers that christina laughed at telling him they were weeds but what mattered names to nicholas they were beautiful in zandam the children ran from him the dogs barked after him so nicholas escaping through byways would wander far into the country children in the villages around came to know a kind old fellow who loved to linger his hands resting on his staff watching their play listening to their laughter whose ample pockets were storehouses of good things their elders passing by would whisper to one another how like he was in features to wicked old nick the miser of zandam and would wonder where he came from nor was it only the faces of the children that taught his lips to smile it troubled him at first to find the world so full of marvellously pretty girlsof pretty women also all more or less lovable it bewildered him until he found that notwithstanding christina remained always in his thoughts the prettiest the most lovable of them all then every pretty face rejoiced him it reminded him of christina  on his return the second day christina had met him with sadness in her eyes farmer beerstraater an old friend of her fathers had called to see nicholas not finding nicholas had talked a little with christina a hardhearted creditor was turning him out of his farm christina pretended not to know that the creditor was nicholas himself but marvelled that such wicked men could be nicholas said nothing but the next day farmer beerstraater had called again all smiles blessings and great wonder  but what can have come to him repeated farmer beerstraater over and over  christina had smiled and answered that perhaps the good god had touched his heart but thought to herself that perhaps it had been the good influence of another the tale flew christina found herself besieged on every hand and finding her intercessions invariably successful grew day by day more pleased with herself and by consequence more pleased with nicholas snyders for nicholas was a cunning old gentleman jans soul in him took delight in undoing the evil the soul of nicholas had wrought but the brain of nicholas snyders that remained to him whispered let the little maid think it is all her doing  the news reached the ears of dame toelast the same evening saw her seated in the inglenook opposite nicholas snyders who smoked and seemed bored  you are making a fool of yourself nicholas snyders the dame told him everybody is laughing at you  i had rather they laughed than cursed me growled nicholas  have you forgotten all that has passed between us demanded the dame  wish i could sighed nicholas  at your age commenced the dame  i am feeling younger than i ever felt in all my life nicholas interrupted her  you dont look it commented the dame  what do looks matter snapped nicholas it is the soul of a man that is the real man  they count for something as the world goes explained the dame why if i liked to follow your example and make a fool of myself there are young men fine young men handsome young men  dont let me stand in your way interposed nicholas quickly as you say i am old and i have a devil of a temper there must be many better men than i am men more worthy of you  i dont say there are not returned the dame but nobody more suitable girls for boys and old women for old men i havent lost my wits nicholas snyders if you have when you are yourself again  nicholas snyders sprang to his feet i am myself he cried and intend to remain myself who dares say i am not myself  i do retorted the dame with exasperating coolness nicholas snyders is not himself when at the bidding of a prettyfaced doll he flings his money out of the window with both hands he is a creature bewitched and i am sorry for him shell fool you for the sake of her friends till you havent a cent left and then shell laugh at you when you are yourself nicholas snyders you will be crazy with yourselfremember that and dame toelast marched out and slammed the door behind her  girls for boys and old women for old men the phrase kept ringing in his ears hitherto his newfound happiness had filled his life leaving no room for thought but the old dames words had sown the seed of reflection  was christina fooling him the thought was impossible never once had she pleaded for herself never once for jan the evil thought was the creature of dame toelasts evil mind christina loved him her face brightened at his coming the fear of him had gone out of her a pretty tyranny had replaced it but was it the love that he sought jans soul in old nicks body was young and ardent it desired christina not as a daughter but as a wife could it win her in spite of old nicks body the soul of jan was an impatient soul better to know than to doubt  do not light the candles let us talk a little by the light of the fire only said nicholas and christina smiling drew her chair towards the blaze but nicholas sat in the shadow  you grow more beautiful every day christina said nicholassweeter and more womanly he will be a happy man who calls you wife  the smile passed from christinas face i shall never marry she answered never is a long word little one  a true woman does not marry the man she does not love  but may she not marry the man she does smiled nicholas  sometimes she may not christina explained  and when is that  christinas face was turned away when he has ceased to love her  the soul in old nicks body leapt with joy he is not worthy of you christina his new fortune has changed him is it not so he thinks only of money it is as though the soul of a miser had entered into him he would marry even dame toelast for the sake of her goldbags and her broad lands and her many mills if only she would have him cannot you forget him  i shall never forget him i shall never love another man i try to hide it and often i am content to find there is so much in the world that i can do but my heart is breaking she rose and kneeling beside him clasped her hands around him i am glad you have let me tell you she said but for you i could not have borne it you are so good to me  for answer he stroked with his withered hand the golden hair that fell disordered about his withered knees she raised her eyes to him they were filled with tears but smiling  i cannot understand she said i think sometimes that you and he must have changed souls he is hard and mean and cruel as you used to be she laughed and the arms around him tightened for a moment and now you are kind and tender and great as once he was it is as if the good god had taken away my lover from me to give to me a father  listen to me christina he said it is the soul that is the man not the body could you not love me for my new soul  but i do love you answered christina smiling through her tears  could you as a husband the firelight fell upon her face nicholas holding it between his withered hands looked into it long and hard and reading what he read there laid it back against his breast and soothed it with his withered hand  i was jesting little one he said girls for boys and old women for old men and so in spite of all you still love jan  i love him answered christina i cannot help it  and if he would you would marry him let his soul be what it may  i love him answered christina i cannot help it  old nicholas sat alone before the dying fire is it the soul or the body that is the real man the answer was not so simple as he had thought it  christina loved janso nicholas mumbled to the dying firewhen he had the soul of jan she loves him still though he has the soul of nicholas snyders when i asked her if she could love me it was terror i read in her eyes though jans soul is now in me she divined it it must be the body that is the real jan the real nicholas if the soul of christina entered into the body of dame toelast should i turn from christina from her golden hair her fathomless eyes her asking lips to desire the shrivelled carcass of dame toelast no i should still shudder at the thought of her yet when i had the soul of nicholas snyders i did not loathe her while christina was naught to me it must be with the soul that we love else jan would still love christina and i should be miser nick yet here am i loving christina using nicholas snyders brain and gold to thwart nicholas snyders every scheme doing everything that i know will make him mad when he comes back into his own body while jan cares no longer for christina would marry dame toelast for her broad lands her many mills clearly it is the soul that is the real man then ought i not to be glad thinking i am going back into my own body knowing that i shall wed christina but i am not glad i am very miserable i shall not go with jans soul i feel it my own soul will come back to me i shall be again the hard cruel mean old man i was before only now i shall be poor and helpless the folks will laugh at me and i shall curse them powerless to do them evil even dame toelast will not want me when she learns all and yet i must do this thing so long as jans soul is in me i love christina better than myself i must do this for her sake i love heri cannot help it  old nicholas rose took from the place where a month before he had hidden it the silver flask of cunning workmanship  just two more glassfuls left mused nicholas as he gently shook the flask against his ear he laid it on the desk before him then opened once again the old green ledger for there still remained work to be done  he woke christina early take these letters christina he commanded when you have delivered them all but not before go to jan tell him i am waiting here to see him on a matter of business he kissed her and seemed loth to let her go  i shall only be a little while smiled christina  all partings take but a little while he answered  old nicholas had foreseen the trouble he would have jan was content had no desire to be again a sentimental young fool eager to saddle himself with a penniless wife jan had other dreams  drink man drink cried nicholas impatiently before i am tempted to change my mind christina provided you marry her is the richest bride in zandam there is the deed read it and read quickly  then jan consented and the two men drank and there passed a breath between them as before and jan with his hands covered his eyes a moment  it was a pity perhaps that he did so for in that moment nicholas snatched at the deed that lay beside jan on the desk the next instant it was blazing in the fire  not so poor as you thought came the croaking voice of nicholas not so poor as you thought i can build again i can build again and the creature laughing hideously danced with its withered arms spread out before the blaze lest jan should seek to rescue christinas burning dowry before it was destroyed  jan did not tell christina in spite of all jan could say she would go back nicholas snyders drove her from the door with curses she could not understand the only thing clear was that jan had come back to her  twas a strange madness that seized upon me jan explained let the good sea breezes bring us health  so from the deck of jans ship they watched old zandam till it vanished into air  christina cried a little at the thought of never seeing it again but jan comforted her and later new faces hid the old  and old nicholas married dame toelast but happily lived to do evil only for a few years longer  long after jan told christina the whole story but it sounded very improbable and christinathough of course she did not say sodid not quite believe it but thought jan was trying to explain away that strange month of his life during which he had wooed dame toelast yet it certainly was strange that nicholas for the same short month had been so different from his usual self  perhaps thought christina if i had not told him i loved jan he would not have gone back to his old ways poor old gentleman no doubt it was despair
