you the two quid afore you go into the house’     continued the boatswain     the nest egg     he said it was a bad road and a little shop and ’ad got a look     about it he didn’t like     the constable’s move     mr grummit suddenly remembering himself stopped short and     attacked the bed with extraordinary fury     bob’s redemption     afore george had settled with the cabman there was a policeman     moving the crowd on     over the side     the four pigeons     the fust bob pretty ’eard of it was up at the cauliflower at     eight o’clock that evening     the temptation of samuel

for it and took it out     for a walk     captains all     every sailorman grumbles about the sea said the nightwatchman thoughtfully it’s human nature to grumble and i s’pose they keep on grumbling and sticking to it because there ain’t much else they can do there’s not many shoregoing berths that a sailorman is fit for and those that they are—such as a nightwatchman’s for instance—wants such a good character that there’s few as are to equal it  sometimes they get things to do ashore i knew one man that took up butchering and ’e did very well at it till the police took him up another man i knew gave up the sea to marry a washerwoman and they hadn’t been married six months afore she died and back he ’ad to go to sea agin pore chap  a man who used to grumble awful about the sea was old sam small—a man i’ve spoke of to you before to hear ’im go on about the sea arter he ’ad spent four or five months’ money in a fortnight was ’artbreaking he used to ask us wot was going to happen to ’im in his old age and when we pointed out that he wouldn’t be likely to ’ave any old age if he wasn’t more careful of ’imself he used to fly into a temper and call us everything ’e could lay his tongue to  one time when ’e was ashore with peter russet and ginger dick he seemed to ’ave got it on the brain he started being careful of ’is money instead o’ spending it and three mornings running he bought a newspaper and read the advertisements to see whether there was any comfortable berth for a strong good’arted man wot didn’t like work  he actually went arter one situation and if it hadn’t ha’ been for seventynine other men he said he believed he’d ha’ had a good chance of getting it as it was all ’e got was a black eye for shoving another man and for a day or two he was so down’arted that ’e was no company at all for the other two  for three or four days ’e went out by ’imself and then all of a sudden ginger dick and peter began to notice a great change in him he seemed to ’ave got quite cheerful and ’appy he answered ’em back pleasant when they spoke to ’im and one night he lay in ’is bed whistling comic songs until ginger and peter russet ’ad to get out o’ bed to him when he bought a new necktie and a smart cap and washed ’imself twice in one day they fust began to ask each other wot was up and then they asked him  up ses sam nothing  he’s in love ses peter russet  you’re a liar ses sam without turning round  he’ll ’ave it bad at ’is age ses ginger  sam didn’t say nothing but he kept fidgeting about as though ’e’d got something on his mind fust he looked out o’ the winder then he ’ummed a tune and at last looking at ’em very fierce he took a toothbrush wrapped in paper out of ’is pocket and began to clean ’is teeth  he is in love ses ginger as soon as he could speak  or else ’e’s gorn mad ses peter watching ’im which is it sam  sam made believe that he couldn’t answer ’im because o’ the toothbrush and arter he’d finished he ’ad such a raging toothache that ’e sat in a corner holding ’is face and looking the pictur’ o’ misery they couldn’t get a word out of him till they asked ’im to go out with them and then he said ’e was going to bed twenty minutes arterwards when ginger dick stepped back for ’is pipe he found he ’ad gorn  he tried the same game next night but the other two wouldn’t ’ave it and they stayed in so long that at last ’e lost ’is temper and arter wondering wot ginger’s father and mother could ha’ been athinking about and saying that he believed peter russet ’ad been changed at birth for a seasick monkey he put on ’is cap and went out both of ’em follered ’im sharp but when he led ’em to a missionhall and actually went inside they left ’im and went off on their own  they talked it over that night between themselves and next evening they went out fust and hid themselves round the corner ten minutes arterwards old sam came out walking as though ’e was going to catch a train and smiling to think ’ow he ’ad shaken them off at the corner of commercial road he stopped and bought ’imself a buttonhole for ’is coat and ginger was so surprised that ’e pinched peter russet to make sure that he wasn’t dreaming  old sam walked straight on whistling and every now and then looking down at ’is buttonhole until byandby he turned down a street on the right and went into a little shop ginger dick and peter waited for ’im at the corner but he was inside for so long that at last they got tired o’ waiting and crept up and peeped through the winder  it was a little tobacconist’s shop with newspapers and penny toys and suchlike but as far as ginger could see through two rows o’ pipes and the police news it was empty they stood there with their noses pressed against the glass for some time wondering wot had ’appened to sam but byandby a little boy went in and then they began to ’ave an idea wot sam’s little game was  as the shopbell went the door of a little parlour at the back of the shop opened and a stout and uncommon goodlooking woman of about forty came out her ’ead pushed the police news out o’ the way and her ’and came groping into the winder arter a toy  ginger ’ad a good look at ’er out o’ the corner of one eye while he pretended to be looking at a tobaccojar with the other as the little boy came out ’im and peter russet went in  i want a pipe please he ses smiling at ’er a clay pipe—one o’ your best the woman handed ’im down a box to choose from and just then peter wot ’ad been staring in at the arfopen door at a boot wot wanted lacing up gave a big start and ses why halloa  wot’s the matter ses the woman looking at ’im  i’d know that foot anywhere ses peter still staring at it and the words was hardly out of ’is mouth afore the foot ’ad moved itself away and tucked itself under its chair why that’s my dear old friend sam small ain’t it  do you know the captin ses the woman smiling at ’im  cap—— ses peter cap—— oh yes why he’s the biggest friend i’ve got ’ow strange ses the woman  we’ve been wanting to see ’im for some time ses ginger he was kind enough to lend me arf a crown the other day and i’ve been wanting to pay ’im  captin small ses the woman pushing open the door here’s some old friends o’ yours  old sam turned ’is face round and looked at ’em and if looks could ha’ killed as the saying is they’d ha’ been dead men there and then  oh yes he ses in a choking voice ’ow are you  pretty well thank you captin ses ginger grinning at ’im and ’ow’s yourself arter all this long time  he held out ’is hand and sam shook it and then shook ’ands with peter russet who was grinning so ’ard that he couldn’t speak  these are two old friends o’ mine mrs finch ses old sam giving ’em a warning look captin dick and captin russet two o’ the oldest and best friends a man ever ’ad  captin dick ’as got arf a crown for you ses peter russet still grinning  there now ses ginger looking vexed if i ain’t been and forgot it i’ve on’y got arf a sovereign  i can give you change sir ses mrs finch p’r’aps you’d like to sit down for five minutes  ginger thanked ’er and ’im and peter russet took a chair apiece in front o’ the fire and began asking old sam about ’is ’ealth and wot he’d been doing since they saw ’im last  fancy your reckernizing his foot ses mrs finch coming in with the change  i’d know it anywhere ses peter who was watching ginger pretending to give sam small the ’arfdollar and sam pretending in a most lifelike manner to take it  ginger dick looked round the room it was a comfortable little place with pictures on the walls and antimacassars on all the chairs and a row of pink vases on the mantelpiece then ’e looked at mrs finch and thought wot a nicelooking woman she was  this is nicer than being aboard ship with a crew o’ nasty troublesome sailormen to look arter captin small he ses  it’s wonderful the way he manages ’em ses peter russet to mrs finch like a lion he is  a roaring lion ses ginger looking at sam he don’t know wot fear is  sam began to smile and mrs finch looked at ’im so pleased that peter russet who ’ad been looking at ’er and the room and thinking much the same way as ginger began to think that they was on the wrong tack  afore ’e got stout and old he ses shaking his ’ead there wasn’t a smarter skipper afloat  we all ’ave our day ses ginger shaking his ’ead too  i dessay he’s good for another year or two afloat yet ses peter russet considering with care ses ginger  old sam was going to say something but ’e stopped himself just in time they will ’ave their joke he ses turning to mrs finch and trying to smile i feel as young as ever i did  mrs finch said that anybody with arf an eye could see that and then she looked at a kettle that was singing on the ’ob  i s’pose you gentlemen wouldn’t care for a cup o’ cocoa she ses turning to them  ginger dick and peter both said that they liked it better than anything else and arter she ’ad got out the cups and saucers and a tin o’ cocoa ginger held the kettle and poured the water in the cups while she stirred them and old sam sat looking on ’elpless  it does seem funny to see you drinking cocoa captin ses ginger as old sam took his cup  ho ses sam firing up and why if i might make so bold as to ask  ’cos i’ve generally seen you drinking something out of a bottle ses ginger  now look ’ere ses sam starting up and spilling some of the hot cocoa over ’is lap  a gingerbeer bottle ses peter russet making faces at ginger to keep quiet  yes o’ course that’s wot i meant ses ginger  old sam wiped the cocoa off ’is knees without saying a word but his weskit kept going up and down till peter russet felt quite sorry for ’im  there’s nothing like it he ses to mrs finch it was by sticking to gingerbeer and milk and suchlike that captain small ’ad command of a ship afore ’e was twentyfive  lor’ ses mrs finch  she smiled at old sam till peter got uneasy agin and began to think p’r’aps ’e’d been praising ’im too much  of course i’m speaking of long ago now he ses  years and years afore you was born ma’am ses ginger  old sam was going to say something but mrs finch looked so pleased that ’e thought better of it some o’ the cocoa ’e was drinking went the wrong way and then ginger patted ’im on the back and told ’im to be careful not to bring on ’is brownchitis agin wot with temper and being afraid to speak for fear they should let mrs finch know that ’e wasn’t a captin he could ’ardly bear ’imself but he very near broke out when peter russet advised ’im to ’ave his weskit lined with red flannel they all stayed on till closing time and by the time they left they ’ad made theirselves so pleasant that mrs finch said she’d be pleased to see them any time they liked to look in  sam small waited till they ’ad turned the corner and then he broke out so alarming that they could ’ardly do anything with ’im twice policemen spoke to ’im and advised ’im to go home afore they altered their minds and he ’ad to hold ’imself in and keep quiet while ginger and peter russet took ’is arms and said they were seeing him ’ome  he started the row agin when they got indoors and sat up in ’is bed smacking ’is lips over the things he’d like to ’ave done to them if he could and then arter saying ’ow he’d like to see ginger boiled alive like a lobster he said he knew that ’e was a noble’arted feller who wouldn’t try and cut an old pal out and that it was a case of love at first sight on top of a tramcar  she’s too young for you ses ginger and too goodlooking besides  it’s the nice little bisness he’s fallen in love with ginger ses peter russet i’ll toss you who ’as it  ginger who was siting on the foot o’ sam’s bed said no at fust but arter a time he pulled out arf a dollar and spun it in the air  that was the last ’e see of it although he ’ad sam out o’ bed and all the clothes stripped off of it twice he spent over arf an hour on his ’ands and knees looking for it and sam said when he was tired of playing bears p’r’aps he’d go to bed and get to sleep like a christian  they ’ad it all over agin next morning and at last as nobody would agree to keep quiet and let the others ’ave a fair chance they made up their minds to let the best man win ginger dick bought a necktie that took all the colour out o’ sam’s and peter russet went in for a collar so big that ’e was lost in it  they all strolled into the widow’s shop separate that night ginger dick ’ad smashed his pipe and wanted another peter russet wanted some tobacco and old sam small walked in smiling with a little silver brooch for ’er that he said ’e had picked up  it was a very nice brooch and mrs finch was so pleased with it that ginger and peter sat there as mad as they could be because they ’adn’t thought of the same thing  captain small is very lucky at finding things ses ginger at last  he’s got the name for it ses peter russet  it’s a handy ’abit ses ginger it saves spending money who did you give that gold bracelet to you picked up the other night captin he ses turning to sam  gold bracelet ses sam i didn’t pick up no gold bracelet wot are you talking about  all right captin no offence ses ginger holding up his ’and i dreamt i saw one on your mantelpiece i s’pose p’r’aps i oughtn’t to ha’ said anything about it  old sam looked as though he’d like to eat ’im especially as he noticed mrs finch listening and pretending not to oh that one he ses arter a bit o’ hard thinking oh i found out who it belonged to you wouldn’t believe ’ow pleased they was at getting it back agin  ginger dick coughed and began to think as ’ow old sam was sharper than he ’ad given ’im credit for but afore he could think of anything else to say mrs finch looked at old sam and began to talk about ’is ship and to say ’ow much she should like to see over it  i wish i could take you ses sam looking at the other two out o’ the corner of his eye but my ship’s over at dunkirk in france i’ve just run over to london for a week or two to look round  and mine’s there too ses peter russet speaking a’most afore old sam ’ad finished side by side they lay in the harbour  oh dear ses mrs finch folding her ’ands and shaking her ’cad i should like to go over a ship one arternoon i’d quite made up my mind to it knowing three captins  she smiled and looked at ginger and sam and peter looked at ’im too wondering whether he was going to berth his ship at dunkirk alongside o’ theirs  ah i wish i ’ad met you a fortnight ago ses ginger very sad i gave up my ship the high flyer then and i’m waiting for one my owners are ’aving built for me at newcastle they said the high flyer wasn’t big enough for me she was a nice little ship though i believe i’ve got ’er picture somewhere about me  he felt in ’is pocket and pulled out a little crumpledup photograph of a ship he’d been fireman aboard of some years afore and showed it to ’er  that’s me standing on the bridge he ses pointing out a little dot with the stem of ’is pipe  it’s your figger ses mrs finch straining her eyes i should know it anywhere  you’ve got wonderful eyes ma’am ses old sam choking with ’is pipe  anybody can see that ses ginger they’re the largest and the bluest i’ve ever seen  mrs finch told ’im not to talk nonsense but both sam and peter russet could see ’ow pleased she was  truth is truth ses ginger i’m a plain man and i speak my mind  blue is my fav’rit’ colour ses old sam in a tender voice true blue  peter russet began to feel out of it i thought brown was he ses  ho ses sam turning on ’im and why  i ’ad my reasons ses peter nodding and shutting ’is mouth very firm  i thought brown was ’is fav’rit colour too ses ginger i don’t know why it’s no use asking me because if you did i couldn’t tell you  brown’s a very nice colour ses mrs finch wondering wot was the matter with old sam  blue ses ginger big blue eyes—they’re the ones for me other people may ’ave their blacks and their browns he ses looking at sam and peter russet but give me blue  they went on like that all the evening and every time the shopbell went and the widow ’ad to go out to serve a customer they said in w’ispers wot they thought of each other and once when she came back rather sudden ginger ’ad to explain to ’er that ’e was showing peter russet a scratch on his knuckle  ginger dick was the fust there next night and took ’er a little chiney teapot he ’ad picked up dirt cheap because it was cracked right acrost the middle but as he explained that he ’ad dropped it in hurrying to see ’er she was just as pleased she stuck it up on the mantelpiece and the things she said about ginger’s kindness and generosity made peter russet spend good money that he wanted for ’imself on a painted flowerpot next evening  with three men all courting ’er at the same time mrs finch had ’er hands full but she took to it wonderful considering she was so nice and kind to ’em all that even arter a week’s ’ard work none of ’em was really certain which she liked best  they took to going in at odd times o’ the day for tobacco and suchlike they used to go alone then but they all met and did the polite to each other there of an evening and then quarrelled all the way ’ome  then all of a sudden without any warning ginger dick and peter russet left off going there the fust evening sam sat expecting them every minute and was so surprised that he couldn’t take any advantage of it but on the second beginning by squeezing mrs finch’s ’and at ha’past seven he ’ad got best part of his arm round ’er waist by a quarter to ten he didn’t do more that night because she told him to be’ave ’imself and threatened to scream if he didn’t leave off  he was arfway home afore ’e thought of the reason for ginger dick and peter russet giving up and then he went along smiling to ’imself to such an extent that people thought ’e was mad he went off to sleep with the smile still on ’is lips and when peter and ginger came in soon arter closing time and ’e woke up and asked them where they’d been ’e was still smiling  i didn’t ’ave the pleasure o’ seeing you at mrs finch’s tonight he ses  no ses ginger very short we got tired of it  so un’ealthy sitting in that stuffy little room every evening ses peter  old sam put his ’ead under the bedclothes and laughed till the bed shook and every now and then he’d put his ’ead out and look at peter and ginger and laugh agin till he choked  i see ’ow it is he ses sitting up and wiping his eyes on the sheet well we cant all win  wot d’ye mean ses ginger very disagreeable  she wouldn’t ’ave you sam thats wot i mean and i don’t wonder at it i wouldn’t ’ave you if i was a gal  you’re dreaming ses peter russet sneering at ’im  that flowerpot o’ yours’ll come in handy ses sam thinking ’ow he ’ad put ’is arm round the widow’s waist and i thank you kindly for the teapot ginger  you don’t mean to say as you’ve asked ’er to marry you ses ginger looking at peter russet  not quite but i’m going to ses sam and i’ll bet you even arfcrowns she ses ’yes’  ginger wouldn’t take ’im and no more would peter not even when he raised it to five shillings and the vain way old sam lay there boasting and talking about ’is way with the gals made ’em both feel ill  i wouldn’t ’ave her if she asked me on ’er bended knees ses ginger holding up his ’ead  nor me ses peter you’re welcome to ’er sam when i think of the evenings i’ve wasted over a fat old woman i feel——  that’ll do ses old sam very sharp that ain’t the way to speak of a lady even if she ’as said ’no’  all right sam ses ginger you go in and win if you think you’re so precious clever  old sam said that that was wot ’e was going to do and he spent so much time next morning making ’imself look pretty that the other two could ’ardly be civil to him  he went off a’most direckly arter breakfast and they didn’t see ’im agin till twelve o’clock that night he ’ad brought a bottle o’ whisky in with ’im and he was so ’appy that they see plain wot had ’appened  she said ’yes’ at two o’clock in the arternoon ses old sam smiling arter they had ’ad a glass apiece i’d nearly done the trick at one o’clock and then the shopbell went and i ’ad to begin all over agin still it wasn’t unpleasant  do you mean to tell us you’ve asked ’er to marry you ses ginger ’olding out ’is glass to be filled agin  i do ses sam but i ’ope there’s no illfeeling you never ’ad a chance neither of you she told me so  ginger dick and peter russet stared at each other  she said she ’ad been in love with me all along ses sam filling their glasses agin to cheer ’em up we went out arter tea and bought the engagementring and then she got somebody to mind the shop and we went to the pagoda music’all  i ’ope you didn’t pay much for the ring sam ses ginger who always got very kind’arted arter two or three glasses o’ whisky if i’d known you was going to be in such a hurry i might ha’ told you before  we ought to ha’ done ses peter shaking his ’ead  told me ses sam staring at ’em told me wot  why me and peter gave it up ses ginger but o’ course p’r’aps you don’t mind  mind wot ses sam  it’s wonderful ’ow quiet she kept it ses peter  old sam stared at ’em agin and then he asked ’em to speak in plain english wot they’d got to say and not to go taking away the character of a woman wot wasn’t there to speak up for herself  it’s nothing agin ’er character ses ginger it’s a credit to her looked at properly ses peter russet  and sam’ll ’ave the pleasure of bringing of ’em up ses ginger  bringing of ’em up ses sam in a trembling voice and turning pale bringing who up  why ’er children ses ginger didn’t she tell you she’s got nine of ’em  sam pretended not to believe ’em at fust and said they was jealous but next day he crept down to the greengrocer’s shop in the same street where ginger had ’appened to buy some oranges one day and found that it was only too true nine children the eldest of ’em only fifteen was staying with diff’rent relations owing to scarletfever next door  old sam crept back ’ome like a man in a dream with a bag of oranges he didn’t want and arter making a present of the engagementring to ginger—if ’e could get it—he took the fust train to tilbury and signed on for a v’y’ge to china     the boatswain’s mate     mr george benn retired boatswain sighed noisily and with a despondent gesture turned to the door and stood with the handle in his hand mrs waters sitting behind the tiny bar in a tall windsorchair eyed him with some heat  my feelings’ll never change said the boatswain  nor mine either said the landlady sharply it’s a strange thing mr benn but you always ask me to marry you after the third mug  it’s only to get my courage up pleaded the boatswain next time i’ll do it afore i ’ave a drop that’ll prove to you i’m in earnest  he stepped outside and closed the door before the landlady could make a selection from the many retorts that crowded to her lips  after the cool bar with its smell of damp sawdust the road seemed hot and dusty but the boatswain a prey to gloom natural to a man whose hand has been refused five times in a fortnight walked on unheeding his steps lagged but his brain was active  he walked for two miles deep in thought and then coming to a shady bank took a seat upon an inviting piece of turf and lit his pipe the heat and the drowsy hum of bees made him nod his pipe hung from the corner of his mouth and his eyes closed  he opened them at the sound of approaching footsteps and feeling in his pocket for matches gazed lazily at the intruder he saw a tall man carrying a small bundle over his shoulder and in the erect carriage the keen eyes and bronzed face had little difficulty in detecting the old soldier  the stranger stopped as he reached the seated boatswain and eyed him pleasantly  got a pipe o’ baccy mate he inquired  the boatswain handed him the small metal box in which he kept that luxury  lobster ain’t you he said affably  the tall man nodded was he replied now i’m my own commanderinchief  padding it suggested the boatswain taking the box from him and refilling his pipe  the other nodded and with the air of one disposed to conversation dropped his bundle in the ditch and took a seat beside him i’ve got plenty of time he remarked  mr benn nodded and for a while smoked on in silence a dim idea which had been in his mind for some time began to clarify he stole a glance at his companion—a man of about thirtyeight clear eyes with humorous wrinkles at the corners a heavy moustache and a cheerful expression more than tinged with recklessness  ain’t over and above fond o’ work suggested the boatswain when he had finished his inspection  i love it said the other blowing a cloud of smoke in the air but we can’t have all we want in this world it wouldn’t be good for us  the boatswain thought of mrs waters and sighed then he rattled his pocket  would arf a quid be any good to you he inquired  look here began the soldier just because i asked you for a pipe o’ baccy—  no offence said the other quickly i mean if you earned it  the soldier nodded and took his pipe from his mouth gardening and windows he hazarded with a shrug of his shoulders  the boatswain shook his head  scrubbing p’r’aps said the soldier with a sigh of resignation last house i scrubbed out i did it so thoroughly they accused me of pouching the soap hang ’em  and you didn’t queried the boatswain eyeing him keenly  the soldier rose and knocking the ashes out of his pipe gazed at him darkly i can’t give it back to you he said slowly because i’ve smoked some of it and i can’t pay you for it because i’ve only got twopence and that i want for myself so long matey and next time a poor wretch asks you for a pipe be civil  i never see such a man for taking offence in all my born days expostulated the boatswain i ’ad my reasons for that remark mate good reasons they was  the soldier grunted and stooping picked up his bundle  i spoke of arf a sovereign just now continued the boatswain impressively and when i tell you that i offer it to you to do a bit o’ burgling you’ll see ’ow necessary it is for me to be certain of your honesty  burgling gasped the astonished soldier honesty ’struth are you drunk or am i  meaning said the boatswain waving the imputation away with his hand for you to pretend to be a burglar  we’re both drunk that’s what it is said the other resignedly  the boatswain fidgeted if you don’t agree mum’s the word and no ’arm done he said holding out his hand  mum’s the word said the soldier taking it my name’s ned travers and barring cells for a spree now and again there’s nothing against it mind that  might ’appen to anybody said mr benn soothingly you fill your pipe and don’t go chucking good tobacco away agin  mr travers took the offered box and with economy born of adversity stooped and filled up first with the plug he had thrown away then he resumed his seat and leaning back luxuriously bade the other fire away  i ain’t got it all shipshape and proper yet said mr benn slowly but it’s in my mind’s eye it’s been there off and on like for some time  he lit his pipe again and gazed fixedly at the opposite hedge two miles from here where i live he said after several vigorous puffs there’s a little public’ouse called the beehive kept by a lady wot i’ve got my eye on  the soldier sat up  she won’t ’ave me said the boatswain with an air of mild surprise  the soldier leaned back again  she’s a lone widder continued mr benn shaking his head and the beehive is in a lonely place it’s right through the village and the nearest house is arf a mile off  silly place for a pub commented mr travers  i’ve been telling her ’ow unsafe it is said the boatswain i’ve been telling her that she wants a man to protect her and she only laughs at me she don’t believe it d’ye see likewise i’m a small man—small but stiff she likes tall men  most women do said mr travers sitting upright and instinctively twisting his moustache when i was in the ranks—  my idea is continued the boatswain slightly raising his voice to kill two birds with one stone—prove to her that she does want being protected and that i’m the man to protect her d’ye take my meaning mate  the soldier reached out a hand and felt the other’s biceps like a lump o’ wood he said approvingly  my opinion is said the boatswain with a faint smirk that she loves me without knowing it  they often do said mr travers with a grave shake of his head  consequently i don’t want ’er to be disappointed said the other  it does you credit remarked mr travers  i’ve got a good head said mr benn else i shouldn’t ’ave got my rating as boatswain as soon as i did and i’ve been turning it over in my mind over and over agin till my brainpan fair aches with it now if you do what i want you to tonight and it comes off all right damme i’ll make it a quid  go on vanderbilt said mr travers i’m listening  the boatswain gazed at him fixedly you meet me ’ere in this spot at eleven o’clock tonight he said solemnly and i’ll take you to her ’ouse and put you through a little winder i know of you goes upstairs and alarms her and she screams for help i’m watching the house faithfullike and hear ’er scream i dashes in at the winder knocks you down and rescues her d’ye see  i hear corrected mr travers coldly  she clings to me continued the boatswain with a rapt expression of face in her gratitood and proud of my strength and pluck she marries me  an’ i get a five years’ honeymoon said the soldier  the boatswain shook his head and patted the other’s shoulder in the excitement of the moment you spring up and escape he said with a kindly smile i’ve thought it all out you can run much faster than i can anyways you will the nearest ’ouse is arf a mile off as i said and her servant is staying till tomorrow at ’er mother’s ten miles away  mr travers rose to his feet and stretched himself time i was toddling he said with a yawn thanks for amusing me mate  you won’t do it said the boatswain eyeing him with much concern  i’m hanged if i do said the soldier emphatically accidents will happen and then where should i be  if they did said the boatswain i’d own up and clear you  you might said mr travers and then again you mightn’t so long mate  i—i’ll make it two quid said the boatswain trembling with eagerness i’ve took a fancy to you you’re just the man for the job  the soldier adjusting his bundle glanced at him over his shoulder thankee he said with mock gratitude  look ’ere said the boatswain springing up and catching him by the sleeve i’ll give it to you in writing come you ain’t fainthearted why a bluejacket ’ud do it for the fun o’ the thing if i give it to you in writing and there should be an accident it’s worse for me than it is for you ain’t it  mr travers hesitated and pushing his cap back scratched his head  i gives you the two quid afore you go into the house continued the boatswain hastily following up the impression he had made i’d give ’em to you now if i’d got ’em with me that’s my confidence in you i likes the look of you soldier or sailor when there is a man’s work to be done give ’em to me afore anybody  the soldier seated himself again and let his bundle fall to the ground go on he said slowly write it out fair and square and sign it and i’m your man  the boatswain clapped him on the shoulder and produced a bundle of papers from his pocket there’s letters there with my name and address on ’em he said it’s all fair square and aboveboard when you’ve cast your eyes over them i’ll give you the writing  mr travers took them and relighting his pipe smoked in silence with various side glances at his companion as that enthusiast sucked his pencil and sat twisting in the agonies of composition the document finished—after several failures had been retrieved and burnt by the careful mr travers—the boatswain heaved a sigh of relief and handing it over to him leaned back with a complacent air while he read it  seems all right said the soldier folding it up and putting it in his waistcoatpocket i’ll be here at eleven tonight  eleven it is said the boatswain briskly and between pals—here’s arf a dollar to go on with  he patted him on the shoulder again and with a caution to keep out of sight as much as possible till night walked slowly home his step was light but he carried a face in which care and exultation were strangely mingled  by ten o’clock that night care was in the ascendant and by eleven when he discerned the red glow of mr travers’s pipe set as a beacon against a dark background of hedge the boatswain was ready to curse his inventive powers mr travers greeted him cheerily and honestly attributing the fact to good food and a couple of pints of beer he had had since the boatswain left him said that he was ready for anything  mr benn grunted and led the way in silence there was no moon but the night was clear and mr travers after one or two lighthearted attempts at conversation abandoned the effort and fell to whistling softly instead  except for one lighted window the village slept in darkness but the boatswain who had been walking with the stealth of a red indian on the warpath breathed more freely after they had left it behind a renewal of his antics a little farther on apprised mr travers that they were approaching their destination and a minute or two later they came to a small inn standing just off the road all shut up and mrs waters abed bless her whispered the boatswain after walking carefully round the house how do you feel  i’m all right said mr travers i feel as if i’d been burgling all my life how do you feel  narvous said mr benn pausing under a small window at the rear of the house this is the one  mr travers stepped back a few paces and gazed up at the house all was still for a few moments he stood listening and then rejoined the boatswain  goodbye mate he said hoisting himself on to the sill death or victory  the boatswain whispered and thrust a couple of sovereigns into his hand take your time there’s no hurry he muttered i want to pull myself together frighten ’er enough but not too much when she screams i’ll come in  mr travers slipped inside and then thrust his head out of the window won’t she think it funny you should be so handy he inquired  no it’s my faithful ’art said the boatswain keeping watch over her every night that’s the ticket she won’t know no better  mr travers grinned and removing his boots passed them out to the other we don’t want her to hear me till i’m upstairs he whispered put ’em outside handy for me to pick up  the boatswain obeyed and mr travers—who was by no means a good hand at darning socks—shivered as he trod lightly over a stone floor then following the instructions of mr benn he made his way to the stairs and mounted noiselessly  but for a slight stumble halfway up his progress was very creditable for an amateur he paused and listened and all being silent made his way to the landing and stopped outside a door despite himself his heart was beating faster than usual  he pushed the door open slowly and started as it creaked nothing happening he pushed again and standing just inside saw by a small ewer silhouetted against the casement that he was in a bedroom he listened for the sound of breathing but in vain  quiet sleeper he reflected or perhaps it is an empty room now i wonder whether—  the sound of an opening door made him start violently and he stood still scarcely breathing with his ears on the alert a light shone on the landing and peeping round the door he saw a woman coming along the corridor—a younger and betterlooking woman than he had expected to see in one hand she held aloft a candle in the other she bore a doublebarrelled gun mr travers withdrew into the room and as the light came nearer slipped into a big cupboard by the side of the fireplace and standing bolt upright waited the light came into the room  must have been my fancy said a pleasant voice  bless her smiled mr travers  his trained ear recognized the sound of cocking triggers the next moment a heavy body bumped against the door of the cupboard and the key turned in the lock  got you said the voice triumphantly keep still if you try and break out i shall shoot you  all right said mr travers hastily i won’t move  better not said the voice mind i’ve got a gun pointing straight at you  point it downwards there’s a good girl said mr travers earnestly and take your finger off the trigger if anything happened to me you’d never forgive yourself  it’s all right so long as you don’t move said the voice and i’m not a girl it added sternly  yes you are said the prisoner i saw you i thought it was an angel at first i saw your little bare feet and—  a faint scream interrupted him  you’ll catch cold urged mr travers  don’t you trouble about me said the voice tartly  i won’t give any trouble said mr travers who began to think it was time for the boatswain to appear on the scene why don’t you call for help i’ll go like a lamb  i don’t want your advice was the reply i know what to do now don’t you try and break out i’m going to fire one barrel out of the window but i’ve got the other one for you if you move  my dear girl protested the horrified mr travers you’ll alarm the neighbourhood  just what i want to do said the voice keep still mind  mr travers hesitated the game was up and it was clear that in any case the stratagem of the ingenious mr benn would have to be disclosed  stop he said earnestly don’t do anything rash i’m not a burglar i’m doing this for a friend of yours—mr benn  what said an amazed voice  true as i stand here asseverated mr travers here here’s my instructions i’ll put ’em under the door and if you go to the back window you’ll see him in the garden waiting  he rustled the paper under the door and it was at once snatched from his fingers he regained an upright position and stood listening to the startled and indignant exclamations of his gaoler as she read the boatswain’s permit          this is to give notice that i george benn being of         sound mind and body have told ned travers to pretend to         be a burglar at mrs waters’s  he ain’t a burglar and         i shall be outside all the time it’s all aboveboard         and shipshape          signed george benn      sound mind—aboveboard—shipshape repeated a dazed voice     where is he  out at the back replied mr travers if you go to the window you can see him now do put something round your shoulders there’s a good girl  there was no reply but a board creaked he waited for what seemed a long time and then the board creaked again  did you see him he inquired  i did was the sharp reply you both ought to be ashamed of yourselves you ought to be punished  there is a clothespeg sticking into the back of my head remarked mr travers what are you going to do  there was no reply  what are you going to do repeated mr travers somewhat uneasily you look too nice to do anything hard leastways so far as i can judge through this crack  there was a smothered exclamation and then sounds of somebody moving hastily about the room and the swish of clothing hastily donned  you ought to have done it before commented the thoughtful mr travers it’s enough to give you your death of cold  mind your business said the voice sharply now if i let you out will you promise to do exactly as i tell you  honour bright said mr travers fervently  i’m going to give mr benn a lesson he won’t forget proceeded the other grimly i’m going to fire off this gun and then run down and tell him i’ve killed you  eh said the amazed mr travers oh lord  h’sh stop that laughing commanded the voice he’ll hear you be quiet  the key turned in the lock and mr travers stepping forth clapped his hand over his mouth and endeavoured to obey mrs waters stepping back with the gun ready scrutinized him closely  come on to the landing said mr travers eagerly we don’t want anybody else to hear fire into this  he snatched a patchwork rug from the floor and stuck it up against the balusters you stay here said mrs waters he nodded  she pointed the gun at the hearthrug the walls shook with the explosion and with a shriek that set mr travers’s teeth on edge she rushed downstairs and drawing back the bolts of the back door tottered outside and into the arms of the agitated boatswain  oh oh oh she cried  what—what’s the matter gasped the boatswain  the widow struggled in his arms a burglar she said in a tense whisper but it’s all right i’ve killed him  kill— stuttered the other kill——killed him  mrs waters nodded and released herself first shot she said with a satisfied air  the boatswain wrung his hands good heavens he said moving slowly towards the door poor fellow  come back said the widow tugging at his coat  i was—was going to see—whether i could do anything for ’im quavered the boatswain poor fellow  you stay where you are commanded mrs waters i don’t want any witnesses i don’t want this house to have a bad name i’m going to keep it quiet  quiet said the shaking boatswain how  first thing to do said the widow thoughtfully is to get rid of the body i’ll bury him in the garden i think there’s a very good bit of ground behind those potatoes you’ll find the spade in the toolhouse  the horrified mr benn stood stockstill regarding her  while you’re digging the grave continued mrs ’waters calmly i’ll go in and clean up the mess  the boatswain reeled and then fumbled with trembling fingers at his collar  like a man in a dream he stood watching as she ran to the toolhouse and returned with a spade and pick like a man in a dream he followed her on to the garden  be careful she said sharply you’re treading down my potatoes  the boatswain stopped dead and stared at her apparently unconscious of his gaze she began to pace out the measurements and then placing the tools in his hands urged him to lose no time  i’ll bring him down when you’re gone she said looking towards the house  the boatswain wiped his damp brow with the back of his hand how are you going to get it downstairs he breathed  drag it said mrs waters briefly  suppose he isn’t dead said the boatswain with a gleam of hope  fiddlesticks said mrs waters do you think i don’t know now don’t waste time talking and mind you dig it deep i’ll put a few cabbages on top afterwards—i’ve got more than i want  she reentered the house and ran lightly upstairs the candle was still alight and the gun was leaning against the bedpost but the visitor had disappeared conscious of an odd feeling of disappointment she looked round the empty room  come and look at him entreated a voice and she turned and beheld the amused countenance of her late prisoner at the door  i’ve been watching from the back window he said nodding you’re a wonder that’s what you are come and look at him  mrs waters followed and leaning out of the window watched with simple pleasure the efforts of the amateur sexton mr benn was digging like one possessed only pausing at intervals to straighten his back and to cast a fearsome glance around him the only thing that marred her pleasure was the behaviour of mr travers who was struggling for a place with all the fervour of a citizen at the lord mayor’s show  get back she said in a fierce whisper he’ll see you  mr travers with obvious reluctance obeyed just as the victim looked up  is that you mrs waters inquired the boatswain fearfully  yes of course it is snapped the widow who else should it be do you think go on what are you stopping for  mr benn’s breathing as he bent to his task again was distinctly audible the head of mr travers ranged itself once more alongside the widow’s for a long time they watched in silence  won’t you come down here mrs waters called the boatswain looking up so suddenly that mr travers’s head bumped painfully against the side of the window it’s a bit creepy all alone  i’m all right said mrs waters  i keep fancying there’s something dodging behind them currant bushes pursued the unfortunate mr benn hoarsely how you can stay there alone i can’t think i thought i saw something looking over your shoulder just now fancy if it came creeping up behind and caught hold of you the widow gave a sudden faint scream  if you do that again she said turning fiercely on mr travers  he put it into my head said the culprit humbly i should never have thought of such a thing by myself i’m one of the quietest and bestbehaved——  make haste mr benn said the widow turning to the window again i’ve got a lot to do when you’ve finished  the boatswain groaned and fell to digging again and mrs waters after watching a little while longer gave mr travers some pointed instructions about the window and went down to the garden again  that will do i think she said stepping into the hole and regarding it critically now you’d better go straight off home and mind not a word to a soul about this  she put her hand on his shoulder and noticing with pleasure that he shuddered at her touch led the way to the gate the boatswain paused for a moment as though about to speak and then apparently thinking better of it bade her goodbye in a hoarse voice and walked feebly up the road mrs waters stood watching until his steps died away in the distance and then returning to the garden took up the spade and stood regarding with some dismay the mountainous result of his industry mr travers who was standing just inside the back door joined her  let me he said gallantly  the day was breaking as he finished his task the clean sweet air and the exercise had given him an appetite to which the smell of cooking bacon and hot coffee that proceeded from the house had set a sharper edge he took his coat from a bush and put it on mrs waters appeared at the door  you had better come in and have some breakfast before you go she said brusquely there’s no more sleep for me now  mr travers obeyed with alacrity and after a satisfying wash in the scullery came into the big kitchen with his face shining and took a seat at the table the cloth was neatly laid and mrs waters fresh and cool with a smile upon her pleasant face sat behind the tray she looked at her guest curiously mr travers’s spirits being somewhat higher than the state of his wardrobe appeared to justify  why don’t you get some settled work she inquired with gentle severity as he imparted snatches of his history between bites  easier said than done said mr travers serenely but don’t you run away with the idea that i’m a beggar because i’m not i pay my way such as it is and bythebye i s’pose i haven’t earned that two pounds benn gave me  his face lengthened and he felt uneasily in his pocket  i’ll give them to him when i’m tired of the joke said the widow holding out her hand and watching him closely  mr travers passed the coins over to her soft hand you’ve got he said musingly i don’t wonder benn was desperate i dare say i should have done the same in his place  mrs waters bit her lip and looked out at the window mr travers resumed his breakfast  there’s only one job that i’m really fit for now that i’m too old for the army he said confidentially as breakfast finished he stood at the door ready to depart  playing at burglars hazarded mrs waters  landlord of a little country publichouse said mr travers simply  mrs waters fell back and regarded him with openeyed amazement  good morning she said as soon as she could trust her voice  goodbye said mr travers reluctantly i should like to hear how old benn takes this joke though  mrs waters retreated into the house and stood regarding him if you’re passing this way again and like to look in—i’ll tell you she said after a long pause goodbye  i’ll look in in a week’s time said mr travers  he took the proffered hand and shook it warmly it would be the best joke of all he said turning away  what would  the soldier confronted her again  for old benn to come round here one evening and find me landlord think it over  mrs waters met his gaze soberly i’ll think it over when you have gone she said softly now go     the nest egg     artfulness said the nightwatchman smoking placidly is a gift but it don’t pay always i’ve met some artful ones in my time—plenty of ’em but i can’t truthfully say as ’ow any of them was the better for meeting me  he rose slowly from the packingcase on which he had been sitting and stamping down the point of a rusty nail with his heel resumed his seat remarking that he had endured it for some time under the impression that it was only a splinter  i’ve surprised more than one in my time he continued slowly when i met one of these ’ere artful ones i used fust of all to pretend to be more stupid than wot i really am  he stopped and stared fixedly  more stupid than i looked he said he stopped again  more stupid than wot they thought i looked he said speaking with marked deliberation and i’d let ’em go on and on until i thought i had ’ad about enough and then turn round on ’em nobody ever got the better o’ me except my wife and that was only before we was married two nights arterwards she found a fishhook in my trouserpocket and arter that i could ha’ left untold gold there—if i’d ha’ had it it spoilt wot some people call the honeymoon but it paid in the long run  one o’ the worst things a man can do is to take up artfulness all of a sudden i never knew it to answer yet and i can tell you of a case that’ll prove my words true  it’s some years ago now and the chap it ’appened to was a young man a shipmate o’ mine named charlie tagg very steady young chap he was too steady for most of ’em that’s ’ow it was me and ’im got to be such pals  he’d been saving up for years to get married and all the advice we could give ’im didn’t ’ave any effect he saved up nearly every penny of ’is money and gave it to his gal to keep for ’im and the time i’m speaking of she’d got seventytwo pounds of ’is and seventeenandsix of ’er own to set up housekeeping with  then a thing happened that i’ve known to ’appen to sailormen afore at sydney ’e got silly on another gal and started walking out with her and afore he knew wot he was about he’d promised to marry ’er too  sydney and london being a long way from each other was in ’is favour but the thing that troubled ’im was ’ow to get that seventytwo pounds out of emma cook ’is london gal so as he could marry the other with it it worried ’im all the way home and by the time we got into the london river ’is head was all in a maze with it emma cook ’ad got it all saved up in the bank to take a little shop with when they got spliced and ’ow to get it he could not think  he went straight off to poplar where she lived as soon as the ship was berthed he walked all the way so as to ’ave more time for thinking but wot with bumping into two old gentlemen with bad tempers and being nearly run over by a cabman with a white ’orse and red whiskers he got to the house without ’aving thought of anything  they was just finishing their tea as ’e got there and they all seemed so pleased to see ’im that it made it worse than ever for ’im mrs cook who ’ad pretty near finished gave ’im her own cup to drink out of and said that she ’ad dreamt of ’im the night afore last and old cook said that he ’ad got so goodlooking ’e shouldn’t ’ave known him  i should ’ave passed ’im in the street he ses i never see such an alteration  they’ll be a nicelooking couple ses his wife looking at a young chap named george smith that ’ad been sitting next to emma  charlie tagg filled ’is mouth with bread and butter and wondered ’ow he was to begin he squeezed emma’s ’and just for the sake of keeping up appearances and all the time ’e was thinking of the other gal waiting for ’im thousands o’ miles away  you’ve come ’ome just in the nick o’ time ses old cook if you’d done it o’ purpose you couldn’t ’ave arranged it better  somebody’s birthday ses charlie trying to smile  old cook shook his ’ead though mine is next wednesday he ses and thank you for thinking of it no you’re just in time for the biggest bargain in the chandlery line that anybody ever ’ad a chance of if you ’adn’t ha’ come back we should have ’ad to ha’ done it without you  eighty pounds ses mrs cook smiling at charlie with the money emma’s got saved and your wages this trip you’ll ’ave plenty you must come round arter tea and ’ave a look at it  little place not arf a mile from ’ere ses old cook properly worked up the way emma’ll do it it’ll be a little fortune i wish i’d had a chance like it in my young time  he sat shaking his ’ead to think wot he’d lost and charlie tagg sat staring at ’im and wondering wot he was to do  my idea is for charlie to go for a few more v’y’ges arter they’re married while emma works up the business ses mrs cook she’ll be all right with young bill and sarah ann to ’elp her and keep ’er company while he’s away  we’ll see as she ain’t lonely ses george smith turning to charlie  charlie tagg gave a bit of a cough and said it wanted considering he said it was no good doing things in a ’urry and then repenting of ’em all the rest of your life and ’e said he’d been given to understand that chandlery wasn’t wot it ’ad been and some of the cleverest people ’e knew thought that it would be worse before it was better by the time he’d finished they was all looking at ’im as though they couldn’t believe their ears  you just step round and ’ave a look at the place ses old cook if that don’t make you alter your tune call me a sinner  charlie tagg felt as though ’e could ha’ called ’im a lot o’ worse things than that but he took up ’is hat and mrs cook and emma got their bonnets on and they went round  i don’t think much of it for eighty pounds ses charlie beginning his artfulness as they came near a big shop with plateglass and a double front  eh ses old cook staring at ’im why that ain’t the place why you wouldn’t get that for eight ’undred  well i don’t think much of it ses charlie if it’s worse than that i can’t look at it—i can’t indeed  you ain’t been drinking charlie ses old cook in a puzzled voice  certainly not ses charlie  he was pleased to see ’ow anxious they all looked and when they did come to the shop ’e set up a laugh that old cook said chilled the marrer in ’is bones he stood looking in a ’elpless sort o’ way at his wife and emma and then at last he ses there it is and a fair bargain at the price  i s’pose you ain’t been drinking ses charlie  wot’s the matter with it ses mrs cook flaring up  come inside and look at it ses emma taking ’old of his arm  not me ses charlie hanging back why i wouldn’t take it at a gift  he stood there on the kerbstone and all they could do ’e wouldn’t budge he said it was a bad road and a little shop and ’ad got a look about it he didn’t like they walked back ’ome like a funeral procession and emma ’ad to keep saying h’s in w’ispers to ’er mother all the way  i don’t know wot charlie does want i’m sure ses mrs cook taking off ’er bonnet as soon as she got indoors and pitching it on the chair he was just going to set down on  it’s so awk’ard ses old cook rubbing his ’cad fact is charlie we pretty near gave ’em to understand as we’d buy it  it’s as good as settled ses mrs cook trembling all over with temper  they won’t settle till they get the money ses charlie you may make your mind easy about that  emma’s drawn it all out of the bank ready ses old cook eager like  charlie felt ’ot and cold all over i’d better take care of it he ses in a trembling voice you might be robbed  so might you be ses mrs cook don’t you worry it’s in a safe place  sailormen are always being robbed ses george smith who ’ad been helping young bill with ’is sums while they ’ad gone to look at the shop there’s more sailormen robbed than all the rest put together  they won’t rob charlie ses mrs cook pressing ’er lips together i’ll take care o’ that  charlie tried to laugh but ’e made such a queer noise that young bill made a large blot on ’is exercisebook and old cook wot was lighting his pipe burnt ’is fingers through not looking wot ’e was doing  you see ses charlie if i was robbed which ain’t at all likely it ’ud only be me losing my own money but if you was robbed of it you’d never forgive yourselves  i dessay i should get over it ses mrs cook sniffing i’d ’ave a try at all events  charlie started to laugh agin and old cook who had struck another match blew it out and waited till he’d finished  the whole truth is ses charlie looking round i’ve got something better to do with the money i’ve got a chance offered me that’ll make me able to double it afore you know where you are  not afore i know where i am ses mrs cook with a laugh that was worse than charlie’s  the chance of a lifetime ses charlie trying to keep ’is temper i can’t tell you wot it is because i’ve promised to keep it secret for a time you’ll be surprised when i do tell you  if i wait till then till i’m surprised ses mrs cook i shall ’ave to wait a long time my advice to you is to take that shop and ha’ done with it  charlie sat there arguing all the evening but it was no good and the idea o’ them people sitting there and refusing to let ’im have his own money pretty near sent ’im crazy it was all ’e could do to kiss emma goodnight and ’e couldn’t have ’elped slamming the front door if he’d been paid for it the only comfort he ’ad got left was the sydney gal’s photygraph and he took that out and looked at it under nearly every lamppost he passed  he went round the next night and ’ad another try to get ’is money but it was no use and all the good he done was to make mrs cook in such a temper that she ’ad to go to bed before he ’ad arf finished it was no good talking to old cook and emma because they daren’t do anything without ’er and it was no good calling things up the stairs to her because she didn’t answer three nights running mrs cook went off to bed afore eight o’clock for fear she should say something to ’im as she’d be sorry for arterwards and for three nights charlie made ’imself so disagreeable that emma told ’im plain the sooner ’e went back to sea agin the better she should like it the only one who seemed to enjoy it was george smith and ’e used to bring bits out o’ newspapers and read to ’em showing ’ow silly people was done out of their money  on the fourth night charlie dropped it and made ’imself so amiable that mrs cook stayed up and made ’im a welsh rarebit for ’is supper and made ’im drink two glasses o’ beer instead o’ one while old cook sat and drank three glasses o’ water just out of temper and to show that ’e didn’t mind when she started on the chandler’s shop agin charlie said he’d think it over and when ’e went away mrs cook called ’im her sailorboy and wished ’im pleasant dreams  but charlie tagg ’ad got better things to do than to dream and ’e sat up in bed arf the night thinking out a new plan he’d thought of to get that money when ’e did fall asleep at last ’e dreamt of taking a little farm in australia and riding about on ’orseback with the sydney gal watching his men at work  in the morning he went and hunted up a shipmate of ’is a young feller named jack bates jack was one o’ these ’ere chaps nobody’s enemy but their own as the saying is a good’arted free’anded chap as you could wish to see everybody liked ’im and the ship’s cat loved ’im he’d ha’ sold the shirt off ’is back to oblige a pal and three times in one week he got ’is face scratched for trying to prevent ’usbands knocking their wives about  charlie tagg went to ’im because he was the only man ’e could trust and for over arf an hour he was telling jack bates all ’is troubles and at last as a great favour he let ’im see the sydney gal’s photygraph and told him that all that pore gal’s future ’appiness depended upon ’im  i’ll step round tonight and rob ’em of that seventytwo pounds ses jack it’s your money and you’ve a right to it  charlie shook his ’ead that wouldn’t do he ses besides i don’t know where they keep it no i’ve got a better plan than that come round to the crooked billet so as we can talk it over in peace and quiet  he stood jack three or four arfpints afore ’e told ’im his plan and jack was so pleased with it that he wanted to start at once but charlie persuaded ’im to wait  and don’t you spare me mind out o’ friendship ses charlie because the blacker you paint me the better i shall like it  you trust me mate ses jack bates if i don’t get that seventytwo pounds for you you may call me a dutchman why it’s fair robbery i call it sticking to your money like that  they spent the rest o’ the day together and when evening came charlie went off to the cooks’ emma ’ad arf expected they was going to a theayter that night but charlie said he wasn’t feeling the thing and he sat there so quiet and miserable they didn’t know wot to make of ’im  ’ave you got any trouble on your mind charlie ses mrs cook or is it the toothache  it ain’t the toothache ses charlie  he sat there pulling a long face and staring at the floor but all mrs cook and emma could do ’e wouldn’t tell them wot was the matter with ’im he said ’e didn’t want to worry other people with ’is troubles let everybody bear their own that was ’is motto even when george smith offered to go to the theayter with emma instead of ’im he didn’t fire up and if it ’adn’t ha’ been for mrs cook george wouldn’t ha’ been sorry that ’e spoke  theayters ain’t for me ses charlie with a groan i’m more likely to go to gaol so far as i can see than a theayter  mrs cook and emma both screamed and sarah ann did ’er first highstericks and very well too considering that she ’ad only just turned fifteen  gaol ses old cook as soon as they ’ad quieted sarah ann with a bowl o’ cold water that young bill ’ad the presence o’ mind to go and fetch gaol what for  you wouldn’t believe if i was to tell you ses charlie getting up to go and besides i don’t want any of you to think as ’ow i am worse than wot i am  he shook his ’cad at them sorrowfullike and afore they could stop ’im he ’ad gone old cook shouted arter ’im but it was no use and the others was running into the scullery to fill the bowl agin for emma  mrs cook went round to ’is lodgings next morning but found that ’e was out they began to fancy all sorts o’ things then but charlie turned up agin that evening more miserable than ever  i went round to see you this morning ses mrs cook but you wasn’t at ’ome  i never am ’ardly ses charlie i can’t be—it ain’t safe  why not ses mrs cook fidgeting  if i was to tell you you’d lose your good opinion of me ses charlie  it wouldn’t be much to lose ses mrs cook firing up  charlie didn’t answer ’er when he did speak he spoke to the old man and he was so down’arted that ’e gave ’im the chills a’most he ’ardly took any notice of emma and when mrs cook spoke about the shop agin said that chandlers’ shops was for happy people not for ’im  by the time they sat down to supper they was nearly all as miserable as charlie ’imself from words he let drop they all seemed to ’ave the idea that the police was arter ’im and mrs cook was just asking ’im for wot she called the third and last time but wot was more likely the hundred and third wot he’d done when there was a knock at the front door so loud and so sudden that old cook and young bill both cut their mouths at the same time  anybody ’ere o’ the name of emma cook ses a man’s voice when young bill opened the door  she’s inside ses the boy and the next moment jack bates followed ’im into the room and then fell back with a start as ’e saw charlie tagg  ho ’ere you are are you he ses looking at ’im very black wot’s the matter ses mrs cook very sharp  i didn’t expect to ’ave the pleasure o’ seeing you ’ere my lad ses jack still staring at charlie and twisting ’is face up into awful scowls which is emma cook  miss cook is my name ses emma very sharp wot d’ye want  very good ses jack bates looking at charlie agin then p’r’aps you’ll do me the kindness of telling that lie o’ yours agin afore this young lady  it’s the truth ses charlie looking down at ’is plate  if somebody

tonight i’m going to see the police about it  he sat down on a chair with ’is hat cocked over one eye and they all sat staring at ’im as though they didn’t know wot to say next  so this is wot you meant when you said you’d got the chance of a lifetime is it ses mrs cook to charlie this is wot you wanted it for is it wot did you borrow all that money for  spend ses charlie in a sulky voice  spend ses mrs cook with a scream wot in  drink and cards mostly ses jack bates remembering wot charlie ’ad told ’im about blackening ’is character  you might ha’ heard a pin drop a’most and charlie sat there without saying a word  charlie’s been led away ses mrs cook looking ’ard at jack bates i s’pose you lent ’im the money to win it back from ’im at cards didn’t you  and gave ’im too much licker fust ses old cook i’ve ’eard of your kind if charlie takes my advice ’e won’t pay you a farthing i should let you do your worst if i was ’im that’s wot i should do you’ve got a low face a nasty ugly low face  one o’ the worst i ever see ses mrs cook it looks as though it might ha’ been cut out o’ the police news  ’owever could you ha’ trusted a man with a face like that charlie ses old cook come away from ’im bill i don’t like such a chap in the room  jack bates began to feel very awk’ard they was all glaring at ’im as though they could eat ’im and he wasn’t used to such treatment and as a matter o’ fact he’d got a very good’arted face  you go out o’ that door ses old cook pointing to it go and do your worst you won’t get any money ’ere  stop a minute ses emma and afore they could stop ’er she ran upstairs mrs cook went arter ’er and ’igh words was heard up in the bedroom but byandby emma came down holding her head very ’igh and looking at jack bates as though he was dirt  how am i to know charlie owes you this money she ses  jack bates turned very red and arter fumbling in ’is pockets took out about a dozen dirty bits o’ paper which charlie ’ad given ’im for i o u’s emma read ’em all and then she threw a little parcel on the table  there’s your money she ses take it and go  mrs cook and ’er father began to call out but it was no good  there’s seventytwo pounds there ses emma who was very pale and ’ere’s a ring you can have to ’elp make up the rest and she drew charlie’s ring off and throwed it on the table i’ve done with ’im for good she ses with a look at ’er mother  jack bates took up the money and the ring and stood there looking at ’er and trying to think wot to say he’d always been uncommon partial to the sex and it did seem ’ard to stand there and take all that on account of charlie tagg  i only wanted my own he ses at last shuffling about the floor  well you’ve got it ses mrs cook and now you can go  you’re pi’soning the air of my front parlour ses old cook opening the winder a little at the top  p’r’aps i ain’t so bad as you think i am ses jack bates still looking at emma and with that ’e walked over to charlie and dumped down the money on the table in front of ’im take it he ses and don’t borrow any more i make you a free gift of it p’r’aps my ’art ain’t as black as my face he ses turning to mrs cook  they was all so surprised at fust that they couldn’t speak but old cook smiled at ’im and put the winder up agin and charlie tagg sat there arf mad with temper locking as though ’e could eat jack bates without any salt as the saying is  i—i can’t take it he ses at last with a stammer  can’t take it why not ses old cook staring this gentleman ’as given it to you a free gift ses mrs cook smiling at jack very sweet  i can’t take it ses charlie winking at jack to take the money up and give it to ’im quiet as arranged i ’ave my pride  so ’ave i ses jack are you going to take it  charlie gave another look no he ses i cant take a favour i borrowed the money and i’ll pay it back  very good ses jack taking it up it’s my money ain’t it  yes ses charlie taking no notice of mrs cook and ’er husband wot was both talking to ’im at once and trying to persuade ’im to alter his mind  then i give it to miss emma cook ses jack bates putting it into her hands goodnight everybody and good luck  he slammed the front door behind ’im and they ’eard ’im go off down the road as if ’e was going for fireengines charlie sat there for a moment struck all of a heap and then ’e jumped up and dashed arter ’im he just saw ’im disappearing round a corner and he didn’t see ’im agin for a couple o’ year arterwards by which time the sydney gal had ’ad three or four young men arter ’im and emma who ’ad changed her name to smith was doing one o’ the best businesses in the chandlery line in poplar     the constable’s move     mr bob grummit sat in the kitchen with his corduroyclad legs stretched on the fender his wife’s halfeaten dinner was getting cold on the table mr grummit who was badly in need of cheering up emptied her halfempty glass of beer and wiped his lips with the back of his hand  come away i tell you he called d’ye hear come away you’ll be locked up if you don’t  he gave a little laugh at the sarcasm and sticking his short pipe in his mouth lurched slowly to the frontroom door and scowled at his wife as she lurked at the back of the window watching intently the furniture which was being carried in next door  come away or else you’ll be locked up repeated mr grummit you mustn’t look at policemen’s furniture it’s agin the law  mrs grummit made no reply but throwing appearances to the winds stepped to the window until her nose touched as a walnut sideboard with bevelled glass back was tenderly borne inside under the personal supervision of policeconstable evans  they’ll be ’aving a pianner next said the indignant mr grummit peering from the depths of the room  they’ve got one responded his wife there’s the end if it stickin’ up in the van  mr grummit advanced and regarded the end fixedly did you throw all them tin cans and things into their yard wot i told you to he demanded  he picked up three of ’em while i was upstairs replied his wife i ’eard ’im tell her that they’d come in handy for paint and things  that’s ’ow coppers get on and buy pianners said the incensed mr grummit sneaking other people’s property i didn’t tell you to throw good ’uns over did i wot d’ye mean by it  mrs grummit made no reply but watched with bated breath the triumphal entrance of the piano the carman set it tenderly on the narrow footpath while p c evans stooping low examined it at all points and mrs evans raising the lid struck a few careless chords  showing off explained mrs grummit with a half turn and she’s got fingers like carrots  it’s a disgrace to mulberry gardens to ’ave a copper come and live in it said the indignant grummit and to come and live next to me— that’s what i can’t get over to come and live next door to a man wot has been fined twice and both times wrong why for two pins i’d go in and smash ’is pianner first and ’im after it he won’t live ’ere long you take my word for it  why not inquired his wife  why repeated mr grummit why why becos i’ll make the place too ’ot to hold him ain’t there enough houses in tunwich without ’im acoming and living next door to me  for a whole week the brain concealed in mr grummit’s bulletshaped head worked in vain and his temper got correspondingly bad the day after the evans’ arrival he had found his yard littered with tins which he recognized as old acquaintances and since that time they had travelled backwards and forwards with monotonous regularity they sometimes made as many as three journeys a day and on one occasion the heavens opened to drop a battered tin bucket on the back of mr grummit as he was tying his bootlace five minutes later he spoke of the outrage to mr evans who had come out to admire the sunset  i heard something fall said the constable eyeing the pail curiously  you threw it said mr grummit breathing furiously  me nonsense said the other easily i was having tea in the parlour with my wife and my motherinlaw and my brother joe and his young lady  any more of ’em demanded the hapless mr grummit aghast at this list of witnesses for an alibi  it ain’t a bad pail if you look at it properly said the constable i should keep it if i was you unless the owner offers a reward for it it’ll hold enough water for your wants  mr grummit flung indoors and after wasting some time concocting impossible measures of retaliation with his sympathetic partner went off to discuss affairs with his intimates at the bricklayers’ arms the company although unanimously agreeing that mr evans ought to be boiled were miserably deficient in ideas as to the means by which such a desirable end was to be attained  make ’im a laughingstock that’s the best thing said an elderly labourer the police don’t like being laughed at  ’ow demanded mr grummit with some asperity  there’s plenty o’ ways said the old man  i should find ’em out fast enough if i ’ad a bucket dropped on my back i know  mr grummit made a retort the feebleness of which was somewhat balanced by its ferocity and subsided into glum silence his back still ached but despite that aid to intellectual effort the only ways he could imagine of making the constable look foolish contained an almost certain risk of hard labour for himself  he pondered the question for a week and meanwhile the tins—to the secret disappointment of mr evans—remained untouched in his yard for the whole of the time he went about looking as mrs grummit expressed it as though his dinner had disagreed with him  i’ve been talking to old bill smith he said suddenly as he came in one night  mrs grummit looked up and noticed with wifely pleasure that he was looking almost cheerful  he’s given me a tip said mr grummit with a faint smile a copper mustn’t come into a freeborn englishman’s ’ouse unless he’s invited  wot of it inquired his wife you wasn’t think of asking him in was you  mr grummit regarded her almost playfully if a copper comes in without being told to he continued he gets into trouble for it now d’ye see  but he won’t come said the puzzled mrs grummit  mr grummit winked yes ’e will if you scream loud enough he retorted where’s the copperstick  have you gone mad demanded his wife or do you think i ’ave  you go up into the bedroom said mr grummit emphasizing his remarks with his forefinger i come up and beat the bed black and blue with the copperstick you scream for mercy and call out ’help’ ’murder’ and things like that don’t call out ’police’ cos bill ain’t sure about that part evans comes bursting in to save your life—i’ll leave the door on the latch—and there you are he’s sure to get into trouble for it bill said so he’s made a study o’ that sort o’ thing  mrs grummit pondered this simple plan so long that her husband began to lose patience at last against her better sense she rose and fetched the weapon in question  and you be careful what you’re hitting she said as they went upstairs to bed we’d better have ’igh words first i s’pose  you pitch into me with your tongue said mr grummit amiably  mrs grummit first listening to make sure that the constable and his wife were in the bedroom the other side of the flimsy wall complied and in a voice that rose gradually to a piercing falsetto told mr grummit things that had been rankling in her mind for some months she raked up misdemeanours that he had long since forgotten and not content with that had a fling at the entire grummit family beginning with her motherinlaw and ending with mr grummit’s youngest sister the hand that held the copperstick itched  any more to say demanded mr grummit advancing upon her  mrs grummit emitted a genuine shriek and mr grummit suddenly remembering himself stopped short and attacked the bed with extraordinary fury the room resounded with the blows and the efforts of mrs grummit were a revelation even to her husband  i can hear ’im moving whispered mr grummit pausing to take breath  mur—der wailed his wife help help  mr grummit changing the stick into his left hand renewed the attack mrs grummit whose voice was becoming exhausted sought a temporary relief in moans  is—he——deaf panted the wifebeater or wot  he knocked over a chair and mrs grummit contrived another frenzied scream a loud knocking sounded on the wall  hel—lp moaned mrs grummit  halloa there came the voice of the constable why don’t you keep that baby quiet we can’t get a wink of sleep  mr grummit dropped the stick on the bed and turned a dazed face to his wife  he—he’s afraid—to come in he gasped keep it up old gal  he took up the stick again and mrs grummit did her best but the heart had gone out of the thing and he was about to give up the task as hopeless when the door below was heard to open with a bang  here he is cried the jubilant grummit now  his wife responded and at the same moment the bedroom door was flung open and her brother who had been hastily fetched by the neighbours on the other side burst into the room and with one hearty blow sent mr grummit sprawling  hit my sister will you he roared as the astounded mr grummit rose take that  mr grummit took it and several other favours while his wife tugging at her brother endeavoured to explain it was not however until mr grummit claimed the usual sanctuary of the defeated by refusing to rise that she could make herself heard  joke repeated her brother incredulously joke  mrs grummit in a husky voice explained  her brother passed from incredulity to amazement and from amazement to mirth he sat down gurgling and the indignant face of the injured grummit only added to his distress  best joke i ever heard in my life he said wiping his eyes don’t look at me like that bob i can’t bear it  get off ’ome responded mr grummit glowering at him  there’s a crowd outside and half the doors in the place open said the other well it’s a good job there’s no harm done so long  he passed beaming down the stairs and mr grummit drawing near the window heard him explaining in a broken voice to the neighbours outside strong men patted him on the back and urged him gruffly to say what he had to say and laugh afterwards mr grummit turned from the window and in a slow and stately fashion prepared to retire for the night even the sudden and startling disappearance of mrs grummit as she got into bed failed to move him  the bed’s broke bob she said faintly  beds won’t last for ever he said shortly sleep on the floor  mrs grummit clambered out and after some trouble secured the bedclothes and made up a bed in a corner of the room in a short time she was fast asleep but her husband broad awake spent the night in devising further impracticable schemes for the discomfiture of the foe next door  he saw mr evans next morning as he passed on his way to work the constable was at the door smoking in his shirtsleeves and mr grummit felt instinctively that he was waiting there to see him pass  i heard you last night said the constable playfully my word good gracious  wot’s the matter with you demanded mr grummit stopping short  the constable stared at him she has been knocking you about he gasped why it must ha’ been you screaming then i thought it sounded loud why don’t you go and get a summons and have her locked up i should be pleased to take her  mr grummit faced him quivering with passion wot would it cost if i set about you he demanded huskily  two months said mr evans smiling serenely p’r’aps three  mr grummit hesitated and his fists clenched nervously the constable lounging against his doorpost surveyed him with a dispassionate smile that would be besides what you’d get from me he said softly  come out in the road said mr grummit with sudden violence  it’s agin the rules said mr evans sorry i can’t why not go and ask your wife’s brother to oblige you  he went in laughing and closed the door and mr grummit after a frenzied outburst proceeded on his way returning the smiles of such acquaintances as he passed with an icy stare or a stronglyworded offer to make them laugh the other side of their face the rest of the day he spent in working so hard that he had no time to reply to the anxious inquiries of his fellowworkmen  he came home at night glum and silent the hardship of not being able to give mr evans his deserts without incurring hard labour having weighed on his spirits all day to avoid the annoyance of the piano next door which was slowly and reluctantly yielding up the last rose of summer note by note he went out at the back and the first thing he saw was mr evans mending his path with tins and other bricabrac  nothing like it said the constable looking up your missus gave ’em to us this morning a little gravel on top and there you are  he turned whistling to his work again and the other after endeavouring in vain to frame a suitable reply took a seat on an inverted washtub and lit his pipe his one hope was that constable evans was going to try and cultivate a garden  the hope was realized a few days later and mr grummit at the back window sat gloating over a dozen fine geraniums some lobelias and calceolarias which decorated the constable’s plot of ground he could not sleep for thinking of them  he rose early the next morning and after remarking to mrs grummit that mr evans’s flowers looked as though they wanted rain went off to his work the cloud which had been on his spirits for some time had lifted and he whistled as he walked the sight of flowers in front windows added to his good humour  he was still in good spirits when he left off work that afternoon but some slight hesitation about returning home sent him to the bricklayers’ firms instead he stayed there until closing time and then being still disinclined for home paid a visit to bill smith who lived the other side of tunwich by the time he started for home it was nearly midnight  the outskirts of the town were deserted and the houses in darkness the clock of tunwich church struck twelve and the last stroke was just dying away as he turned a corner and ran almost into the arms of the man he had been trying to avoid  halloa said constable evans sharply here i want a word with you  mr grummit quailed with me sir he said with involuntary respect  what have you been doing to my flowers demanded the other hotly  flowers repeated mr grummit as though the word were new to him flowers what flowers  you know well enough retorted the constable you got over my fence last night and smashed all my flowers down  you be careful wot you’re saying urged mr grummit why i love flowers you don’t mean to tell me that all them beautiful flowers wot you put in so careful ’as been spoiled  you know all about it said the constable choking i shall take out a summons against you for it  ho said mr grummit and wot time do you say it was when i done it  never you mind the time said the other  cos it’s important said mr grummit  my wife’s brother—the one you’re so fond of—slept in my ’ouse last night he was ill arf the night pore chap but come to think of it it’ll make ’im a good witness for my innocence  if i wasn’t a policeman said mr evans speaking with great deliberation i’d take hold o’ you bob grummit and i’d give you the biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life  if you wasn’t a policeman said mr grummit yearningly i’d arf murder you  the two men eyed each other wistfully loth to part  if i gave you what you deserve i should get into trouble said the constable  if i gave you a quarter of wot you ought to ’ave i should go to quod sighed mr grummit  i wouldn’t put you there said the constable earnestly i swear i wouldn’t  everything’s beautiful and quiet said mr grummit trembling with eagerness and i wouldn’t say a word to a soul i’ll take my solemn davit i wouldn’t  when i think o’ my garden— began the constable with a sudden movement he knocked off mr grummit’s cap and then seizing him by the coat began to hustle him along the road in the twinkling of an eye they had closed  tunwich church chimed the halfhour as they finished and mr grummit forgetting his own injuries stood smiling at the wreck before him the constable’s helmet had been smashed and trodden on his uniform was torn and covered with blood and dirt and his good looks marred for a fortnight at least he stooped with a groan and recovering his helmet tried mechanically to punch it into shape he stuck the battered relic on his head and mr grummit fell back—awed despite himself  it was a fair fight he stammered  the constable waved him away get out o’ my sight before i change my mind he said fiercely and mind if you say a word about this it’ll be the worse for you  do you think i’ve gone mad said the other he took another look at his victim and turning away danced fantastically along the road home the constable making his way to a gaslamp began to inspect damages  they were worse even than he had thought and leaning against the lamppost he sought in vain for an explanation that in the absence of a prisoner would satisfy the inspector a button which was hanging by a thread fell tinkling on to the footpath and he had just picked it up and placed it in his pocket when a faint distant outcry broke upon his ear  he turned and walked as rapidly as his condition would permit in the direction of the noise it became louder and more imperative and cries of police became distinctly audible he quickened into a run and turning a corner beheld a little knot of people standing at the gate of a large house other people only partially clad were hastening towards them the constable arrived out of breath  better late than never said the owner of the house sarcastically  mr evans breathing painfully supported himself with his hand on the fence  they went that way but i suppose you didn’t see them continued the householder halloa he added as somebody opened the hall door and the constable’s damaged condition became visible in the gaslight are you hurt  yes said mr evans who was trying hard to think clearly to gain time he blew a loud call on his whistle  the rascals continued the other i think i should know the big chap with a beard again but the others were too quick for me  mr evans blew his whistle again—thoughtfully the opportunity seemed too good to lose  did they get anything he inquired  not a thing said the owner triumphantly i was disturbed just in time  the constable gave a slight gulp i saw the three running by the side of the road he said slowly their behaviour seemed suspicious so i collared the big one but they set on me like wild cats they had me down three times the last time i laid my head open against the kerb and when i came to my senses again they had gone  he took off his battered helmet with a flourish and amid a murmur of sympathy displayed a nasty cut on his head a sergeant and a constable both running appeared round the corner and made towards’ them  get back to the station and make your report said the former as constable evans in a somewhat defiant voice repeated his story you’ve done your best i can see that  mr evans enacting to perfection the part of a wounded hero limped painfully off praying devoutly as he went that the criminals might make good their escape if not he reflected that the word of a policeman was at least equal to that of three burglars  he repeated his story at the station and after having his head dressed was sent home and advised to keep himself quiet for a day or two he was off duty for four days and the tunwich gazette having devoted a column to the affair headed a gallant constable modestly secluded himself from the public gaze for the whole of that time  to mr grummit who had read the article in question until he could have repeated it backwards this modesty was particularly trying the constable’s yard was deserted and the front door ever closed once mr grummit even went so far as to tap with his nails on the front parlour window and the only response was the sudden lowering of the blind it was not until a week afterwards that his eyes were gladdened by a sight of the constable sitting in his yard and fearing that even then he might escape him he ran out on tiptoe and put his face over the fence before the latter was aware of his presence  wot about that ’ere burglary he demanded in truculent tones  good evening grummit said the constable with a patronizing air  wot about that burglary repeated mr grummit with a scowl i don’t believe you ever saw a burglar  mr evans rose and stretched himself gracefully you’d better run indoors my good man he said slowly  telling all them lies about burglars continued the indignant mr grummit producing his newspaper and waving it why i gave you that black eye i smashed your ’elmet i cut your silly ’ead open i——  you’ve been drinking said the other severely  you mean to say i didn’t demanded mr grummit ferociously  mr evans came closer and eyed him steadily i don’t know what you’re talking about he said calmly  mr grummit about to speak stopped appalled at such hardihood  of course if you mean to say that you were one o’ them burglars continued the constable why say it and i’ll take you with pleasure come to think of it i did seem to remember one o’ their voices  mr grummit with his eyes fixed on the other’s backed a couple of yards and breathed heavily  about your height too he was mused the constable i hope for your sake you haven’t been saying to anybody else what you said to me just now  mr grummit shook his head not a word he faltered  that’s all right then said mr evans i shouldn’t like to be hard on a neighbour not that we shall be neighbours much longer  mr grummit feeling that a reply was expected of him gave utterance to a feeble oh  no said mr evans looking round disparagingly it ain’t good enough for us now i was promoted to sergeant this morning a sergeant can’t live in a common place like this  mr grummit a prey to a sickening fear drew near the fence again a— a sergeant he stammered  mr evans smiled and gazed carefully at a distant cloud for my bravery with them burglars the other night grummit he said modestly i might have waited years if it hadn’t been for them  he nodded to the frantic grummit and turned away mr grummit without any adieu at all turned and crept back to the house     bob’s redemption     gratitoode said the nightwatchman with a hard laugh hmf don’t talk to me about gratitoode i’ve seen too much of it if people wot i’ve helped in my time ’ad only done arf their dooty—arf mind you—i should be riding in my carriage  forgetful of the limitations of soapboxes he attempted to illustrate his remark by lolling and nearly went over backwards recovering himself by an effort he gazed sternly across the river and smoked fiercely it was evident that he was brooding over an illused past  arry thomson was one of them he said at last for over six months i wrote all ’is loveletters for him ’e being an iggernerant sort of man and only being able to do the kisses at the end which he always insisted on doing ’imself being jealous only three weeks arter he was married ’e come up to where i was standing one day and set about me without saying a word i was a single man at the time and i didn’t understand it my idea was that he ’ad gone mad and being pretty artful and always ’aving a horror of mad people i let ’im chase me into a policestation leastways i would ha’ let ’im but he didn’t come and i all but got fourteen days for being drunk and disorderly  then there was bill clark he ’ad been keeping comp’ny with a gal and got tired of it and to oblige ’im i went to her and told ’er he was a married man with five children bill was as pleased as punch at fust but as soon as she took up with another chap he came round to see me and said as i’d ruined his life we ’ad words about it—naturally—and i did ruin it then to the extent of a couple o’ ribs i went to see ’im in the horsepittle—place i’ve always been fond of—and the langwidge he used to me was so bad that they sent for the sister to ’ear it  that’s on’y two out of dozens i could name arf the unpleasantnesses in my life ’ave come out of doing kindnesses to people and all the gratitoode i’ve ’ad for it i could put in a pintpot with a pint o’ beer already in it  the only case o’ real gratitoode i ever heard of ’appened to a shipmate o’ mine—a young chap named bob evans coming home from auckland in a barque called the dragon fly he fell overboard and another chap named george crofts one o’ the best swimmers i ever knew went overboard arter ’im and saved his life  we was hardly moving at the time and the sea was like a duck pond but to ’ear bob evans talk you’d ha’ thought that george crofts was the bravest’arted chap that ever lived he ’adn’t liked him afore same as the rest of us george being a sly mean sort o’ chap but arter george ’ad saved his life ’e couldn’t praise ’im enough he said that so long as he ’ad a crust george should share it and wotever george asked ’im he should have  the unfortnit part of it was that george took ’im at his word and all the rest of the v’y’ge he acted as though bob belonged to ’im and by the time we got into the london river bob couldn’t call his soul ’is own he used to take a room when he was ashore and live very steady as ’e was saving up to get married and as soon as he found that out george invited ’imself to stay with him  it won’t cost you a bit more he ses not if you work it properly  bob didn’t work it properly but george having saved his life and never letting ’im forget it he didn’t like to tell him so he thought he’d let ’im see gradual that he’d got to be careful because of ’is gal and the fust evening they was ashore ’e took ’im along with ’im there to tea  gerty mitchell—that was the gal’s name—’adn’t heard of bob’s accident and when she did she gave a little scream and putting ’er arms round his neck began to kiss ’im right in front of george and her mother  you ought to give him one too ses mrs mitchell pointing to george  george wiped ’is mouth on the back of his ’and but gerty pretended not to ’ear  fancy if you’d been drownded she ses hugging bob agin  he was pretty near ses george shaking his ’ead i’m a pore swimmer but i made up my mind either to save ’im or else go down to a watery grave myself  he wiped his mouth on the back of his ’and agin but all the notice gerty took of it was to send her young brother ted out for some beer then they all ’ad supper together and mrs mitchell drank good luck to george in a glass o’ beer and said she ’oped that ’er own boy would grow up like him let ’im grow up a good and brave man that’s all i ask she ses i don’t care about ’is looks  he might have both ses george sharplike why not  mrs mitchell said she supposed he might and then she cuffed young ted’s ears for making a noise while ’e was eating and then cuffed ’im agin for saying that he’d finished ’is supper five minutes ago  george and bob walked ’ome together and all the way there george said wot a pretty gal gerty was and ’ow lucky it was for bob that he ’adn’t been drownded he went round to tea with ’im the next day to mrs mitchell’s and arter tea when bob and gerty said they was going out to spend the evening together got ’imself asked too  they took a tramcar and went to a musichall and bob paid for the three of ’em george never seemed to think of putting his ’and in his pocket and even arter the musichall when they all went into a shop and ’ad stewed eels he let bob pay  as i said afore bob evans was chockfull of gratefulness and it seemed only fair that he shouldn’t grumble at spending a little over the man wot ’ad risked ’is life to save his but wot with keeping george at his room and paying for ’im every time they went out he was spending a lot more money than ’e could afford  you’re on’y young once bob george said to him when ’e made a remark one arternoon as to the fast way his money was going and if it hadn’t ha’ been for me you’d never ’ave lived to grow old  wot with spending the money and always ’aving george with them when they went out it wasn’t long afore bob and gerty ’ad a quarrel i don’t like a porespirited man she ses two’s company and three’s none and besides why can’t he pay for ’imself he’s big enough why should you spend your money on ’im he never pays a farthing  bob explained that he couldn’t say anything because ’e owed his life to george but ’e might as well ’ave talked to a lamppost the more he argued the more angry gerty got and at last she ses two’s company and three’s none and if you and me can’t go out without george crofts then me and ’im ’ll go out without you  she was as good as her word too and the next night while bob ’ad gone out to get some ’bacca she went off alone with george it was ten o’clock afore they came back agin and gerty’s eyes were all shining and ’er cheeks as pink as roses she shut ’er mother up like a concertina the moment she began to find fault with ’er and at supper she sat next to george and laughed at everything ’e said  george and bob walked all the way ’ome arter supper without saying a word but arter they got to their room george took a sidelook at bob and then he ses suddenlike look ’ere i saved your life didn’t i  you did ses bob and i thank you for it  i saved your life ses george agin very solemn if it hadn’t ha’ been for me you couldn’t ha’ married anybody  that’s true ses bob  me and gerty ’ave been having a talk ses george bending down to undo his boots we’ve been getting on very well together you can’t ’elp your feelings and the long and the short of it is the pore gal has fallen in love with me  bob didn’t say a word  if you look at it this way it’s fair enough ses george i gave you your life and you give me your gal we’re quits now you don’t owe me anything and i don’t owe you anything that’s the way gerty puts it and she told me to tell you so  if—if she don’t want me i’m agreeable ses bob in a choking voice we’ll call it quits and next time i tumble overboard i ’ope you won’t be handy  he took gerty’s photygraph out of ’is box and handed it to george you’ve got more right to it now than wot i ’ave he ses i shan’t go round there any more i shall look out for a ship tomorrow  george crofts said that perhaps it was the best thing he could do and ’e asked ’im in a offhand sort o’ way ’ow long the room was paid up for  mrs mitchell ’ad a few words to say about it next day but gerty told ’er to save ’er breath for walking upstairs the on’y thing that george didn’t like when they went out was that young ted was with them but gerty said she preferred it till she knew ’im better and she ’ad so much to say about his noble behaviour in saving life that george gave way they went out looking at the shops george thinking that that was the cheapest way of spending an evening and they were as happy as possible till gerty saw a brooch she liked so much in a window that he couldn’t get ’er away  it is a beauty she ses i don’t know when i’ve seen a brooch i liked better look here let’s all guess the price and then go in and see who’s right  they ’ad their guesses and then they went in and asked and as soon as gerty found that it was only threeandsixpence she began to feel in her pocket for ’er purse just like your wife does when you go out with ’er knowing all the time that it’s on the mantelpiece with twopenceha’penny and a cough lozenge in it  i must ha’ left it at ’ome she ses looking at george  just wot i’ve done ses george arter patting ’is pockets  gerty bit ’er lips and for a minute or two be civil to george she could not then she gave a little smile and took ’is arm agin and they walked on talking and laughing till she turned round of a sudden and asked a big chap as was passing wot ’e was shoving ’er for  shoving you ses he wot do you think i want to shove you for  don’t you talk to me ses gerty firing up george make ’im beg my pardon  you ought to be more careful ses george in a gentle sort o’ way  make ’im beg my pardon ses gerty stamping ’er foot if he don’t knock ’im down  yes knock ’im down ses the big man taking hold o’ george’s cap and rumpling his ’air  pore george who was never much good with his fists hit ’im in the chest and the next moment he was on ’is back in the middle o’ the road wondering wot had ’appened to ’im by the time ’e got up the other man was arf a mile away and young ted stepped up and wiped ’im down with a pocket’andkerchief while gerty explained to ’im ’ow she saw ’im slip on a piece o’ banana peel  it’s ’ard lines she ses but never mind you frightened ’im away and i don’t wonder at it you do look terrible when you’re angry george i didn’t know you  she praised ’im all the way ’ome and if it ’adn’t been for his mouth and nose george would ’ave enjoyed it more than ’e did she told ’er mother how ’e had flown at a big man wot ’ad insulted her and mrs mitchell shook her ’ead at ’im and said his bold spirit would lead ’im into trouble afore he ’ad done  they didn’t seem to be able to make enough of ’im and next day when he went round gerty was so upset at the sight of ’is bruises that he thought she was going to cry when he had ’ad his tea she gave ’im a cigar she had bought for ’im herself and when he ’ad finished smoking it she smiled at him and said that she was going to take ’im out for a pleasant evening to try and make up to ’im for wot he ’ad suffered for ’er  we’re all going to stand treat to each other she ses bob always would insist on paying for everything but i like to feel a bit independent give and take—that’s the way i like to do things  there’s nothing like being independent ses george bob ought to ha’ known that  i’m sure it’s the best plan ses gerty now get your ’at on we’re going to a theayter and ted shall pay the ’bus fares  george wanted to ask about the theayter but ’e didn’t like to and arter gerty was dressed they went out and ted paid the ’bus fares like a man  here you are ses gerty as the ’bus stopped outside the theayter hurry up and get the tickets george ask for three upper circles  she bustled george up to the pay place and as soon as she ’ad picked out the seats she grabbed ’old of the tickets and told george to make haste  twelve shillings it is ses the man as george put down arf a crown  twelve ses george beginning to stammer twelve twelve twel—  twelve shillings ses the man three upper circles you’ve ’ad  george was going to fetch gerty back and ’ave cheaper seats but she ’ad gone inside with young ted and at last arter making an awful fuss he paid the rest o’ the money and rushed in arter her arf crazy at the idea o’ spending so much money  make ’aste ses gerty afore he could say anything the band ’as just begun  she started running upstairs and she was so excited that when they got their seats and george started complaining about the price she didn’t pay any attention to wot he was saying but kept pointing out ladies’ dresses to ’im in w’ispers and wondering wot they ’ad paid for them george gave it up at last and then he sat wondering whether he ’ad done right arter all in taking bob’s gal away from him  gerty enjoyed it very much but when the curtain came down after the first act she leaned back in her chair and looked up at george and said she felt faint and thought she’d like to ’ave an icecream and you ’ave one too dear she ses when young ted ’ad got up and beckoned to the gal and ted ’ud like one too i’m sure  she put her ’ead on george’s shoulder and looked up at ’im then she put her ’and on his and stroked it and george reckoning that arter all icecreams were on’y a ha’penny or at the most a penny each altered ’is mind about not spending any more money and ordered three  the way he carried on when the gal said they was three shillings was alarming at fust ’e thought she was ’aving a joke with ’im and it took another gal and the fireman and an old gentleman wot was sitting behind ’im to persuade ’im different he was so upset that ’e couldn’t eat his arter paying for it and ted and gerty had to finish it for ’im  they’re expensive but they’re worth the money ses gerty you are good to me george i could go on eating ’em all night but you mustn’t fling your money away like this always  i’ll see to that ses george very bitter  i thought we was going to stand treat to each other that was the idea i understood  so we are ses gerty ted stood the ’bus fares didn’t he  he did ses george wot there was of ’em but wot about you  me ses gerty drawing her ’ead back and staring at ’im why ’ave you forgot that cigar already george  george opened ’is mouth but ’e couldn’t speak a word he sat looking at ’er and making a gasping noise in ’is throat and fortunately just as ’e got ’is voice back the curtain went up agin and everybody said h’sh  he couldn’t enjoy the play at all ’e was so upset and he began to see more than ever ’ow wrong he ’ad been in taking bob’s gal away from ’im he walked downstairs into the street like a man in a dream with gerty sticking to ’is arm and young ted treading on ’is heels behind  now you mustn’t waste any more money george ses gerty when they got outside we’ll walk ’ome  george ’ad got arf a mind to say something about a ’bus but he remembered in time that very likely young ted hadn’t got any more money then gerty said she knew a short cut and she took them walking along little dark narrow streets and places until at last just as george thought they must be pretty near ’ome she began to dab her eyes with ’er pocket’andkerchief and say she’d lost ’er way  you two go ’ome and leave me she ses arf crying i can’t walk another step  where are we ses george looking round  i don’t know ses gerty i couldn’t tell you if you paid me i must ’ave taken a wrong turning oh hurrah here’s a cab  afore george could stop ’er she held up ’er umbrella and a ’ansom cab with bells on its horse crossed the road and pulled up in front of ’em ted nipped in first and gerty followed ’im  tell ’im the address dear and make ’aste and get in ses gerty  george told the cabman and then he got in and sat on ted’s knee partly on gerty’s umbrella and mostly on nothing  you are good to me george ses gerty touching the back of ’is neck with the brim of her hat it ain’t often i get a ride in a cab all the time i was keeping company with bob we never ’ad one once i only wish i’d got the money to pay for it  george who was going to ask a question stopped ’imself and then he kept striking matches and trying to read all about cab fares on a bill in front of ’im  ’ow are we to know ’ow many miles it is he ses at last  i don’t know ses gerty leave it to the cabman it’s his bisness ain’t it and if ’e don’t know he must suffer for it  there was hardly a soul in gerty’s road when they got there but afore george ’ad settled with the cabman there was a policeman moving the crowd on and arf the winders in the road up by the time george had paid ’im and the cabman ’ad told him wot ’e looked like gerty and ted ’ad disappeared indoors all the lights was out and in a state o’ mind that won’t bear thinking of george walked ’ome to his lodging  bob was asleep when he got there but ’e woke ’im up and told ’im about it and then arter a time he said that he thought bob ought to pay arf because he ’ad saved ’is life  cert’nly not ses bob we’re quits now that was the arrangement i only wish it was me spending the money on her i shouldn’t grumble  george didn’t get a wink o’ sleep all night for thinking of the money he ’ad spent and next day when he went round he ’ad almost made up ’is mind to tell bob that if ’e liked to pay up the money he could ’ave gerty back but she looked so pretty and praised ’im up so much for ’is generosity that he began to think better of it one thing ’e was determined on and that was never to spend money like that agin for fifty gertys  there was a very sensible man there that evening that george liked very much his name was uncle joe and when gerty was praising george to ’is face for the money he ’ad been spending uncle joe instead o’ looking pleased shook his ’ead over it  young people will be young people i know he ses but still i don’t approve of extravagance bob evans would never ’ave spent all that money over you  bob evans ain’t everybody ses mrs mitchell standing up for gerty  he was steady anyway ses uncle joe besides gerty ought not to ha’ let mr crofts spend his money like that she could ha’ prevented it if she’d ha’ put ’er foot down and insisted on it  he was so solemn about it that everybody began to feel a bit upset and gerty borrowed ted’s pocket’andkerchief and then wiped ’er eyes on the cuff of her dress instead  well well ses uncle joe i didn’t mean to be ’ard but don’t do it no more you are young people and can’t afford it  we must ’ave a little pleasure sometimes ses gerty  yes i know ses uncle joe but there’s moderation in everything look ’ere it’s time somebody paid for mr crofts tomorrow’s saturday and if you like i’ll take you all to the crystal palace  gerty jumped up off of ’er chair and kissed ’im while mrs mitchell said she knew ’is bark was worse than ’is bite and asked ’im who was wasting his money now  you meet me at london bridge station at two o’clock ses uncle joe getting up to go it ain’t extravagance for a man as can afford it  he shook ’ands with george crofts and went and arter george ’ad stayed long enough to hear a lot o’ things about uncle joe which made ’im think they’d get on very well together he went off too  they all turned up very early the next arternoon and gerty was dressed so nice that george couldn’t take his eyes off of her besides her there was mrs mitchell and ted and a friend of ’is named charlie smith  they waited some time but uncle joe didn’t turn up and they all got looking at the clock and talking about it and ’oping he wouldn’t make ’em miss the train  here he comes ses ted at last  uncle joe came rushing in puffing and blowing as though he’d bust take ’em on by this train will you he ses catching ’old o’ george by the arm i’ve just been stopped by a bit o’ business i must do and i’ll come on by the next or as soon arter as i can  he rushed off again puffing and blowing his ’ardest in such a hurry that he forgot to give george the money for the tickets however george borrowed a pencil of mrs mitchell in the train and put down on paper ’ow much they cost and mrs mitchell said if george didn’t like to remind ’im she would  they left young ted and charlie to stay near the station when they got to the palace uncle joe ’aving forgotten to say where he’d meet ’em but train arter train came in without ’im and at last the two boys gave it up  we’re sure to run across ’im sooner or later ses gerty let’s ’ave something to eat i’m so hungry  george said something about buns and milk but gerty took ’im up sharp buns and milk she ses why uncle would never forgive us if we spoilt his treat like that  she walked into a refreshment place and they ’ad cold meat and bread and pickles and beer and tarts and cheese till even young ted said he’d ’ad enough but still they couldn’t see any signs of uncle joe they went on to the roundabouts to look for ’im and then into all sorts o’ shows at sixpence a head but still there was no signs of ’im and george had ’ad to start on a fresh bit o’ paper to put down wot he’d spent  i suppose he must ha’ been detained on important business ses gerty at last  unless it’s one of ’is jokes ses mrs mitchell shaking her ’ead you know wot your uncle is gerty  there now i never thought o’ that ses gerty with a start p’r’aps it is  joke ses george choking and staring from one to the other  i was wondering where he’d get the money from ses mrs mitchell to gerty i see it all now i never see such a man for a bit o’ fun in all my born days and the solemn way he went on last night too why he must ha’ been laughing in ’is sleeve all the time it’s as good as a play  look here ses george ’ardly able to speak do you mean to tell me he never meant to come  i’m afraid not ses mrs mitchell knowing wot he is but don’t you worry i’ll give him a bit o’ my mind when i see ’im  george crofts felt as though he’d burst and then ’e got his breath and the things ’e said about uncle joe was so awful that mrs mitchell told the boys to go away  how dare you talk of my uncle like that ses gerty firing up  you forget yourself george ses mrs mitchell you’ll like ’im when you get to know ’im better  don’t you call me george ses george crofts turning on ’er i’ve been done that’s wot i’ve been i ’ad fourteen pounds when i was paid off and it’s melting like butter  well we’ve enjoyed ourselves ses gerty and that’s what money was given us for i’m sure those two boys ’ave had a splendid time thanks to you don’t go and spoil all by a little bit o’ temper  temper ses george turning on her i’ve done with you i wouldn’t marry you if you was the on’y gal in the world i wouldn’t marry you if you paid me  oh indeed ses gerty but if you think you can get out of it like that you’re mistaken i’ve lost my young man through you and i’m not going to lose you too i’ll send my two big cousins round to see you tomorrow  they won’t put up with no nonsense i can tell you ses mrs mitchell  she called the boys to her and then she and gerty arter holding their ’eads very high and staring at george went off and left ’im alone he went straight off ’ome counting ’is money all the way and trying to make it more and arter telling bob ’ow he’d been treated and trying hard to get ’im to go shares in his losses packed up his things and cleared out all boiling over with temper  bob was so dazed he couldn’t make head or tail out of it but ’e went round to see gerty the first thing next morning and she explained things to him  i don’t know when i’ve enjoyed myself so much she ses wiping her eyes but i’ve had enough gadding about for once and if you come round this evening we’ll have a nice quiet time together looking at the furniture shops     over the side     of all classes of men those who follow the sea are probably the most prone to superstition afloat upon the black waste of waters at the mercy of wind and sea with vast depths and strange creatures below them a belief in the supernatural is easier than ashore under the cheerful gaslamps strange stories of the sea are plentiful and an incident which happened within my own experience has made me somewhat chary of dubbing a man fool or coward because he has encountered something he cannot explain there are stories of the supernatural with prosaic sequels there are others to which the sequel has never been published  i was fifteen years old at the time and as my father who had a strong objection to the sea would not apprentice me to it i shipped before the mast on a sturdy little brig called the endeavour bound for riga she was a small craft but the skipper was as fine a seaman as one could wish for and in fair weather an easy man to sail under most boys have a rough time of it when they first go to sea but with a strong sense of what was good for me i had attached myself to a brawny goodnatured infant named bill smith and it was soon understood that whoever hit me struck bill by proxy not that the crew were particularly brutal but a sound cuffing occasionally is held by most seamen to be beneficial to a lad’s health and morals the only really spiteful fellow among them was a man named jem dadd he was a morose sallowlooking man of about forty with a strong taste for the supernatural and a stronger taste still for frightening his fellows with it i have seen bill almost afraid to go on deck of a night for his trick at the wheel after a few of his reminiscences rats were a favourite topic with him and he would never allow one to be killed if he could help it for he claimed for them that they were the souls of drowned sailors hence their love of ships and their habit of leaving them when they became unseaworthy he was a firm believer in the transmigration of souls some idea of which he had no doubt picked up in eastern ports and gave his shivering auditors to understand that his arrangements for his own immediate future were already perfected  we were six or seven days out when a strange thing happened dadd had the second watch one night and bill was to relieve him they were not very strict aboard the brig in fair weather and when a man’s time was up he just made the wheel fast and running for’ard shouted down the fo’c’s’le on this night i happened to awake suddenly in time to see bill slip out of his bunk and stand by me rubbing his red eyelids with his knuckles  dadd’s giving me a long time he whispered seeing that i was awake it’s a whole hour after his time  he pattered up on deck and i was just turning over thankful that i was too young to have a watch to keep when he came softly down again and taking me by the shoulders shook me roughly  jack he whispered jack  i raised myself on my elbows and in the light of the smoking lamp saw that he was shaking all over  come on deck he said thickly  i put on my clothes and followed him quietly to the sweet cool air above it was a beautiful clear night but from his manner i looked nervously around for some cause of alarm i saw nothing the deck was deserted except for the solitary figure at the wheel  look at him whispered bill bending a contorted face to mine  i walked aft a few steps and bill followed slowly then i saw that jem dadd was leaning forward clumsily on the wheel with his hands clenched on the spokes  he’s asleep said i stopping short  bill breathed hard he’s in a queer sleep said he kind o’ trance more like go closer  i took fast hold of bill’s sleeve and we both went the light of the stars was sufficient to show that dadd’s face was very white and that his dim black eyes were wide open and staring in a very strange and dreadful manner straight before him  dadd said i softly dadd  there was no reply and with a view of arousing him i tapped one sinewy hand as it gripped the wheel and even tried to loosen it  he remained immovable and suddenly with a great cry my courage deserted me and bill and i fairly bolted down into the cabin and woke the skipper  then we saw how it was with jem and two strong seamen forcibly loosened the grip of those rigid fingers and laying him on the deck covered him with a piece of canvas the rest of the night two men stayed at the wheel and gazing fearfully at the outline of the canvas longed for dawn  it came at last and breakfast over the body was sewn up in canvas and the skipper held a short service compiled from a bible which belonged to the mate and what he remembered of the burial service proper then the corpse went overboard with a splash and the men after standing awkwardly together for a few minutes slowly dispersed to their duties  for the rest of that day we were all very quiet and restrained pity for the dead man being mingled with a dread of taking the wheel when night came  the wheel’s haunted said the cook solemnly mark my words there’s more of you will be took the same way dadd was  the cook like myself had no watch to keep  the men bore up pretty well until night came on again and then they unanimously resolved to have a double watch the cook sorely against his will was impressed into the service and i glad to oblige my patron agreed to stay up with bill  some of the pleasure had vanished by the time night came and i seemed only just to have closed my eyes when bill came and with a rough shake or two informed me that the time had come any hope that i might have had of escaping the ordeal was at once dispelled by his expectant demeanour and the helpful way in which he assisted me with my clothes and yawning terribly i followed him on deck  the night was not so clear as the preceding one and the air was chilly with a little moisture in it i buttoned up my jacket and thrust my hands in my pockets  everything quiet asked bill as he stepped up and took the wheel  ay ay said roberts quiet as the grave and followed by his willing mate he went below  i sat on the deck by bill’s side as with a light touch on the wheel he kept the brig to her course it was weary work sitting there doing nothing and thinking of the warm berth below and i believe that i should have fallen asleep but that my watchful companion stirred me with his foot whenever he saw me nodding  i suppose i must have sat there shivering and yawning for about an hour when tired of inactivity i got up and went and leaned over the side of the vessel the sound of the water gurgling and lapping by was so soothing that i began to doze  i was recalled to my senses by a smothered cry from bill and running to him i found him staring to port in an intense and uncomfortable fashion at my approach he took one hand from the wheel and gripped my arm so tightly that i was like to have screamed with the pain of it  jack said he in a shaky voice while you was away something popped its head up and looked over the ship’s side  you’ve been dreaming said i in a voice which was a very fair imitation of bill’s own  dreaming repeated bill dreaming ah look there  he pointed with outstretched finger and my heart seemed to stop beating as i saw a man’s head appear above the side for a brief space it peered at us in silence and then a dark figure sprang like a cat on to the deck and stood crouching a short distance away  a mist came before my eyes and my tongue failed me but bill let off a roar such as i have never heard before or since it was answered from below both aft and for’ard and the men came running up on deck just as they left their beds  what’s up shouted the skipper glancing aloft  for answer bill pointed to the intruder and the men who had just caught sight of him came up and formed a compact knot by the wheel  come over the side it did panted bill come over like a ghost out of the sea  the skipper took one of the small lamps from the binnacle and holding it aloft walked boldly up to the cause of alarm in the little patch of light we saw a ghastly blackbearded man dripping with water regarding us with unwinking eyes which glowed red in the light of the lamp  where did you come from asked the skipper  the figure shook its head  where did you come from he repeated walking up and laying his hand on the other’s shoulder  then the intruder spoke but in a strange fashion and in strange words we leaned forward to listen but even when he repeated them we could make nothing of them  he’s a furriner said roberts  blest if i’ve ever ’eard the lingo afore said bill does anybody rekernize it  nobody did and the skipper after another attempt gave it up and falling back upon the universal language of signs pointed first to the man and then to the sea the other understood him and in a heavy slovenly fashion portrayed a man drifting in an open boat and clutching and clambering up the side of a passing ship as his meaning dawned upon us we rushed to the stern and leaning over peered into the gloom but the night was dark and we saw nothing  well said the skipper turning to bill with a mighty yawn take him below and give him some grub and the next time a gentleman calls on you don’t make such a confounded row about it  he went below followed by the mate and after some slight hesitation roberts stepped up to the intruder and signed to him to follow he came stolidly enough leaving a trail of water on the deck and after changing into the dry things we gave him fell to but without much appearance of hunger upon some salt beef and biscuits regarding us between bites with black lacklustre eyes  he seems as though he’s awalking in his sleep said the cook  he ain’t very hungry said one of the men he seems to mumble his food  hungry repeated bill who had just left the wheel course he ain’t famished he had his tea last night  the men stared at him in bewilderment  don’t you see said bill still in a hoarse whisper ain’t you ever seen them eyes afore don’t you know what he used to say about dying it’s jem dadd come back to us jem dadd got another man’s body as he always said he would  rot said roberts trying to speak bravely but he got up and with the others huddled together at the end of the fo’c’s’le and stared in a bewildered fashion at the sodden face and short squat figure of our visitor for his part having finished his meal he pushed his plate from him and leaning back on the locker looked at the empty bunks  roberts caught his eye and with a nod and a wave of his hand indicated the bunks the fellow rose from the locker and amid a breathless silence climbed into one of them—jem dadd’s  he slept in the dead sailor’s bed that night the only man in the fo’c’s’le who did sleep properly and turned out heavily and lumpishly in the morning for breakfast  the skipper had him on deck after the meal but could make nothing of him to all his questions he replied in the strange tongue of the night before and though our fellows had been to many ports and knew a word or two of several languages none of them recognized it the skipper gave it up at last and left to himself he stared about him for some time regardless of our interest in his movements and then leaning heavily against the side of the ship stayed there so long that we thought he must have fallen asleep  he’s halfdead now whispered roberts  hush said bill mebbe he’s been in the water a week or two and can’t quite make it out see how he’s looking at it now  he stayed on deck all day in the sun but as night came on returned to the warmth of the fo’c’s’le the food we gave him remained untouched and he took little or no notice of us though i fancied that he saw the fear we had of him he slept again in the dead man’s bunk and when morning came still lay there  until dinnertime nobody interfered with him and then roberts pushed forward by the others approached him with some food he motioned it away with a dirty bloated hand and making signs for water drank it eagerly  for two days he stayed there quietly the black eyes always open the stubby fingers always on the move on the third morning bill who had conquered his fear sufficiently to give him water occasionally called softly to us  come and look at him said he what’s the matter with him  he’s dying said the cook with a shudder  he can’t be going to die yet said bill blankly  as he spoke the man’s eyes seemed to get softer and more lifelike and he looked at us piteously and helplessly from face to face he gazed in mute inquiry and then striking his chest feebly with his fist uttered two words  we looked at each other blankly and he repeated them eagerly and again touched his chest  it’s his name said the cook and we all repeated them  he smiled in an exhausted fashion and then rallying his energies held up a forefinger as we stared at this new riddle he lowered it and held up all four fingers doubled  come away quavered the cook he’s putting a spell on us  we drew back at that and back farther still as he repeated the motions then bill’s face cleared suddenly and he stepped towards him  he means his wife and younkers he shouted eagerly this ain’t no jem dadd  it was good then to see how our fellows drew round the dying sailor and strove to cheer him bill to show he understood the finger business nodded cheerily and held his hand at four different heights from the floor the last was very low so low that the man set his lips together and strove to turn his heavy head from us  poor devil said bill he wants us to tell his wife and children what’s become of him he must ha’ been dying when he come aboard what was his name again  but the name was not easy to english lips and we had already forgotten it  ask him again said the cook and write it down who’s got a pen  he went to look for one as bill turned to the sailor to get him to repeat it then he turned round again and eyed us blankly for by this time the owner had himself forgotten it     the four pigeons     the old man took up his mug and shifted along the bench until he was in the shade of the elms that stood before the cauliflower the action also had the advantage of bringing him opposite the two strangers who were refreshing themselves after the toils of a long walk in the sun  my hearing ain’t wot it used to be he said tremulously when you asked me to have a mug o’ ale i ’ardly heard you and if you was to ask me to ’ave another i mightn’t hear you at all  one of the men nodded  not over there piped the old man that’s why i come over here he added after a pause it ’ud be rude like to take no notice if you was to ask me  he looked round as the landlord approached and pushed his mug gently in his direction the landlord obeying a nod from the second stranger filled it  it puts life into me said the old man raising it to his lips and bowing it makes me talk  time we were moving jack said the first traveller the second assenting to this as an abstract proposition expressed however a determination to finish his pipe first  i heard you saying something about shooting continued the old man and that reminds me of some shooting we ’ad here once in claybury we’ve always ’ad a lot o’ game in these parts and if it wasn’t for a low poaching fellow named bob pretty—claybury’s disgrace i call ’im—we’d ’ave a lot more  it happened in this way squire rockett was going abroad to foreign parts for a year and he let the hall to a gentleman from london named sutton a real gentleman ’e was open’anded and free and just about october he ’ad a lot of ’is friends come down from london to ’elp ’im kill the pheasants  the first day they frightened more than they killed but they enjoyed theirselves all right until one gentleman who ’adn’t shot a single thing all day shot pore bill chambers wot was beating with about a dozen more  bill got most of it in the shoulder and a little in the cheek but the row he see fit to make you’d ha’ thought he’d been killed he laid on the ground groaning with ’is eyes shut and everybody thought ’e was dying till henery walker stooped down and asked ’im whether ’e was hurt  it took four men to carry bill ’ome and he was that particular you wouldn’t believe they ’ad to talk in whispers and when peter gubbins forgot ’imself and began to whistle he asked him where his ’art was when they walked fast he said they jolted ’im and when they walked slow ’e asked ’em whether they’d gone to sleep or wot  bill was in bed for nearly a week but the gentleman was very nice about it and said that it was his fault he was a very pleasantspoken gentleman and arter sending dr green to him and saying he’d pay the bill ’e gave bill chambers ten pounds to make up for ’is sufferings  bill ’ad intended to lay up for another week and the doctor wot ’ad been calling twice a day said he wouldn’t be responsible for ’is life if he didn’t but the ten pounds was too much for ’im and one evening just a week arter the accident he turned up at this cauliflower public’ouse and began to spend ’is money  his face was bandaged up and when ’e come in he walked feeblelike and spoke in a faint sort o’ voice smith the landlord got ’im a easychair and a couple of pillers out o’ the parlour and bill sat there like a king telling us all his sufferings and wot it felt like to be shot  i always have said wot a good thing beer is and it done bill more good than doctor’s medicine when he came in he could ’ardly crawl and at nine o’clock ’e was out of the easychair and dancing on the table as well as possible he smashed three mugs and upset about two pints o’ beer but he just put his ’and in his pocket and paid for ’em without a word  there’s plenty more where that came from he ses pulling out a handful o’ money  peter gubbins looked at it ’ardly able to speak it’s worth while being shot to ’ave all that money he ses at last  don’t you worry yourself peter ses bob pretty there’s plenty more of you as’ll be shot afore them gentlemen at the hall ’as finished bill’s the fust but ’e won’t be the last—not by a long chalk  they’re more careful now ses dicky weed the tailor  all right ’ave it your own way ses bob nastylike i don’t know much about shooting being on’y a pore labourin’ man all i know is i shouldn’t like to go beating for them i’m too fond o’ my wife and family  there won’t be no more shot ses sam jones  we’re too careful ses peter gubbins  bob pretty don’t know everything ses dicky weed  i’ll bet you what you like there’ll be some more of you shot ses bob pretty in a temper now then  ’ow much’ll you bet bob ses sam jones with a wink at the others i can see you winking sam jones ses bob pretty but i’ll do more than bet the last bet i won is still owing to me now look ’ere i’ll pay you sixpence a week all the time you’re beating if you promise to give me arf of wot you get if you’re shot i can’t say fairer than that  will you give me sixpence a week too ses henery walker jumping up  i will ses bob and anybody else that likes and wot’s more i’ll pay in advance fust sixpences now  claybury men ’ave never been backward when there’s been money to be made easy and they all wanted to join bob pretty’s club as he called it but fust of all ’e asked for a pen and ink and then he got smith the landlord being a scholard to write out a paper for them to sign henery walker was the fust to write ’is name and then sam jones peter gubbins ralph thomson jem hall and walter bell wrote theirs bob stopped ’em then and said six ’ud be enough to go on with and then ’e paid up the sixpences and wished ’em luck  wot they liked a’most as well as the sixpences was the idea o’ getting the better o’ bob pretty as i said afore he was a poacher and that artful that up to that time nobody ’ad ever got the better of ’im  they made so much fun of ’im the next night that bob turned sulky and went off ’ome and for two or three nights he ’ardly showed his face and the next shoot they ’ad he went off to wickham and nobody saw ’im all day  that very day henery walker was shot several gentlemen fired at a rabbit that was started and the next thing they knew henery walker was lying on the ground calling out that ’is leg ’ad been shot off  he made more fuss than bill chambers a’most ’specially when they dropped ’im off a hurdle carrying him ’ome and the things he said to dr green for rubbing his ’ands as he came into the bedroom was disgraceful  the fust bob pretty ’eard of it was up at the cauliflower at eight o’clock that evening and he set down ’is beer and set off to see henery as fast as ’is legs could carry ’im henery was asleep when ’e got there and do all he could bob pretty couldn’t wake ’im till he sat down gentle on ’is bad leg  it’s on’y me old pal he ses smiling at ’im as henery woke up and shouted at ’im to get up  henery walker was going to say something bad but ’e thought better of it and he lay there arf busting with rage and watching bob out of the corner of one eye  i quite forgot you was on my club till smith reminded me of it ses bob don’t you take a farthing less than ten pounds henery  henery walker shut his eyes again i forgot to tell you i made up my mind this morning not to belong to your club any more bob he ses  why didn’t you come and tell me henery instead of leaving it till it was too late ses bob shaking his ’ead at ’im  i shall want all that money ses henery in a weak voice i might ’ave to have a wooden leg bob  don’t meet troubles arf way henery ses bob in a kind voice i’ve no doubt mr sutton’ll throw in a wooden leg if you want it and look here if he does i won’t trouble you for my arf of it  he said goodnight to henery and went off and when mrs walker went up to see ’ow henery was getting on he was carrying on that alarming that she couldn’t do nothing with ’im  he was laid up for over a week though it’s my opinion he wasn’t much hurt and the trouble was that nobody knew which gentleman ’ad shot ’im mr sutton talked it over with them and at last arter a good deal o’ trouble and henery pulling up ’is trousers and showing them ’is leg till they was fair sick of the sight of it they paid ’im ten pounds the same as they ’ad bill  it took bob pretty two days to get his arf but he kept very quiet about it not wishing to make a fuss in the village for fear mr sutton should get to hear of the club at last he told henery walker that ’e was going to wickham to see ’is lawyer about it and arter smith the landlord ’ad read the paper to henery and explained ’ow he’d very likely ’ave to pay more than the whole ten pounds then ’e gave bob his arf and said he never wanted to see ’im again as long as he lived  bob stood treat up at the cauliflower that night and said ’ow bad he’d been treated the tears stood in ’is eyes a’most and at last ’e said that if ’e thought there was going to be any more fuss of that kind he’d wind up the club  it’s the best thing you can do ses sam jones i’m not going to belong to it any longer so i give you notice if so be as i get shot i want the money for myself  me too ses peter gubbins it ’ud fair break my ’art to give bob pretty five pounds i’d sooner give it to my wife  all the other chaps said the same thing but bob pointed out to them that they ’ad taken their sixpences on’y the night afore and they must stay in for the week he said that was the law some of ’em talked about giving ’im ’is sixpences back but bob said if they did they must pay up all the sixpences they had ’ad for three weeks the end of it was they said they’d stay in for that week and not a moment longer  the next day sam jones and peter gubbins altered their minds sam found a couple o’ shillings that his wife ’ad hidden in her sunday bonnet and peter gubbins opened ’is boy’s moneybox to see ’ow much there was in it they came up to the cauliflower to pay bob their eighteenpences but he wasn’t there and when they went to his ’ouse mrs pretty said as ’ow he’d gone off to wickham and wouldn’t be back till saturday so they ’ad to spend the money on beer instead  that was on tuesday and things went on all right till friday when mr sutton ’ad another shoot the birds was getting scarce and the gentlemen that anxious to shoot them there was no ’olding them once or twice the keepers spoke to ’em about carefulness and said wot large families they’d got but it wasn’t much good they went on blazing away and just at the corner of the wood sam jones and peter gubbins was both hit sam in the leg and peter in the arm  the noise that was made was awful—everybody shouting that they ’adn’t done it and all speaking at once and mr sutton was dancing about a’most beside ’imself with rage pore sam and peter was ’elped along by the others sam being carried and peter led and both of ’em with the idea of getting all they could out of it making such ’orrible noises that mr sutton couldn’t hear ’imself calling his friends names  there seems to be wounded men calling out all over the place he ses in a temper  i think there is another one over there sir ses one o’ the keepers pointing  sam jones and peter gubbins both left off to listen and then they all heard it distinctly a dreadful noise it was and when mr sutton and one or two more follered it up they found poor walter bell lying on ’is face in a bramble  wot’s the matter ses mr sutton shouting at ’im  i’ve been shot from behind ses walter i’d got something in my boot and i was just stooping down to fasten it up agin when i got it  but there oughtn’t to be anybody ’ere ses mr sutton to one of the keepers  they get all over the place sir ses the ’keeper scratching his ’ead i fancied i ’eard a gun go off here a minute or two arter the others was shot  i believe he’s done it ’imself says mr sutton stamping his foot  i don’t see ’ow he could sir ses the keeper touching his cap and looking at walter as was still lying with ’is face on ’is arms  they carried walter ’ome that way on a hurdle and dr green spent all the rest o’ that day picking shots out o’ them three men and telling ’em to keep still he ’ad to do sam jones by candlelight with mrs jones ’olding the candle with one hand and crying with the other twice the doctor told her to keep it steady and poor sam ’ad only just passed the remark how ’ot it was for october when they discovered that the bed was on fire the doctor said that sam was no trouble he got off of the bed by ’imself and when it was all over and the fire put out the doctor found him sitting on the stairs with the leg of a broken chair in ’is hand calling for ’is wife  of course there was a terrible todo about it in claybury and up at the hall too all of the gentlemen said as ’ow they hadn’t done it and mr sutton was arf crazy with rage he said that they ’ad made ’im the laughingstock of the neighbourhood and that they oughtn’t to shoot with anything but popguns they got to such high words over it that two of the gentlemen went off ’ome that very night  there was a lot of talk up at the cauliflower too and more than one pointed out ’ow lucky bob pretty was in getting four men out of the six in his club as i said afore bob was away at the time but he came back the next night and we ’ad the biggest row here you could wish for to see  henery walker began it i s’pose you’ve ’eard the dreadful news bob pretty he ses looking at ’im  i ’ave ses bob and my ’art bled for ’em i told you wot those gentlemen was like didn’t i but none of you would believe me now you can see as i was right  it’s very strange ses henery walker looking round it’s very strange that all of us wot’s been shot belonged to bob pretty’s precious club  it’s my luck henery ses bob always was lucky from a child  and i s’pose you think you’re going to ’ave arf of the money they get ses henery walker  don’t talk about money while them pore chaps is suffering ses bob i’m surprised at you henery  you won’t ’ave a farthing of it ses henery walker and wot’s more bob pretty i’m going to ’ave my five pounds back  don’t you believe it henery ses bob smiling at ’im  i’m going to ’ave my five pounds back ses henery and you know why i know wot your club was for now and we was all a pack o’ silly fools not to see it afore  speak for yourself henery ses john biggs who thought henery was looking at ’im  i’ve been putting two and two together ses henery looking round and it’s as plain as the nose on your face bob pretty hid up in the wood and shot us all himself  for a moment you might ’ave heard a pin drop and then there was such a noise nobody could hear theirselves speak everybody was shouting his ’ardest and the on’y quiet one there was bob pretty ’imself  poor henery he’s gorn mad he ses shaking his ’ead  you’re a murderer ses ralph thomson shaking ’is fist at him  henery walker’s gorn mad ses bob agin why i ain’t been near the place there’s a dozen men’ll swear that i was at wickham each time these misfortunate accidents ’appened  men like you they’d swear anything for a pot o’ beer ses henery but i’m not going to waste time talking to you bob pretty i’m going straight off to tell mr sutton  i shouldn’t do that if i was you henery ses bob  i dessay ses henery walker but then you see i am  i thought you’d gorn mad henery ses bob taking a drink o’ beer that somebody ’ad left on the table by mistake and now i’m sure of it why if you tell mr sutton that it wasn’t his friends that shot them pore fellers he won’t pay them anything ’tain’t likely ’e would is it  henery walker wot ’ad been standing up looking fierce at ’im sat down agin struck all of a heap  and he might want your ten pounds back henery said bob in a soft voice and seeing as ’ow you was kind enough to give five to me and spent most of the other it ’ud come ’ard on you wouldn’t it always think afore you speak henery i always do  henery walker got up and tried to speak but ’e couldn’t and he didn’t get ’is breath back till bob said it was plain to see that he ’adn’t got a word to say for ’imself then he shook ’is fist at bob and called ’im a low thieving poaching murderer  you’re not yourself henery ses bob when you come round you’ll be sorry for trying to take away the character of a pore labourin’ man with a ailing wife and a large family but if you take my advice you won’t say anything more about your wicked ideas if you do these pore fellers won’t get a farthing and you’d better keep quiet about the club mates for their sakes other people might get the same crazy ideas in their silly ’eads as henery keepers especially  that was on’y common sense but as john biggs said it did seem ’ard to think as ’ow bob pretty should be allowed to get off scotfree and with henery walker’s five pounds too there’s one thing he ses to bob you won’t ’ave any of these other pore chaps money and if they’re men they ought to make it up to henery walker for the money he ’as saved ’em by finding you out  they’ve got to pay me fust ses bob i’m a pore man but i’ll stick up for my rights as for me shooting ’em they’d ha’ been ’urt a good deal more if i’d done it—especially mr henery walker why they’re hardly ’urt at all  don’t answer ’im henery ses john biggs you save your breath to go and tell sam jones and the others about it it’ll cheer ’em up  and tell ’em about my arf in case they get too cheerful and go overdoing it ses bob pretty stopping at the door goodnight all  nobody answered ’im and arter waiting a little bit henery walker set off to see sam jones and the others john biggs was quite right about its making ’em cheerful but they see as plain as bob ’imself that it ’ad got to be kept quiet till we’ve spent the money at any rate ses walter bell then p’r’aps mr sutton might get bob locked up for it  mr sutton went down to see ’em all a day or two afterwards the shootingparty was broken up and gone ’ome but they left some money behind ’em ten pounds each they was to ’ave same as the others but mr sutton said that he ’ad heard ’ow the other money was wasted at the cauliflower and ’e was going to give it out to ’em ten shillings a week until the money was gorn he ’ad to say it over and over agin afore they understood ’im and walter bell ’ad to stuff the bedclo’es in ’is mouth to keep civil  peter gubbins with ’is arm tied up in a sling was the fust one to turn up at the cauliflower and he was that down’arted about it we couldn’t do nothing with ’im he ’ad expected to be able to pull out ten golden sovereigns and the disapp’intment was too much for ’im  i wonder ’ow they heard about it ses dicky weed  i can tell you ses bob pretty wot ’ad been sitting up in a corner by himself nodding and smiling at peter wot wouldn’t look at ’im a friend o’ mine at wickham wrote to him about it he was so disgusted at the way bill chambers and henery walker come up ’ere wasting their ’ardearned money that he sent ’im a letter signed ’a friend of the working man’ telling ’im about it and advising ’im what to do  a friend o’ yours ses john biggs staring at ’im what for  i don’t know ses bob he’s a wunnerful good scholard and he likes writin’ letters he’s going to write another tomorrer unless i go over and stop ’im  another ses peter who ’ad been tellin’ everybody that ’e wouldn’t speak to ’im agin as long as he lived wot about  about the idea that i shot you all ses bob i want my character cleared o’ course they can’t prove anything against me—i’ve got my witnesses but taking one thing with another i see now that it does look suspicious and i don’t suppose any of you’ll get any more of your money mr sutton is so sick o’ being laughed at he’ll jump at anything  you dursn’t do it bob ses peter all of a tremble  it ain’t me peter old pal ses bob it’s my friend but i don’t mind stopping ’im for the sake of old times if i get my arf he’d listen to me i feel sure  at fust peter said he wouldn’t get a farthing out of ’im if his friend wrote letters till doomsday but byandby he thought better of it and asked bob to stay there while he went down to see sam and walter about it when ’e came back he’d got the fust week’s money for bob pretty but he said he left walter bell carrying on like a madman and as for sam jones he was that upset ’e didn’t believe he’d last out the night     the temptation of samuel burge     mr higgs jeweller sat in the small parlour behind his shop gazing hungrily at a suppertable which had been laid some time before it was a quarter to ten by the small town clock on the mantelpiece and the jeweller rubbing his hands over the fire tried in vain to remember what etiquette had to say about starting a meal before the arrival of an expected guest  he must be coming by the last train after all sir said the housekeeper entering the room and glancing at the clock i suppose these london gentlemen keep such late hours they don’t understand us country folk wanting to get to bed in decent time you must be wanting your supper sir  mr higgs sighed i shall be glad of my supper he said slowly but i dare say our friend is hungrier still travelling is hungry work  perhaps he is thinking over his words for the seventh day said the housekeeper solemnly forgetting hunger and thirst and all our poor earthly feelings in the blessedness of his work  perhaps so assented the other whose own earthly feelings were particularly strong just at that moment  brother simpson used to forget all about mealtimes when he stayed here said the housekeeper clasping her hands he used to sit by the window with his eyes halfclosed and shake his head at the smell from the kitchen and call it fleshpots of egypt he said that if it wasn’t for keeping up his strength for the work luscious bread and fair water was all he wanted i expect brother burge will be a similar sort of man  brother clark wrote and told me that he only lives for the work said the jeweller with another glance at the clock the chapel at clerkenwell is crowded to hear him it’s a blessed favour and privilege to have such a selected instrument staying in the house i’m curious to see him from what brother clark said i rather fancy that he was a little bit wild in his younger days  hallelujah exclaimed the housekeeper with fervour i mean to think as he’s seen the error of his ways she added sharply as her master looked up  there he is said the latter as the bell rang  the housekeeper went to the sidedoor and drawing back the bolt admitted the gentleman whose preaching had done so much for the small but select sect known as the seventh day primitive apostles she came back into the room followed by a tall stout man whose upper lip and short stubby beard streaked with grey seemed a poor match for the beady eyes which lurked behind a pair of clumsy spectacles  brother samuel burge inquired the jeweller rising  the visitor nodded and regarding him with a smile charged with fraternal love took his hand in a huge grip and shook it fervently  i am glad to see you brother higgs he said regarding him fondly oh ’ow my eyes have yearned to be set upon you oh ’ow my ears ’ave longed to hearken unto the words of your voice  he breathed thickly and taking a seat sat with his hands upon his knees looking at a fine piece of cold beef which the housekeeper had just placed upon the table  is brother clark well inquired the jeweller placing a chair for him at the table and taking up his carvingknife  dear brother clark is in excellent ’ealth i thank you said the other taking the proffered chair oh what a man he is what a instrument for good always stretching out them blessed hands of ’is to make one of the fallen a seventh day primitive  and success attends his efforts said the jeweller  success brother repeated mr burge eating rapidly and gesticulating with his knife success ain’t no name for it why since this day last week he has saved three pickpockets two salvationists one bigamist and a roman catholic  brother higgs murmured his admiration you are also a power for good he said wistfully brother clark tells me in his letter that your exhortations have been abundantly blessed  mr burge shook his head a lot of it falls by the wayside he said modestly but some of it is an eyeopener to them as don’t entirely shut their ears only the day before yesterday i ’ad two jemmies and a dark lantern sent me with a letter saying as ’ow the owner had no further use for ’em  the jeweller’s eyes glistened with admiration not quite untinged with envy have you expounded the word for long he inquired  six months replied the other it come to me quite natural—i was on the penitent bench on the saturday and the wednesday afterwards i preached as good a sermon as ever i’ve preached in my life brother clark said it took ’is breath away  and he’s a judge too said the admiring jeweller  now continued brother burge helping himself plentifully to pickled walnuts now there ain’t standing room in our bethel when i’m expounding people come to hear me from all parts—old and young—rich and poor—and the apostles that don’t come early ’ave to stand outside and catch the crumbs i throw ’em through the winders  it is enough sighed brother higgs whose own audience was frequently content to be on the wrong side of the window it is enough to make a man vain  i struggle against it brother said mr burge passing his cup up for some more tea i fight against it hard but once the evil one was almost too much for me and in spite of myself and knowing besides that it was a plot of ’is i nearly felt uplifted  brother higgs passing him some more beef pressed for details  he sent me two policemen replied the other scowling darkly at the meanness of the trick one i might ’ave stood but two come to being pretty near too much for me they sat under me while i gave ’em the word ’ot and strong and the feeling i had standing up there and telling policemen what they ought to do i shall never forget  but why should policemen make you proud asked his puzzled listener  mr burge looked puzzled in his turn why hasn’t brother clark told you about me he inquired  mr higgs shook his head he sort of—suggested that—that you had been a little bit wild before you came to us he murmured apologetically  a—little—bit—wild repeated brother burge in horrified accents me a little bit wild  no doubt he exaggerated a little said the jeweller hurriedly being such a good man himself no doubt things would seem wild to him that wouldn’t to us—to me i mean  a little bit wild said his visitor again sam burge the converted burglar a little bit wild well well  converted what shouted the jeweller halfrising from his chair  burglar said the other shortly why i should think i know more about the inside o’ gaols than anybody in england i’ve pretty near killed three policemen besides breaking a gent’s leg and throwing a footman out of window and then brother clark goes and says i’ve been a little bit wild i wonder what he would ’ave  but you—you’ve quite reformed now said the jeweller resuming his seat and making a great effort to hide his consternation  i ’ope so said mr burge with alarming humility but it’s an uncertain world and far be it from me to boast that’s why i’ve come here  mr higgs only halfcomprehending sat back gasping  if i can stand this pursued brother burge gesticulating wildly in the direction of the shop if i can stand being here with all these ’ere pretty little things to be ’ad for the trouble of picking of ’em up i can stand anything tempt me i says to brother clark put me in the way o’ temptation i says let me see whether the evil one or me is the strongest let me ’ave a good old up and down with the powers o’ darkness and see who wins  mr higgs gripping the edge of the table with both hands gazed at this new michael in speechless consternation  i think i see his face now said brother burge with tender enthusiasm all in a glow it was and he patted me on the shoulder and says ’i’ll send you on a week’s mission to duncombe’ he says and ’you shall stop with brother higgs who ’as a shop full o’ cunning wrought vanities in silver and gold’  but suppose said the jeweller finding his voice by a great effort suppose victory is not given unto you  it won’t make any difference replied his visitor brother clark promised that it shouldn’t ’if you fall brother’ he says ’we’ll help you up again when you are tired of sin come back to us—there’s always a welcome’  but— began the dismayed jeweller  we can only do our best said brother burge the rest we must leave i ’ave girded my loins for the fray and taken much spiritual sustenance on the way down from this little hymnbook  mr higgs paid no heed he sat marvelling over the fatuousness of brother clark and trying to think of ways and means out of the dilemma into which that gentleman’s perverted enthusiasm had placed him he wondered whether it would be possible to induce brother burge to sleep elsewhere by offering to bear his hotel expenses and at last after some hesitation broached the subject  what exclaimed the other pushing his plate from him and regarding him with great severity go and sleep at a hotel after brother clark has been and took all this trouble why i wouldn’t think of doing such a thing  brother clark has no right to expose you to such a trial said mr higgs with great warmth  i wonder what he’d say if he ’eard you remarked mr burge sternly after his going and making all these arrangements for you to try and go and upset ’em to ask me to shun the fight like a coward to ask me to go and hide in the rearranks in a hotel with everything locked up or a coffer pallis with nothing to steal  i should sleep far more comfortably if i knew that you were not undergoing this tremendous strain said the unhappy mr higgs and besides that if you did give way it would be a serious business for me —that’s what i want you to look at i am afraid that if—if unhappily you did fall i couldn’t prevent you  i’m sure you couldn’t said the other cordially that’s the beauty of it that’s when the evil one’s whispers get louder and louder why i could choke you between my finger and thumb if unfortunately my fallen nature should be too strong for me don’t interfere whatever you do i mightn’t be myself  mr higgs rose and faced him gasping  not even—call for—the police—i suppose he jerked out  that would be interfering said brother burge coldly  the jeweller tried to think it was past eleven the housekeeper had gone to spend the night with an ailing sister and a furtive glance at brother burge’s small shifty eyes and fat unwholesome face was sufficient to deter him from leaving him alone with his property while he went to ask the police to give an eye to his house for the night besides it was more than probable that mr burge would decline to allow such a proceeding with a growing sense of his peril he resolved to try flattery  it was a great thing for the brethren to secure a man like you he said  i never thought they’d ha’ done it said mr burge frankly i’ve ’ad all sorts trying to convert me crying over me and praying over me i remember the first dear good man that called me a lorst lamb he didn’t say anything else for a month  so upset hazarded the jeweller  i broke his jor pore feller said brother burge a sad but withal indulgent smile lighting up his face at the vagaries of his former career what time do you go to bed brother  any time said the other reluctantly i suppose you are tired with your journey  mr burge assented and rising from his chair yawned loudly and stretched himself in the small room with his huge arms raised he looked colossal  i suppose said the jeweller still seeking to reassure himself i suppose dear brother clark felt pretty certain of you else he wouldn’t have sent you here  brother clark said ’what is a jeweller’s shop compared with a ’uman soul a priceless ’uman soul’ replied mr burge what is a few gewgaws to decorate them that perish and make them vain when you come to consider the opportunity of such a trial and the good it’ll do and the draw it’ll be—if i do win—and testify to the congregation to that effect why there’s sermons for a lifetime in it  so there is said the jeweller trying to look cheerful you’ve got a good face brother burge and you’ll do a lot of good by your preaching there is honesty written in every feature  mr burge turned and surveyed himself in the small pierglass yes he said somewhat discontentedly i don’t look enough like a burglar to suit some of ’em  some people are hard to please said the other warmly  mr burge started and eyed him thoughtfully and then as mr higgs after some hesitation walked into the shop to turn the gas out stood in the doorway watching him a smothered sigh as he glanced round the shop bore witness to the state of his feelings  the jeweller hesitated again in the parlour and then handing brother burge his candle turned out the gas and led the way slowly upstairs to the room which had been prepared for the honoured visitor he shook hands at the door and bade him an effusive goodnight his voice trembling despite himself as he expressed a hope that mr burge would sleep well he added casually that he himself was a very light sleeper  tonight sleep of any kind was impossible he had given up the front room to his guest and his own window looked out on an overgrown garden he sat trying to read with his ears alert for the slightest sound brother burge seemed to be a long time undressing for half an hour after he had retired he could hear him moving restlessly about his room  twelve o’clock struck from the tower of the parish church and was followed almost directly by the tall clock standing in the hall downstairs scarcely had the sounds died away than a low moaning from the next room caused the affrighted jeweller to start from his chair and place his ear against the wall two or three hollow groans came through the plaster followed by ejaculations which showed clearly that brother burge was at that moment engaged in a terrified combat with the powers of darkness to decide whether he should or should not rifle his host’s shop his hands clenched and his ear pressed close to the wall the jeweller listened to a monologue which increased in interest with every word  i tell you i won’t said the voice in the next room with a groan i won’t get thee behind me—get thee—no and don’t shove me over to the door if you can’t get behind me without doing that stay where you are yes i know it’s a fortune as well as what you do but it ain’t mine  the listener caught his breath painfully  diamond rings continued brother burge in a suffocating voice stop it i tell you no i won’t just go and look at ’em  a series of groans which the jeweller noticed to his horror got weaker and weaker testified to the greatness of the temptation he heard brother burge rise and then a succession of panting snarls seemed to indicate a fierce bodily encounter  i don’t—want to look at ’em said brother burge in an exhausted voice what’s—the good of—looking at ’em it’s like you you know diamonds are my weakness what does it matter if he is asleep what’s my knife got to do with you  brother higgs reeled back and a mist passed before his eyes he came to himself at the sound of a door opening and impelled with a vague idea of defending his property snatched up his candle and looked out on to the landing  the light fell on brother burge fully dressed and holding his boots in his hand for a moment they gazed at each other in silence then the jeweller found his voice  i thought you were ill brother he faltered  an ugly scowl lit up the other’s features don’t you tell me any of your lies he said fiercely you’re watching me that’s what you’re doing spying on me  i thought that you were being tempted confessed the trembling mr higgs  an expression of satisfaction which he strove to suppress appeared on mr burge’s face  so i was he said sternly so i was but that’s my business i don’t want your assistance i can fight my own battles you go to bed—i’m going to tell the congregation i won the fight single’anded  so you have brother said the other eagerly but it’s doing me good to see it it’s a lesson to me a lesson to all of us the way you wrestled  i thought you was asleep growled brother burge turning back to his room and speaking over his shoulder you get back to bed the fight ain’t half over yet get back to bed and keep quiet  the door closed behind him and mr higgs still trembling regained his room and looked in agony at the clock it was only halfpast twelve and the sun did not rise until six he sat and shivered until a second instalment of groans in the next room brought him in desperation to his feet  brother burge was in the toils again and the jeweller despite his fears could not help realizing what a sensation the story of his temptation would create brother burge was now going round and round his room like an animal in a cage and sounds as of a soul wrought almost beyond endurance smote upon the listener’s quivering ear then there was a long silence more alarming even than the noise of the conflict had brother burge won and was he now sleeping the sleep of the righteous or—— mr higgs shivered and put his other ear to the wall then he heard his guest move stealthily across the floor the boards creaked and the handle of the door turned  mr higgs started and with a sudden flash of courage born of anger and desperation seized a small brass poker from the fireplace and taking the candle in his other hand went out on to the landing again brother burge was closing his door softly and his face when he turned it upon the jeweller was terrible in its wrath his small eyes snapped with fury and his huge hands opened and shut convulsively  what agin he said in a low growl after all i told you  mr higgs backed slowly as he advanced  no noise said mr burge in a dreadful whisper one scream and i’ll— what were you going to do with that poker  he took a stealthy step forward  i—i began the jeweller his voice failed him burglars he mouthed downstairs  what said the other pausing  mr higgs threw truth to the winds i heard them in the shop he said recovering that’s why i took up the poker can’t you hear them  mr burge listened for the fraction of a second nonsense he said huskily  i heard them talking said the other recklessly let’s go down and call the police  call ’em from the winder said brother burge backing with some haste they might ’ave pistols or something and they’re ugly customers when they’re disturbed  he stood with strained face listening  here they come whispered the jeweller with a sudden movement of alarm  brother burge turned and bolting into his room clapped the door to and locked it the jeweller stood dumbfounded on the landing then he heard the window go up and the voice of brother burge much strengthened by the religious exercises of the past six months bellowing lustily for the police  for a few seconds mr higgs stood listening and wondering what explanation he should give still thinking he ran downstairs and throwing open the pantry window unlocked the door leading into the shop and scattered a few of his cherished possessions about the floor by the time he had done this people were already beating upon the streetdoor and exchanging hurried remarks with mr burge at the window above the jeweller shot back the bolts and halfadozen neighbours headed by the butcher opposite clad in his nightgown and armed with a cleaver burst into the passage a constable came running up just as the pallid face of brother burge peered over the balusters the constable went upstairs three at a time and twisting his hand in the exburglar’s neckcloth bore him backwards  i’ve got one he shouted come up and hold him while i look round  the butcher was beside him in a moment brother burge struggling wildly called loudly upon the name of brother higgs  that’s all right constable said the latter that’s a friend of mine  friend o’ yours sir said the disappointed officer still holding him  the jeweller nodded mr samuel burge the converted burglar he said mechanically  conver—— gasped the astonished constable converted burglar here  he is a preacher now added mr higgs  preacher retorted the constable why it’s as plain as a pikestaff confederates his part was to go down and let ’em in  mr burge raised a piteous outcry i hope you may be forgiven for them words he cried piously  what time did you go up to bed pursued the constable  about halfpast eleven replied mr higgs  the other grunted with satisfaction and he’s fully dressed with his boots off he remarked did you hear him go out of his room at all  he did go out said the jeweller truthfully but——  i thought so said the constable turning to his prisoner with affectionate solicitude now you come along o’ me come quietly because it’ll be the best for you in the end  you won’t get your skull split open then added the butcher toying with his cleaver  the jeweller hesitated he had no desire to be left alone with mr burge again and a sense of humour which many years’ association with the primitive apostles had not quite eradicated strove for hearing  think of the sermon it’ll make he said encouragingly to the frantic mr burge think of the congregation  brother burge replied in language which he had not used in public since he had joined the apostles the butcher and another man stood guard over him while the constable searched the premises and made all secure again then with a final appeal to mr higgs who was keeping in the background he was pitched to the policestation by the energetic constable and five zealous assistants  a diffidence natural in the circumstances prevented him from narrating the story of his temptation to the magistrates next morning and mr higgs was equally reticent he was put back while the police communicated with london and in the meantime brother clark and a band of apostles flanked down to his support  on his second appearance before the magistrates he was confronted with his past and his past to the great astonishment of the brethren being free from all blemish with the solitary exception of fourteen days for stealing milkcans he was discharged with a caution the disillusioned primitive apostles also gave him his freedom     the madness of mr lister     old jem lister of the susannah was possessed of two devils—the love of strong drink and avarice—and the only thing the twain had in common was to get a drink without paying for it when mr lister paid for a drink the demon of avarice masquerading as conscience preached a teetotal lecture and when he showed signs of profiting by it the demon of drink would send him hanging round publichouse doors cadging for drinks in a way which his shipmates regarded as a slur upon the entire ship’s company many a healthy thirst reared on salt beef and tickled with strong tobacco had been spoiled by the sight of mr lister standing by the entrance with a propitiatory smile waiting to be invited in to share it and on one occasion they had even seen him him jem lister ab holding a horse’s head with ulterior motives  it was pointed out to mr lister at last that his conduct was reflecting discredit upon men who were fully able to look after themselves in that direction without having any additional burden thrust upon them bill henshaw was the spokesman and on the score of violence miscalled firmness his remarks left little to be desired on the score of profanity bill might recall with pride that in the opinion of his fellows he had left nothing unsaid  you ought to ha’ been a member o’ parliament bill said harry lea when he had finished  it wants money said henshaw shaking his head  mr lister laughed a senile laugh but not lacking in venom  that’s what we’ve got to say said henshaw turning upon him suddenly if there’s anything i hate in this world it’s a drinking miser you know our opinion and the best thing you can do is to turn over a new leaf now  take us all in to the goat and compasses urged lea bring out some o’ those sovrins you’ve been hoarding  mr lister gazed at him with frigid scorn and finding that the conversation still seemed to centre round his unworthy person went up on deck and sat glowering over the insults which had been heaped upon him his futile wrath when bill dogged his footsteps ashore next day and revealed his character to a bibulous individual whom he had almost persuaded to be a christian—from his point of view—bordered upon the maudlin and he wandered back to the ship wildeyed and dry of throat  for the next two months it was safe to say that every drink he had he paid for his eyes got brighter and his complexion clearer nor was he as pleased as one of the other sex might have been when the selfsatisfied henshaw pointed out these improvements to his companions and claimed entire responsibility for them it is probable that mr lister under these circumstances might in time have lived down his taste for strong drink but that at just that time they shipped a new cook  he was a big cadaverous young fellow who looked too closely after his own interests to be much of a favourite with the other men forward on the score of thrift it was soon discovered that he and mr lister had much in common and the latter pleased to find a congenial spirit was disposed to make the most of him and spent despite the heat much of his spare time in the galley  you keep to it said the greybeard impressively money was made to be took care of if you don’t spend your money you’ve always got it i’ve always been a saving man—what’s the result  the cook waiting some time in patience to be told gently inquired what it was  ’ere am i said mr lister goodnaturedly helping him to cut a cabbage at the age of sixtytwo with a bankbook down below in my chest with one hundered an’ ninety pounds odd in it  one ’undered and ninety pounds repeated the cook with awe  to say nothing of other things continued mr lister with joyful appreciation of the effect he was producing altogether i’ve got a little over four ’undered pounds  the cook gasped and with gentle firmness took the cabbage from him as being unfit work for a man of such wealth  it’s very nice he said slowly it’s very nice you’ll be able to live on it in your old age  mr lister shook his head mournfully and his eyes became humid  there’s no old age for me he said sadly but you needn’t tell them and he jerked his thumb towards the forecastle  no no said the cook  i’ve never been one to talk over my affairs said mr lister in a low voice i’ve never yet took fancy enough to anybody so to do no my lad i’m saving up for somebody else  what are you going to live on when you’re past work then demanded the other  mr lister took him gently by the sleeve and his voice sank with the solemnity of his subject i’m not going to have no old age he said resignedly  not going to live repeated the cook gazing uneasily at a knife by his side how do you know  i went to a orsepittle in london said mr lister i’ve been to two or three altogether while the money i’ve spent on doctors is more than i like to think of and they’re all surprised to think that i’ve lived so long i’m so chockfull o’ complaints that they tell me i can’t live more than two years and i might go off at any moment  well you’ve got money said the cook why don’t you knock off work now and spend the evenin’ of your life ashore why should you save up for your relatives  i’ve got no relatives said mr lister i’m all alone i ’spose i shall leave my money to some nice young feller and i hope it’ll do ’im good  with the dazzling thoughts which flashed through the cook’s brain the cabbage dropped violently into the saucepan and a shower of cooling drops fell on both men  i ’spose you take medicine he said at length  a little rum said mr lister faintly the doctors tell me that it is the only thing that keeps me up—o’ course the chaps down there —he indicated the forecastle again with a jerk of his head—accuse me o’ taking too much  what do ye take any notice of ’em for inquired the other indignantly  i ’spose it is foolish admitted mr lister but i don’t like being misunderstood i keep my troubles to myself as a rule cook i don’t know what’s made me talk to you like this i ’eard the other day you was keeping company with a young woman  well i won’t say as i ain’t replied the other busying himself over the fire  an’ the best thing too my lad said the old man warmly it keeps you stiddy keeps you out of public’ouses not as they ain’t good in moderation—i ’ope you’ll be ’appy  a friendship sprang up between the two men which puzzled the remainder of the crew not a little  the cook thanked him and noticed that mr lister was fidgeting with a piece of paper  a little something i wrote the other day said the old man catching his eye if i let you see it will you promise not to tell a soul about it and not to give me no thanks  the wondering cook promised and the old man being somewhat emphatic on the subject backed his promise with a home made affidavit of singular power and profanity  here it is then said mr lister  the cook took the paper and as he read the letters danced before him he blinked his eyes and started again slowly in plain black and white and nondescriptcoloured fingermarks mr lister after a general statement as to his bodily and mental health left the whole of his estate to the cook the will was properly dated and witnessed and the cook’s voice shook with excitement and emotion as he offered to hand it back  i don’t know what i’ve done for you to do this he said  mr lister waved it away again keep it he said simply while you’ve got it on you you’ll know it’s safe  from this moment a friendship sprang up between the two men which puzzled the remainder of the crew not a little the attitude of the cook was as that of a son to a father the benignancy of mr lister beautiful to behold it was noticed too that he had abandoned the reprehensible practice of hanging round tavern doors in favour of going inside and drinking the cook’s health  for about six months the cook although always in somewhat straitened circumstances was well content with the tacit bargain and then bit by bit the character of mr lister was revealed to him it was not a nice character but subtle and when he made the startling discovery that a will could be rendered invalid by the simple process of making another one the next day he became as a man possessed when he ascertained that mr lister when at home had free quarters at the house of a married niece he used to sit about alone and try and think of ways and means of securing capital sunk in a concern which seemed to show no signs of being woundup  i’ve got a touch of the ’art again lad said the elderly invalid as they sat alone in the forecastle one night at seacole  you move about too much said the cook why not turn in and rest  mr lister who had not expected this fidgeted i think i’ll go ashore a bit and try the air he said suggestively i’ll just go as far as the black horse and back you won’t have me long now my lad  no i know said the cook that’s what’s worrying me a bit don’t worry about me said the old man pausing with his hand on the other’s shoulder i’m not worth it don’t look so glum lad  i’ve got something on my mind jem said the cook staring straight in front of him  what is it inquired mr lister  you know what you told me about those pains in your inside said the cook without looking at him  jem groaned and felt his side  and what you said about its being a relief to die continued the other only you was afraid to commit suicide  well said mr lister  it used to worry me continued the cook earnestly i used to say to myself ’poor old jem’ i ses ’why should ’e suffer like this when he wants to die it seemed ’ard’  it is ’ard said mr lister but what about it  the other made no reply but looking at him for the first time surveyed him with a troubled expression  what about it repeated mr lister with some emphasis  you did say you wanted to die didn’t you said the cook now suppose suppose——  suppose what inquired the old man sharply why don’t you say what you’re agoing to say  suppose said the cook some one what liked you jem—what liked you mind—’eard you say this over and over again an’ see you sufferin’ and ’eard you groanin’ and not able to do nothin’ for you except lend you a few shillings here and there for medicine or stand you a few glasses o’ rum suppose they knew a chap in a chemist’s shop  suppose they did said the other turning pale  a chap what knows all about p’isons continued the cook p’isons what a man can take without knowing it in ’is grub would it be wrong do you think if that friend i was speaking about put it in your food to put you out of your misery  wrong said mr lister with glassy eyes wrong look ’ere cook—  i don’t mean anything to give him pain said the other waving his hand you ain’t felt no pain lately ’ave you jem  do you mean to say shouted mr lister  i don’t mean to say anything said the cook answer my question you ain’t felt no pain lately ’ave you  have—you—been—putting—p’ison—in—my—wittles demanded mr lister in trembling accents  if i ’ad jem supposin’ that i ’ad said the cook in accents of reproachful surprise do you mean to say that you’d mind  mind said mr lister with fervour i’d ’ave you ’ung  but you said you wanted to die said the surprised cook  mr lister swore at him with startling vigour i’ll ’ave you ’ung he repeated wildly  me said the cook artlessly what for  for giving me p’ison said mr lister frantically do you think you can deceive me by your roundabouts do you think i can’t see through you  the other with a sphinxlike smile sat unmoved prove it he said darkly but supposin’ if anybody ’ad been givin’ you p’ison would you like to take something to prevent its acting  i’d take gallons of it said mr lister feverishly  the other sat pondering while the old man watched him anxiously it’s a pity you don’t know your own mind jem he said at length still you know your own business best but it’s very expensive stuff  how much inquired the other  well they won’t sell more than two shillingsworth at a time said the cook trying to speak carelessly but if you like to let me ’ave the money i’ll go ashore to the chemist’s and get the first lot now  mr lister’s face was a study in emotions which the other tried in vain to decipher  then he slowly extracted the amount from his trouserspocket and handed it over without a word  i’ll go at once said the cook with a little feeling and i’ll never take a man at his word again jem  he ran blithely up on deck and stepping ashore spat on the coins for luck and dropped them in his pocket down below mr lister with his chin in his hand sat in a state of mind pretty evenly divided between rage and fear  the cook who was in no mood for company missed the rest of the crew by two publichouses and having purchased a baby’s teething powder and removed the label had a congratulatory drink or two before going on board again a chatter of voices from the forecastle warned him that the crew had returned but the tongues ceased abruptly as he descended and three pairs of eyes surveyed him in grim silence  what’s up he demanded  wot ’ave you been doin’ to poor old jem demanded henshaw sternly  nothin’ said the other shortly  you ain’t been p’isoning ’im demanded henshaw  certainly not said the cook emphatically  he ses you told ’im you p’isoned ’im said henshaw solemnly and ’e give you two shillings to get something to cure ’im it’s too late now  what stammered the bewildered cook he looked round anxiously at the men  they were all very grave and the silence became oppressive where is he he demanded  henshaw and the others exchanged glances he’s gone mad said he slowly  mad repeated the horrified cook and seeing the aversion of the crew in a broken voice he narrated the way in which he had been victimized  well you’ve done it now said henshaw when he had finished he’s gone right orf ’is ’ed  where is he inquired the cook  where you can’t follow him said the other slowly  heaven hazarded the unfortunate cook no skipper’s bunk said lea  oh can’t i foller ’im said the cook starting up i’ll soon ’ave ’im out o’ that  better leave ’im alone said henshaw he was that wild we couldn’t do nothing with ’im singing an’ larfin’ and crying all together—i certainly thought he was p’isoned  i’ll swear i ain’t touched him said the cook  well you’ve upset his reason said henshaw there’ll be an awful row when the skipper comes aboard and finds ’im in ’is bed  ’well come an’ ’elp me to get ’im out said the cook  i ain’t going to be mixed up in it said henshaw shaking his head  don’t you bill said the other two  wot the skipper’ll say i don’t know said henshaw anyway it’ll be said to you not——  i’ll go and get ’im out if ’e was five madmen said the cook compressing his lips  you’ll harve to carry ’im out then said henshaw i don’t wish you no ’arm cook and perhaps it would be as well to get ’im out afore the skipper or mate comes aboard if it was me i know what i should do  what inquired the cook breathlessly  draw a sack over his head said henshaw impressively he’ll scream like blazes as soon as you touch him and rouse the folks ashore if you don’t besides that if you draw it well down it’ll keep his arms fast  the cook thanked him fervently and routing out a sack rushed hastily on deck his departure being the signal for mr henshaw and his friends to make preparations for retiring for the night so hastily as almost to savour of panic  the cook after a hasty glance ashore went softly below with the sack over his arm and felt his way in the darkness to the skipper’s bunk the sound of deep and regular breathing reassured him and without undue haste he opened the mouth of the sack and gently raised the sleeper’s head  eh wha—— began a sleepy voice  the next moment the cook had bagged him and gripping him tightly round the middle turned a deaf ear to the smothered cries of his victim as he strove to lift him out of the bunk in the exciting time which followed he had more than one reason for thinking that he had caught a centipede  now you keep still he cried breathlessly i’m not going to hurt you  he got his burden out of bed at last and staggered to the foot of the companionladder with it then there was a halt two legs sticking obstinately across the narrow way and refusing to be moved while a furious humming proceeded from the other end of the sack  four times did the exhausted cook get his shoulder under his burden and try and push it up the ladder and four times did it wriggle and fight its way down again half crazy with fear and rage he essayed it for the fifth time and had got it halfway up when there was a sudden exclamation of surprise from above and the voice of the mate sharply demanding an explanation  what the blazes are you up to he cried  it’s all right sir said the panting cook old jem’s had a drop too much and got down aft and i’m getting ’im for’ard again  jem said the astonished mate why he’s sitting up here on the forehatch he came aboard with me  sitting began the horrified cook sit—oh lor  he stood with his writhing burden wedged between his body and the ladder and looked up despairingly at the mate  i’m afraid i’ve made a mistake he said in a trembling voice  the mate struck a match and looked down  take that sack off he demanded sternly  the cook placed his burden upon its feet and running up the ladder stood by the mate shivering the latter struck another match and the twain watched in breathless silence the writhings of the strange creature below as the covering worked slowly upwards in the fourth match it got free and revealed the empurpled visage of the master of the susannah for the fraction of a second the cook gazed at him in speechless horror and then with a hopeless cry sprang ashore and ran for it hotly pursued by his enraged victim at the time of sailing he was still absent and the skipper loth to part two such friends sent mr james lister at the urgent request of the anxious crew to look for him     the white cat     the traveller stood looking from the taproom window of the cauliflower at the falling rain the village street below was empty and everything was quiet with the exception of the garrulous old man smoking with much enjoyment on the settle behind him  it’ll do a power o’ good said the ancient craning his neck round the edge of the settle and turning a bleared eye on the window i ain’t like some folk i never did mind a drop o’ rain  the traveller grunted and returning to the settle opposite the old man fell to lazily stroking a cat which had strolled in attracted by the warmth of the small fire which smouldered in the grate  he’s a good mouser said the old man but i expect that smith the landlord would sell ’im to anybody for arf a crown but we ’ad a cat in claybury once that you couldn’t ha’ bought for a hundred golden sovereigns  the traveller continued to caress the cat  a white cat with one yaller eye and one blue one continued the old man it sounds queer but it’s as true as i sit ’ere wishing that i ’ad another mug o’ ale as good as the last you gave me  the traveller with a start that upset the cat’s nerves finished his own mug and then ordered both to be refilled he stirred the fire into a blaze and lighting his pipe and putting one foot on to the hob prepared to listen  it used to belong to old man clark young joe clark’s uncle said the ancient smacking his lips delicately over the ale and extending a tremulous claw to the tobaccopouch pushed towards him and he was never tired of showing it off to people he used to call it ’is blueeyed darling and the fuss ’e made o’ that cat was sinful  young joe clark couldn’t bear it but being down in ’is uncle’s will for five cottages and a bit o’ land bringing in about forty pounds a year he ’ad to ’ide his feelings and pretend as he loved it he used to take it little drops o’ cream and titbits o’ meat and old clark was so pleased that ’e promised ’im that he should ’ave the cat along with all the other property when ’e was dead  young joe said he couldn’t thank ’im enough and the old man who ’ad been ailing a long time made ’im come up every day to teach ’im ’ow to take care of it arter he was gone he taught joe ’ow to cook its meat and then chop it up fine ’ow it liked a clean saucer every time for its milk and ’ow he wasn’t to make a noise when it was asleep  take care your children don’t worry it joe he ses one day very sharp one o’ your boys was pulling its tail this morning and i want you to clump his ’ead for ’im  which one was it ses joe  the slobberynosed one ses old clark  i’ll give ’im a clout as soon as i get ’ome ses joe who was very fond of ’is children  go and fetch ’im and do it ’ere ses the old man that’ll teach ’im to love animals  joe went off ’ome to fetch the boy and arter his mother ’ad washed his face and wiped his nose an’ put a clean pinneyfore on ’im he took ’im to ’is uncle’s and clouted his ’ead for ’im arter that joe and ’is wife ’ad words all night long and next morning old clark coming in from the garden was just in time to see ’im kick the cat right acrost the kitchen  he could ’ardly speak for a minute and when ’e could joe see plain wot a fool he’d been fust of all ’e called joe every name he could think of— which took ’im a long time—and then he ordered ’im out of ’is house  you shall ’ave my money wen your betters have done with it he ses and not afore that’s all you’ve done for yourself  joe clark didn’t know wot he meant at the time but when old clark died three months arterwards ’e found out his uncle ’ad made a new will and left everything to old george barstow for as long as the cat lived providing that he took care of it when the cat was dead the property was to go to joe  the cat was only two years old at the time and george barstow who was arf crazy with joy said it shouldn’t be ’is fault if it didn’t live another twenty years  the funny thing was the quiet way joe clark took it he didn’t seem to be at all cut up about it and when henery walker said it was a shame ’e said he didn’t mind and that george barstow was a old man and he was quite welcome to ’ave the property as long as the cat lived  it must come to me by the time i’m an old man he ses ard that’s all i care about  henery walker went off and as ’e passed the cottage where old clark used to live and which george barstow ’ad moved into ’e spoke to the old man over the palings and told ’im wot joe clark ’ad said george barstow only grunted and went on stooping and prying over ’is front garden  bin and lost something ses henery walker watching ’im  no i’m finding ses george barstow very fierce and picking up something that’s the fifth bit o’ powdered liver i’ve found in my garden this morning  henery walker went off whistling and the opinion he’d ’ad o’ joe clark began to improve he spoke to joe about it that arternoon and joe said that if ’e ever accused ’im o’ such a thing again he’d knock ’is ’ead off he said that he ’oped the cat ’ud live to be a hundred and that ’e’d no more think of giving it poisoned meat than henery walker would of paying for ’is drink so long as ’e could get anybody else to do it for ’im  they ’ad bets up at this ’ere cauliflower public’ouse that evening as to ’ow long that cat ’ud live nobody gave it more than a month and bill chambers sat and thought o’ so many ways o’ killing it on the sly that it was wunnerful to hear ’im  george barstow took fright when he ’eard of them and the care ’e took o’ that cat was wunnerful to behold arf its time it was shut up in the back bedroom and the other arf george barstow was fussing arter it till that cat got to hate ’im like pison instead o’ giving up work as he’d thought to do ’e told henery walker that ’e’d never worked so ’ard in his life  wot about fresh air and exercise for it ses henery  wot about joe clark ses george barstow i’m tied ’and and foot i dursent leave the house for a moment i ain’t been to the cauliflower since i’ve ’ad it and three times i got out o’ bed last night to see if it was safe  mark my words ses henery walker if that cat don’t ’ave exercise you’ll lose it  i shall lose it if it does ’ave exercise ses george barstow that i know  he sat down thinking arter henery walker ’ad gone and then he ’ad a little collar and chain made for it and took it out for a walk pretty nearly every dog in claybury went with ’em and the cat was in such a state o’ mind afore they got ’ome he couldn’t do anything with it it ’ad a fit as soon as they got indoors and george barstow who ’ad read about children’s fits in the almanac gave it a warm bath it brought it round immediate and then it began to tear round the room and up and downstairs till george barstow was afraid to go near it  it was so bad that evening sneezing that george barstow sent for bill chambers who’d got a good name for doctoring animals and asked ’im to give it something bill said he’d got some powders at ’ome that would cure it at once and he went and fetched ’em and mixed one up with a bit o’ butter  that’s the way to give a cat medicine he ses smear it with the butter and then it’ll lick it off powder and all  he was just going to rub it on the cat when george barstow caught ’old of ’is arm and stopped ’im  how do i know it ain’t pison he ses you’re a friend o’ joe clark’s and for all i know he may ha’ paid you to pison it  i wouldn’t do such a thing ses bill you ought to know me better than that  all right ses george barstow you eat it then and i’ll give you two shillings in stead o’ one you can easy mix some more  not me ses bill chambers making a face  well three shillings then ses george barstow getting more and more suspicious like four shillings—five shillings  bill chambers shook his ’ead and george barstow more and more certain that he ’ad caught ’im trying to kill ’is cat and that ’e wouldn’t eat the stuff rose ’im up to ten shillings  bill looked at the butter and then ’e looked at the ten shillings on the table and at last he shut ’is eyes and gulped it down and put the money in ’is pocket  you see i ’ave to be careful bill ses george barstow rather upset  bill chambers didn’t answer ’im he sat there as white as a sheet and making such extraordinary faces that george was arf afraid of ’im  anything wrong bill he ses at last  bill sat staring at ’im and then all of a sudden he clapped ’is ’andkerchief to ’is mouth and getting up from his chair opened the door and rushed out george barstow thought at fust that he ’ad eaten pison for the sake o’ the ten shillings but when ’e remembered that bill chambers ’ad got the most delikit stummick in claybury he altered ’is mind  the cat was better next morning but george barstow had ’ad such a fright about it ’e wouldn’t let it go out of ’is sight and joe clark began to think that ’e would ’ave to wait longer for that property than ’e had thought arter all to ’ear ’im talk anybody’d ha’ thought that ’e loved that cat we didn’t pay much attention to it up at the cauliflower ’ere except maybe to wink at ’im—a thing he couldn’t a bear—but at ’ome o’ course his young ’uns thought as everything he said was gospel and one day coming ’ome from work as he was passing george barstow’s he was paid out for his deceitfulness  i’ve wronged you joe clark ses george barstow coming to the door and i’m sorry for it  oh ses joe staring  give that to your little jimmy ses george barstow giving ’im a shilling i’ve give ’im one but i thought arterwards it wasn’t enough  what for ses joe staring at ’im agin  for bringing my cat ’ome ses george barstow ’ow it got out i can’t think but i lost it for three hours and i’d about given it up when your little jimmy brought it to me in ’is arms he’s a fine little chap and ’e does you credit  joe clark tried to speak but he couldn’t get a word out and henery walker wot ’ad just come up and ’eard wot passed took hold of ’is arm and helped ’im home he walked like a man in a dream but arfway he stopped and cut a stick from the hedge to take ’ome to little jimmy he said the boy ’ad been asking him for a stick for some time but up till then ’e’d always forgotten it  at the end o’ the fust year that cat was still alive to everybody’s surprise but george barstow took such care of it ’e never let it out of ’is sight every time ’e went out he took it with ’im in a hamper and to prevent its being pisoned he paid isaac sawyer who ’ad the biggest family in claybury sixpence a week to let one of ’is boys taste its milk before it had it  the second year it was ill twice but the horsedoctor that george barstow got for it said that it was as ’ard as nails and with care it might live to be twenty he said that it wanted more fresh air and exercise but when he ’eard ’ow george barstow come by it he said that p’r’aps it would live longer indoors arter all  at last one day when george barstow ’ad been living on the fat o’ the land for nearly three years that cat got out agin george ’ad raised the frontroom winder two or three inches to throw something outside and afore he knew wot was ’appening the cat was outside and going up the road about twenty miles an hour  george barstow went arter it but he might as well ha’ tried to catch the wind the cat was arf wild with joy at getting out agin and he couldn’t get within arf a mile of it  he stayed out all day without food or drink follering it about until it came on dark and then o’ course he lost sight of it and hoping against ’ope that it would come home for its food he went ’ome and waited for it he sat up all night dozing in a chair in the front room with the door left open but it was all no use and arter thinking for a long time wot was best to do he went out and told some o’ the folks it was lost and offered a reward of five pounds for it  you never saw such a hunt then in all your life nearly every man woman and child in claybury left their work or school and went to try and earn that five pounds by the arternoon george barstow made it ten pounds provided the cat was brought ’ome safe and sound and people as was too old to walk stood at their cottage doors to snap it up as it came by  joe clark was hunting for it ’igh and low and so was ’is wife and the boys in fact i b’lieve that everybody in claybury excepting the parson and bob pretty was trying to get that ten pounds  o’ course we could understand the parson—’is pride wouldn’t let ’im but a low poaching thieving rascal like bob pretty turning up ’is nose at ten pounds was more than we could make out even on the second day when george barstow made it ten pounds down and a shilling a week for a year besides he didn’t offer to stir all he did was to try and make fun o’ them as was looking for it  have you looked everywhere you can think of for it bill he ses to bill chambers yes i ’ave ses bill  well then you want to look everywhere else ses bob pretty i know where i should look if i wanted to find it  why don’t you find it then ses bill  ’cos i don’t want to make mischief ses bob pretty i don’t want to be unneighbourly to joe clark by interfering at all  not for all that money ses bill  not for fifty pounds ses bob pretty you ought to know me better than that bill chambers  it’s my belief that you know more about where that cat is than you ought to ses joe gubbins  you go on looking for it joe ses bob pretty grinning it’s good exercise for you and you’ve only lost two days’ work  i’ll give you arf a crown if you let me search your ’ouse bob ses bill chambers looking at ’im very ’ard  i couldn’t do it at the price bill ses bob pretty shaking his ’ead i’m a pore man but i’m very partikler who i ’ave come into my ’ouse  o’ course everybody left off looking at once when they heard about bob— not that they believed that he’d be such a fool as to keep the cat in his ’ouse and that evening as soon as it was dark joe clark went round to see ’im  don’t tell me as that cat’s found joe ses bob pretty as joe opened the door  not as i’ve ’eard of said joe stepping inside i wanted to speak to you about it the sooner it’s found the better i shall be pleased  it does you credit joe clark ses bob pretty  it’s my belief that it’s dead ses joe looking at ’im very ’ard but i want to make sure afore taking over the property  bob pretty looked at ’im and then he gave a little cough oh you want it to be found dead he ses now i wonder whether that cat’s worth most dead or alive  joe clark coughed then dead i should think he ses at last george barstow’s just ’ad bills printed offering fifteen pounds for it ses bob pretty  i’ll give that or more when i come into the property ses joe clark  there’s nothing like readymoney though is there ses bob  i’ll promise it to you in writing bob ses joe trembling  there’s some things that don’t look well in writing joe says bob pretty considering besides why should you promise it to me  o’ course i meant if you found it ses joe  well i’ll do my best joe ses bob pretty and none of us can do no more than that can they  they sat talking and argufying over it for over an hour and twice bob pretty got up and said ’e was going to see whether george barstow wouldn’t offer more by the time they parted they was as thick as thieves and next morning bob pretty was wearing joe clark’s watch and chain and mrs pretty was up at joe’s ’ouse to see whether there was any of ’is furniture as she ’ad a fancy for  she didn’t seem to be able to make up ’er mind at fust between a chest o’ drawers that ’ad belonged to joe’s mother and a grandfather clock she walked from one to the other for about ten minutes and then bob who ’ad come in to ’elp her told ’er to ’ave both  you’re quite welcome he ses ain’t she joe  joe clark said yes and arter he ’ad helped them carry ’em ’ome the prettys went back and took the best bedstead to pieces cos bob said as it was easier to carry that way mrs clark ’ad to go and sit down at the bottom o’ the garden with the neck of ’er dress undone to give herself air but when she saw the little prettys each walking ’ome with one of ’er best chairs on their ’eads she got and walked up and down like a mad thing  i’m sure i don’t know where we are to put it all ses bob pretty to joe gubbins wot was looking on with other folks but joe clark is that generous he won’t ’ear of our leaving anything  has ’e gorn mad ses bill chambers staring at ’im  not as i knows on ses bob pretty it’s ’is good’artedness that’s all he feels sure that that cat’s dead and that he’ll ’ave george barstow’s cottage and furniture i told ’im he’d better wait till he’d made sure but ’e wouldn’t  before they’d finished the prettys ’ad picked that ’ouse as clean as a bone and joe clark ’ad to go and get clean straw for his wife and children to sleep on not that mrs clark ’ad any sleep that night nor joe neither  henery walker was the fust to see what it really meant and he went rushing off as fast as ’e could run to tell george barstow george couldn’t believe ’im at fust but when ’e did he swore that if a ’air of that cat’s head was harmed ’e’d ’ave the law o’ bob pretty and arter henery walker ’ad gone ’e walked round to tell ’im so  you’re not yourself george barstow else you wouldn’t try and take away my character like that ses bob pretty  wot did joe clark give you all them things for ses george pointing to the furniture  took a fancy to me i s’pose ses bob people do sometimes there’s something about me at times that makes ’em like me  he gave ’em to you to kill my cat ses george barstow it’s plain enough for anybody to see  bob pretty smiled i expect it’ll turn up safe and sound one o’ these days he ses and then you’ll come round and beg my pardon p’r’aps—  p’r’aps wot ses george barstow arter waiting a bit  p’r’aps somebody ’as got it and is keeping it till you’ve drawed the fifteen pounds out o’ the bank ses bob looking at ’im very hard  i’ve taken it out o’ the bank ses george starting if that cat’s alive bob and you’ve got it there’s the fifteen pounds the moment you ’and it over  wot d’ye mean—me got it ses bob pretty you be careful o’ my character  i mean if you know where it is ses george barstow trembling all over  i don’t say i couldn’t find it if that’s wot you mean ses bob i can gin’rally find things when i want to  you find me that cat alive and well and the money’s yours bob ses george ’ardly able to speak now that ’e fancied the cat was still alive  bob pretty shook his ’ead no that won’t do he ses s’pose i did ’ave the luck to find that pore animal you’d say i’d had it all the time and refuse to pay  i swear i wouldn’t bob ses george barstow jumping up  best thing you can do if you want me to try and find that cat says bob pretty is to give me the fifteen pounds now and i’ll go and look for it at once i can’t trust you george barstow  and i can’t trust you ses george barstow  very good ses bob getting up there’s no ’arm done p’r’aps joe clark ’ll find the cat is dead and p’r’aps you’ll find it’s alive it’s all one to me  george barstow walked off ’ome but he was in such a state o’ mind ’e didn’t know wot to do bob pretty turning up ’is nose at fifteen pounds like that made ’im think that joe clark ’ad promised to pay ’im more if the cat was dead and at last arter worrying about it for a couple o’ hours ’e came up to this ’ere cauliflower and offered bob the fifteen pounds  wot’s this for ses bob  for finding my cat ses george  look here ses bob handing it back i’ve ’ad enough o’ your insults i don’t know where your cat is  i mean for trying to find it bob ses george barstow  oh well i don’t mind that ses bob taking it i’m a ’ardworking man and i’ve got to be paid for my time it’s on’y fair to my wife and children i’ll start now  he finished up ’is beer and while the other chaps was telling george barstow wot a fool he was joe clark slipped out arter bob pretty and began to call ’im all the names he could think of  don’t you worry ses bob the cat ain’t found yet  is it dead ses joe clark ’ardly able to speak  ’ow should i know ses bob that’s wot i’ve got to try and find out that’s wot you gave me your furniture for and wot george barstow gave me the fifteen pounds for ain’t it now don’t you stop me now ’cos i’m goin’ to begin looking  he started looking there and then and for the next two or three days george barstow and joe clark see ’im walking up and down with his ’ands in ’is pockets looking over garden fences and calling puss he asked everybody ’e see whether they ’ad seen a white cat with one blue eye and one yaller one and every time ’e came into the cauliflower he put his ’ead over the bar and called puss ’cos as ’e said it was as likely to be there as anywhere else  it was about a week after the cat ’ad disappeared that george barstow was standing at ’is door talking to joe clark who was saying the cat must be dead and ’e wanted ’is property when he sees a man coming up the road carrying a basket stop and speak to bill chambers just as ’e got near them an awful miaow come from the basket and george barstow and joe clark started as if they’d been shot  he’s found it shouts bill chambers pointing to the man  it’s been living with me over at ling for a week pretty nearly ses the man i tried to drive it away several times not knowing that there was fifteen pounds offered for it  george barstow tried to take ’old of the basket  i want that fifteen pounds fust ses the man  that’s on’y right and fair george ses bob pretty who ’ad just come up you’ve got all the luck mate we’ve been hunting ’igh and low for that cat for a week  then george barstow tried to explain to the man and call bob pretty names at the same time but it was all no good the man said it ’ad nothing to do with ’im wot he ’ad paid to bob pretty and at last they fetched policeman white over from cudford and george barstow signed a paper to pay five shillings a week till the reward was paid  george barstow ’ad the cat for five years arter that but he never let it get away agin they got to like each other in time and died within a fortnight of each other so that joe clark got ’is property arter all                                    ————
