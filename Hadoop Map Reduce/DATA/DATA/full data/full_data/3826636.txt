elegaic stanzas ode notes   poems written during a tour in scotland  rob roys grave    the history of rob roy is sufficiently known his grave     is near the head of loch ketterine in one of those small     pinfoldlike burialgrounds of neglected and desolate     appearance which the traveller meets with in the     highlands of scotland     a famous man is robin hood   the english balladsingers joy   and scotland has a thief as good   an outlaw of as daring mood   she has her brave rob roy   then clear the weeds from off his grave   and let us chaunt a passing stave   in honour of that hero brave    heaven gave rob roy a dauntless heart   and wondrous length and strength of arm                 10   nor craved he more to quell his foes   or keep his friends from harm    yet was rob roy as wise as brave   forgive me if the phrase be strong   poet worthy of rob roy   must scorn a timid song    say then that he was wise as brave   as wise in thought as bold in deed   for in the principles of things   he sought his moral creed                        20    said generous rob what need of books   burn all the statutes and their shelves   they stir us up against our kind   and worse against ourselves    we have a passion make a law   too false to guide us or controul   and for the law itself we fight   in bitterness of soul    and puzzled blinded thus we lose   distinctions that are plain and few                     30   these find i graven on my heart   that tells me what to do    the creatures see of flood and field   and those that travel on the wind   with them no strife can last they live   in peace and peace of mind    for whybecause the good old rule   sufficeth them the simple plan   that they should take who have the power   and they should keep who can                           40    a lesson which is quickly learnd   a signal this which all can see   thus nothing here provokes the strong   to wanton cruelty    all freakishness of mind is checkd   he tamd who foolishly aspires   while to the measure of his might   each fashions his desires    all kinds and creatures stand and fall   by strength of prowess or of wit                        50   tis gods appointment who must sway   and who is to submit    since then said robin right is plain   and longest life is but a day   to have my ends maintain my rights   ill take the shortest way    and thus among these rocks he livd   through summers heat and winters snow   the eagle he was lord above   and rob was lord below                                 60    so was itwould at least have been   but through untowardness of fate   for polity was then too strong   he came an age too late    or shall we say an age too soon   for were the bold man living now   how might he flourish in his pride   with buds on every bough    then rents and factors rights of chace   sheriffs and lairds and their domains                   70   would all have seemd but paltry things   not worth a moments pains    rob roy had never lingerd here   to these few meagre vales confind   but thought how wide the world the times   how fairly to his mind    and to his sword he would have said   do thou my sovereign will enact   from land to land through half the earth   judge thou of law and fact                             80    tis fit that we should do our part   becoming that mankind should learn   that we are not to be surpassd   in fatherly concern    of old things all are over old   of good things none are good enough   well shew that we can help to frame   a world of other stuff    i too will have my kings that take   from me the sign of life and death                      90   kingdoms shall shift about like clouds   obedient to my breath    and if the word had been fulfilld   as might have been then thought of joy   france would have had her present boast   and we our brave rob roy    oh say not so compare them not   i would not wrong thee champion brave   would wrong thee no where least of all   here standing by thy grave                             100    for thou although with some wild thoughts   wild chieftain of a savage clan   hadst this to boast of thou didst love   the liberty of man    and had it been thy lot to live   with us who now behold the light   thou wouldst have nobly stirrd thyself   and battled for the right    for robin was the poor mans stay   the poor mans heart the poor mans hand              110   and all the oppressd who wanted strength   had robins to command    bear witness many a pensive sigh   of thoughtful herdsman when he strays   alone upon loch veols heights   and by loch lomonds braes    and far and near through vale and hill   are faces that attest the same   and kindle like a fire new stirrd   at sound of rob roys name                             120      2 the solitary reaper     behold her single in the field   yon solitary highland lass   reaping and singing by herself   stop here or gently pass   alone she cuts and binds the grain   and sings a melancholy strain   o listen for the vale profound   is overflowing with the sound    no nightingale did ever chaunt   so sweetly to reposing bands                             10   of travellers in some shady haunt   among arabian sands   no sweeter voice was ever heard   in springtime from the cuckoobird   breaking the silence of the seas   among the farthest hebrides    will no one tell me what she sings   perhaps the plaintive numbers flow   for old unhappy faroff things   and battles long ago                                    20   or is it some more humble lay   familiar matter of today   some natural sorrow loss or pain   that has been and may be again    whateer the theme the maiden sung   as if her song could have no ending   i saw her singing at her work   and oer the sickle bending   i listend till i had my fill   and as i mounted up the hill                           30   the music in my heart i bore   long after it was heard no more     3 stepping westward    while my fellowtraveller and i were walking by the side of     loch ketterine one fine evening after sunset in our     road to a hut where in the course of our tour we had     been hospitably entertained some weeks before we met     in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region     two well dressed women one of whom said to us by     way of greeting what you are stepping westward     what you are stepping westwardyea   twould be a wildish destiny   if we who thus together roam   in a strange land and far from home   were in this place the guests of chance   yet who would stop or fear to advance   though home or shelter he had none   with such a sky to lead him on    the dewy ground was dark and cold   behind all gloomy to behold                            10   and stepping westward seemd to be   a kind of heavenly destiny   i liked the greeting twas a sound   of something without place or bound   and seemd to give me spiritual right   to travel through that region bright    the voice was soft and she who spake   was walking by her native lake   the salutation had to me   the very sound of courtesy                              20   its power was felt and while my eye   was fixed upon the glowing sky   the echo of the voice enwrought   a human sweetness with the thought   of travelling through the world that lay   before me in my endless way     4 glenalmain        or the narrow glen     in this still place remote from men   sleeps ossian in the narrow glen   in this still place where murmurs on   but one meek streamlet only one   he sang of battles and the breath   of stormy war and violent death   and should methinks when all was past   have rightfully been laid at last   where rocks were sudely heapd and rent   as by a spirit turbulent                                10   where sights were rough and sounds were wild   and every thing unreconciled   in some complaining dim retreat   for fear and melancholy meet   but this is calm there cannot be   a more entire tranquillity    does then the bard sleep here indeed   or is it but a groundless creed   what matters it i blame them not   whose fancy in this lonely spot                          20   was moved and in this way expressd   their notion of its perfect rest   a convent even a hermits cell   would break the silence of this dell   it is not quiet is not ease   but something deeper far than these   the separation that is here   is of the grave and of austere   and happy feelings of the dead   and therefore was it rightly said                      30   that ossian last of all his race   lies buried in this lonely place     5 the matron of jedborough and her husband     at jedborough we went into private lodgings for a few     days and the following verses were called forth by     the character and domestic situation of our hostess     age twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers   and call a train of laughing hours   and bid them dance and bid them sing   and thou too mingle in the ring   take to thy heart a new delight   if not make merry in despite   for there is one who scorns thy power   but dance for under jedborough tower   there liveth in the prime of glee   a woman whose years are seventythree                  10   and she will dance and sing with thee    nay start not at that figurethere   him who is rooted to his chair   look at himlook again for he   hath long been of thy family   with legs that move not if they can   and useless arms a trunk of man   he sits and with a vacant eye   a sight to make a stranger sigh   deaf drooping that is now his doom                    20   his world is in this single room   is this a place for mirth and cheer   can merrymaking enter here    the joyous woman is the mate   of him in that forlorn estate   he breathes a subterraneous damp   but bright as vesper shines her lamp   he is as mute as jedborough tower   she jocund as it was of yore   with all its bravery on in times                      30   when all alive with merry chimes   upon a sunbright morn of may   it rouzd the vale to holiday    i praise thee matron and thy due   is praise heroic praise and true   with admiration i behold   thy gladness unsubdued and bold   thy looks thy gestures all present   the picture of a life wellspent   this do i see and something more                       40   a strength unthought of heretofore   delighted am i for thy sake   and yet a higher joy partake   our humannature throws away   its second twilight and looks gay   a land of promise and of pride   unfolding wide as life is wide    ah see her helpless charge enclosd   within himself as seems composd   to fear of loss and hope of gain                       50   the strife of happiness and pain   utterly dead yet in the guise   of little infants when their eyes   begin to follow to and fro   the persons that before them go   he tracks her motions quick or slow   her buoyant spirit can prevail   where common cheerfulness would fail   she strikes upon him with the heat   of july suns he feels it sweet                         60   an animal delight though dim   tis all that now remains for him    i lookd i scannd her oer and oer   the more i lookd i wonderd more   when suddenly i seemd to espy   a trouble in her strong black eye   a remnant of uneasy light   a flash of something overbright   and soon she made this matter plain   and told me in a thoughtful strain                     70   that she had borne a heavy yoke   been stricken by a twofold stroke   ill health of body and had pind   beneath worse ailments of the mind    so be it but let praise ascend   to him who is our lord and friend   who from disease and suffering   hath calld for thee a second spring   repaid thee for that sore distress   by no untimely joyousness                               80   which makes of thine a blissful state   and cheers thy melancholy mate      6 to a highland girl  at inversneyde upon loch lomond     sweet highland girl a very shower   of beauty is thy earthly dower   twice seven consenting years have shed   their utmost bounty on thy head   and these gray rocks this household lawn   these trees a veil just half withdrawn   this fall of water that doth make   a murmur near the silent lake   this little bay a quiet road   that holds in shelter thy abode                         10   in truth together ye do seem   like something fashiond in a dream    such forms as from their covert peep   when earthly cares are laid asleep   yet dream and vision as thou art   i bless thee with a human heart   god shield thee to thy latest years   i neither know thee nor thy peers   and yet my eyes are filld with tears    with earnest feeling i shall pray                        20   for thee when i am far away   for never saw i mien or face   in which more plainly i could trace   benignity and homebred sense   ripening in perfect innocence   here scatterd like a random seed   remote from men thou dost not need   the embarrassd look of shy distress   and maidenly shamefacedness    thou wearst upon thy forehead clear                     30   the freedom of a mountaineer   a face with gladness overspread   sweet looks by human kindness bred   and seemliness complete that sways   thy courtesies about thee plays   with no restraint but such as springs   from quick and eager visitings   of thoughts that lie beyond the reach   of thy few words of english speech   a bondage sweetly brookd a strife                      40   that gives thy gestures grace and life   so have i not unmovd in mind   seen birds of tempestloving kind   thus beating up against the wind    what hand but would a garland cull   for thee who art so beautiful   o happy pleasure here to dwell   beside thee in some heathy dell   adopt your homely ways and dress   a shepherd thou a shepherdess                          50   but i could frame a wish for thee   more like a grave reality   thou art to me but as a wave   of the wild sea and i would have   some claim upon thee if i could   though but of common neighbourhood   what joy to hear thee and to see   thy elder brother i would be   thy father any thing to thee    now thanks to heaven that of its grace                  60   hath led me to this lonely place   joy have i had and going hence   i bear away my recompence   in spots like these it is we prize   our memory feel that she hath eyes   then why should i be loth to stir   i feel this place was made for her   to give new pleasure like the past   continued long as life shall last   nor am i loth though pleased at heart                  70   sweet highland girl from thee to part   for i methinks till i grow old   as fair before me shall behold   as i do now the cabin small   the lake the bay the waterfall   and thee the spirit of them all      7 sonnet       composed at  castle     degenerate douglas oh the unworthy lord   whom mere despite of heart could so far please   and love

the breeze   he did not cease but coodand cood   and somewhat pensively he wood   he sang of love with quiet blending   slow to begin and never ending   of serious faith and inward glee   that was the song the song for me                      20      4     my heart leaps up when i behold         a rainbow in the sky   so was it when my life began   so is it now i am a man   so be it when i shall

or blasts the green field and the trees distressd   oft have i seen it muffled up from harm   in close selfshelter like a thing at rest    but lately one rough day this flower i passd   and recognized it though an alterd form               10   now standing forth an offering to the blast   and buffetted at will by rain and storm    i stoppd and said with inly muttered voice   it doth not love the shower nor seek the cold   this neither is its courage nor its choice   but its necessity in being old    the sunshine may not bless it nor the dew   it cannot help itself in its decay   stiff in its

wrought   within me when i recognised thy light   a moment i was startled at the sight   and while i gazed there came to me a thought   that i might step beyond my natural race   as thou seemst now to do might one day trace   some ground not mine and strong her strength above   my soul an apparition in the place   tread there with steps that no one shall reprove      the blind highland boy with other poems     the blind highland boy     a tale told by the fireside     now we are tired of boisterous joy   weve rompd enough my little boy   jane hangs her head upon my breast   and you shall bring your stool and rest       this corner is your own    there take your seat and let me see   that you can listen quietly   and as i promised i will tell   that strange adventure which befel       a poor blind highland boy                           10    a highland boywhy call him so   because my darlings ye must know   in land where many a mountain towers   far higher hills than these of ours         he from his birth had livd    he neer had seen one earthly sight   the sun the day the stars the night   or tree or butterfly or flower   or fish in stream or bird in bower         or woman man or child                           20    and yet he neither drooped nor pined   nor had a melancholy mind   for god took pity on the boy   and was his friend and gave him joy         of which we nothing know    his mother too no doubt above   her other children him did love   for was she here or was she there   she thought of him with constant care       and more than mothers love                         30    and proud she was of heart when clad   in crimson stockings tartan plaid   and bonnet with a feather gay   to kirk he on the sabbath day       went hand in hand with her    a dog too had he not for need   but one to play with and to feed   which would have led him if bereft   of company or friends and left       without a better guide                              40    and then the bagpipes he could blow   and thus from house to house would go   and all were pleasd to hear and see   for none made sweeter melody         than did the poor blind boy    yet he had many a restless dream   both when he heard the eagles scream   and when he heard the torrents roar   and heard the water beat the shore         near which their cottage stood                    50    beside a lake their cottage stood   not small like ours a peaceful flood   but one of mighty size and strange   that rough or smooth is full of change         and stirring in its bed    for to this lake by night and day   the great seawater finds its way   through long long windings of the hills   and drinks up all the pretty rills         and rivers large and strong                       60    then hurries back the road it came   returns on errand still the same   this did it when the earth was new   and this for evermore will do         as long as earth shall last    and with the coming of the tide   come boats and ships that sweetly ride   between the woods and lofty rocks   and to the shepherds with their flocks         bring tales of distant lands                      70    and of those tales whateer they were   the blind boy always had his share   whether of mighty towns or vales   with warmer suns and softer gales       or wonders of the deep    yet more it pleased him more it stirrd   when from the waterside he heard   the shouting and the jolly cheers   the bustle of the mariners       in stillness or in storm                            80    but what do his desires avail   for he must never handle sail   nor mount the mast nor row nor float   in sailors ship or fishers boat       upon the rocking waves    his mother often thought and said   what sin would be upon her head   if she should suffer this my son   whateer you do leave this undone         the danger is so great                           90    thus lived he by loch levins side   still sounding with the sounding tide   and heard the billows leap and dance   without a shadow of mischance         till he was ten years old    when one day and now mark me well   you soon shall know how this befel   hes in a vessel of his own   on the swift water hurrying down         towards the mighty sea                           100    in such a vessel neer before   did human creature leave the shore   if this or that way he should stir   woe to the poor blind mariner       for death will be his doom    strong is the current but be mild   ye waves and spare the helpless child   if ye in anger fret or chafe   a beehive would be ship as safe       as that in which he sails                          110    but say what was it thought of fear   well may ye tremble when ye hear   a household tub like one of those   which women use to wash their clothes       this carried the blind boy    close to the water he had found   this vessel pushd it from dry ground   went into it and without dread   following the fancies in his head         he paddled up and down                           120    a while he stood upon his feet   he felt the motiontook his seat   and dallied thus till from the shore   the tide retreating more and more         had suckd and suckd him in    and there he is in face of heaven   how rapidly the child is driven   the fourth part of a mile i ween   he thus had gone ere he was seen         by any human eye                                 130    but when he was first seen oh me   what shrieking and what misery   for many saw among the rest   his mother she who loved him best      she saw her poor blind boy    but for the child the sightless boy   it is the triumph of his joy   the bravest traveller in balloon   mounting as if to reach the moon       was never half so blessd                          140    and let him let him go his way   alone and innocent and gay   for if good angels love to wait   on the forlorn unfortunate       this child will take no harm    but now the passionate lament   which from the crowd on shore was sent   the cries which broke from old and young   in gaelic or the english tongue         are stifledall is still                        150    and quickly with a silent crew   a boat is ready to pursue   and from the shore their course they take   and swiftly down the running lake         they follow the blind boy    with sound the least that can be made   they follow more and more afraid   more cautious as they draw more near   but in his darkness he can hear         and guesses their intent                         160    leighaleighathen did he cry   leighaleighamost eagerly   thus did he cry and thus did pray   and what he meant was keep away         and leave me to myself    alas and when he felt their hands   youve often heard of magic wands   that with a motion overthrow   a palace of the proudest shew         or melt it into air                              170    so all his dreams that inward light   with which his soul had shone so bright   all vanishdtwas a heartfelt cross   to him a heavy bitter loss         as he had ever known    but hark a gratulating voice   with which the very hills rejoice   tis from the crowd who tremblingly   had watchd the event and now can see        that he is safe at last                           180    and then when he was brought to land   full sure they were a happy band   which gathering round did on the banks   of that great water give god thanks        and welcomd the poor child    and in the general joy of heart   the blind boys little dog took part   he leapt about and oft did kiss   his masters hands in sign of bliss        with sound like lamentation                       190    but most of all his mother dear   she who had fainted with her fear   rejoiced when waking she espies   the child when she can trust her eyes         and touches the blind boy    she led him home and wept amain   when he was in the house again   tears flowd in torrents from her eyes   she could not blame him or chastise         she was too happy far                            200    thus after he had fondly braved   the perilous deep the boy was saved   and though his fancies had been wild   yet he was pleased and reconciled         to live in peace on shore      the green linnet     the may is come againhow sweet   to sit upon my orchardseat   and birds

brougham castle henry lord clifford c c who is the subject of this poem was the son of john lord clifford who was slain at towton field which john lord clifford as is known to the reader of english history was the person who after the battle of wakefield slew in the pursuit the young earl of rutland son of the duke of york who had fallen in the battle in part of revenge say the authors of the history of cumberland and westmorland for the earls father had slain his a deed which worthily blemished the author saith speed but who as he adds dare promise any thing temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury chiefly when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the york line standing for so one maketh this lord to speak this no doubt i would observe by the bye was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times and yet not altogether so bad as represented for the earl was no child as some writers would have him but able to bear arms being sixteen or seventeen years of age as is evident from this say the memoirs of the countess of pembroke who was laudably anxious to wipe away as far as could be this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was born that he was the next child to king edward the fourth which his mother had by richard duke of york and that king was then eighteen years of age and for the small distance betwixt her children see austin vincent in his book of nobility page 622 where he writes of them all it may further be observed that lord clifford who was then himself only twentyfive years of age had been a leading man and commander two or three years together in the army of lancaster before this time and therefore would be less likely to think that the earl of rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youthbut independent of this act at best a cruel and savage one the family of clifford had done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the house of york so that after the battle of towton there was no hope for them but in flight and concealment henry the subject of the poem was deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twentyfour years all which time he lived as a shepherd in yorkshire or in cumberland where the estate of his fatherinlaw sir lancelot threlkeld lay he was restored to his estate and honours in the first year of henry the seventh it is recorded that when called to parliament he behaved nobly and wisely but otherwise came seldom to london or the court and rather delighted to live in the country where he repaired several of his castles which had gone to decay during the late troubles thus far is chiefly collected from nicholson and burn and i can add from my own knowledge that there is a tradition current in the village of threlkeld and its neighbourhood his principal retreat that in the course of his shepherd life he had acquired great astronomical knowledge i cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those numerous and noble feudal edifices spoken of in the poem the ruins of some of which are at this day so great an ornament to that interesting country the cliffords had always been distinguished for an honorable pride in these castles and we have seen that after the wars of york and lancaster they were rebuilt in the civil wars of charles the first they were again laid waste and again restored almost to their former magnificence by the celebrated lady anne clifford countess of pembroke c c not more than 25 years after this was done when the estates of clifford had passed into the family of tufton three of these castles namely brough brougham and pendragon were demolished and the timber and other materials sold by thomas earl of thanet we will hope that when this order was issued the earl had not consulted the text of isaiah 58th chap 12th verse to which the inscription placed over the gate of pendragon castle by the countess of pembroke i believe his grandmother at the time she repaired that structure refers the reader and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach
