davis clark memorial library     introduction   defoe has been recognized as the author of a general history of the robberies and murders of the most notorious pyrates since 1932 when john robert moore suggested that the supposed author captain charles johnson like andrew moreton kara selym or captain roberts was merely another mask for the creator of robinson crusoe although most of the first volume is of minor literary importance the second section which appeared in 1728 as the history of the pyrates commenced with a life of captain misson and his crew one of defoes most remarkable and neglected works of fiction in much the same manner and at the same time that john gay was satirizing walpoles government in the beggars opera defoe began to use his pirates as a commentary on the injustice and hypocrisy of contemporary english society among defoes gallery of pirates are captain white who refused to rob from women and children captain bellamy the proletarian revolutionist and captain north whose sense of justice and honesty was a rebuke to the corruption of government under walpole but the fictional captain misson the founder of a communist utopia is by far the most original of these creations  if we were to accept the view of nineteenthcentury critics that defoe was one of the earliest exponents of laissez faire his creation of a communist utopia would seem remarkable indeed but paradoxes fascinated defoe and his ideas can seldom be reduced to unambiguous platitudes he was especially fascinated by the comparison between businessmen and thieves in 1707 he urged the government to pardon the madagascar pirates if they agreed to stop their crimes pay a large sum of money and become honest freeholders as others of our westindia pyrates merchants i should have said have done before them and he noted that it would make a sad chasm on the exchange of london if all the pyrates should be taken away from the merchants there1 twelve years later just before the start of the south sea bubble defoe attacked stockjobbing as a branch of highway robbing2  although these attacks were directed mainly at trade thieves and corruptions in business practices they reflect defoes growing concern with problems of poverty and wealth in england in his preface to the first volume of the general history of the pyrates defoe argued that the unemployed seaman had no choice but to steal or starve when the pirate captain bellamy boards a merchant ship from boston he attacks the inequality of capitalist society the ship owners and most of all the captain  damn ye you are a sneaking puppy and so are all those who will submit to be governed by laws which rich men have made for their own security for the cowardly whelps have not the courage otherwise to defend what they get by their knavery but damn ye altogether damn them for a pack of crafty rascals and you who serve them for a parcel of henhearted numskuls they villify us the scoundrels do when there is only this difference they rob the poor under the cover of law forsooth and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage3  bellamy asks the crew of the captured ship to abandon the slavery of working for low wages under severe captains for the complete economic and political equality of life on a pirate ship  government on captain missons ship the victoire and in the colony of libertalia is partially an idealization of the pirates creed but two other elements which must be considered are first the concept of government in the state of nature and secondly the ideal of the socialist utopia most political theorists of defoes time postulated a state of nature in which man lived either entirely free from government or under loose patriarchal control from which he was removed either by the invention of money the discovery of agriculture or by some crime to a certain extent missons pirate government may be regarded as a stage in the evolution of government in the farther adventures of robinson crusoe defoe showed how government evolved from the anarchy of the state of nature both crusoes colony and libertalia are eventually forced to establish government private property and criminal laws but libertalia which retains its egalitarian and democratic character is overthrown by its failure to account for human evil and crime  a second influence on captain missons ideology is plutarchs description of the laws of sparta and rome even during the anti communist period which followed the glorious revolution the well regulated state of the lacedemonians remained the norm for utopias the influence of plutarch pervades the biographies in the general history of the pyrates lycurgus laws echo throughout missons attacks on luxury and the unequal distribution of wealth while plutarchs study of spartacus which is mentioned in defoes preface may well have been the model for his hero  but neither the desire to regain the purity of the state of nature nor an admiration for spartan simplicity entirely explain missons vigorous demand for freedom and his attacks on the corruption of the ruling class by refusing to fly the pirate flag misson dramatizes the growing revolt of the poor against a useless nobility the crew of the victoire are prophetically enough french their aspiration is for a society following the precepts of la carri√®re ouverte aux talents their revolt is that of a few courageous men unafraid to engage in the pirates war against mankind while those of lesser courage dance to the musick of their chains  defoes study of misson is different from the utopias of more bacon or campanella in so far as there is no discovery of an ideal civilization libertalia is a utopia which reflects a direct reaction to the abuses of the timeabuses of economic political and religious freedom anticipating beccarias criticism of the death penalty by almost forty years carracioli argues that since mans right to life is inalienable no government can have the power of capital punishment4 missons belief in equality is extended to include the negro slaves the victoire takes at sea as well as the natives of madagascar after asking the negroes to join his crew misson tells his men that  the trading for those of our own species could never be agreeable to the eyes of divine justice that no man had power of the liberty of another and while those who professd a more enlightened knowledge of the deity sold men like beasts they provd that their religion was no more than crimace for his part he hopd he spoke the sentiments of all his brave companions he had not exempted his neck from the galling yoak of slavery and asserted his own liberty to enslave others  slavery is banished from missons ship and the negroes are schooled in the principles of freedom  perhaps the most difficult problem in discussing the principles of misson and carracioli is to attempt an explanation of why defoe a presbyterian should have made his protagonists into deists defoe attacks carraciolis deistic arguments through his narrator captain johnson who remarks that such ideas are pernicious only to weak men who cannot discover their fallacy but since similar ideas appear in robert drurys journal published a year later it may be assumed that the arguments of the deists held a certain fascination for defoe at this time carraciolis deism also has a dramatic function in the story that on a voyage to rome a young man like misson should be converted to deism by a disillusioned lewd priest was in harmony with the traditional english belief in the dangers of italy5 that carracioli should combine the rebellion against organized religion with the revolt against monarchy is indicative of defoes keen apprehension of the future course of history  considered as a short novel the history of captain misson and his crew reveals many of the same techniques which defoe used in his longer works to gain a sense of verisimilitude the narrator pretends to be working from a manuscript a device which defoe also employed in his memoirs of a cavalier as in colonel jack real historical figures and events from the war of the spanish succession are woven into the adventures of the victoire captain misson and his crew sink the winchelsea an english ship lost in the west indies at the end of august 1707 and they barely escape from admiral wagers fleet which fought a famous battle there in 1708 even the name of missons ship the victoire was undoubtedly familiar to defoe as the vessel commanded by the famous french corsair cornil saus6 so convincing is defoe that although his hero is shown meeting a real freebooter captain tew ten years after tews death misson is still included in the histories of piracy7  also typical of defoes fiction is the relationship between captain misson the leader and his intellectual mentor carracioli colonel jack and his tutor moll flanders and her governess and particularly captain singleton and william walters form similar groups just as william walters a quaker reminds captain singleton and the crew that their business is not fighting but making money so carracioli addresses lengthy speeches to the crew converting everyone on the victoire to democracy and deism missons libertalia takes root in madagascar where singleton wanted to establish a colony while both carracioli and walters adapt the secular aspects of their religion to piracy but whereas walters eventually converts singleton into an honest christian carracioli leads misson into piracy  in the history of captain misson and his crew defoe decided to pursue the same method of third person narrative as in his brief biographies of real pirates the result is that he merely provides a sketch of political theories rather than a study of human beings of course there are good reasons for this defoe was more interested in dramatizing proletarian utopian ideals than in developing the inner workings of missons mind the novelette is unified by its epic theme not by its study of character or its episodic plot  although defoe toyed with radical notions throughout the history of the pyrates he had little faith in their practicality libertalia must be understood as defoes best expression of political and social ideals which he admired but considered unworkable the continuation of missons career in the section of captain tew depicts the decline and fall of the utopia and the heros tragic death as a disillusioned idealist this however is another story a story which suggested that private property was necessary equality impossible and slavery a useful expedient for colonization it was a far more comforting message for the augustan age but it could not silence the tocsins of the french revolution which sound throughout the speeches of misson and carracioli  maximillian e novak university of michigan     bibliographical note  the text of of captain misson and his crew has been

tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci  hor     the history of the pyrates vol ii  of captain misson     we can be somewhat particular in the life of this gentleman because by very great accident we have got into our hands a french manuscript in which he himself gives a detail of his actions he was born in provence of an ancient family his father whose true name he conceals was master of a plentiful fortune but having a great number of children our rover had but little hopes of other fortune than what he could carve out for himself with his sword his parents took care to give him an education equal to his birth after he had passed his humanity and logick and was a tolerable mathematician at the age of fifteen he was sent to angiers where he was a year learning his exercises his father at his return home would have put him into the musketeers but as he was of a roving temper and much affected with the accounts he had read in books of travels he chose the sea as a life which abounds with more variety and would afford him an opportunity to gratify his curiosity by the change of countries having made this choice his father with letters of recommendation and every thing fitting for him sent him voluntier on board the victoire commanded by monsieur fourbin his relation he was received on board with all possible regard by the captain whose ship was at marseilles and was orderd to cruise soon after missons arrival nothing could be more agreeable to the inclinations of our voluntier than this cruize which made him acquainted with the most noted ports of the mediterranean and gave him a great insight into the practical part of navigation he grew fond of this life and was resolved to be a compleat sailor which made him always one of the first on a yard arm either to hand or reef and very inquisitive in the different methods of working a ship his discourse was turnd on no other subject and he would often get the boatswain and carpenter to teach him in their cabbins the constituent parts of a ships hull and how to rigg her which he generously paid em for and tho he spent a great part of his time with these two officers yet he behaved himself with such prudence that they never attempted at a familiarity and always paid the respect due to his family the ship being at naples he obtained leave of his captain to go to rome which he had a great desire to visit hence we may date his misfortunes for remarking the licentious lives of the clergy so different from the regularity observd among the french ecclesiasticks the luxury of the papal court and that nothing but hulls of religion was to be found in the metropolis of the christian church he began to figure to himself that all religion was no more than a curb upon the minds of the weaker which the wiser sort yielded to in appearance only these sentiments so disadvantageous to religion and himself were strongly riveted by accidentally becoming acquainted with a lewd priest who was at his arrival by meer chance his confessor and after that his procurer and companion for he kept him company to his death one day having an opportunity he told misson a religious was a very good life where a man had a subtle enterprising genius and some friends for such a one woud in a short time rise to such dignities in the church the hopes of which was the motive of all the wiser sort who voluntarily took upon them the sacerdotal habit that the ecclesiastical state was governd with the same policy as were secular principalities and kingdoms that what was beneficial not what was meritorious and virtuous would be alone regarded that there were no more hopes for a man of piety and learning in the patrimony of st peter than in any other monarchy nay rather less for this being known to be real that mans rejected as a visionary no way fit for employment as one whose scruples might prove prejudicial for its a maxim that religion and politicks can never set up in one house as to our statesmen dont imagine that the purple makes em less courtiers than are those of other nations they know and pursue the reggione del stato a term of art which means selfinterest with as much cunning and as little conscience as any secular and are as artful where art is required and as barefaced and impudent when their power is great enough to support em in the oppressing the people and aggrandizing their families what their morals are you may read in the practice of their lives and their sentiments of religion from this saying of a certain cardinal quantum lucrum ex ista fabula christi which many of em may say tho they are not so foolish for my part i am quite tird of the farce and will lay hold on the first opportunity to throw off this masquerading habit for by reason of my age i must act an under part many years and before i can rise to share the spoils of the people i shall i fear be too old to enjoy the sweets of luxury and as i am an enemy to restraint i am apprehensive i shall never act up to my character and carry thro the hypocrite with art enough to rise to any considerable post in the church my parents did not consult my genius or they would have given me a sword instead of a pair of beads  misson advised him to go with him voluntier and offerd him money to cloath him the priest leapd at the proposal and a letter coming to misson from his captain that he was going to leghorn and left to him either to come to naples or go by land he chose the latter and the dominican whom he furnishd with money clothing himself very cavalierly threw off his habit and preceeded him two days staying at pisa for misson from whence they went together to leghorn where they found the victoire and signor caraccioli recommended by his friend was received on board two days after they weighd from hence and after a weeks cruize fell in with two sally men the one of twenty the other of twenty four guns the victoire had but thirty mounted though she had ports for forty the engagement was long and bloody for the sally man hopd to carry the victoire and on the contrary captain fourbin so far from having any thoughts of being taken he was resolutely bent to make prize of his enemies or sink his ship one of the sally men was commanded by a spanish renegade though he had only the title of a lieutenant for the captain was a young man who knew little of marine affairs  this ship was called the lyon and he attempted more than once to board the victoire but by a shot betwixt wind and water he was obliged to sheer off and running his guns c on one side bring her on the careen to stop his leak this being done with too much precipitation she overset and every soul was lost his comrade seeing this disaster threw out all his small sails and endeavourd to get off but the victoire wrongd her and obligd her to renew the fight which she did with great obstinacy and made monsieur fourbin despair of carrying her if he did not board he made preparations accordingly signior caraccioli and misson were the two first on board when the command was given but they and their followers were beat back by the despair of the sally men the former received a shot in his thigh and was carried down to the surgeon the victoire laid her on board the second time and the sally men defended their decks with such resolution that they were coverd with their own and the dead bodies of their enemies misson seeing one of em jump down the mainhatch with a lighted match suspecting his design resolutely leapd after him and reaching him with his sabre laid him dead the moment he going to set fire to the powder the victoire pouring in more men the mahometans quitted the decks finding resistance vain and fled for shelter to the cook room steerage and cabbins and some run between decks the french gave em quarters and put the prisoners on board the victoire the prize yielding nothing worth mention except liberty to about fifteen christian slaves she was carried into and sold with the prisoners at text unreadable the turks lost a great many men the french not less than 35 in boarding for they lost very few by the great shot the sally men firing mostly at the masts and rigging hoping by disabling to carry her the limited time of  their cruize being out the victoire returned to marseilles from whence misson taking his companion went to visit his parents to whom the captain sent a very advantageous character both of his courage and conduct he was about a month at home when his captain wrote to him that his ship was ordered to rochelle from whence he was to sail for the westindies with some merchant men this was very agreeable to misson and signior caraccioli who immediately set out for marseilles this town is well fortified has four parish churches and the number of inhabitants is computed to be about 1200000 the harbour is esteemed the safest in the mediterranean and is the common station for the french gallies  leaving this place they steerd for rochelle where the victoire was dockd the merchant ships not being near ready misson who did not care to pass so long a time in idleness proposed to his comrade the taking a cruize on board the triumph who was going into the english channel the italian readily contented to it  between the isle of guernsey and the start point they met with the mayflower captain balladine commanded a merchant ship of 18 guns richly laden and coming from jamaica the captain of the english made a gallant resistance and fought his ship so long that the french could not carry her into harbour wherefore they took the money and what was most valuable out of her and finding she made more water than the pumps could free quitted and saw her go down in less than four hours after monsieur le blanc the french captain received captain balladine very civilly and would not suffer either him or his men to be strippd saying none but cowards ought be treated after that manner that brave men ought to treat such though their enemies as brothers and that to use a gallant man who does his duty ill speaks a revenge which cannot proceed but from a coward soul he orderd that the prisoners should leave their chests and when some of his men seemd to mutter he bid em remember the grandeur of the monarch they servd that they were neither pyrates nor privateers and as brave men they ought to shew their enemies an example they would willingly have followd and use their prisoners as they wishd to be usd  they running up the english channel as high as beachy head and in returning fell in with three fifty gun ships which gave chace to the triumph but as she was an excellent sailor she run em out of sight in seven glasses and made the best of her way for the landsend they here cruized eight days then doubling cape cornwall ran up the bristol channel near as far as nash point and intercepted a small ship from barbadoes and stretching away to the northward gave chase to a ship they saw in the evening but lost her in the night the triumph stood then towards milford and spying a sail endeavourd to cut her off the land but found it impossible for she got into the haven though they came up with her very fast and she had surely been taken had the chase had been any thing longer  captain balladine who took the glass said it was the port royal a bristol ship which left jamaica in company with him and the charles they now returnd to their own coast and sold their prize at brest where at his desire they left captain balladine and monsieur le blanc made him a present of purse with 40 louiss for his support his crew were also left here  at the entrance into this harbour the triumph struck upon a rock but receivd no damage this entrance called genlet is very dangerous on account of the number of rocks which lie on each side under water though the harbour is certainly the best in france the mouth of the harbour is defended by a strong castle the town is well fortified and has a citadel for its farther defence which is of considerable strength in 1694 the english attempted a descent but did not find their market for they were beat off with the loss of their general and a great many men from hence the triumph returnd to rochel and in a month after our voluntiers who went on board the victoire took their departure for martineco and guadalupe they met with nothing in their voyage thither worth noting  i shall only observe that signior caraccioli who was as ambitious as he was irreligious had by this time made a perfect deist of misson and thereby convincd him that all religion was no other than human policy and shewd him that the law of moses was no more than what were necessary as well for the preservation as the governing of the people for instance said he the african negroes never heard of the institution of circumcision which is said to be the sign of the covenant made between god and this people and yet they circumcise their children doubtless for the same reason the jews and other nations do who inhabit the southern climes the prepuce consolidating the perspired matter which is of a fatal consequence in short he ran through all the ceremonies of the jewish christian and mahometan religion and convinced him these were as might be observed by the absurdity of many far from being indications of men inspired and that moses in his account of the creation was guilty of known blunders and the miracles both in the new and old testament inconsistent with reason that god had given us this blessing to make use of for our present and future happiness and whatever was contrary to it notwithstanding their school distinctions of contrary and above reason must be false this reason teaches us that there is a first cause of all things an ens entium which we call god and our reason will also suggest that he must be eternal and as the author of every thing perfect he must be infinitely perfect  if so he can be subject to no passions and neither loves nor hates he must be ever the fame and cannot rashly do to day what he shall repent to morrow he must be perfectly happy consequently nothing can add to an eternal state of tranquillity and though it becomes us to adore him yet can our adorations neither augment nor our sins take from this happiness  but his arguments on this head are too long and too dangerous to translate and as they are workd up with great subtlety they may be pernicious to weak men who cannot discover their fallacy or who finding em agreeable to their inclinations and would be glad to shake off the yoke of the christian religion which galls and curbs their passions would not give themselves the trouble to examine them to the bottom but give into what pleases glad of finding some excuse to their consciences though as his opinion of a future state has nothing in it which impugns the christian religion i shall set it down in few words  that reasoning faculty says he which we perceive within us we call the soul but what that soul is is unknown to us it may die with the body or it may survive i am of opinion its immortal but to say that this opinion is the dictate of reason or only the prejudice of education would i own puzzle me if it is immortal it must be an emanation from the divine being and consequently at its being separated from the body will return to its first principle if not contaminated now my reason tells me if it is estranged from its first principle which is the deity all the hells of mans invention can never yield tortures adequate to such a banishment  as he had privately held these discourses among the crew he had gained a number of proselytes who lookd upon him as a new prophet risen up to reform the abuses in religion and a great number being rochellers and as yet tainted with calvinism his doctrine was the more readily embracd when he had experienced the effects of his religious arguments he fell upon government and shewd that every man was born free and had as much right to what would support him as to the air he respired a contrary way of arguing would be accusing the deity with cruelty and injustice for he brought into the world no man to pass a life of penury and to miserably want a necessary support that the vast difference between man and man the one wallowing in luxury and the other in the most pinching necessity was owing only to avarice and ambition on the one hand and a pusillanimous subjection on the other that at first no other than a natural was known a paternal government every father was the head the prince and monarch of his family and obedience to such was both just and easy for a father had a compassionate tenderness for his children but ambition creeping in by degrees the stronger family set upon and enslaved the weaker and this additional strength overrun a third by every conquest gathering force to make others and this was the first foundation of monarchy pride encreasing with power man usurped the prerogative of god over his creatures that of depriving them of life which was a privilege no one had over his own for as he did not come into the world by his own election he ought to stay the determined time of his creator that indeed death given in war was by the law of nature allowable because it is for the preservation of our own lives but no crime ought to be thus punished nor indeed any war undertaken but in defence of our natural right which is such a share of earth as is necessary for our support  these topicks he often declaimed on and very often advised with misson about the setting up for themselves he was as ambitious as the other and as resolute caraccioli and misson were by this expert mariners and very capable of managing a ship caraccioli had founded a great many of the men on this subject and found them very inclineable to listen to him an accident happend which gave caraccioli a fair opportunity to put his designs in execution and he laid hold of it they went off martinico on a cruize and met with the winchelsea an english man of war of 40 guns commanded by captain jones they made for each other and a very smart engagement followed the first broadside killed the captain second captain and the three lieutenants on board the victoire and left only the master who would have struck but misson took up the sword orderd caraccioli to act as lieutenant and encouraging the men fought the ship six glasses when by some accident the winchelsea blew up and not a man was saved but lieutenant franklin whom the french boats took up and he died in two days none ever knew before this manuscript fell into my hands how the winchelsea was lost for her head being driven ashore at antegoa and a great storm having happend a few days before her head was found it was concluded that she founderd in that storm after this engagement caraccioli came to misson and saluted him captain and desired to know if he would chuse a momentary or a lasting command that he must now determine for at his return to martinico it would be too late and he might depend upon the ship he fought and saved being given to another and they would think him well rewarded if made a lieutenant which piece of justice he doubted that he had his fortune in his hands which he might either keep or let go if he made choice of the latter he must never again expect she would court him to accept her favours that he ought to let before his eyes his circumstances as a younger brother of a good family but nothing to support his character and the many years he must serve at the expence of his blood before he could make any figure in the world and consider the wide difference between the commanding and being commanded that he might with the ship he had under foot and the brave fellows under command bid defiance to the power of europe enjoy every thing he wishd reign sovereign of the southern seas and lawfully make war on all the world since it would deprive him of that liberty to which he had a right by the laws of nature that he might in time become as great as alexander was to the persians and by encreasing his forces by his captures he would every day strengthen the justice of his cause for who has power is always in the right that harry the fourth and harry the seventh attempted and succeeded in their enterprizes on the crown of england yet their forces did not equal his mahomet with a few camel drivers founded the ottoman empire and darius with no more than six or seven companions got possession on of that of persia  in a word he said so much that misson resolved to follow his advice and calling up all hands he told them that a great number of them had resolved with him upon a life of liberty and had done him the honour to create him chief that he designed to force no man and be guilty of that injustice he blamed in others therefore if any were averse to the following his fortune which he promised should be the same to all he desired they would declare themselves and he would set them ashore whence they might return with conveniency having made an end they one and all cryed vive le capitain misson et son lieutenant le seavant caraccioli god bless capt misson and his learned lieutenant caraccioli misson thanked them for the honour they conferrd upon him and promised he would use the power they gave for the publick good only and hoped as they had the bravery to assert their liberty they would be as unanimous in the preserving it and stand by him in what should be found expedient for the good of all that he was their friend and companion and should never exert his power or think himself other than their comrade but when the necessity of affairs should oblige him  they shouted a second time vive le capitain he after this desired they would chuse their subaltern officers and give them power to consult and conclude upon what might be for the common interest and bind themselves down by an oath to agree to what such officers and he should determine this they readily gave into the schoolmaster they chose for second lieutenant jean besace they nominated for third and the boatswain and a quartermaster named matthieu le tondu with the gunner they desired might be their representatives in council  the choice was approved and that every thing might pass methodically and with general approbation they were called into the great cabbin and the question put what course they should steer the captain proposed the spanish coast as the most probable to afford them rich prizes this was agreed upon by all the boatswain then asked what colours they should fight under and advised black as most terrifying but caraccioli objected that they were no pyrates but men who were resolved to assert that liberty which god and nature gave them and own no subjection to any farther than was for the common good of all that indeed obedience to governors was necessary when they knew and acted up to the duty of their function were vigilant guardians of the peoples rights and liberties saw that justice was equally distributed were barriers against the rich and powerful when they attempted to oppress the weaker when they suffered none of the one hand to grow immensely rich either by his own or his ancestors encroachments nor on the other any to be wretchedly miserable either by falling into the hands of villains unmerciful creditors or other misfortunes while he had eyes impartial and allowed nothing but merit to distinguish between man and man and instead of being a burthen to the people by his luxurious life he was by his care for and protection of them a real father and in every thing acted with the equal and impartial justice of a parent but when a governor who is the minister of the people thinks himself raisd to this dignity that he may spend his days in pomp and luxury looking upon his subjects as so many slaves created for his use and pleasure and therefore leaves them and their affairs to the immeasurable avarice and tyranny of some one whom he has chosen for his favourite when nothing but oppression poverty and all the miseries of life flow from such an administration that he lavishes away the lives and fortunes of the people either to gratify his ambition or to support the cause of some neighbouring prince that he may in return strengthen his hands should his people exert themselves in defence of their native rights or should he run into unnecessary wars by the rash and thoughtless councils of his favourite and not able to make head against the enemy he has rashly or wantonly brought upon his hands and buy a peace which is the present case of france as every one knows by supporting king james and afterwards proclaiming his son and drain the subject should the peoples trade be wilfully neglected for private interests and while their ships of war lie idle in their harbours suffer their vessels to be taken and the enemy not only intercepts all commerce but insults their coasts it speaks a generous and great soul to shake off the yoak and if we cannot redress our wrongs withdraw from sharing the miseries which meaner spirits submit to and scorn to yield to the tyranny such men are we and if the world as experience may convince us it will makes war upon us the law of nature empowers us not only to be on the defensive but also on the offensive part as we then do not proceed upon the same ground with pyrates who are men of dissolute lives and no principles let us scorn to take their colours ours is a brave a just an innocent and a noble cause the cause of liberty i therefore advise a white ensign with liberty painted in the fly and if you like the motto a deo a libertate for god and liberty as an emblem of our uprightness and resolution  the cabbin door was left open and the bulk head which was of canvas rowled up the steerage being full of men who lent an attentive ear they cried liberty liberty we are free men vive the brave captain misson and the noble lieutenant caraccioli this short council breaking up every thing belonging to the deceased captain and the other officers and men lost in the engagement was brought upon deck and overhawled the money ordered to be put into a chest and the carpenter to clap on a padlock for and give a key to every one of the council misson telling them all should be in common and the particular avarice of no one should defraud the publick  when the plate monsieur fourbin had was going to the chest the men unanimously cried out avast keep that out for the captains use as a present from his officers and foremast men misson thanked them the plate was returned to the great cabbin and the chest secured according to orders misson then ordered his lieutenants and other officers to examine who among the men were in most want of cloaths and to distribute those of the dead men impartially which was done with a general content and applause of the whole crew all but the wounded being upon deck misson from the baracade spoke to the following purpose that since they had unanimously resolved to seize upon and defend their liberty which ambitious men had usurped and that this could not be esteemed by impartial judges other than a just and brave resolution he was under an obligation to recommend to them a brotherly love to each other the banishment of all private piques and grudges and a swift agreement and harmony among themselves that in throwing off the yoak of tyranny of which the action spoke an abhorrence he hoped none would follow the example of tyrants and turn his back upon justice for when equity was trodden under foot misery confusion and mutual distrust naturally followedhe also advised them to remember there was a supream the adoration of which reason and gratitude prompted us and our own interests would engage us as it is best to be of the surest side and afterlife was allowed possible to conciliate that he was satisfied men who were born and bred in slavery by which their spirits were broke and were incapable of so generous a way of thinking who ignorant of their birthright and the sweets of liberty dance to the musick of their chains which was indeed the greater part of the inhabitants of the globe would brand this generous crew with the insidious name of pyrates and think it meritorious to be instrumental in their destructionselfpreservation therefore and not a cruel disposition obliged him to declare war against all such as should refuse him the entry of their ports and against all who should not immediately surrender and give up what their necessities required but in a more particular manner against all european ships and vessels as concluded implacable enemies and i do now said he declare such war and at the same time recommend to you my comrades a humane and generous behaviour towards your prisoners which will appear by so much more the effects of a noble soul as we are satisfied we should not meet the same treatment should our ill fortune or more properly our disunion or want of courage give us up to their mercy  after this he required a muster should be made and there were able hands two hundred and thirty five sick and wounded as they were musterd they were sworn after affairs were thus settled they shaped their course the spanish westindies but resolved in the way to take a week or ten days cruize in the windward passage from jamaica because most merchant men which were good sailors and did not slay for convoy took this as the shorter cut for england  off st christophers they took an english sloop becalmed with their boats they took out of her a couple of puncheons of rum and half a dozen hogsheads of sugar she was a new england sloop bound for boston and without offering the least violence to the men or stripping them they let her go the master of the sloop was thomas butler who owned he never met with so candid an enemy as the french man of war which took him the day he left st christophers they met with no other booty in their way till they came upon their station when after three days they saw a sloop which had the impudence to give them chace captain misson asked what could be the meaning that the sloop stood for them one of the men who was acquainted with the west indies told him it was a jamaica privateer and he should not wonder if he clappd him aboard i am said he no stranger to their way of working and this despicable fellow as those who dont know a jamaica privateer may think him it is ten to one will give you some trouble it now grows towards evening and youll find as soon as he has discovered your force hell keep out of the reach of your guns till the 12 aclock watch is changed at night and hell then attempt to clap you aboard with hopes to carry you in the hurry wherefore captain if you will give me leave to advise you let every man have his small arms and at twelve let the bell ring as usual and rather more noise than ordinary be made as if the one watch was turning in and the other out in a confusion and hurry and ill engage he will venture to enter his men the fellows advice was approved and resolved upon and the sloop workd as he said she would for upon coming near enough to make distinctly the force of the victoire on her throwing out french colours she the sloop clappd upon a wind the victoire gave chace but without hopes of gaining upon her she went so well to windward that she coud spare the ship some points in her sheet and yet wrong her at dusk of the even the french had lost sight of her but about eleven at night they saw her hankering up their windward bow which confirmed the sailors opinion that she would attempt to board them as she did at the pretended change of the watch there being little or no wind she lashed to the bowsprit of the victoire and enterd her men who were very quietly taken as they enterd and tumbled down the forehatch where they were received by others and bound without noise not one of the privateers killed few hurt and only one frenchman wounded the victoire the better part of the sloops men secured they boarded in their turn when the privateers suspecting some stratagem were endeavouring to cut their lashing and get off  thus the englishman caught a tartar the prisoners being all secured the captain charged his men not to discover thro a desire of augmenting their number the account they were upon  the next morning monsieur misson called for the captain of the privateer he told him he could not but allow him a brave fellow to venture upon a ship of his countenance and for that reason he should meet treatment which men of his profession seldom afforded the prisoners they made he asked him how long he had been out what was his name and what he had on board he answered he was but just come out that he was the first sail he had met with and should have thought himself altogether as lucky not to have spoke with him that his name was harry ramsey and what he had on board were rags powder ball and some few half anchors of rum ramsey was ordered into the gunroom and a council being held in the publick manner aforesaid the bulk head of the great cabbin rowled up on their conclusion the captain of the privateer was called in again when captain misson told him he would return him his sloop and restore him and his men to their liberty without stripping or plundering of any thing but what prudence obliged him to their ammunition and smallarms if he would give him his word and honour and his men to take an oath not to go out on the privateer account in six months after they left him that he did not design to continue that station above a week longer at the expiration of which time he would let them go  ramsey who had a new sloop did not expect this favour which he thanked him for and promised punctually to comply with the injunction which his men as readily swore to tho they had no design to keep the oath the time being expired he and his men were put on board their own sloop at going over the ships side ramsey beggd monsieur misson would allow him powder for a salute by way of thanks but he answered him the ceremony was needless and he expected no other return than that of keeping his word which indeed ramsey did some of his men had found it more to their advantage to have been as religious  at parting ramsey gave the ship three chears and misson had the complaisance to return one which ramsey answering with three more made the best of his way for jamaica and at the east end of the island met with the diana who upon advice turnd back  the victoire steerd for carthagene off which port they cruised some days but meeting with nothing in the seas they made for porto bello in their way they met with two dutch traders who had letters of mart and were just come upon the coast the one had 20 the other 24 guns misson engaged them and they defended themselves with a great deal of resolution and gallantry and as they were mannd a peak he darst not venture to board either of them for fear of being at the same time boarded by the other his weight of mettal gave him a great advantage over the dutch though they were two to one besides their business as they had cargoes was to get off if possible wherefore they made a running fight though they took care to stick close to one another  they maintained the fight for above six hours when misson enraged at this obstinacy and fearing if by accident they should bring a mast or topmast by the board they would get from him he was resolved to sink the larger ship of the two and accordingly ordered his men to bring all their guns to bear a midship then running close along side of him to raise their mettal his orders being punctually obeyd he pourd in a broad side which opend such a gap in the dutch ship that she went directly to the bottom and every man perishd  he then mannd his bowsprit brought his spritsail yard fore and aft and resolved to board the other which the dutch perceiving and terrified with the unhappy fate of their comrade thought a farther resistance vain and immediately struck misson gave them good quarters though he was enraged at the loss of 13 men killed outright beside 9 wounded of which 6 died they found on board a great quantity of gold and silver lace brocade silks silk stockings bails of broad cloath bazes of all colours and osnabrughs  a consultation being held it was resolved captain misson should take the name of fourbin and returning to carthagene dispose of his prize and set his prisoners ashoar accordingly they plyd to the eastward and came to an anchor between boca chieca fort and the town for they did not think it expedient to enter the harbour the barge was manned and caraccioli with the name of daubigny the first lieutenant who was killed in the engagement with the winchelsea and his commission in his pocket went ashore with a letter to the governor signd fourbin whose character for fear of the worst was exactly counterfeited the purport of his letter was that having discretionary orders to cruize for three months and hearing the english infested his coast he was come in search of em and had met two dutch men one of which he had sunk the other he made prize of that his limited time being near expired he should be obliged to his excellency if he would send on board him such merchants as were willing to take the ship and cargoe off his hands of which he had lent the dutch invoice don joseph de la zerda the then governor received the lieutenant who sent back the barge at landing very civilly and agreed to take the prisoners ashoar and do every thing was required of him and ordering fresh provisions and sallading to be got ready as a present for the captain he sent for some merchants who were very ready to go on board and agree for the ship and goods which they did for two and fifty thousand pieces of eight the next day the prisoners were set ashoar a rich piece of brocade which was reservd sent to the governor for a present a quantity of fresh provision bought and brought on board the money paid by the merchants the ship and goods deliverd and the victoire at the dawn of the following day got under sail it may be wonderd how such dispatch could be made but the reader must take notice these goods were sold by the dutch invoice which the merchant of the prize affirmed was genuine i shall observe by the by that the victoire was the french man of war which admiral wager sent the kingston in search of and being afterwards falsly informd that she was joind by another of seventy guns and that they cruizd together between the capes orderd the severn up to windward to assist the kingston which had like to have provd very fatal for these two english men of war commanded by captain trevor and captain padnor meeting in the night had prepared to engage each taking the other for the enemy the kingstons men not having a good lookout which must be attributed to the negligence of the officer of the watch did not see the severn till she was just upon them but by good luck to leeward and plying up with all the sail she could crowd and a clear ship this put the kingston in such confusion that when the severn hald no answer was retund for none heard her she was got under the kingstons stern and captain padnor ordered to hale for the third and last time and if no answer was returnd to give her a broadside the noise onboard the kingston was now a little ceasd and captain trevor who was on the poop with a speaking trumpet to hale the severn by good luck heard her hale him answering the kingston and asking the name of the other ship prevented the damage  they cruised together some time and meeting nothing which answerd their information returnd to jamaica as i shall to my subject begging pardon for this as i thought necessary digression  don juan de la zevda told the captain in a letter that the st joseph a gallion of seventy guns was then lying at port a bello and should be glad he could keep her company till she was off the coast that she would sail in eight or ten days for the havana and that if his time would permit him he would send an adviceboat that she had on board the value of 800000 pieces of eight in silver and bar gold misson returnd answer that he believd he should be excusd if he stretched his orders for a few days and that he would cruize off the isle of pearls and cape gratias a dios and give for signal to the gallion his spreading a white ensign in his foretopmast shrouds the cluing up his foresail and the firing one gun to windward and two to leeward which he should answer by letting run and hoisting his fore topsail three times and the firing as many guns to leeward don joseph extreamly pleased with this complaisance sent a boat express to advise the st joseph but she was already sailed two days contrary to the governor of carthagenes expectation and this advice captain misson had from the boat which returning with an answer saw the victoire in the offin and spoke to her it was then resolved to follow the st joseph and accordingly they steerd for the havanna but by what accident they did not overtake her is unknown  i forgot to tell my reader on board the dutch ship were fourteen french hugonots whom misson thought fit to detain when they were at sea misson called em up and proposed to em their taking on telling them at the same time he left it to their choice for he would have no forcd men and that if they all or any of them disapproved the proposal he would either give em the first vessel he met that was fit for em or set em ashoar on some inhabited coast and therefore bid em take two days for consideration before they returned an answer and to encourage em he called all hands up and declard that if any man repented him of the course of life he had chosen his just dividend should be counted to him and he would set him on shoar either near the havanna or some other convenient place but not one accepted the offer and the fourteen prisoners unanimously resolved to join in with em to which resolution no doubt the hopes of a good booty from the st joseph and this offer of liberty greatly contributed  at the entrance of the gulph they spied and came with a large merchant ship bound for london from jamaica she had 20 guns but no more than 32 hands that its not to be wonderd at she made no resistance besides she was deep laden with sugars monsieur misson took out of her what ammunition she had about four thousand pieces of eight some puncheons of rum and ten hogsheads of sugar and without doing her any further damage let her proceed her voyage what he valued most in this prize was the men he got for she was carrying to europe twelve french prisoners two of which were necessary hands being a carpenter and his mate they were of bourdeaux from whence they came with the pomechatraine which was taken by the maremaid off petit guavers after an obstinate resistance in which they lost forty men but they were of opinion the maremaid could not have taken em having but four guns less than she had which was made amends for by their having about thirty hands on the contrary had not the guernsey come up they thought of boarding and carrying the maremaid these men very willingly came into captain missons measures  these men who had been strippd to the skin beggd leave to make reprisals but the captain would not suffer them though he told the master of the prize as he protected him and his men he thought it reasonable these french should be cloathed upon this the master contributed of his own and every man bringing up his chest thought themselves very well off in sharing with them one half  though missons ship passd for a french man of war yet his generosity in letting the prize go gave the english grounds to suspect the truth neither the ship nor cargoe being of use to such as were upon the grand account  when they had lost all hopes of the st joseph they coasted along the northside of cuba and the victoire growing now foul they ran into a landlockd bay on the east northeast point where they hove her down by boats and guns though they could not pretend to heave her keel out however they scraped and tallowed as far as they could go they for this reason many of them repented they had let the last prize go by which they might have careened  when they had righted the ship and put every thing on board they consulted upon the course they should steer upon this the council divided the captain and caraccioli were for stretching over to the african and the others for the newengland coast alledging that the ship had a foul bottom and was not fit for the voyage and that if they met with contrary winds and bad weather their stock of provision might fall short and that as they were not far from the english settlement of carolina they might either on that or the coast of virginia maryland pensylvania newyork or newengland intercept ships which traded to the islands with provisions and by that means provide themselves with bread flower and other necessaries an account of the provisions were taken and finding they had provisions for four months captain misson called all hands upon deck and told them as the council differed in the course they should steer he thought it reasonable to have it put to the vote of the whole company that for his part he was for going to the coast of guiney where they might reasonably expect to meet with valuable prizes but should they fail in their expectation one way they would be sure of having it answered another for they could then throw themselves in that of the east india ships and he need not tell them that the outward bound dreined europe of what money they drew from america he then gave the sentiments of those who were against him and their reasons and beggd that every one would give his opinion and vote according as he thought most conducive to the good of all that he should be far from taking it ill if they should reject what he had proposed since he had no private views to serve the majority of votes fell on the captains side and they accordingly shaped their course for the coast of guiney in which voyage nothing remarkable happened on their arrival on the goldcoast they fell in with the nieuwstadt of amsterdam a ship of 18 guns commanded by capt blacs who made a running fight of five glasses this ship they kept with them putting on board 40 hands and bringing all the prisoners on board the victoire they were forty three in number they left amsterdam with fifty six seven were killed in the engagement and they had lost six by sickness and accidents one falling overboard and one being taken by a shark going overboard in a calm  the nieuwstadt had some golddust on board to the value of about 2000 l sterling and a few slaves to the number of seventeen for she had but begun to trade the slaves were a strengthening of their hands for the captain orderd them to be cloathed out of dutch mariners chests and told his men that the trading for those of our own species coud never be agreeable to the eyes of divine justice that no man had power or the liberty of another and while those who professd a more enlightened knowledge of the deity sold men like beasts they provd that their religion was no more than grimace and that they differd from the barbarians in name only since their practice was in nothing more humane for his part and he hopd he spoke the sentiments of all his brave companions he had not exempted his neck from the galling yoak of slavery and asserted his own liberty to enslave others that however these men were distinguishd from the europeans by their colour customs or religious rites they were the work of the same omnipotent being and endued with equal reason wherefore he desired they might be treated like freemen for he woud banish even the name of slavery from among them and divided into messes among them to the end they might the sooner learn their language be sensible of the obligation they had to them and more capable and zealous to defend that liberty they owed to their justice and humanity  this speech of missons was received with general applause and the ship rang with vive le capitain misson long live capt missonthe negroes were divided among the french one to a mess who by their gesticulations shewd they were gratefully sensible of their being delivered from their chains their ship growing very foul and going heavily through the water they run into the river of lagoa where they hove her down taking out such planks as had sufferd most by the worms and substituting new in their room  after this they careened the prize and so put out to sea steering to the southward and keeping along the coast but met with nothing all this while the greatest decorum and regularity was observed on board the victoire but the dutch prisoners example began to lead em into swearing and drunkenness which the captain remarking thought it was best to nip these vices in the bud and calling both the french and dutch upon deck he addressd himself to the former desiring their captain who spoke french excellently well to interpret what he said to those who did not understand him he told them before he had the misfortune of having them on board his ears were never grated with hearing the name of the great creator prophaned tho he to his sorrow had often since heard his own men guilty of that sin which administerd neither profit nor pleasure and might draw upon them a severe punishment that if they had a just idea of that great being they woud never mention him but they woud immediately reflect on his purity and their own vileness that we so easily took impression from our company that the spanish proverb says let a hermit and a thief live together the thief woud become hermit or the hermit thief that he saw this verified in his ship for he coud attribute the oaths and curses he had heard among his brave companions to nothing but the odious example of the dutch that this was not the only vice they had introduced for before they were on board his men were men but he found by their beastly pattern they were degenerated into brutes by drowning that only faculty which distinguishes between man and beast reason that as he had the honour to command them he could not see them run into these odious vices without a sincere concern as he had a paternal affection for them and he should reproach himself as neglectful of the common good if he did not admonish them and as by the post which they had honourd him he was obliged to have a watchful eye over their general interest he was obliged to tell them his sentiments were that the dutch allured them to a dissolute way of life that they might take some advantage over them wherefore as his brave companions he was assured woud be guided by reason he gave the dutch notice that the first whom he catchd either with an oath in his mouth or liquor in his head should be brought to the geers whipped and pickled for an example to the rest of his nation as to his friends his companions his children those gallant those generous noble and heroick souls he had the honour to command he entreated them to allow a small time for reflection and to consider how little pleasure sure and how much danger might flow from imitating the vices of their enemies and that they would among themselves make a law for the suppression of what would otherwise estrange them from the source of life and consequently leave them destitute of his protection  it is not to be imagined what efficacy this speech had on both nations the dutch grew continent in fear of punishment and the french in fear of being reproachd by their good captain for they never mentioned him without this epithet upon the coast of angola they met with a second dutch ship the cargo of which consisted of silk and woolen stuffs cloath lace wine brandy oyl spice and hard ware the prize gave chase and engaged her but upon the coming up of the victoire she struck this ship opportunely came in their way and gave full employ to the taylors who were on board for the whole crew began to be out at elbows they plundered her of what was of use to their own ship and then sunk her  the captain having about ninety prisoners on board proposed the giving them the prize with what was necessary for their voyage and sending them away which being agreed to they shifted her ammunition on board the victoire and giving them provision to carry them to the settlements the dutch have on the coast misson called them up told them what was his design and askd if any of them was willing to share his fortune eleven dutch came into him two of which were sail makers one an armourer and one a carpenter necessary hands the rest he let go not a little surprised at the regularity tranquillity and humanity which they found among these new fashioned pyrates  they had now run the length of soldinia bay about ten leagues to the northward of table bay as here is good water safe riding plenty of fish and fresh provision to be got of the natives for the merchandize they had on board it was resolved to stay here some little time for refreshments when they had the bay open they spied a tall ship which instantly got under sail and hove out english colours the victoire made a clear ship and hove out her french ensign and a smart engagement began the english was a new ship built for 40 guns though she had but 32 mounted and 90 hands misson gave orders for boarding and his number of fresh men he constantly poured in after an obstinate dispute obliged the english to fly the decks and leave the french masters of their ship who promised and gave them good quarters and strippd not a man  they found on board the prize some bales of english broadcloath and about 60000 l in english crown pieces and spanish pieces of eight the english captain was killed in the engagement and 14 of his men the french lost 12 which was no small mortification but did not however provoke them to use their prisoners harshly captain misson was sorry for the death of the commander whom he buried on the shoar and one of his men being a stonecutter he raised a stone over his grave with these words icy gist un brave anglois here lies a gallant english man when he was buried he made a tripple discharge of 50 small arms and fired minute guns  the english knowing whose hands they were fallen into charmd with missons humanity 30 of them in 3 days space desired to take on with him he accepted em but at the same time gave em to understand that in taking on with him they were not to expect they should be indulged in a dissolute and immoral life he now divided his company between the two ships and made caraccioli captain of the prize giving him officers chosen by the publick suffrage the 17 negroes began to understand a little french and to be useful hands and in less than a month all the english prisoners came over to him except their officers  he had two ships well mannd with resolute fellows they now doubled the cape and made the south end of madagascar and one of the english men telling captain misson that the european ships bound for surat commonly touchd at the island of johanna he sent for captain caracciola on board and it was agreed to cruise off that island they accordingly sailed on the westside of madagascar and off the bay de diego about half seas over between that bay and the island of johanna they came up with an english eastindia man which made signals of distress as soon as she spyd misson and his prize they found her sinking by an unexpected leak and took all her men on board though they could get little out of her before she went down the english who were thus miraculously saved from perishing desired to be set on shoar at johanna where they hopd to meet with either a dutch or english ship in a little time and the mean while they were sure of relief  they arrived at johanna and were kindly received by the queenregent and her brother on account of the english on the one hand and of their  strength on the other which the queens brother who had the administration of affairs was not able to make head against and hoped they might assist him against the king of mohila who threatend him with a visit  this is an island which is contiguous in a manner to johanna and lies about n w and by n from it caraccioli told misson he might make his advantage in widening the breach between these two little monarchies and by offering his assistance to that of johanna in a manner rule both for these would count him as their protector and those come to any terms to buy his friendship by which means he would hold the ballance of power between them he followed this advice and offered his friendship and assistance to the queen who very readily embraced it  i must advise the reader that many of this island speak english and that the english men who were of missons crew and his interpreters told them their captain though not an englishman was their friend and ally and a friend and brother to the johanna men for they esteem the english beyond all other nations  they were supplied by the queen with all necessaries of life and misson married her sister as caraccioli did the daughter of her brother whose armory which consisted before of no more than two rusty firelocks and three pistols he furnishd with thirty fuzils as many pair of pistols and gave him two barrels of powder and four of ball  several of his men took wives and some requited their share of the prizes which was justly given them they designing to settle in this island but the number of these did not exceed ten which loss was repaired by thirty of the crew they had saved from perishing coming in to him  while they past their time in all manner of diversions the place would afford them as hunting feasting and visiting the island the king of mohila made a descent and alarmd the whole country misson advised the queens brother not to give him any impediment but let him get into the heart of the island and he would take care to intercept their return but the prince answered should he follow his advice the enemy would do him and the subjects an irreparable damage in destroying the cocoa walks and for that reason he must endeavour to stop his progress upon this answer he asked the english who were not under his command if they were willing to join him in repelling the enemies of their common host and one and all consenting he gave them arms and mixed them with his own men and about the same number of johannians under the command of caraccioli and the queens brother and arming out all his boats he went himself to the westward of the island where they made their descent the party which went by land fell in with and beat the mohilians with great ease who were in the greatest consternation to find their retreat cut off by missons boats the johannians whom they had often molested were so enraged that they gave quarter to none and out of 300 who made the descent if misson and caraccioli had not interposed not a soul had escaped 113 were taken prisoners by his men and carried on board his ships these he sent fate to mohila with a message to the king to desire he would make peace with his friend and ally the king of johanna but that prince little affected with the service done him in the preservation of his subjects sent him word he took laws from none and knew when to make war and peace without his advice which he neither asked nor wanted misson irritated by this rude answer resolved to transfer the war into his own country and accordingly set sail for mohila with about 100 johanna men the shoar on sight of the ships was filled with men to hinder a descent if intended but the great guns soon dispersed this rabble and under their cover he landed the johannians and an equal number of french and english they were met by about 700 mohilians who pretended to stop their passage but their darts and arrows were of little avail against missons fuzils the first discharge made a great slaughter and about 20 shells which were thrown among them put them to a confusd flight the party of europeans and johannians then marched to their metropolis without resistance which they reduced to ashes and the johannians cut down all the cocoa walks that they could for the time for towards evening they returned to their ships and stood off to sea  at their return to johanna the queen made a festival and magnified the bravery and service of her guests friends and allies this feast lasted four days at the expiration of which time the queens brother proposed to captain misson the making another descent in which he would go in person and did not doubt subjecting the mohilians but this was not the design of misson who had thoughts of fixing a retreat on the north west side of madagascar and lookd upon the feuds between these two islands advantageous to his views and therefore no way his interest to suffer the one to overcome the other for while the variance was kept up and their forces pretty much upon a level it was evident their interest would make both sides caress him he therefore answerd that they ought to deliberate on the consequences for they might be deceived in their hopes and find the conquest less easy than they imagined that the king of mohilia would be more upon his guard and not only intrench himself but gall them with frequent ambuscades by which they must inevitably lose a number of men and if they were forced to retire with loss raise the courage of the mohilians and make them irreconcilable enemies to the johannians and intirely deprive him of the advantages with which he might now make a peace having twice defeated them that he could not be always with them and at his leaving johanna he might expect the king of mohilia would endeavour to take a bloody revenge for the late damages the queen gave intirely into missons sentiments  while this was in agitation four mohilians arrived as ambassadors to propose a peace they finding the johannians upon high terms one of them spoke to this purpose o ye johannians do not conclude from your late success that fortune will be always favourable she will not always give you the protection of the europeans and without their help its possible you might now sue for a peace which you seem averse to remember the sun rises comes to its meridian height and stays not there but declines in a moment let this admonish you to reflect on the constant revolution of all sublunary affairs and the greater is your glory the nearer you are to your declension we are taught by every thing we see that there is no stability in the world but nature is in continual movement the sea which oer flows the sands has its bounds set which it cannot pass which the moment it has reached without abiding returns back to the bottom of the deep every herb every shrub and tree and even our own bodies teach us this lesson that nothing is durable or can be counted upon time passes away insensibly one sun follows another and brings its changes with it todays globe of light sees you strengthened by these europeans elate with victory and we who have been used to conquer you come to ask a peace to morrows sun may see you deprived of your present succours and the johannians petitioning us as therefore we cannot say what to morrow may bring forth it would be unwise on uncertain hopes to forego a certain advantage as surely peace ought to be esteemd by every wise man  having said this the ambassadors withdrew and were treated by the queens orders after the council had concluded they were again calld upon and the queen told them that by the advice of her good friends the europeans and those of her council she agreed to make a peace which she wishd might banish all memory of former injuries that they must own the war was begun by them and that she was far from being the agressor she only defended her self in her own kingdom which they had often invaded though till within few days she had never molested their coasts if then they really desired to live amicably with her they must resolve to send two of the kings children and ten of the first nobility as hostages that they might when they pleased return for that was the only terms on which she would desist prosecuting the advantages she now had with the utmost vigour  the ambassadors returned with this answer and about ten days after the two ships appearing upon their coasts they sent off to give notice that their king complyd with the terms proposed would send the hostages and desired a cessation of all hostility and at the same time invited the commanders on shoar the johanna men on board disswaded their accepting the invitation but misson and caraccioli fearing nothing went but armd their boats crew they were received by the king with demonstrations of friendship and they dined with him under a tamerane tree but when they parted from him and were returning to their boats they were inclosed by at least 100 of the mohilians who set upon them with the utmost fury and in the first flight of arrows wounded both the captains and killed four of their boats crew of eight who were with them they in return discharged their pistols with some execution and fell in with their cutlasses but all their bravery would have stood them in little stead had not the report of their pistols alarmd and brought the rest of their friends to their assistance who took their fuzils and coming up while they were engaged discharged a volley on the back of the assailants which laid twelve of them dead on the spot the ships hearing this fire sent immediately the yawls and longboats well mannd though the islanders were a little dampd in their courage by this fire of the boats crew yet they did not give over the fight and one of them desperately threw himself upon caraccioli and gave him a deep wound in his side with a long knife but he paid for the rashness of the attempt with his life one of the crew cleaving his skull the yawls and longboats now arrived and being guided by the noise reinforced their companions put the traytors to flight and brought off their dead and wounded the europeans lost by this treachery seven slain outright and eight wounded six of which recovered  the crew were resolved to revenge the blood of their officers and comrades the next day and were accordingly on the point of landing when two canoes came off with two men bound the pretended authors of this treason without the kings knowledge who had sent em that they might receive the punishment due to their villany the johanna men on board were calld for interpreters who having given this account added that the king only sacrificed these men but that they should not believe him for he certainly had given orders for assassinating the europeans and the better way was to kill all the mohilians that came in the canoes as well as the two prisoners go back to johanna take more of their countrymen and give no peace to traytors but misson was for no such violent measures he was averse to every thing that bore the face of cruelty and thought a bloody revenge if necessity did not enforce it spoke a groveling and timid soul he therefore sent those of the canoes back and bid them tell their king if before the evening he sent the hostages agreed upon he should give credit to his excuse but if he did not he should believe him the author of the late vile attempt on his life  the canoes went off but returned not with an answer wherefore he bid the johanna men tell the two prisoners that they should be set on shore the next morning and orderd them to acquaint their king he was no executioner to put those to death whom he had condemnd but that he should find he knew how to revenge himself of his treason the prisoners being unbound threw themselves at his feet and beggd that he would not send them ashore for they should be surely put to death for the crime they had committed was the dissuading the barbarous action of which they were accused as authors  next day the two ships landed 200 men under the cover of their canon but that precaution of bringing their ships close to the shore they found needless not a soul appearing they marchd two leagues up the country when they saw a body of men appear behind some shrubs caracciolis lieutenant who commanded the right wing with fifty men made up to them but found he had got among pit falls artificially coverd several of his men falling into them which made him halt and not pursue those mohilians who made a feint retreat to ensnare him thinking it dangerous to proceed farther and seeing no enemy would face them they retired the same way they came and getting into their boats went on board the ships resolving to return with a strong reinforcement and make descents at one and the same time in different parts of the island they askd the two prisoners how the country lay and what the soil was on the north side the island and they answerd it was morass and the most dangerous part to attempt it being a place where they shelter on any imminent danger  the ships returnd to johanna where the greatest tenderness and care was shown for the recovery and cure of the two captains and of their men they lay six weeks before they were able to walk the decks for neither of them would quit his ship their johanna wives expressed a concern they did not think them capable of nay a wife of one of the wounded men who died stood some time looking upon the corpse as motionless as a statue then embracing it without shedding a tear desired she might take it ashore to wash and bury it and at the same time by an interpreter and with a little mixture of european language she had beggd her late husbands friends would take their leave of him the next day  accordingly a number went ashore and carried with them the dividend which fell to his share which the captain orderd to be given his widow when she saw the money she smild and askd if all all that was for her being answered in the affirmative and what good will all that shining dirt do me if i could with it purchase the life of my husband and call him back from the grave i would accept it with pleasure but as it is not sufficient to allure him back to this world i have no use for it do with it what you please then she desired they would go with her and perform the last ceremonies to her husbands dead body after their country fashion least he should be displeased that she could not stay with them to be a witness because she was in haste to go and be married again she startled the europeans who heard this latter part of her speech so dissonant from the beginning however they followed her and she led them into a plantane walk where they found a great many johanna men and women sitting under the shade of plantanes round the corpse which lay as they all sate on the ground covered with flowers she embraced them round and then the europeans one by one and after these ceremonies she poured out a number of bitter imprecations against the mohila men whose treachery had darkend her husbands eyes and made him insensible of her caresses who was her first love to whom she had given her heart with her virginity she then proceeded in his praises calling him the joy of infants the love of virgins the delight of the old and the wonder of the young adding he was strong and beautiful as the cedar brave as the bull tender as the kid and loving as the ground turtle having finished this oration not unlike those of the romans which the nearest relation of the deceasd used to pronounce from the rostrum she laid her down by the side of her husband embracing him and sitting up again gave herself a deep wound under the left breast with a bayonet and fell dead on her husbands corpse  the europeans were astonished at the tenderness and resolution of the girl for she was not by what her mien spoke her past seventeen and they now admired as much as they had secretly detested her for saying she was in haste to be married again the meaning of which they did not understand  after the husband and wife were buried the crew returnd on board and gave an account of what had passd the captains wives for misson and his were on board the bijoux the name they had given their prize from her make and gilding seemd not in the least surprized and caracciolis lady only said she must be of noble descent for none but the families of the nobility had the privilege allowed them of following their husbands on pain if they transgressed of being thrown into the sea to be eat by fish and they knew that their souls could not rest as long as any of the fish who fed upon them lived misson asked if they intended to have done the same thing had they died we should not answerd his wife have disgraced our families nor is our tenderness for our husbands inferior to hers whom you seem to admire  after their recovery misson proposes a cruize on the coast of zangueber which being agreed to he and caraccioli took leave of the queen and her brother and would have left their wives on the island but they could by no means be induced to the separation it was in vain to urge the shortness of the time they were to cruize they answerd it was farther than mohila they intended to go and if they were miserable in that short absence they could never support a longer and if they would not allow them to keep them company the voyage they must not expect to see them at their return if they intended one  in a word they were obliged to yield to them but told them if the wives of their men should insist as strongly on following their example their tenderness would be their ruin and make them a prey to their enemies they answerd the queen should prevent that by ordering no woman should go on board and if any were in the ships they should return on shore this order was accordingly made and they set sail for the river of mozembique in about ten days cruize after they had left johanna and about 15 leagues to the eastward of this river they fell in with a stout portuguese ship of 60 guns which engaged them from break of day till two in the afternoon when the captain being killed and a great number of men lost she struck this proved a very rich prize for she had the value of 250000 l sterling on board in gold dust the two women never quitted the decks all the time of the engagement neither gave they the least mark of fear except for their husbands this engagement cost them thirty men and caraccioli lost his right leg the slaughter fell mostly on the english for of the above number twenty were of that nation the portuguese lost double the number caracciolis wound made them resolve to make the best of their way for johanna where the greatest care was taken of their wounded not one of whom died tho their number amounted to twenty seven  caraccioli kept his bed two months but misson seeing him in a fair way of recovery took what hands could be spard from the bijoux leaving her sufficient for defence and went out having mounted ten of the portuguese guns for he had hitherto carried but thirty though he had ports for forty he stretched over to madagascar and coasted along this island to the northward as far as the most northerly point when turning back he enterd a bay to the northward of diego suares he run ten leagues up this bay and on the larboard side found it afforded a large and safe harbour with plenty of fresh water he came here to an anchor went ashore and examined into the nature of the soil which he found rich the air wholesome and the country level he told his men that this was an excellent place for an asylum and that he determined here to fortify and raise a small town and make docks for shipping that they might have some place to call their own and a receptacle when age or wounds had renderd them incapable of hardship where they might enjoy the fruits of their labour and go to their graves in peace that he would not however set about this till he had the approbation of the whole company and were he sure they would all approve this design which he hoped it being evidently for the general good he should not think it adviseable to begin any works lest the natives should in his absence destroy them but however as they had nothing upon their hands if they were of his opinion they might begin to fall and square timber ready for the raising a wooden fort when they returnd with their companions  the captains motion was universally applauded and in ten days they felld and rough hewd a hundred and fifty large trees without any interruption from or seeing any of the inhabitants they felld their timber at the waters edge so that they had not the trouble of hawling them any way which would have employd a great deal more time they returned again and acquainted their companions with what they had seen and done and with the captains resolution which they one and all came into  captain misson then told the queen as he had been serviceable to her in her war with the island of mohila and might continue to be of farther use he did not question her lending him assistance in the settling himself on the coast of madagascar and to that end furnish him with 300 men to help in his buildings the queen answered she could do nothing without consent of council and that she would assemble her nobility and did not question their agreeing to any thing he could reasonably define for they were sensible of the obligations the johanians had to him the council was accordingly called and missons demand being told one of the eldest said he did not think it expedient to comply with it nor safe to refuse that they should in agreeing to give him that assistance help to raise a power which might prove formidable to themselves by the being so near a neighbour and these men who had lately protected might when they found it for their interest enslave them on the other hand if they did not comply they had the power to do them great damage that they were to make choice of the least of two possible evils for he could prognosticate no good to johanna by their settling near it another answered that many of them had johanna wives that it was not likely they would make enemies of the johanna men at first settling because their friendship might be of use to them and from their children there was nothing to be apprehended in the next generation for they would be half their own blood that in the mean while if they complyd with the request they might be sure of an ally and protector against the king of mohila wherefore he was for agreeing to the demand  after a long debate in which every inconvenience and advantage was maturely considered it was agreed to send with him the number of men he required on condition he should send them back in four moons make an alliance with them and war against mohila this being agreed to they staid till caraccioli was thoroughly recovered then putting the johannians on board the portuguese ship with 40 french and english and 15 portuguese to work her and setting sail they arrived at the place where misson designed his settlement which he called libertalia and gave the name of liberi to his people desiring in that might be drownd the distingushd names of french english dutch africans c  the first thing they sat about was the raising a fort on each side the harbour which they made of an octogon figure and having finished and mounted them with 40 guns taken out of the portuguese they raised a battery on an angle of ten guns and began to raise houses and magazines under the protection of their forts and ships the portuguese was unriggd and all her sails and cordage carefully laid up while they were very busily employed in the raising a town a party which had often hunted and rambled four or five leagues off their settlement resolved to venture farther into the country they made themselves some huts at about 4 leagues distance from their companions and travelld east south east about 5 leagues farther into the country when they came up with a black who was armd with a bow arrows and a javelin they with a friendly appearance engaged the fellow to lay by his fear and go with them they carried him to their companions and there entertained him three days with a great deal of humanity and then returned with him near the place they found him made him a present of a piece of scarlet baze and an ax he appeared overjoyd at the present and left them with seeming satisfaction  the hunters imagined that there might be some village not far off and observing that he lookd at the sun and then took his way direct south they travelld on the same point of the compass and from the top of a hill they spied a pretty large village and went down to it the men came out with their arms such as before described bows arrows and javelins but upon two only of the whites advancing with presents of axes and baze in their hands they sent only four to meet them the misfortune was that they could not understand one another but by their pointing to the sun and holding up one finger and making one of them go forward and return again with shewing their circumcision and pointing up to heaven with one finger they apprehended they gave them to understand there was but one god who had sent one prophet and concluded from thence and their circumcision they were mahometans the presents were carried to their chief and he seemd to receive them kindly and by signs invited the whites into their village but they remembring the late treachery of the mohilians made signs for victuals to be brought them where they were  more of the history of these adventurers in another place
