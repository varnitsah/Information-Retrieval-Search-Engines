he hath met with and how god hath carried him through them     a preface    or brief account of the publishing this work  written by the author thereof and dedicated to those whom god hath counted him

overcome them the next time we see them we shall find a nest of honey within them  the philistines understand me not  it is something of a relation of the work of god upon my soul even from the very first till now wherein you may perceive my castings down and risings up  for he woundeth and his hands make whole it is written in the scripture isa xxxviii 19 the father to the children shall make known thy truth  yea it was for this reason i lay so long at sinai lev iv 10 11 to see the fire and the cloud and the darkness that i might fear the lord all the days of my life upon earth and tell of his wondrous works to my children psalm lxxviii 35  moses numb xxxiii 1 2 writ of the journeys of the children of israel from egypt to the land of canaan and commanded also that they did remember their forty years travel in the wilderness thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no  deut viii 2  wherefore this i have endeavoured to do and not only so but to publish it also that if god will others may be put in remembrance of what he hath done for their souls by reading his work upon me  it is profitable for christians to be often calling to mind the very beginnings of grace with their souls  it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt  this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations  exod xii 42  o my god saith david ps xlii 6 my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the hill mizar  he remembered also the lion and the bear when he went to fight with the giant of gath  1 sam xvii 36 37  it was pauls accustomed manner acts xxii and that when tried for his life acts xxiv even to open before his judges the manner of his conversion  he would think of that day and that hour in which he first did meet with grace for he found it supported him when god had brought the children of israel out of the red sea far into the wilderness yet they must turn quite about thither again to remember the drowning of their enemies there numb xiv 25 for though they sang his praise before yet they soon forgat his works psalm cvi 11 12  in this discourse of mine you may see much much i say of the grace of god towards me  i thank god i can count it much for it was above my sins and satans temptations too  i can remember my fears and doubts and sad months with comfort they are as the head of goliah in my hand  there was nothing to david like goliahs sword even that sword that should have been sheathed in his bowels for the very sight and remembrance of that did preach forth gods deliverance to him  oh the remembrance of my great sins of my great temptations and of my great fear of perishing for ever  they bring afresh into my mind the remembrance of my great help my great supports from heaven and the great grace that god extended to such a wretch as i  my dear children call to mind the former days and years of ancient times  remember also your songs in the night and commune with your own hearts ps lxxiii 512  yea look diligently and leave no corner therein unsearched for that treasure hid even the treasure of your first and second experience of the grace of god towards you  remember i say the word that first laid hold upon you  remember your terrors of conscience and fear of death and hell  remember also your tears and prayers to god yea how you sighed under every hedge for mercy  have you never a hill mizar to remember  have you forgot the close the milkhouse the stable the barn and the like where god did visit your souls  remember also the word the word i say upon which the lord hath caused you to hope  if you have sinned against light if you are tempted to blaspheme if you are drowned in despair if you think god fights against you or if heaven is hid from your eyes remember it was thus with your father but out of them all the lord delivered me  i could have enlarged much in this my discourse of my temptations and troubles for sin as also of the merciful kindness and working of god with my soul  i could also have stepped into a style much higher than this in which i have here discoursed and could have adorned all things more than here i have seemed to do but i dare not  god did not play in tempting of me neither did i play when i sunk as into the bottomless pit when the pangs of hell caught hold upon me wherefore i may not play in relating of them but be plain and simple and lay down the thing as it was he that liketh it let him receive it and he that doth not let him produce a better  farewell  my dear children  the milk and honey are beyond this wilderness  god be merciful to you and grant that you be not slothful to go in to possess the land  john bunyan    grace abounding to the chief of sinners or a brief relation of the exceeding mercy of god in christ to his poor servant john bunyan     in this my relation of the merciful working of god upon my soul it will not be amiss if in the first place i do in a few words give you a hint of my pedigree and manner of bringing up that thereby the goodness and bounty of god towards me may be the more advanced and magnified before the sons of men  2  for my descent then it was as is well known by many of a low and inconsiderable generation my fathers house being of that rank that is meanest and most despised of all the families in the land wherefore i have not here as others to boast of noble blood or of any highborn state according to the flesh though all things considered i magnify the heavenly majesty for that by this door he brought me into the world to partake of the grace and life that is in christ by the gospel  3  but yet notwithstanding the meanness and inconsiderableness of my parents it pleased god to put it into their hearts to put me to school to learn both to read and write the which i also attained according to the rate of other poor mens children though to my shame i confess i did soon lose that i had learned even almost utterly and that long before the lord did work his gracious work of conversion upon my soul  4  as for my own natural life for the time that i was without god in the world it was indeed according to the course of this world and the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience eph ii 2 3  it was my delight to be taken captive by the devil at his will 2 tim ii 26 being filled with all unrighteousness the which did also so strongly work and put forth itself both in my heart and life and that from a child that i had but few equals especially considering my years which were tender being but few both for cursing swearing lying and blaspheming the holy name of god  5  yea so settled and rooted was i in these things that they became as a second nature to me the which as i have also with soberness considered since did so offend the lord that even in my childhood he did scare and affrighten me with fearful dreams and did terrify me with fearful visions  for often after i have spent this and the other day in sin i have in my bed been greatly afflicted while asleep with the apprehensions of devils and wicked spirits who still as i then thought laboured to draw me away with them of which i could never be rid  6  also i should at these years be greatly afflicted and troubled with the thoughts of the fearful torments of hellfire still fearing that it would be my lot to be found at last among those devils and hellish fiends who are there bound down with the chains and bonds of darkness unto the judgment of the great day  7  these things i say when i was but a child but nine or ten years old did so distress my soul that then in the midst of my many sports and childish vanities amidst my vain companions i was often much cast down and afflicted in my mind therewith yet could i not let go my sins  yea i was also then so overcome with despair of life and heaven that i should often wish either that there had been no hell or that i had been a devil supposing they were only tormentors that if it must needs be that i went thither i might be rather a tormentor than be tormented myself  8 a while after those terrible dreams did leave me which also i soon forgot for my pleasures did quickly cut off the remembrance of them as if they had never been  wherefore with more greediness according to the strength of nature i did still let loose the reins of my lust and delighted in all transgressions against the law of god  so that until i came to the state of marriage i was the very ringleader of all the youth that kept me company in all manner of vice and ungodliness  9  yea such prevalency had the lusts and fruits of the flesh in this poor soul of mine that had not a miracle of precious grace prevented i had not only perished by the stroke of eternal justice but had also laid myself open even to the stroke of those laws which bring some to disgrace and open shame before the face of the world  10  in these days the thoughts of religion were very grievous to me i could neither endure it myself nor that any other should so that when i have seen some read in those books that concerned christian piety it would be as it were a prison to me  then i said unto god depart from me for i desire not the knowledge of thy ways  job xxi 14 15  i was now void of all good consideration heaven and hell were both out of sight and mind and as for saving and damning they were least in my thoughts  o lord thou knowest my life and my ways were not hid from thee  11  but this i well remember that though i could myself sin with the greatest delight and ease and also take pleasure in the vileness of my companions yet even then if i had at any time seen wicked things by those who professed goodness it would make my spirit tremble  as once above all the rest when i was in the height of vanity yet hearing one to swear that was reckoned for a religious man it had so great a stroke upon my spirit that it made my heart ache  12  but god did not utterly leave me but followed me still not now with convictions but judgments yet such as were mixed with mercy  for once i fell into a creek of the sea and hardly escaped drowning  another time i fell out of a boat into bedford river but mercy yet preserved me alive  besides another time being in a field with one of my companions it chanced that an adder passed over the highway so i having a stick in my hand struck her over the back and having stunned her i forced open her mouth with my stick and plucked her sting out with my fingers by which act had not god been merciful unto me i might by my desperateness have brought myself to my end  13  this also i have taken notice of with thanksgiving  when i was a soldier i with others were drawn out to go to such a place to besiege it but when i was just ready to go one of the company desired to go in my room  to which when i had consented he took my place and coming to the siege as he stood sentinel he was shot in the head with a musketbullet and died  14  here as i said were judgments and mercy but neither of them did awaken my soul to righteousness wherefore i sinned still and grew more and more rebellious against god and careless of my own salvation  15  presently after this i changed my condition into a married state and my mercy was to light upon a wife whose father was counted godly  this woman and i though we came together as poor as poor might be not having so much household stuff as a dish or a spoon betwixt us both yet this she had for her part  the plain mans pathway to heaven and the practice of piety which her father had left her when he died  in these two books i would sometimes read with her wherein i also found some things that were somewhat pleasing to me but all this while i met with no conviction  she also would be often telling of me what a godly man her father was and how he would reprove and correct vice both in his house and among his neighbours what a strict and holy life he lived in his days both in word and deed  16  wherefore these books with this relation though they did not reach my heart to awaken it about my sad and sinful state yet they did beget within me some desires to religion  so that because i knew no better i fell in very eagerly with the religion of the times to wit to go to church twice a day and that too with the foremost and there should very devoutly both say and sing as others did yet retaining my wicked life but withal i was so overrun with the spirit of superstition that i adored and that with great devotion even all things both the highplace priest clerk vestment service and what else belonging to the church counting all things holy that were therein contained and especially the priest and clerk most happy and without doubt greatly blessed because they were the servants as i then thought of god and were principal in the holy temple to do his work therein  17  this conceit grew so strong in a little time upon my spirit that had i but seen a priest though never so sordid and debauched in his life i should find my spirit fall under him reverence him and knit unto him yea i thought for the love i did bear unto them supposing them the ministers of god i could have laid down at their feet and have been trampled upon by them their name their garb and work did so intoxicate and bewitch me  18  after i had been thus for some considerable time another thought came in my mind and that was whether we were of the israelites or no  for finding in the scripture that they were once the peculiar people of god thought i if i were one of this race my soul must needs be happy  now again i found within me a great longing to be resolved about this question but could not tell how i should  at last i asked my father of it who told me no we were not  wherefore then i fell in my spirit as to the hopes of that and so remained  19  but all this while i was not sensible of the danger and evil of sin i was kept from considering that sin would damn me what religion soever i followed unless i was found in christ  nay i never thought of him or whether there was such a one or no  thus man while blind doth wander but wearieth himself with vanity for he knoweth not the way to the city of god  eccles x 15  20  but one day amongst all the sermons our parson made his subject was to treat of the sabbath day and of the evil of breaking that either with labour sports or otherwise  now i was notwithstanding my religion one that took much delight in all manner of vice and especially that was the day that i did solace myself therewith  wherefore i fell in my conscience under his sermon thinking and believing that he made that sermon on purpose to show me my evil doing  and at that time i felt what guilt was though never before that i can remember but then i was for the present greatly loaden therewith and so went home when the sermon was ended with a great burthen upon my spirit  21  this for that instant did benumb the sinews of my best delights and did imbitter my former pleasures to me but hold it lasted not for before i had well dined the trouble began to go off my mind and my heart returned to its old course  but oh how glad was i that this trouble was gone from me and that the fire was put out that i might sin again without control  wherefore when i had satisfied nature with my food i shook the sermon out of my mind and to my old custom of sports and gaming i returned with great delight  22  but the same day as i was in the midst of a game of cat and having struck it one blow from the hole just as i was about to strike it the second time a voice did suddenly dart from heaven into my soul which said wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven or have thy sins and go to hell  at this i was put to an exceeding maze wherefore leaving my cat upon the ground i looked up to heaven and was as if i had with the eyes of my understanding seen the lord jesus looking down upon me as being very hotly displeased with me and as if he did severely threaten me with some grievous punishment for these and other ungodly practices  23  i had no sooner thus conceived in my mind but suddenly this conclusion was fastened on my spirit for the former hint did set my sins again before my face that i had been a great and grievous sinner and that it was now too late for me to look after heaven for christ would not forgive me nor pardon my transgressions then i fell to musing on this also and while i was thinking of it and fearing lest it should be so i felt my heart sink in despair concluding it was too late and therefore i resolved in my mind i would go on in sin  for thought i if the case be thus my state is surely miserable miserable if i leave my sins and but miserable if i follow them i can but be damned and if i must be so i had as good be damned for many sins as be damned for few  24  thus i stood in the midst of my play before all that then were present  but yet i told them nothing  but i say having made this conclusion i returned desperately to my sport again and i well remember that presently this kind of despair did so possess my soul that i was persuaded i could never attain to other comfort than what i should get in sin for heaven was gone already so that on that i must not think wherefore i found within me great desire to take my fill of sin still studying what sin was yet to be committed that i might taste the sweetness of it and i made as much haste as i could to fill my belly with its delicates lest i should die before i had my desire for that i feared greatly  in these things i protest before god i lye not neither do i feign this form of speech these were really strongly and with all my heart my desires  the good lord whose mercy is unsearchable forgive me my transgressions  25  and i am very confident that this temptation of the devil is more usual among poor creatures than many are aware of even to overrun the spirits with a scurvy and seared frame of heart and benumbing of conscience which frame he stilly and slily supplieth with such despair that though not much guilt attendeth souls yet they continually have a secret conclusion within them that there is no hope for them for they have loved sins therefore after them they will go  jer ii 25 and xviii 12  26  now therefore i went on in sin with great greediness of mind still grudging that i could not be so satisfied with it as i would  this did continue with me about a month or more but one day as i was standing at a neighbours shop window and there cursing and swearing and playing the madman after my wonted manner there sate within the woman of the house and heard me who though she also was a very loose and ungodly wretch yet protested that i swore and cursed at that most fearful rate that she was made to tremble to hear me and told me further that i was the ungodliest fellow for swearing that she ever heard in all her life and that i by thus doing was able to spoil all the youth in the whole town if they come but in my company  27  at this reproof i was silenced and put to secret shame and that too as i thought before the god of heaven wherefore while i stood there and hanging down my head i wished with all my heart that i might be a little child again that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked way of swearing for thought i i am so accustomed to it that it is in vain for me to think of a reformation for i thought it could never be  28  but how it came to pass i know not i did from this time forward so leave my swearing that it was a great wonder to myself to observe it and whereas before i knew not how to speak unless i put an oath before and another behind to make my words have authority now i could without it speak better and with more pleasantness than ever i could before  all this while i knew not jesus christ neither did i leave my sports and plays  29  but quickly after this i fell into company with one poor man that made profession of religion who as i then thought did talk pleasantly of the scriptures and of the matters of religion wherefore falling into some love and liking to what he said i betook me to my bible and began to take great pleasure in reading but especially with the historical part thereof for as for pauls epistles and such like scriptures i could not away with them being as yet ignorant either of the corruptions of my nature or of the want and worth of jesus christ to save me  30  wherefore i fell to some outward reformation both in my words and life and did set the commandments before me for my way to heaven which commandments i also did strive to keep and as i thought did keep them pretty well sometimes and then i should have comfort yet now and then should break one and so afflict my conscience but then i should repent and say i was sorry for it and promise god to do better next time and there get help again for then i thought i pleased god as well as any man in england  31  thus i continued about a year all which time our neighbours did take me to be a very godly man a new and religious man and did marvel much to see such a great and famous alteration in my life and manners and indeed so it was though yet i knew not christ nor grace nor faith nor hope for as i have well seen since had i then died my state had been most fearful  32  but i say my neighbours were amazed at this my great conversion from prodigious profaneness to something like a moral life and truly so they well might for this my conversion was as great as for tom of bethlehem to become a sober man  now therefore they began to praise to commend and to speak well of me both to my face and behind my back  now i was as they said become godly now i was become a right honest man  but oh when i understood these were their words and opinions of me it pleased me mighty well  for though as yet i was nothing but a poor painted hypocrite yet i loved to be talked of as one that was truly godly  i was proud of my godliness and indeed i did all i did either to be seen of or to be well spoken of by men  and thus i continued for about a twelvemonth or more  33  now you must know that before this i had taken much delight in ringing but my conscience beginning to be tender i thought such practice was but vain and therefore forced myself to leave it yet my mind hankered wherefore i would go to the steeple house and look on though i durst not ring  but i thought this did not become religion neither yet i forced myself and would look on still but quickly after i began to think how if one of the bells should fall  then i chose to stand under a main beam that lay overthwart the steeple from side to side thinking here i might stand sure but then i should think again should the bell fall with a swing it might first hit the wall and then rebounding upon me might kill me for all this beam this made me stand in the steepledoor and now thought i i am safe enough for if the bell should now fall i can slip out behind these thick walls and so be preserved notwithstanding  34  so after this i would yet go to see them ring but would not go any farther than the steepledoor but then it came into my head how if the steeple itself should fall  and this thought it may for aught i know when i stood and looked on did continually so shake my mind that i durst not stand at the steepledoor any longer but was forced to flee for fear the steeple should fall upon my head  35  another thing was my dancing i was a full year before i could quite leave that but all this while when i thought i kept this or that commandment or did by word or deed anything that i thought was good i had great peace in my conscience and should think with myself god cannot choose but be now pleased with me yea to relate it in mine own way i thought no man in england could please god better than i  36  but poor wretch as i was  i was all this while ignorant of jesus christ and going about to establish my own righteousness and had perished therein had not god in mercy showed me more of my state by nature  37  but upon a day the good providence of god called me to bedford to work on my calling and in one of the streets of that town i came where there were three or four poor women sitting at a door in the sun talking about the things of god and being now willing to hear them discourse i drew near to hear what they said for i was now a brisk talker also myself in the matters of religion but i may say i heard but understood not for they were far above out of my reach  their talk was about a new birth the work of god on their hearts also how they were convinced of their miserable state by nature they talked how god had visited their souls with his love in the lord jesus and with what words and promises they had been refreshed comforted and supported against the temptations of the devil  moreover they reasoned of the suggestions and temptations of satan in particular and told to each other by which they had been afflicted and how they were borne up under his assaults  they also discoursed of their own wretchedness of heart and of their unbelief and did contemn slight and abhor their own righteousness as filthy and insufficient to do them any good  38  and methought they spake as if joy did make them speak they spake with such pleasantness of scripture language and with such appearance of grace in all they said that they were to me as if they had found a new world as if they were people that dwelt alone and were not to be reckoned among their neighbours  numb xxiii 9  39  at this i felt my own heart began to shake and mistrust my condition to be naught for i saw that in all my thoughts about religion and salvation the newbirth did never enter into my mind neither knew i the comfort of the word and promise nor the deceitfulness and treachery of my own wicked heart  as for secret thoughts i took no notice of them neither did i understand what satans temptations were nor how they were to be withstood and resisted etc  40  thus therefore when i had heard and considered what they said i left them and went about my employment again but their talk and discourse went with me also my heart would tarry with them for i was greatly affected with their words both because by them i was convinced that i wanted the true tokens of a truly godly man and also because by them i was convinced of the happy and blessed condition of him that was such a one  41  therefore i should often make it my business to be going again and again into the company of these poor people for i could not stay away and the more i went amongst them the more i did question my condition and as i still do remember presently i found two things within me at which i did sometimes marvel especially considering what a blind ignorant sordid and ungodly wretch but just before i was  the one was a very great softness and tenderness of heart which caused me to fall under the conviction of what by scripture they asserted and the other was a great bending in my mind to a continual meditating on it and on all other good things which at any time i heard or read of  42  by these things my mind was now so turned that it lay like an horseleech at the vein still crying out give give prov xxx 15 yea it was so fixed on eternity and on the things about the kingdom of heaven that is so far as i knew though as yet god knows i knew but little that neither pleasures nor profits nor persuasions nor threats could loose it or make it let go its hold and though i may speak it with shame yet it is in very deed a certain truth it would then have been as difficult for me to have taken my mind from heaven to earth as i have found it often since to get again from earth to heaven  43  one thing i may not omit  there was a young man in our town to whom my heart before was knit more than to any other but he being a most wicked creature for cursing and swearing and whoreing i now shook him off and forsook his company but about a quarter of a year after i had left him i met him in a certain lane and asked him how he did  he after his old swearing and mad way answered he was well  but harry said i why do you curse and swear thus  what will become of you if you die in this condition  he answered me in a great chafe what would the devil do for company if it were not for such as i am  44  about this time i met with some ranters books that were put forth by some of our countrymen which books were also highly in esteem by several old professors some of these i read but was not able to make any judgment about them wherefore as i read in them and thought upon them seeing myself unable to judge i would betake myself to hearty prayer in this manner  o lord i am a fool and not able to know the truth from error  lord leave me not to my own blindness either to approve of or condemn this doctrine if it be of god let me not despise it if it be of the devil let me not embrace it  lord i lay my soul in this matter only at thy foot let me not be deceived i humbly beseech thee  i had one religious intimate companion all this while and that was the poor man i spoke of before but about this time he also turned a most devilish ranter and gave himself up to all manner of filthiness especially uncleanness  he would also deny that there was a god angel or spirit and would laugh at all exhortations to sobriety when i laboured to rebuke his wickedness he would laugh the more and pretend that he had gone through all religions and could never light on the right till now  he told me also that in a little time i should see all professors turn to the ways of the ranters  wherefore abominating those cursed principles i left his company forthwith and became to him as great a stranger as i had been before a familiar  45  neither was this man only a temptation to me but my calling lying in the country i happened to light into several peoples company who though strict in religion formerly yet were also swept away by these ranters  these would also talk with me of their ways and condemn me as legal and dark pretending that they only had attained to perfection that could do what they would and not sin  oh these temptations were suitable to my flesh i being but a young man and my nature in its prime but god who had as i hoped designed me for better things kept me in the fear of his name and did not suffer me to accept such cursed principles  and blessed be god who put it into my heart to cry to him to be kept and directed still distrusting my own wisdom for i have since seen even the effects of that prayer in his preserving me not only from ranting errors but from those also that have sprung up since  the bible was precious to me in those days  46  and now methought i began to look into the bible with new eyes and read as i never did before and especially the epistles of the apostle st paul were sweet and pleasant to me and indeed i was then never out of the bible either by reading or meditation still crying out to god that i might know the truth and way to heaven and glory  47  and as i went on and read i lighted upon that passage to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word knowledge by the same spirit and to another faith etc  1 cor xii  and though as i have since seen that by this scripture the holy ghost intends in special things extraordinary yet on me it did then fasten with conviction that i did want things ordinary even that understanding and wisdom that other christians had  on this word i mused and could not tell what to do especially this word faith put me to it for i could not help it but sometimes must question whether i had any faith or no but i was loath to conclude i had no faith for if i do so thought i then i shall count myself a very castaway indeed  48  no said i with myself though i am convinced that i am an ignorant sot and that i want those blessed gifts of knowledge and understanding that other people have yet at a venture i will conclude i am not altogether faithless though i know not what faith is for it was shewn me and that too as i have seen since by satan that those who conclude themselves in a faithless state have neither rest nor quiet in their souls and i was loath to fall quite into despair  49  wherefore by this suggestion i was for a while made afraid to see my want of faith but god would not suffer me thus to undo and destroy my soul but did continually against this my sad and blind conclusion create still within me such suppositions insomuch that i could not rest content until i did now come to some certain knowledge whether i had faith or no this always running in my mind but how if you want faith indeed  but how can you tell you have faith  and besides i saw for certain if i had not i was sure to perish for ever  50  so that though i endeavoured at the first to look over the business of faith yet in a little time i better considering the matter was willing to put myself upon the trial whether i had faith or no  but alas poor wretch so ignorant and brutish was i that i knew not to this day no more how to do it than i know how to begin and accomplish that rare and curious piece of art which i never yet saw or considered  51  wherefore while i was thus considering and being put to my plunge about it for you must know that as yet i had in this matter broken my mind to no man only did hear and consider the tempter came in with this delusion that there was no way for me to know i had faith but by trying to work some miracle urging those scriptures that seem to look that way for the enforcing and strengthening his temptation  nay one day as i was between elstow and bedford the temptation was hot upon me to try if i had faith by doing some miracle which miracle at this time was this i must say to the puddles that were in the horsepads be dry and to the dry places be you puddles  and truly one time i was going to say so indeed but just as i was about to speak this thought came into my mind but go under yonder hedge and pray first that god would make you able  but when i had concluded to pray this came hot upon me that if i prayed and came again and tried to do it and yet did nothing notwithstanding then to be sure i had no faith but was a castaway and lost nay thought i if it be so i will not try yet but will stay a little longer  52  so i continued at a great loss for i thought if they only had faith which could do so wonderful things then i concluded that for the present i neither had it nor yet for the time to come were ever like to have it  thus i was tossed betwixt the devil and my own ignorance and so perplexed especially at some times that i could not tell what to do  53  about this time the state and happiness of these poor people at bedford was thus in a kind of a vision presented to me i saw as if they were on the sunny side of some high mountain there refreshing themselves with the pleasant beams of the sun while i was shivering and shrinking in the cold afflicted with frost snow and dark clouds  methought also betwixt me and them i saw a wall that did compass about this mountain now through this wall my soul did greatly desire to pass concluding that if i could i would even go into the very midst of them and there also comfort myself with the heat of their sun  54  about this wall i bethought myself to go again and again still prying as i went to see if i could find some way or passage by which i might enter therein  but none could i find for some time  at the last i saw as it were a narrow gap like a little doorway in the wall through which i attempted to pass  now the passage being very strait and narrow i made many offers to get in but all in vain even until i was wellnigh quite beat out by striving to get in at last with great striving methought i at first did get in my head and after that by a sideling striving my shoulders and my whole body then i was exceeding glad went and sat down in the midst of them and so was comforted with the light and heat of their sun  55  now this mountain and wall etc was thus made out to me the mountain signified the church of the living god  the sun that shone thereon the comfortable shining of his merciful face on them that were therein the wall i thought was the word that did make separation between the christians and the world and the gap which was in the wall i thought was jesus christ who is the way to god the father  john xiv 6 matt vii 14  but forasmuch as the passage was wonderful narrow even so narrow that i could not but with great difficulty enter in thereat it showed me that none could enter into life but those that were in downright earnest and unless also they left that wicked world behind them for here was only room for body and soul but not for body and soul and sin  56  this resemblance abode upon my spirit many days all which time i saw myself in a forlorn and sad condition but yet was provoked to a vehement hunger and desire to be one of that number that did sit in the sunshine  now also i should pray wherever i was  whether at home or abroad in house or field and would also often with lifting up of heart sing that of the fiftyfirst psalm o lord consider my distress for as yet i knew not where i was  57  neither as yet could i attain to any comfortable persuasion that i had faith in christ but instead of having satisfaction here i began to find my soul to be assaulted with fresh doubts about my future happiness especially with such as these whether i was elected  but how if the day of grace should now be past and gone  58  by these two temptations i was very much afflicted and disquieted sometimes by one and sometimes by the other of them and first to speak of that about my questioning my election i found at this time that though i was in a flame to find the way to heaven and glory and though nothing could beat me off from this yet this question did so offend and discourage me that i was especially sometimes as if the very strength of my body also had been taken away by the force and power thereof  this scripture did also seem to me to trample upon all my desires it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that showeth mercy  rom ix 16  59  with this scripture i could not tell what to do  for i evidently saw unless that the great god of his infinite grace and bounty had voluntarily chosen me to be a vessel of mercy though i should desire and long and labour until my heart did break no good could come of it  therefore this would stick with me how can you tell that you are elected  and what if you should not  how then  60  o lord thought i what if i should not indeed  it may be you are not said the tempter it may be so indeed thought i  why then said satan you had as good leave off and strive no farther for if indeed you should not be elected and chosen of god there is no talk of your being saved for it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that showeth mercy  61  by these things i was driven to my wits end not knowing what to say or how to answer these temptations  indeed i little thought that satan had thus assaulted me but that rather it was my own prudence thus to start the question  for that the elect only attained eternal life that i without scruple did heartily close withal but that myself was one of them there lay the question  62  thus therefore for several days i was greatly assaulted and perplexed and was often when i have been walking ready to sink where i went with faintness in my mind but one day after i had been so many weeks oppressed and cast down therewith as i was now quite giving up the ghost of all my hopes of ever attaining life that sentence fell with weight upon my spirit look at the generations of old and see did ever any trust in god and were confounded  63  at which i was greatly lightened and encouraged in my soul for thus at that very instant it was expounded to me  begin at the beginning of genesis and read to the end of the revelations and see if you can find that there were ever any that trusted in the lord and were confounded  so coming home i presently went to my bible to see if i could find that saying not doubting but to find it presently for it was so fresh and with such strength and comfort on my spirit that it was as if it talked with me  64  well i looked but i found it not only it abode upon me then did i ask first this good man and then another if they knew where it was but they knew no such place  at this i wondered that such a sentence should so suddenly and with such comfort and strength seize and abide upon my heart and yet that none could find it for i doubted not but that it was in holy scripture  65  thus i continued above a year and could not find the place but at last casting my eye upon the apocrypha books i found it in ecclesiasticus eccles ii 10  this at the first did somewhat daunt me but because by this time i had got more experience of the love and kindness of god it troubled me the less especially when i considered that though it was not in those texts that we call holy and canonical yet forasmuch as this sentence was the sum and substance of many of the promises it was my duty to take the comfort of it and i bless god for that word for it was of god to me  that word doth still at times shine before my face  66  after this that other doubt did come with strength upon me but how if the day of grace should be past and gone  how if you have overstood the time of mercy  now i remember that one day as i was walking in the country i was much in the thoughts of this but how if the day of grace is past  and to aggravate my trouble the tempter presented to my mind those good people of bedford and suggested thus unto me that these being converted already they were all that god would save in those parts and that i came too late for these had got the blessing before i came  67  now i was in great distress thinking in very deed that this might well be so wherefore i went up and down bemoaning my sad condition counting myself far worse than a thousand fools for standing off thus long and spending so many years in sin as i had done still crying out oh that i had turned sooner  oh that i had turned seven years ago  it made me also angry with myself to think that i should have no more wit but to trifle away my time till my soul and heaven were lost  68  but when i had been long vexed with this fear and was scarce able to take one step more just about the same place where i received my other encouragement these words broke in upon my mind compel them to come in that my house may be filled and yet there is room  luke xiv 22 23  these words but especially those and yet there is room were sweet words to me for truly i thought that by them i saw there was place enough in heaven for me and moreover that when the lord jesus did speak these words he then did think of me  and that he knowing that the time would come that i should be afflicted with fear that there was no place left for me in his bosom did before speak this word and leave it upon record that i might find help thereby against this vile temptation  this i then verily believed  69  in the light and encouragement of this word i went a pretty while and the comfort was the more when i thought that the lord jesus should think on me so long ago and that he should speak those words on purpose for my sake for i did think verily that he did on purpose speak them to encourage me withal  70  but i was not without my temptations to go back again temptations i say both from satan mine own heart and carnal acquaintance but i thank god these were outweighed by that sound sense of death and of the day of judgment which abode as it were continually in my view  i would often also think on nebuchadnezzar of whom it is said he had given him all the kingdoms of the earth  dan v 18 19  yet thought i if this great man had all his portion in this world one hour in hellfire would make him forget all  which consideration was a great help to me  71  i was also made about this time to see something concerning the beasts that moses counted clean and unclean  i thought those beasts were types of men the clean types of them that were the people of god but the unclean types of such as were the children of the wicked one  now i read that the clean beasts chewed the cud that is thought i they show us we must feed upon the word of god  they also parted the hoof  i thought that signified we must part if we would be saved with the ways of ungodly men  and also in further reading about them i found that though we did chew the cud as the hare yet if we walked with claws like a dog or if we did part the hoof like the swine yet if we did not chew the cud as the sheep we were still for all that but unclean for i thought the hare to be a type of those that talk of the word yet walk in the ways of sin and that the swine was like him that parted with his outward pollutions but still wanteth the word of faith without which there could be no way of salvation let a man be never so devout  deut xiv  after this i found by reading the word that those that must be glorified with christ in another world must be called by him here called to the partaking of a share in his word and righteousness and to the comforts and first fruits of his spirit and to a peculiar interest in all those heavenly things which do indeed prepare the soul for that rest and house of glory which is in heaven above  72  here again i was at a very i great stand not knowing what to do fearing i was not called for thought i if i be not called what then can do me good  none but those who are effectually called inherit the kingdom of heaven  but oh how i now loved those words that spake of a christians calling as when the lord said to one follow me and to another come after me  and oh thought i that he would say so to me too  how gladly would i run after him  73  i cannot now express with what longings and breathings in my soul i cried to christ to call me  thus i continued for a time all on a flame to be converted to jesus christ and did also see at that day such glory in a converted state that i could not be contented without a share therein  gold could it have been gotten for gold what would i have given for it  had i had a whole world it had all gone ten thousand times over for this that my soul might have been in a converted state  74  how lovely now was every one in my eyes that i thought to be converted men and women  they shone they walked like a people that carried the broad seal of heaven about them  oh i saw the lot was fallen to them in pleasant places and they had a goodly heritage  psalm xvi  but that which made me sick was that of christ in st mark he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him  mark iii 13  75  this scripture made me faint and fear yet it kindled fire in my soul  that which made me fear was this lest christ should have no liking to me for he called whom he would  but oh the glory that i saw in that condition did still so engage my heart that i could seldom read of any that christ did call but i presently wished would i had been in their clothes would i had been born peter would i had been born john or would i had been by and had heard him when he called them how would i have cried o lord call me also  but oh  i feared he would not call me  76  and truly the lord let me go thus many months together and shewed me nothing either that i was already or should be called hereafter  but at last after much time spent and many groans to god that i might be made partaker of the holy and heavenly calling that word came in upon me  i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the lord dwelleth in zion  joel iii 21  these words i thought were sent to encourage me to wait still upon god and signified unto me that if i were not already yet time might come i might be in truth converted unto christ  77  about this time i began to break my mind to those poor people in bedford and to tell them my condition which when they had heard they told mr gifford of me who himself also took occasion to talk with me and was willing to be well persuaded of me though i think from little grounds  but he invited me to his house where i should hear him confer with others about the dealings of god with their souls from all which i still received more conviction and from that time began to see something of the vanity and inward wretchedness of my wicked heart for as yet i knew no great matter therein but now it began to be discovered unto me and also to work at that rate as it never did before  now i evidently found that lusts and corruptions put forth themselves within me in wicked thoughts and desires which i did not regard before my desires also for heaven and life began to fail i found also that whereas before my soul was full of longing after god now it began to hanker after every foolish vanity yea my heart would not be moved to mind that which was good it began to be careless both of my soul and heaven it would now continually hang back both to and in every duty and was as a clog on the leg of a bird to hinder me from flying  78  nay thought i now i grow worse and worse  now i am farther from conversion than ever i was before  wherefore i began to sink greatly in my soul and began to entertain such discouragement in my heart as laid me as low as hell  if now i should have burned at the stake i could not believe that christ had love for me alas  i could neither hear him nor see him nor feel him nor favour any of his things i was driven as with a tempest my heart would be unclean and the canaanites would dwell in the land  79  sometimes i would tell my condition to the people of god which when they heard they would pity me and would tell me of the promises but they had as good have told me that i must reach the sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely upon the promises  and as soon i should have done it  all my sense and feeling were against me and i saw i had an heart that would sin and that lay under a law that would condemn  80  these things have often made me think of the child which the father brought to christ who while he was yet coming to him was thrown down by the devil and also so rent and torn by him that he lay down and wallowed foaming  luke ix 42 mark ix 20  81  further in these days i would find my heart to shut itself up against the lord and against his holy word  i have found my unbelief to set as it were the shoulder to the door to keep him out and that too even then when i have with many a bitter sigh cried good lord break it open  lord break these gates of brass and cut these bars of iron asunder  psalm cvii 16  yet that word would sometimes create in my heart a peaceable pause i girded thee though thou hast not known me  isaiah xlv 5  82  but all this while as to the act of sinning i was never more tender than now  my hinder parts were inward  i durst not take a pin or stick though but so big as a straw for my conscience now was sore and would smart at every touch  i could not now tell how to speak my words for fear i should misplace them  oh how gingerly did i then go in all i did or said  i found myself as on a miry bog that shook if i did but stir and was as there left both of god and christ and the spirit and all good things  83  but i observed though i was such a great sinner before conversion yet god never much charged the guilt of the sins of my ignorance upon me only he showed me i was lost if i had not christ because i had been a sinner  i saw that i wanted a perfect righteousness to present me without fault before god and this righteousness was no where to be found but in the person of jesus christ  84  but my original and inward pollution that that was my plague and affliction that i saw at a dreadful rate always putting forth itself within me that i had the guilt of to amazement by reason of that i was more loathsome in mine own eyes than was a toad and i thought i was so in gods eyes too  sin and corruption i said would as naturally bubble out of my heart as water would bubble out of a fountain  i thought now that every one had a better heart than i had i could have changed heart with any body i thought none but the devil himself could equalise me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind  i fell therefore at the sight of my own vileness deeply into despair for i concluded that this condition that i was in could not stand with a state of grace sure thought i i am forsaken of god sure i am given up to the devil and to a reprobate mind  and thus i continued a long while even for some years together  85  while i was thus afflicted with the fears of my own damnation there were two things would make me wonder the one was when i saw old people hunting after the things of this life as if they should live here always  the other was when i found professors much distressed and cast down when they met with outward losses as of husband wife child etc  lord thought i what ado is here about such little things as these  what seeking after carnal things by some and what grief in others for the loss of them if they so much labour after and shed so many tears for the things of this present life how am i to be bemoaned pitied and prayed for my soul is dying my soul is damning  were my soul but in a good condition and were i but sure of it ah how rich should i esteem myself though blessed but with bread and water  i should count those but small afflictions and should bear them as little burthens  a wounded spirit who can bear  86 and though i was much troubled and tossed and afflicted with the sight and sense and terror of my own wickedness yet i was afraid to let this sight and sense go quite off my mind  that unless guilt of conscience was taken off the right way that is by the blood of christ a man grew rather worse for the loss of his trouble of mind than better  wherefore if my guilt lay hard upon me then i should cry that the blood of christ might take it off and if it was going off without it for the sense of sin would be sometimes as if it would die and go quite away then i would also strive to fetch it upon my heart again by bringing the punishment of sin in hell fire upon my spirit and should cry lord let it not go off my heart but the right way by the blood of christ and the application of thy mercy through him to my soul for that scripture lay much upon me without shedding of blood is no remission  heb ix 22  and that which made me the more afraid of this was because i had seen some who though when they were under wounds of conscience would cry and pray yet seeking rather present ease from their trouble than pardon for their sin cared not how they lost their guilt so they got it out of their mind now having got it off the wrong way it was not sanctified unto them but they grew harder and blinder and more wicked after their trouble  this made me afraid and made me cry to god the more that it might not be so with me  87  and now i was sorry that god had made me man for i feared i was a reprobate i counted man as unconverted the most doleful of all the creatures  thus being afflicted and tossed about my sad condition i counted myself alone and above the most of men unblessed  88  yea i thought it impossible that ever i should attain to so much goodness of heart as to thank god that he had made me a man man indeed is the most noble by creation of all creatures in the visible world but by sin he has made himself the most ignoble the beasts birds fishes etc  i blessed their condition for they had not a sinful nature they were not obnoxious to the wrath of god they were not to go to hellfire after death i could therefore have rejoiced had my condition been as any of theirs  89  in this condition i went a great while but when comforting time was come i heard one preach a sermon on these words in the song song iv 1 behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair  but at that time he made these two words my love his chief and subject matter  from which after he had a little opened the text he observed these several conclusions  1 that the church and so every saved soul is christs love when loveless  2 christs love without a cause  3 christs love when hated of the world  4 christs love when under temptation and under destruction  5 christs love from first to last  90  but i got nothing by what he said at present only when he came to the application of the fourth particular this was the word he said if it be so that the saved soul is christs love when under temptation and desertion then poor tempted soul when thou art assaulted and afflicted with temptations and the hidings of gods face yet think on these two words my love still  91  so as i was going home these words came again into my thoughts and i well remember as they came in i said thus in my heart what shall i get by thinking on these two words  this thought had no sooner passed through my heart but these words began thus to kindle in my spirit thou art my love thou art my dove twenty times together and still as they ran in my mind they waxed stronger and warmer and began to make me look up but being as yet between hope and fear i still replied in my heart but is it true but is it true  at which that sentence fell upon me he wist not that it was true which was done by the angel  acts xii 9  92  then i began to give place to the word which with power did over and over make this joyful sound within my soul thou art my love thou art my love and nothing shall separate thee from my love  and with that my heart was filled full of comfort and hope and now i could believe that my sins should be forgiven me yea i was now so taken with the love and mercy of god that i remember i could not tell how to contain till i got home  i thought i could have spoken of his love and have told of his mercy to me even to the very crows that sat upon the ploughed lands before me had they been capable to have understood me  wherefore i said in my soul with much gladness well i would i had a pen and ink here i would write this down before i go any farther for surely i will not forget this forty years hence  but alas within less than forty days i began to question all again which made me begin to question all still  93  yet still at times i was helped to believe that it was a true manifestation of grace unto my soul though i had lost much of the life and favour of it  now about a week or a fortnight after this i was much followed by this scripture simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you luke xxii 31 and sometimes it would sound so loud within me yea and as it was call so strongly after me that once above all the rest i turned my head over my shoulder thinking verily that some man had behind me called me being at a great distance methought he called so loud  it came as i have thought since to have stirred me up to prayer and to watchfulness  it came to acquaint me that a cloud and a storm was coming down upon me  but i understood it not  94  also as i remember that time that it called to me so loud was the last time that it sounded in mine ears but me thinks i hear still with what a loud voice these words simon simon sounded in mine ears  i thought verily as i have told you that somebody had called after me that was half a mile behind me  and although that was not my name yet it made me suddenly look behind me believing that he that called so loud meant me  95  but so foolish was i and ignorant that i knew not the reason of this sound which as i did both see and feel soon after was sent from heaven as an alarm to awaken me to provide for what was coming only i should muse and wonder in my mind to think what should be the reason of this scripture and that at this rate so often and so loud should still be sounding and rattling in mine ears  but as i said before i soon after perceived the end of god therein  96  for about the space of a month after a very great storm came down upon me which handled me twenty times worse than all i had met with before it came stealing upon me now by one piece then by another  first all my comfort was taken from me then darkness seized upon me after which whole floods of blasphemies both against god christ and the scriptures were poured upon my spirit to my great confusion and astonishment  these blasphemous thoughts were such as stirred up questions in me against the very being of god and of his only beloved son  as whether there were in truth a god or christ  and whether the holy scriptures were not rather a fable and cunning story than the holy and pure word of god  97  the tempter would also much assault me with this how can you tell but that the turks had as good scriptures to prove their mahomet the saviour as we have to prove our jesus is  and could i think that so many ten thousands in so many countries and kingdoms should be without the knowledge of the right way to heaven if there were indeed a heaven and that we only who live in a corner of the earth should alone be blessed therewith  every one doth think his own religion rightest both jews and moors and pagans and how if all our faith and christ and scriptures should be but a think so too  98  sometimes i have endeavoured to argue against these suggestions and to set some of the sentences of blessed paul against them but alas i quickly felt when i thus did such arguings as these would return again upon me though we made so great a matter of paul and of his words yet how could i tell but that in very deed he being a subtle and cunning man might give himself up to deceive with strong delusions  and also take the pains and travel to undo and destroy his fellows  99  these suggestions with many others which at this time i may not and dare not utter neither by word or pen did make such a seizure upon my spirit and did so overweigh my heart both with their number continuance and fiery force that i felt as if there were nothing else but these from morning to night within me and as though indeed there could be room for nothing else and also concluded that god had in very wrath to my soul given me up to them to be carried away with them as with a mighty whirlwind  100  only by the distaste that they gave unto my spirit i felt there was something in me that refused to embrace them  but this consideration i then only had when god gave me leave to swallow my spittle otherwise the noise and strength and force of these temptations would drown and overflow and as it were bury all such thoughts or the remembrance of any such thing  while i was in this temptation i often found my mind suddenly put upon it to curse and swear or to speak some grievous thing against god or christ his son and of the scriptures  101  now i thought surely i am possessed of the devil  at other times again i thought i should be bereft of my wits for instead of lauding and magnifying god the lord with others if i have but heard him spoken of presently some most horrible blasphemous thought or other would bolt out of my heart against him so that whether i did think that god was or again did think there was no such thing no love nor peace nor gracious disposition could i feel within me  102  these things did sink me into very deep despair for i concluded that such things could not possibly be found amongst them that loved god  i often when these temptations had been with force upon me did compare myself to the case of such a child whom some gipsy hath by force took up in her arms and is carrying from friend and country  kick sometimes i did and also shriek and cry but yet i was bound in the wings of the temptation and the wind would carry me away  i thought also of saul and of the evil spirit that did possess him  and did greatly fear that my condition was the same with that of his  1 sam x  103  in these days when i have heard others talk of what was the sin against the holy ghost then would the tempter so provoke me to desire to sin that against sin that i was as if i could not must not neither should be quiet until i had committed it now no sin would serve but that  if it were to be committed by speaking of such a word then i have been as if my mouth would have spoken that word whether i would or no and in so strong a measure was this temptation upon me that often i have been ready to clap my hand under my chin to hold my mouth from opening and to that end also i have had thoughts at other times to leap with my head downward into some muckhillhole or other to keep my mouth from speaking  104  now again i beheld the condition of the dog and toad and counted the estate of every thing that god had made far better than this dreadful state of mine and such as my companions were yea gladly would i have been in the condition of a dog or horse for i knew they had no souls to perish under the everlasting weight of hell or sin as mine was like to do  nay and though i saw this felt this and was broken to pieces with it yet that which added to my sorrow was i could not find that with all my soul i did desire deliverance  that scripture did also tear and rend my soul in the midst of these distractions the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt  there is no peace saith my god to the wicked  isa lvii 20 21  105  and now my heart was at times exceeding hard if i would have given a thousand pounds for a tear i could not shed one  no nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one  i was much dejected to think that this would be my lot  i saw some could mourn and lament their sin and others again could rejoice and bless god for christ and others again could quietly talk of and with gladness remember the word of god while i only was in the storm or tempest this much sunk me i thought my condition was alone i should therefore much bewail my hard hap but get out of or get rid of these things i could not  106  while this temptation lasted which was about a year i could attend upon none of the ordinances of god but with sore and great affliction  yea then i was most distressed with blasphemies  if i had been hearing the word then uncleanness blasphemies and despair would hold me a captive there  if i have been reading then sometimes i had sudden thoughts to question all i read sometimes again my mind would be so strangely snatched away and possessed with other things that i have neither known nor regarded nor remembered so much as the sentence that but now i have read  107  in prayer also i have been greatly troubled at this time sometimes i have thought i have felt him behind me pulling my clothes  he would be also continually at me in time of prayer to have done break off make haste you have prayed enough and stay no longer still drawing my mind away  sometimes also he would cast in such wicked thoughts as these that i must pray to him or for him  i have thought sometimes of that fall down or if thou wilt fall down and worship me  matt iii 9  108  also when because i have had wandering thoughts in the time of this duty i have laboured to compose my mind and fix it upon god then with great force hath the tempter laboured to distract me and confound me and to turn away my mind by presenting to my heart and fancy the form of a bush a bull a besom or the like as if i should pray to these  to these he would also at sometimes especially so hold my mind that i was as if i could think of nothing else or pray to nothing else but to these or such as they  109  yet at times i should have some strong and heartaffecting apprehensions of god and the reality of the truth of his gospel but oh how would my heart at such times put forth itself with unexpressible groanings  my whole soul was then in every word i should cry with pangs after god that he would be merciful unto me but then i should be daunted again with such conceits as these  i should think that god did mock at these my prayers saying and that in the audience of the holy angels this poor simple wretch doth hanker after me as if i had nothing to do with my mercy but to bestow it on such as he  alas poor soul how art thou deceived  it is not for such as thee to have favour with the highest  110  then hath the tempter come upon me also with such discouragements as these  you are very hot for mercy but i will cool you this frame shall not last always  many have been as hot as you for a spurt but i have quenched their zeal and with this such and such who were fallen off would be set before mine eyes then i should be afraid that i should do so too  but thought i i am glad this comes into my mind  well i will watch and take what care i can  though you do said satan i shall be too hard for you i will cool you insensibly by degrees by little and little what care i saith he though i be seven years in chilling your heart if i can do it at last  continual rocking will lull a crying child asleep  i will ply it close but i will have my end accomplished  though you be burning hot at present i can pull you from this fire i shall have you cold before it be long  111  these things brought me into great straits for as i at present could not find myself fit for present death so i thought to live long would make me yet more unfit for time would make me forget all and wear even the remembrance of the evil of sin the worth of heaven and the need i had of the blood of christ to wash me both out of mind and thought  but i thank christ jesus these things did not at present make me slack my crying but rather did put me more upon it like her who met with adulterer deut xxii 26 in which days that was a good word to me after i had suffered these things a while i am persuaded that neither death nor life etc shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  rom viii 38 39  and now i hoped long life would not destroy me nor make me miss of heaven  112  yet i had some supports in this temptation though they were then all questioned by me that in jer iii at the first was something to me and so was the consideration of verse 5 of that chapter that though we have spoken and done as evil things as we could yet we should cry unto god my father thou art the guide of my youth and shall return unto him  113  i had also once a sweet glance from that in 2 cor v 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him  i remember that one day as i was sitting in a neighbours house and there very sad at the consideration of my many blasphemies and as i was saying in my mind what ground have i to say that who have been so vile and abominable should ever inherit eternal life  that word came suddenly upon me what shall we say to these things  if god be for us who can be against us rom viii 31  that also was an help unto me because i live ye shall live also  john xiv 19  but these words were but hints touches and short visits though very sweet when present only they lasted not but like to peters sheet of a sudden were caught up from me to heaven again  acts x 16  114  but afterwards the lord did more fully and graciously discover himself unto me and indeed did quite not only deliver me from the guilt that by these things was laid upon my conscience but also from the very filth thereof for the temptation was removed and i was put into my right mind again as other christians were  115  i remember that one day as i was travelling into the country and musing on the wickedness and blasphemy of my heart and considering the enmity that was in me to god that scripture came into my mind having made peace through the blood of his cross  col i 20  by which i was made to see both again and again that god and my soul were friends by his blood yea i saw that the justice of god and my sinful soul could embrace and kiss each other through his blood  this was a good day to me i hope i shall never forget it  116  at another time as i sat by the fire in my house and was musing on my wretchedness the lord made that also a precious word unto me forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage  heb ii 14 15  i thought that the glory of these words was then so weighty on me that i was both once and twice ready to swoon as i sate yet not with grief and trouble but with solid joy and peace  117  at this time also i sate under of holy mr gifford whose doctrine by gods grace was much for my stability  this man made it much his business to deliver the people of god from all those false and unsound tests that by nature we are prone to  he would bid us take special heed that we took not up any truth upon trust as from this or that or any other man or men but to cry mightily to god that he would convince us of the reality thereof and set us down therein by his own spirit in the holy word for said he if you do otherwise when temptations come if strongly you not having received them with evidence from heaven will find you want that help and strength now to resist that once you thought you had  118  this was as seasonable to my soul as the former and latter rains in their season for i had found and that by sad experience the truth of these his words  for i had felt no man can say especially when tempted by the devil that jesus christ is lord but by the holy ghost  wherefore i found my soul through grace very apt to drink in this doctrine and to incline to pray to god that in nothing that pertained to gods glory and my own eternal happiness he would suffer me to be without the confirmation thereof from heaven for now i saw clearly there was an exceeding difference betwixt the notion of the flesh and blood and the revelations of god in heaven  also a great difference betwixt that faith that is feigned and according to mans wisdom and that which comes by a mans being born thereto of god  matt xvi 15 1 john v 1  119  but oh now how was my soul led from truth to truth by god even from the birth and cradle of the son of god to his accession and second coming from heaven to judge the world  120  truly i then found upon this account the great god was very good unto me for to my remembrance there was not any thing that i then cried unto god to make known and reveal unto me but he was pleased to do it for me i mean not one part of the gospel of the lord jesus but i was orderly led into it  methought i saw with great evidence from the relation of the four evangelists the wonderful work of god in giving jesus christ to save us from his conception and birth even to his second coming to judgment methought i was as if i had seen him born as if i had seen him grow up as if i had seen him walk through this world from the cradle to the cross to which also when he came i saw how gently he gave himself to be hanged and nailed on it for my sins and wicked doings  also as i was musing on this his progress that dropped on my spirit he was ordained for the slaughter  1 peter i 12 20  121  when i have considered also the truth of his resurrection and have remembered that word touch me not mary etc i have seen as if he had leaped out of the graves mouth for joy that he was risen again and had got the conquest over our dreadful foes john xx 17  i have also in the spirit seen him a man on the right hand of god the father for me and have seen the manner of his coming from heaven to judge the world with glory and have been confirmed in these things by these scriptures following acts i 9 10 and vii 56 and x 42 heb vii 24 and ix 28 rev i 18 1 thess iv 17 18  112  once i was troubled to know whether the lord jesus was man as well as god and god as well as man  and truly in those days let men say what they would unless i had it with evidence from heaven all was nothing to me i counted myself not set down in any truth of god  well i was much troubled about this point and could not tell how to be resolved at last that in rev v 6 came into my mind  and i beheld and to in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain  in the midst of the throne thought i there is the godhead in the midst of the elders there is his manhood but oh methought this did glister  it was a goodly touch and gave me sweet satisfaction  that other scripture also did help me much in this for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder  and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace etc  isa ix 6  123  also besides these teachings of god in his word the lord made use of two things to confirm me in this truth the one was the errors of the quakers and the other was the guilt of sin for as the quakers did oppose this truth so god did the more confirm me in it by leading me into the scripture that did wonderfully maintain it  124 the errors that this people then maintained were  1  that the holy scriptures were not the word of god  2  that every man in the world had the spirit of christ grace faith etc  3  that christ jesus as crucified and dying sixteen hundred years ago did not satisfy divine justice for the sins of the people  4  that christs flesh and blood were within the saints  5  that the bodies of the good and bad that are buried in the churchyard shall not arise again  6  that the resurrection is past with good men already  7  that that man jesus that was crucified between two thieves on mount calvary in the land of canaan by jerusalem was not ascended above the starry heavens  8  that he should not even the same jesus that died by the hands of the jews come again at the last day and as man judge all nations etc  125  many more vile and abominable things were in those days fomented by them by which i was driven to a more narrow search of the scriptures and was through their light and testimony not only enlightened but greatly confirmed and comforted in the truth and as i said the guilt of sin did help me much for still as that would come upon me the blood of christ did take it off again and again and again and that too sweetly according to the scripture  o friends cry to god to reveal jesus christ unto you there is none teacheth like him  126  it would be too long here to stay to tell you in particular how god did set me down in all the things of christ and how he did that he might so do lead me into his words yea and also how he did open them unto me and make them shine before me and cause them to dwell with me talk with me and comfort me over and over both of his own being and the being of his son and spirit and word and gospel  127  only this as i said before i will say unto you again that in general he was pleased to take this course with me first to suffer me to be afflicted with temptations concerning them and then reveal them unto me as sometimes i should lie under great guilt for sin even crushed to the ground therewith and then the lord would show me the death of christ yea so sprinkle my conscience with his blood that i should find and that before i was aware that in that conscience where but just now did reign and rage the law even there would rest and abide the peace and love of god through christ  128  now i had an evidence as i thought of my salvation from heaven with many golden seals thereon all hanging in my sight now could i remember this manifestation and the other discovery of grace with comfort and should often long and desire that the last day were come that i might be for ever inflamed with the sight and joy and communion of him whose head was crowned with thorns whose face was spit upon and body broken and soul made an offering for my sins  for whereas before i lay continually trembling at the mouth of hell now methought i was got so far therefrom that i could not when i looked back scarce discern it and oh thought i that i were fourscore years old now that i might die quickly that my soul might be gone to rest  129  but before i had got thus far out of these my temptations i did greatly long to see some ancient godly mans experience who had writ some hundreds of years before i was born for those who had writ in our days i thought but i desire them now to pardon me that they had writ only that which others felt or else had through the strength of their wits and parts studied to answer such objections as they perceived others were perplexed with without going down themselves into the deep  well after many such longings in my mind the god in whose hands are all our days and ways did cast into my hand one day a book of martin luthers it was his comment on the galatians it also was so old that it was ready to fall piece from piece if i did but turn it over  now i was pleased much that such an old book had fallen into my hand the which when i had but a little way perused i found my condition in his experience so largely and profoundly handled as if his book had been written out of my heart  this made me marvel  for thus thought i this man could not know any thing of the state of christians now but must needs write and speak the experience of former days  130  besides he doth most gravely also in that book debate of the rise of these temptations namely blasphemy desperation and the like showing that the law of moses as well as the devil death and hell hath a very great hand therein  the which at first was very strange to me but considering and watching i found it so indeed  but of particulars here i intend nothing only this methinks i must let fall before all meni do prefer this book of martin luther upon the galatians excepting the holy bible before all the books that ever i had seen as most fit for a wounded conscience  131  and now i found as i thought that i loved christ dearly oh methought my soul cleaved unto him my affections cleaved unto him i felt love to him as hot as fire and now as job said i thought i should die in my nest but i did quickly find that my great love was but little and that i who had as i thought such burning love to jesus christ could let him go again for a very triflegod can tell how to abase us and can hide pride from man quickly after this my love was tried to purpose  132  for after the lord had in this manner thus graciously delivered me from this great and sore temptation and had set me down so sweetly in the faith of his holy gospel and had given me such strong consolation and blessed evidence from heaven touching my interest in his love through christ the tempter came upon me again and that with a more grievous and dreadful temptation than before  133 and that was to sell and part with this most blessed christ to exchange him for the things of this life for any thing  the temptation lay upon me for the space of a year and did follow me so continually that i was not rid of it one day in a month  no not sometimes one hour in many days together unless when i was asleep  134  and though in my judgment i was persuaded that those who were once effectually in christ as i hoped through his grace i had seen myself could never lose him for ever the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine saith god  lev xxv 23 yet it was a continual vexation to me to think that i should have so much as one such thought within me against a christ a jesus that had done for me as he had done and yet then i had almost none others but such blasphemous ones  135  but it was neither my dislike of the thought nor yet any desire and endeavour to resist that in the least did shake or abate the continuation or force and strength thereof for it did always in almost whatever i thought intermix itself therewith in such sort that i could neither eat my food stoop for a pin chop a stick or cast mine eye to look on this or that but still the temptation would come sell christ for this or sell christ for that sell him sell him  136  sometimes it would run in my thoughts not so little as a hundred times together sell him sell him sell him  against which i may say for whole hours together i have been forced to stand as continually leaning and forcing my spirit against it lest haply before i were aware some wicked thought might arise in my heart that might consent thereto and sometimes the tempter would make me believe i had consented to it but then i should be as tortured upon a rack for whole days together  137  this temptation did put me to such scares lest i should at some times i say consent thereto and be overcome therewith that by the very force of my mind in labouring to gainsay and resist this wickedness my very body would be put into action or motion by way of pushing or thrusting with my hands or elbows still answering as fast as the destroyer said sell him i will not i will not i will not i will not no not for thousands thousands thousands of worlds  thus reckoning lest i should in the midst of these assaults set too low a value on him even until i scarce well knew where i was or how to be composed again  138  at these seasons he would not let me eat my food at quiet but forsooth when i was set at the table at my meat i must go hence to pray i must leave my food now just now so counterfeit holy also would this devil be  when i was thus tempted i would say in myself now i am at meat let me make an end  no said he you must do it now or you will displease god and despise christ wherefore i was much afflicted with these things and because of the sinfulness of my nature imagining that these were impulses from god i should deny to do it as if i denied god and then should i be as guilty because i did not obey a temptation of the devil as if i had broken the law of god indeed  139  but to be brief  one morning as i did lie in my bed i was as at other times most fiercely assaulted with this temptation to sell and part with christ the wicked suggestion still running in my mind sell him sell him sell him sell him sell him as fast as a man could speak  against which also in my mind as at other times i answered no no not for thousands thousands thousands at least twenty times together  but at last after much striving even until i was almost out of breath i felt this thought pass through my heart let him go if he will and i thought also that i felt my heart freely consent thereto  oh the diligence of satan  oh the desperateness of mans heart  140  now was the battle won and down fell i as a bird that is shot from the top of a tree into great guilt and fearful despair thus getting out of my bed i went moping into the field but god knows with as heavy a heart as mortal man i think could bear where for the space of two hours i was like a man bereft of life and as now past all recovery and bound over to eternal punishment  141  and withal that scripture did seize upon my soul  or profane persons as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright  for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  heb xii 16 17  142  now was i as one bound i felt myself shut up unto the judgment to come nothing now for two years together would abide with me but damnation and an expectation of damnation  i say nothing now would abide with me but this save some few moments for relief as in the sequel you will see  143  these words were to my soul like fetters of brass to my legs in the continual sound of which i went for several months together  but about ten or eleven oclock on that day as i was walking under an hedge full of sorrow and guilt god knows and bemoaning myself for this hard hap that such a thought should arise within me suddenly this sentence rushed in upon me the blood of christ remits all guilt  at this i made a stand in my spirit  with that this word took hold upon me the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin  1 john i 7  144  now i began to conceive peace in my soul and methought i saw as if the tempter did leer and steal away from me as being ashamed of what he had done  at the same time also i had my sin and the blood of christ thus represented to me that my sin when compared to the blood of christ was no more to it than this little clod or stone before me is to this vast and wide field that here i see  this gave me good encouragement for the space of two or three hours in which time also methought i saw by faith the son of god as suffering for my sins  but because it tarried not i therefore sunk in my spirit under exceeding guilt again  145  but chiefly by the aforementioned scripture concerning esaus selling of his birthright for that scripture would lie all day long all the week long yea all the year long in my mind and hold me down so that i could by no means lift up myself for when i would strive to turn to this scripture or that for relief still that sentence would be sounding in me for ye know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  146  sometimes indeed i should have a touch from that in luke xxii 31 i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not but it would not abide upon me neither could i indeed when i considered my state find ground to conceive in the least that there should be the root of that grace in me having sinned as i had done  now was i tore and rent in an heavy case for many days together  147  then began i with sad and careful heart to consider of the nature and largeness of my sin and to search into the word of god if i could in any place espy a word of promise or any encouraging sentence by which i might take relief  wherefore i began to consider that of mark iii 28  all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme which place methought at a blush did contain a large and glorious promise for the pardon of high offences but considering the place more fully i thought it was rather to be understood as relating more chiefly to those who had while in a natural estate committed such things as there are mentioned but not to me who had not only received light and mercy but that had both after and also contrary to that so slighted christ as i had done  148  i feared therefore that this wicked sin of mine might be that sin unpardonable of which he there thus speaketh  but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation  mark iii 29 and i did the rather give credit to this because of that sentence in the hebrews  for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  and this stuck always with me  149  and now was i both a burthen and a terror to myself nor did i ever so know as now what it was to be weary of my life and yet afraid to die  oh how gladly now would i have been anybody but myself anything but a man and in any condition but my own  for there was nothing did pass more frequently over my mind than that it was impossible for me to be forgiven my transgression and to be saved from the wrath to come  150  and now i began to call again time that was spent wishing a thousand times twice told that the day was yet to come when i should be tempted to such a sin concluding with great indignation both against my heart and all assaults how i would rather have been torn in pieces than be found a consenter thereto  but alas these thoughts and wishings and resolvings were now too late to help me this thought had passed my heart god hath let me go and i am fallen  oh thought i that it were with me as in months past as in the days when god preserved me  job xxix 2  151  then again being loth and unwilling to perish i began to compare my sin with others to see if i could find that any of those that were saved had done as i had done  so i considered davids adultery and murder and found them most heinous crimes and those too committed after light and grace received  but yet by considering that his transgressions were only such as were against the law of moses from which the lord christ could with the consent of his word deliver him  but mine was against the gospel yea against the mediator thereof i had sold my saviour  152  now again should i be as if racked upon the wheel when i considered that besides the guilt that possessed me i should be so void of grace so bewitched  what thought i must it be no sin but this  must it needs be the great transgression  ps xix 13 must that wicked one touch my soul  1 john v 18  oh what sting did i find in all these sentences  153  what thought i is there but one sin that is unpardonable but one sin that layeth the soul without the reach of gods mercy and must i be guilty of that must it needs be that  is there but one sin among so many millions of sins for which there is no forgiveness and must i commit this  oh unhappy sin  oh unhappy man  these things would so break and confound my spirit that i could not tell what to do i thought at times they would have broke my wits and still to aggravate my misery that would run in my mind you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected  oh no one knows the terrors of those days but myself  154  after this i began to consider of peters sin which he committed in denying his master  and indeed this came nighest to mine of any that i could find for he had denied his saviour as i after light and mercy received yea and that too after warning given him  i also considered that he did it both once and twice and that after time to consider betwixt  but though i put all these circumstances together that if possible i might find help yet i considered again that his was but a denial of his master but mine was a selling of my saviour  wherefore i thought with myself that i came nearer to judas than either to david or peter  155  here again my torment would flame out and afflict me yea it would grind me as it were to powder to consider the preservation of god towards others while i fell into the snare for in my thus considering of other mens sins and comparing them with mine own i could evidently see god preserved them notwithstanding their wickedness and would not let them as he had let me become a son of perdition  156  but oh how did my soul at this time prize the preservation that god did set about his people  ah how safely did i see them walk whom god had hedged in  they were within his care protection and special providence  though they were full as bad as i by nature yet because he loved them he would not suffer them to fall without the range of mercy  but as for me i was gone i had done it  he would not preserve me nor keep me but suffered me because i was a reprobate to fall as i had done  now did those blessed places that speak of gods keeping his people shine like the sun before me though not to comfort me yet to show me the blessed state and heritage of those whom the lord had blessed  157  now i saw that as god had his hand in all the providences and dispensations that overtook his elect so he had his hand in all the temptations that they had to sin against him not to animate them to wickedness but to choose their temptations and troubles for them and also to leave them for a time to such sins only that might not destroy but humble them as might not put them beyond but lay them in the way of the renewing his mercy  but oh what love what care what kindness and mercy did i now see mixing itself with the most severe and dreadful of all gods ways to his people  he would let david hezekiah solomon peter and others fall but he would not let them fall into sin unpardonable nor into hell for sin  oh thought i these be the men that god hath loved these be the men that god though he chastiseth them keeps them in safety by him and them whom he makes to abide under the shadow of the almighty  but all these thoughts added sorrow grief and horror to me as whatever i now thought on it was killing to me  if i thought how god kept his own that was killing to me if i thought of how i was fallen myself that was killing to me  as all things wrought together for the best and to do good to them that were the called according to his purpose so i thought that all things wrought for my damage and for my eternal overthrow  158  then again i began to compare my sin with the sin of judas that if possible i might find if mine differed from that which in truth is unpardonable  and oh thought i if it should differ from it though but the breadth of an hair what a happy condition is my soul in  and by considering i found that judas did this intentionally but mine was against my prayer and strivings besides his was committed with much deliberation but mine in a fearful hurry on a sudden  all this while i was tossed to and fro like the locusts and driven from trouble to sorrow hearing always the sound of esaus fall in mine ears and the dreadful consequences thereof  159  yet this consideration about judass sin was for awhile some little relief to me for i saw i had not as to the circumstances transgressed so fully as he  but this was quickly gone again for i thought with myself there might be more ways than one to commit this unpardonable sin also i thought there might be degrees of that as well as of other transgressions wherefore for aught i yet could perceive this iniquity of mine might be such as might never be passed by  160  i was often now ashamed that i should be like such an ugly man as judas  i thought also how loathsome i should be unto all the saints at the day of judgment  insomuch that now i could scarce see a good man that i believed had a good conscience but i should feel my heart tremble at him while i was in his presence oh now i saw a glory in walking with god and what a mercy it was to have a good conscience before him  161  i was much about that time tempted to content myself by receiving some false opinion as that there should be no such thing as a day of judgment that we should not rise again and that sin was no such grievous thing  the tempter suggesting thus  for if these things should indeed be true yet to believe otherwise would yield you ease for the present  if you must perish never torment yourself so much beforehand  drive the thoughts of damning out of your mind by possessing your mind with some such conclusions that atheists and ranters use to help themselves withal  162  but oh when such thoughts have led through my heart how as it were within a step hath death and judgment been in my view methought the judge stood at the door i was as if it was come already so that such things could have no entertainment  but methinks i see by this that satan will use any means to keep the soul from christ he loveth not an awakened frame of spirit security blindness darkness and error is the very kingdom and habitation of the wicked one  163  i found it a hard work now to pray to god because despair was swallowing me up i thought i was as with a tempest driven away from god for always when i cried to god for mercy this would come in tis too late i am lost god hath let me fall not to my correction but condemnation  my sin is unpardonable and i know concerning esau how that after he had sold his birthright be would have received the blessing but was rejected  about this time i did light on that dreadful story of that miserable mortal francis spira a book that was to my troubled spirit as salt when rubbed into a fresh wound  every sentence in that book every groan of that man with all the rest of his actions in his dolours as his tears his prayers his gnashing of teeth his wringing of hands his twining and twisting and languishing and pining away under that mighty hand of god that was upon him were as knives and daggers in my soul especially that sentence of his was frightful to me man knows the beginning of sin but who bounds the issues thereof  then would the former sentence as the conclusion of all fall like an hot thunderbolt again upon my conscience for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  164  then should i be struck into a very great trembling insomuch that at sometimes i could for whole days together feel my very body as well as my mind to shake and totter under the sense of this dreadful judgment of god that should fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and unpardonable sin  i felt also such a clogging and heat at my stomach by reason of this my terror that i was especially at some times as if my breastbone would split asunder then i thought of that concerning judas who by falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out  acts i 18  165  i feared also that this was the mark that the lord did set on cain even continual fear and trembling under the heavy load of guilt that he had charged on him for the blood of his brother abel thus did i wind and twine and shrink under the burthen that was upon me which burthen also did so oppress me that i could neither stand nor go nor lie either at rest or quiet  166  yet that saying would sometimes come into my mind he hath received gifts for the rebellious  psalm lxviii 18  the rebellious thought i why surely they are such as once were under subjection to their prince even those who after they have sworn subjection to his government have taken up arms against him and this thought i is my very condition  i once loved him feared him served him but now i am a rebel i have sold him i have said let him go if he will but yet he has gifts for rebels and then why not for me  167  this sometimes i thought on and should labour to take hold thereof that some though small refreshment might have been conceived by me but in this also i missed of my desire i was driven with force beyond it i was like a man going to execution even by that place where he would fain creep in and hide himself but may not  168  again after i had thus considered the sins of the saints in particular and found mine went beyond them then i began to think with myself set the case i should put all theirs together and mine alone against them might i not then find some encouragement for if mine though bigger than any one yet should be but equal to all then there is hopes for that blood that hath virtue enough in it to wash away all theirs had virtue enough in it to do away mine though this one be full as big if not bigger than all theirs  here again i should consider the sin of david of solomon of manasseh of peter and the rest of the great offenders and should also labour what i might with fairness to aggravate and heighten their sins by several circumstances  169  i should think with myself that david shed blood to cover his adultery and that by the sword of the children of ammon a work that could not be done but by continuance deliberate contrivance which was a great aggravation to his sin  but then this would turn upon me  ah but these were but sins against the law from which there was a jesus sent to save them but yours is a sin against the saviour and who shall save you from that  170  then i thought on solomon and how he sinned in loving strange women falling away to their idols in building them temples in doing this after light in his old age after great mercy received  but the same conclusion that cut me off in the former consideration cut me off as to this namely that all those were but sins against the law for which god had provided a remedy but i had sold my saviour and there remained no more sacrifice for sin  171  i would then add to these mens sins the sins of manasseh how that he built altars for idols in the house of the lord he also observed times used enchantments had to do with wizards was a wizard had his familiar spirits burned his children in the fire in sacrifice to devils and made the streets of jerusalem run down with the blood of innocents  these thought i are great sins sins of a bloody colour but yet it would turn again upon me they are none of them of the nature of yours you have parted with jesus you have sold your saviour  172  this one consideration would always kill my heart my sin was point blank against my saviour and that too at that height that i had in my heart said of him let him go if he will  oh methought this sin was bigger than the sins of a country of a kingdom or of the whole world no one pardonable nor all of them together was able to equal mine mine outwent them every one  173  now i should find my mind to flee from god as from the face of a dreadful judge yet this was my torment i could not escape his hand  it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  hebrew x  but blessed be his grace that scripture in these flying fits would call as running after me i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins  return unto me for i have redeemed thee  isaiah xliv 22  this i say would come in upon my mind when i was fleeing from the face of god for i did flee from his face that is my mind and spirit fled before him by reason of his highness i could not endure  then would the text cry return unto me it would cry aloud with a very great voice return unto me for i have redeemed thee  indeed this would make me make a little stop and as it were look over my shoulder behind me to see if i could discern that the god of grace did follow me with a pardon in his hand but i could no sooner do that but all would be clouded and darkened again by that sentence for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  wherefore i could not refrain but fled though at some times it cried return return as if it did hollow after me  but i feared to close in therewith lest it should not come from god for that other as i said was still sounding in my conscience for you know that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected etc  174  once as i was walking to and fro in a good mans shop bemoaning of myself in my sad and doleful state afflicting myself with selfabhorrence for this wicked and ungodly thought lamenting also this hard hap of mine for that i should commit so great a sin greatly fearing that i should not be pardoned praying also in my heart that if this sin of mine did differ from that against the holy ghost the lord would show it me  and being now ready to sink with fear suddenly there was as if there had rushed in at the window the noise of wind upon me but very pleasant and as if i heard a voice speaking didst thou ever refuse to be justified by the blood of christ and withal my whole life of profession past was in a moment opened to me wherein i was made to see that designedly i had not  so my heart answered groaningly no  then fell with power that word of god upon me see that ye refuse not him that speaketh  hebrew xii 25  this made a strange seizure upon my spirit it brought light with it and commanded a silence in my heart of all those tumultuous thoughts that did before use like masterless hellhounds to roar and bellow and make an hideous noise within me  it showed me also that jesus christ had yet a word of grace and mercy for me that he had not as i had feared quite forsaken and cast off my soul yea this was a kind of chide for my proneness to desperation a kind of threatening of me if i did not notwithstanding my sins and the heinousness of them venture my salvation upon the son of god  but as to my determining about this strange dispensation what it was i know not or from whence it came i know not i have not yet in twenty years time been able to make a judgment of it i thought then what here i should be loth to speak  but verily that sudden rushing wind was as if an angel had come upon me but both it and the salutation i will leave until the day of judgment  only this i say it commanded a great calm in my soul it persuaded me there might be hope  it showed me as i thought what the sin unpardonable was and that my soul had yet the blessed privilege to flee to jesus christ for mercy  but i say concerning this dispensation i know not yet what to say unto it which was also in truth the cause that at first i did not speak of it in the book i do now also leave it to be thought on by men of sound judgment  i lay not the stress of my salvation thereupon but upon the lord jesus in the promise yet seeing i am here unfolding of my secret things i thought it might not be altogether inexpedient to let this also show itself though i cannot now relate the matter as there i did experience it  this lasted in the savour of it for about three or four days and then i began to mistrust and to despair again  175  wherefore still my life hung in doubt before me not knowing which way i should tip only this i found my soul desire even to cast itself at the foot of grace by prayer and supplication  but oh twas hard for me now to have the face to pray to this christ for mercy against whom i had thus most vilely sinned  twas hard work i say to offer to look him in the face against whom i had so vilely sinned and indeed i have found it as difficult to come to god by prayer after backsliding from him as to do any other thing  oh the shame that did now attend me especially when i thought i am now agoing to pray to him for mercy that i had so lightly esteemed but a while before  i was ashamed yea even confounded because this villany had been committed by me  but i saw that there was but one way with me i must go to him and humble myself unto him and beg that he of his wonderful mercy would show pity to me and have mercy upon my wretched sinful soul  176  which when the tempter perceived he strongly suggested to me that i ought not to pray to god for prayer was not for any in my case neither could it do me good because i had rejected the mediator by whom all prayers came with acceptance to god the father and without whom no prayer could come into his presence wherefore now to pray is but to add sin to sin yea now to pray seeing god has cast you off is the next way to anger and offend him more than you ever did before  177  for god saith he hath been weary of you for these several years already because you are none of his your bawlings in his ears hath been no pleasant voice to him and therefore he let you sin this sin that you might be quite cut off and will you pray still  this the devil urged and set forth that in numbers when moses said to the children of israel that because they would not go up to possess the land when god would have them therefore for ever after he did bar them out from thence though they prayed they might with tears  numbers xiv 36 37 etc  178  as it is said in another place exodus xxi 14 the man that sins presumptuously shall be taken from gods altar that he may die even as joab was by king solomon when he thought to find shelter there  1 kings ii 27 28 etc  these places did pinch me very sore yet my case being desperate i thought with myself i can but die and if it must be so it shall once be said that such an one died at the foot of christ in prayer  this i did but with great difficulty god doth know and that because together with this still that saying about esau would be set at my heart even like a flaming sword to keep the way of the tree of life lest i should take thereof and live  oh who knows how hard a thing i found it to come to god in prayer  179  i did also desire the prayers of the people of god for me but i feared that god would give them no heart to do it yea i trembled in my soul to think that some or other of them would shortly tell me that god hath said those words to them that he once did say to the prophet concerning the children of israel pray not for this people for i have rejected them  jeremiah xi 14 so pray not for him for i have rejected him yea i thought that he had whispered this to some of them already only they durst not tell me so neither durst i ask them of it for fear if it should be so it would make me quite beside myself  man knows the beginning of sin said spira but who bounds the issues thereof  180  about this time i took an opportunity to break my mind to an ancient christian and told him all my case  i told him also that i was afraid that i had sinned the sin against the holy ghost and he told me he thought so too  here therefore i had but cold comfort but talking a little more with him i found him though a good man a stranger to much combat with the devil  wherefore i went to god again as well as i could for mercy still  181  now also did the tempter begin to mock me in my misery saying that seeing i had thus parted with the lord jesus and provoked him to displeasure who would have stood between my soul and the flame of devouring fire there was now but one way and that was to pray that god the father would be a mediator betwixt his son and me that we might be reconciled again and that i might have that blessed benefit in him that his blessed saints enjoyed  182  then did that scripture seize upon my soul he is of one mind and who can turn him  oh i saw it was as easy to persuade him to make a new world a new covenant or a new bible besides that we have already as to pray for such a thing  this was to persuade him that what he had done already was mere folly and persuade him to alter yea to disannul the whole way of salvation and then would that saying rend my soul asunder neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved  acts iv 12  183  now the most free and full and gracious words of the gospel were the greatest torment to me yea nothing so afflicted me as the thoughts of jesus christ the remembrance of a saviour because i had cast him off brought forth the villany of my sin and my loss by it to mind nothing did twinge my conscience like this every time that i thought of the lord jesus of his grace love goodness kindness gentleness meekness death blood promises and blessed exhortations comforts and consolations it went to my soul like a sword for still unto these my considerations of the lord jesus these thoughts would make place for themselves in my heart  aye this is the jesus the loving saviour the son of god whom you have parted with whom you have slighted despised and abused  this is the only saviour the only redeemer the only one that could so love sinners as to wash them from their sins in his own most precious blood but you have no part nor lot in this jesus  you have put him from you you have said in your heart let him go if he will  now therefore you are severed from him you have severed yourself from him  behold then his goodness but yourself to be no partaker of it  oh thought i what have i lost what have i parted with  what has disinherited my poor soul  oh tis sad to be destroyed by the grace and mercy of god to have the lamb the saviour turn lion and destroyer  rev vi  i also trembled as i have said at the sight of the saints of god especially at those that greatly loved him and that made it their business to walk continually with him in this world for they did both in their words their carriages and all their expressions of tenderness and fear to sin against their precious saviour condemn lay guilt upon and also add continual affliction and shame upon my soul  the dread of them was upon me and i trembled at gods samuels  1 sam xvi 4  184  now also the tempter began afresh to mock my soul another way saying that christ indeed did pity my case and was sorry for my loss but forasmuch as i had sinned and transgressed as i had done he could by no means help me nor save me from what i feared for my sin was not of the nature of theirs for whom he bled and died neither was it counted with those that were laid to his charge when he hanged on a tree  therefore unless he should come down from heaven and die anew for this sin though indeed he did greatly pity me yet i could have no benefit of him  these things may seem ridiculous to others even as ridiculous as they were in themselves but to me they were most tormenting cogitations  every one of them augmented my misery that jesus christ should have so much love as to pity me when yet he could not help me nor did i think that the reason why he could not help me was because his merits were weak or his grace and salvation spent on others already but because his faithfulness to his threatening would not let him extend his mercy to me  besides i thought as i have already hinted that my sin was not within the bounds of that pardon that was wrapped up in a promise and if not then i knew assuredly that it was more easy for heaven and earth to pass away than for me to have eternal life  so that the ground of all these fears of mine did arise from a steadfast belief i had of the stability of the holy word of god and also from my being misinformed of the nature of my sin  185  but oh how this would add to my affliction to conceit that i should be guilty of such a sin for which he did not die  these thoughts would so confound me and imprison me and tie me up from faith that i knew not what to do  but oh thought i that he would come down again  oh that the work of mans redemption was yet to be done by christ how would i pray him and entreat him to count and reckon this sin among the rest for which he died  but this scripture would strike me down as dead christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him rom vi 9  186  thus by the strange and unusual assaults of the tempter my soul was like a broken vessel driven as with the winds and tossed sometimes headlong into despair sometimes upon the covenant of works and sometimes to wish that the new covenant and the conditions thereof might so far forth as i thought myself concerned be turned another way and changed but in all these i was as those that jostle against the rocks more broken scattered and rent  oh the unthoughtof imaginations frights fears and terrors that are affected by a thorough application of guilt yielding to desperation  this is the man that hath his dwelling among the tombs with the dead that is always crying out and cutting himself with stones  mark v 1 2 3  but i say all in vain desperation will not comfort him the old covenant will not save him  nay heaven and earth shall pass away before one jot or tittle of the word and law of grace will fail or be removed  this i saw this i felt and under this i groaned yet this advantage i got thereby namely a farther confirmation of the certainty of the way of salvation and that the scriptures were the word of god oh i cannot now express what then i saw and felt of the steadiness of jesus christ the rock of mans salvation  what was done could not be undone added to nor altered  i saw indeed that sin might drive the soul beyond christ even the sin which is unpardonable but woe to him that was so driven for the word would shut him out  187  thus i was always sinking whatever i did think or do  so one day i walked to a neighbouring town and sate down upon a settle in the street and fell into a very deep pause about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to and after long musing i lifted up i sat my head but methought i saw as if the sun that shineth in the heavens did grudge to give light and as if the very stones in the street and tiles upon the houses did bend themselves against me  methought that they all combined together to banish me out of the world  i was abhorred of them and unfit to dwell among them or be partaker of their benefits because i had sinned against the saviour  o how happy now was every creature over i was  for they stood fast and kept their station but i was gone and lost  188  then breaking out in the bitterness of my soul i said to myself with a grievous sigh how can god comfort such a wretch  i had no sooner said it but this returned upon me as an echo doth answer a voice  this sin is not unto death  at which i was as if i had been raised out of the grave and cried out again lord how couldst thou find out such a word as this  for i was filled with admiration at the fitness and at the unexpectedness of the sentence the fitness of the word the rightness of the timing of it the power and sweetness and light and glory that came with it also were marvellous to me to find  i was now for the time out of doubt as to that about which i was so much in doubt before my fears before were that my sin was not pardonable and so that i had no right to pray to repent etc or that if i did it would be of no advantage or profit to me  but now thought i if this sin is not unto death then it is pardonable therefore from this i have encouragement to come to god by christ for mercy to consider the promise of forgiveness as that which stands with open arms to receive me as well as others  this therefore was a great easement to my mind to wit that my sin was pardonable that it was not the sin unto death 1 john v 16 17  none but those that know what my trouble by their own experience was can tell what relief came to my soul by this consideration  it was a release to me from my former bonds and a shelter from the former storm  i seemed now to stand upon the same ground with other sinners and to have as good right to the word and prayer as any of they  189  now i say i was in hopes that my sin was not unpardonable but that there might be hopes for me to obtain forgiveness  but oh how satan did now lay about him for to bring me down again but he could by no means do it neither this day nor the most part of the next for this good sentence stood like a millpost at my back  yet towards the evening of the next day i felt this word begin to leave me and to withdraw its supportation from me and so i returned to my old fears again but with a great deal of grudging and peevishness for i feared the sorrow of despair nor could my faith now long retain this word  190  but the next day at evening being under many fears i went to seek the lord and as i prayed i cried and my soul cried to him in these words with strong cries  o lord i beseech thee show me that thou hast loved me with everlasting love  jer xxxi 3  i had no sooner said it but with sweetness this returned upon me as an echo or sounding again i have loved thee with an everlasting love  now i went to bed in quiet also when i awakened the next morning it was fresh upon my soul and i believed it  191  but yet the tempter left me not for it could not be so little as an hundred times that he that day did labour to then break my peace  oh the combats and conflicts that i did then meet with as i strove to hold by this word that of esau would fly in my face like lightning  i should be sometimes up and down twenty times in an hour yet god did bear me up and keep my heart upon this word from which i had also for several days together very much sweetness and comfortable hopes of pardon  for thus it was made out unto me i loved thee whilst thou wast committing this sin i loved thee before i love thee still and i will love thee for ever  192  yet i saw my sin most barbarous and a filthy crime and could not but conclude and that with great shame and astonishment that i had horribly abused the holy son of god  wherefore i felt my soul greatly to love and pity him and my bowels to yearn towards him for i saw he was still my friend and did reward me good for evil yea the love and affection that then did burn within to my lord and saviour jesus christ did work at this time such a strong and hot desire of revengement upon myself for the abuse i had done unto him that to speak as i then thought had i had a thousand gallons of blood within my veins i could freely then have spilt it all at the command and feet of this my lord and saviour  193  and as i was thus in musing and in my studies considering how to love the lord and to express my love to him that saying came in upon me if thou lord shouldst mark iniquities o lord who should stand  but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared  psalm cxxx 3 4  these were good words to me especially the latter part thereof to wit that there is forgiveness with the lord that he might be feared that is as then i understood it that he might be loved and had in reverence for it was thus made out to me that the great god did set so high an esteem upon the love of his poor creatures that rather than he would go without their love he would pardon their transgressions  194  and now was that word fulfilled on me and i was also refreshed by it that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord god  ezek xvi 63  thus was my soul at this time and as i then did think for ever set at liberty from being afflicted with my former guilt and amazement  195  but before many weeks were gone i began to despond again fearing lest notwithstanding all that i had enjoyed that i might be deceived and destroyed at the last for this consideration came strong into my mind that whatever comfort and peace i thought i might have from the word of the promise of life yet unless there could be found in my refreshment a concurrence and agreement in the scriptures let me think what i will thereof and hold it never so fast i should find no such thing at the end and the scripture cannot be broken  john x 35  196  now began my heart again to ache and fear i might meet with a disappointment at last  wherefore i began with all seriousness to examine my former comfort and to consider whether one that had sinned as i had done might with confidence trust upon the faithfulness of god laid down in those words by which i had been comforted and on which i had leaned myself  but now were brought those sayings to my mind  for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance  heb vi 46  for if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries  heb x 26 27  as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright  for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears  heb xii 16 17  197  now was the word of the gospel forced from my soul so that no promise or encouragement was to be found in the bible for me and now would that saying work upon my spirit to afflict me rejoice not o israel for joy as other people  hos ix 1  for i saw indeed there was cause of rejoicing for those that held to jesus but for me i had cut myself off by my transgressions and left myself neither foothold or handhold among all the stays and props in the precious word of life  198  and truly i did now feel myself to sink into a gulph as an house whose foundation is destroyed i did liken myself in this condition unto the case of some child that was fallen into a mill pit who though it could make some shift to scramble and sprawl in the water yet because it could find neither hold for hand nor foot therefore at last it must die in that condition  so soon as this fresh assault had fastened on my soul that scripture came into my heart this for many days  dan x 14  and indeed i found it was so for i could not be delivered nor brought to peace again until well nigh two years and a half were completely finished  wherefore these words though in themselves they tended to discouragement yet to me who feared this condition would be eternal they were at some times as an help and refreshment to me  199  for thought i many days are not for ever many days will have an end therefore seeing i was to be afflicted not a few but many days yet i was glad it was but for many days  thus i say i would recall myself sometimes and give myself an help for as soon as ever the words came into my mind at first i knew my trouble would be long yet this would be but sometimes for i could not always think on this nor ever be helped by it though i did  200  now while the scriptures lay before me and laid sin anew at my door that saying in luke xviii 1 with others did encourage me to prayer  then the tempter laid again at me very sore suggesting that neither the mercy of god nor yet the blood of christ did at all concern me nor could they help me for my sin therefore it was but in vain to pray  yet thought i i will pray but said the tempter your sin is unpardonable  well said i i will pray  tis to no boot said he  yet said i i will pray  so i went to prayer to god and while i was at prayer i uttered words to this effect  lord satan tells me that neither thy mercy nor christs blood is sufficient to save my soul  lord shall i honour thee most by believing thou wilt and canst or him by believing thou neither wilt not nor canst  lord i would fain honour thee by believing thou wilt and canst  201  and as i was thus before the lord that scripture fastened on my heart o man great is thy faith matt xv 28 even as if one had clapped me on the back as i was on my knees before god  yet i was not able to believe this that this was a prayer of faith till almost six months after for i could not think that i had faith or that there should be a word for me to act faith on therefore i should still be as sticking in the jaws of desperation and went mourning up and down in a sad condition  202  there was nothing now that i longed for more than to be put out of doubt as to this thing in question and as i was vehemently desiring to know if there was indeed hope for me these words came rolling into my mind will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no more  is his mercy clean gone for ever  doth his promise fail for evermore  hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies  ps lxxvii 79  and all the while they run in my mind methought i had still this as the answer tis a question whether he hath or no  it may be he hath not  yea the interrogatory seemed to me to carry in it a sure affirmation that indeed he had not nor would so cast off but would be favourable  that his promise doth not fail and that he had not forgotten to be gracious nor would in anger shut up tender mercy  something also there was upon my heart at the same time which i cannot now call to mind which with this text did sweeten my heart and make me conclude that his mercy might not be quite gone nor clean gone for ever  203  at another time i remembered i was again much under this question whether the blood of christ was sufficient to save my soul in which doubt i continued from morning till about seven or eight at night  and at last when i was as it were quite worn out with fear lest it should not lay hold on me these words did sound suddenly within my heart  he is able  but methought this word able was spoke loud unto me it showed a great word it seemed to be writ in great letters and gave such a jostle to my fear and doubt i mean for the time it tarried with me which was about a day as i never had from that all my life either before or after  heb vii 25  204  but one morning as i was again at prayer and trembling under the fear of this that no word of god could help me that piece of a sentence darted in upon me my grace is sufficient  at this methought i felt some stay as if there might be hopes  but oh how good a thing it is for god to send his word for about a fortnight before i was looking on this very place and then i thought it could not come near my soul with comfort therefore i threw down my book in a pet  then i thought it was not large enough for me no not large enough but now it was as if it had arms of grace so wide that it could not only enclose me but many more such as i besides  205  by these words i was sustained yet not without exceeding conflicts for the space of seven or eight weeks for my peace would be in it and out sometimes twenty times a day comfort now and trouble presently peace now and before i could go a furlong as full of fear and guilt as ever heart could hold  and this was not only now and then but my whole seven weeks experience  for this about the sufficiency of grace and that of esaus parting with his birthright would be like a pair of scales within my mind sometimes one end would be uppermost and sometimes again the other according to which would be my peace or trouble  206  therefore i did still pray to god that he would come in with this scripture more fully on my heart to wit that he would help me to apply the whole sentence for as yet i could not  that he gave that i gathered but farther i could not go for as yet it only helped me to hope there might be mercy for me my grace is sufficient  and though it came no farther it answered my former question to wit that there was hope yet because for thee was left out i was not contented but prayed to god for that also wherefore one day when i was in a meeting of gods people full of sadness and terror for my fears again were strong upon me and as i was now thinking my soul was never the better but my case most sad and fearful these words did with great power suddenly break in upon me my grace is sufficient for thee my grace is sufficient for thee my grace is sufficient for thee three times together  and oh methought that every word was a mighty word unto me as my and grace and sufficient and for thee they were then and sometimes are still far bigger than others be  207  at which time my understanding was so enlightened that i was as though i had seen the lord jesus look down from heaven through the tiles upon me and direct these words unto me  this sent me mourning home it broke my heart and filled me full of joy and laid me low as the dust only it stayed not long with me i mean in this glory and refreshing comfort yet it continued with me for several weeks and did encourage me to hope  but as soon as that powerful operation of it was taken from my heart that other about esau returned upon me as before  so my soul did hang as in a pair of scales again sometimes up and sometimes down now in peace and anon again in terror  208  thus i went on for many weeks sometimes comforted and sometimes tormented and especially at sometimes my torment would be very sore for all those scriptures forenamed in the hebrews would be set before me as the only sentences that would keep me out of heaven  then again i would begin to repent that ever that thought went through me i would also think thus with myself  why how many scriptures are there against me  there are but three or four and cannot god miss them and save me for all them sometimes again i would think oh if it were not for these three or four words now how might i be comforted  and i could hardly forbear at some times to wish them out of the book  209  then methought i should see as if both peter and paul and john and all the writers did look with scorn upon me and hold me in derision and as if they had said unto me all our words are truth one of as much force as another  it is not we that have cut you of but you have cast away yourself  there is none of our sentences that you must take hold upon but these and such as these it is impossible heb vi there remains no more sacrifice for sin heb x  and it had been better for them not to have known the will of god than after they had known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them 2 peter ii 21  for the scriptures cannot be broken  john x 35  210  these as the elders of the city of refuge i saw were to be judges both of my case and me while i stood with the avenger of blood at my heels trembling at their gate for deliverance also with a thousand fears and mistrusts i doubted that they would shut me out for ever  joshua xx 3 4  211  thus i was confounded not knowing what to do or how to be satisfied in this question whether the scriptures could agree in the salvation of my soul  i quaked at the apostles i knew their words were true and that they must stand for ever  212  and i remember one day as i was in divers frames of spirit and considering that these frames were according to the nature of several scriptures that came in upon my mind if this of grace then was i quiet but of that of esau then tormented  lord thought i if both these scriptures should meet in my heart at once i wonder which of them would get the better of me  so methought i had a longing mind that they might come both together upon me yea i desired of god they might  213  well about two or three days after so they did indeed they bolted both upon me at a time and did work and struggle strangely in me for a while at last that about esaus birthright began to wax weak and withdraw and vanish and this about the sufficiency of grace prevailed with peace and joy  and as i was in a muse about this thing that scripture came in upon me mercy rejoiceth against judgment  james ii 13  214  this was a wonderment to me yet truly i am apt to think it was of god for the word of the law and wrath must give place to the word of life and grace because though the word of condemnation be glorious yet the word of life and salvation doth far exceed in glory  2 cor iii 811  mark ix 57  john vi 37  also that moses and elias must both vanish and leave christ and his saints alone  215  this scripture also did now most sweetly visit my soul and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  oh the comfort that i had from this word in no wise  as who should say by no means for nothing whatever he hath done  but satan would greatly labour to pull this promise from me telling of me that christ did not mean me and such as i but sinners of a lower rank that had not done as i had done  but i would answer him again satan here is in these words no such exception but him that comes him any him  him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  and this i well remember still that of all the slights that satan used to take this scripture from me yet he never did so much as put this question but do you come aright  and i have thought the reason was because he thought i knew full well what coming aright was for i saw that to come aright was to come as i was a vile and ungodly sinner and to cast myself at the feet of mercy condemning myself for sin  if ever satan and i did strive for any word of god in all my life it was for this good word of christ he at one end and i at the other  oh what work did we make  it was for this in john i say that we did so tug and strive he pulled and i pulled but god be praised i got the better of him i got some sweetness from it  216  but notwithstanding all these helps and blessed words of grace yet that of esaus selling of his birthright would still at times distress my conscience  for though i had been most sweetly comforted and that but just before yet when that came into my mind twould make me fear again  i could not be quite rid thereof twould every day be with me  wherefore now i went another way to work even to consider the nature of this blasphemous thought i mean if i should take the words at the largest and give them their own natural force and scope even every word therein  so when i had thus considered i found that if they were fairly taken they would amount to this that i had freely left the lord jesus christ to his choice whether he would be my saviour or no for the wicked words were these let him go if he will  then that scripture gave me hope i will never leave thee nor forsake thee  heb xiii 5  o lord said i but i have left thee  then it answered again but i will not leave thee for this i thanked god also  217  yet i was grievous afraid he should and found it exceeding hard to trust him seeing i had so offended him  i could have been exceeding glad that this thought had never befallen for then i thought i could with more ease and freedom in abundance have leaned on his grace  i saw it was with me as it was with josephs brethren the guilt of their own wickedness did often fill them with fears that their brother would at last despise them  gen l 15 16 etc  218  yet above all the scriptures that i yet did meet with that in joshua xx was the greatest comfort to me which speaks of the slayer that was to flee for refuge  and if the avenger of blood pursue the slayer then saith moses they that are the elders of the city of refuge shall not deliver him into his hands because he smote his neighbour unwittingly and hated him not aforetime  oh blessed be god for this word  i was convinced that i was the slayer and that the avenger of blood pursued me i felt with great terror only now it remained that i inquire whether i have right to enter the city of refuge  so i found that he must not who lay in wait to shed blood  it was not the wilful murderer but he who unwittingly did it he who did it unawares not out of spite or grudge or malice he that shed it unwittingly  even he who did not hate his neighbour before  wherefore  219  i thought verily i was the man that must enter because i had smitten my neighbour unwittingly and hated him not aforetime  i hated him not aforetime no i prayed unto him was tender of sinning against him yea and against this wicked temptation i had strove for a twelvemonth before yea and also when it did pass through my heart it did in spite of my teeth  wherefore i thought i had a right to enter this city and the elders which are the apostles were not to deliver me up  this therefore was great comfort to me and gave me much ground of hope  220  yet being very critical for my smart had made me that i knew not what ground was sure enough to bear me i had one question that my soul did much desire to be resolved about and that was whether it be possible for any soul that hath sinned the unpardonable sin yet after that to receive though but the least true spiritual comfort from god though christ  the which after i had much considered i found the answer was no they could not and that for these reasons  221  first because those that have sinned that sin they are debarred a share in the blood of christ and being shut out of that they must needs be void of the least ground of hope and so of spiritual comfort for to such there remains no more sacrifice for sin  heb x 26 27  secondly because they are denied a share in the promise of life  it shall never be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come  matt xii 32  thirdly the son of god excludes them also from a share in his blessed intercession being for ever ashamed to own them both before his holy father and the blessed angels in heaven  mark viii  222  when i had with much deliberation considered of this matter and could not but conclude that the lord had comforted me and that too after this my wicked sin  then methought i durst venture to come nigh unto those most fearful and terrible scriptures with which all this while i had been so greatly affrighted and on which indeed before i durst scarce cast mine eye yea had much ado an hundred times to forbear wishing them out of the bible for i thought they would destroy me but now i say i began to take some measure of encouragement to come close to them to read them and consider them and to weigh their scope and tendency  223  the which when i began to do i found their visage changed for they looked not so grimly as before i thought they did  and first i came to the sixth of the hebrews yet trembling for fear it should strike me which when i had considered i found that the falling there intended was a falling quite away that is as i conceived a falling from and absolute denying of the gospel of remission of sins by jesus christ for from them the apostle begins his argument verses 1 2 3 4  secondly i found that this falling away must be openly even in the view of the world even so as to put christ to an open shame  thirdly i found those he there intended were for ever shut up of god both in blindness hardness and impenitency  it is impossible they should be renewed again unto repentance  by all these particulars i found to gods everlasting praise my sin was not the sin in this place intended  first i confessed i was fallen but not fallen away that is from the profession of faith in jesus unto eternal life  secondly i confessed that i had put jesus christ to shame by my sin but not to open shame i did not deny him before men nor condemn him as a fruitless one before the world  thirdly nor did i find that god had shut me up or denied me to come though i found it hard work indeed to come to him by sorrow and repentance  blessed be god for unsearchable grace  224  then i considered that in the 10th chapter of the hebrews and found that the wilful sin there mentioned is not every wilful sin but that which doth throw off christ and then his commandments too  secondly that must be done also openly before two or three witnesses to answer that of the law verse 28 thirdly this sin cannot be committed but with great despite done to the spirit of grace despising both the dissuasions from that sin and the persuasions to the contrary  but the lord knows though this my sin was devilish yet it did not amount to these  225  and as touching that in the 12th of the hebrews about esaus selling of his birthright though this was that which killed me and stood like a spear against me yet now i did consider first that his was not a hasty thought against the continual labour of his mind but a thought consented to and put in practice likewise and that after some deliberation gen xxv  secondly it was a public and open action even before his brother if not before many more this made his sin of a far more heinous nature than otherwise it would have been  thirdly he continued to slight his birthright  he did eat and drink and went his way  thus esau despised his birthright yea twenty years after he was found to despise it still  and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself  gen xxxiii 9  226  now as touching this that esau sought a place of repentance thus i thought  first this was not for the birthright but the blessing  this is clear from the apostle and is distinguished by esau himself he took away my birthright that is formerly and behold now he hath taken away my blessing  gen xxvii 36 secondly now this being thus considered i came again to the apostle to see what might be the mind of god in a newtestament style and sense concerning esaus sin and so far as i could conceive this was the mind of god that the birthright signified regeneration and the blessing the eternal inheritance for so the apostle seems to hint  lest there be any profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright as if he should say that shall cast off all those blessed beginnings of god that at present are upon him in order to a newbirth lest they become as esau even be rejected afterwards when they would inherit the blessing  227  for many there are who in the day of grace and mercy despise those things which are indeed the birthright to heaven who yet when the deciding day appears will cry as lord as esau lord lord open to us but then as isaac would not repent no more will god the father but will say i have blessed these yea and they shall be blessed but as for you depart you are the workers of iniquity  gen xxvii 32 luke xiii 2527  228  when i had thus considered these scriptures and found that thus to understand them was not against but according to other scriptures this still added further to my encouragement and comfort and also gave a great blow to that objection to wit that the scriptures could not agree in the salvation of my soul  and now remained only the hinder part of the tempest for the thunder was gone beyond me only some drops did still remain that now and then would fall upon me but because my former frights and anguish were very sore and deep therefore it oft befall me still as it befalleth those that have been scared with fire  i thought every voice was fire fire  every little touch would hurt my tender conscience  229  but one day as i was passing in the field and that too with some dashes on my conscience fearing lest yet all was not right suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul thy righteousness is in heaven and methought withal i saw with the eyes of my soul jesus christ at gods right hand  there i say was my righteousness so that wherever i was or whatever i was doing god could not say of me he wants my righteousness for that was just before him  i also saw moreover that it was not my good frame of heart that made my righteousness better nor yet my bad frame that made my righteousness worse for my righteousness was jesus christ himself the same yesterday today and for ever  heb xiii 8  230  now did my chains fall off my legs indeed i was loosed from my afflictions and irons my temptations also fled away so that from that time those dreadful scriptures of god left off to trouble me  now went i also home rejoicing for the grace and love of god so when i came home i looked to see if i could find that sentence thy righteousness is in heaven but could not find such a saying wherefore my heart began to sink again only that was brought to my remembrance 1 cor i 30 christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption by this word i saw the other sentence true  231  for by this scripture i saw that the man christ jesus as he is distinct from us as touching his bodily presence so he is our righteousness and sanctification before god  here therefore i lived for some time very sweetly at peace with god through christ oh methought christ christ there was nothing but christ that was before my eyes  i was not now only for looking upon this and the other benefits of christ apart as of his blood burial or resurrection but considering him as a whole christ as he in whom all these and all his other virtues relations offices and operations met together and that he sat on the right hand of god in heaven  232  twas glorious to me to see his exaltation and the worth and prevalency of all his benefits and that because now i could look from myself to him and should reckon that all those graces of god that now were green on me were yet but like those cracked groats and fourpencehalfpennies that rich men carry in their purses when their gold is in their trunks at home  oh i saw my gold was in my trunk at home  in christ my lord and saviour  now christ was all all my wisdom all my righteousness all my sanctification and all my redemption  233  further the lord did also lead me into the mystery of union with the son of god that i was joined to him that i was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and now was that word sweet to me in eph v 30  by this also was my faith in him as my righteousness the more confirmed in me for if he and i were one then his righteousness was mine his merits mine his victory also mine  now could i see myself in heaven and earth at once  in heaven by my christ by my head by my righteousness and life though on earth by my body or person  234  now i saw christ jesus was looked upon of god and should also be looked upon by us as that common or public person in whom all the whole body of his elect are always to be considered and reckoned that we fulfilled the law by him died by him rose from the dead by him got the victory over sin death the devil and hell by him when he died we died and so of his resurrection thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise saith he  isa xxvi 19  and again after two days he will revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight  hosea vi 2  which is now fulfilled by the sitting down of the son of man on the right hand of the majesty in the heavens according to that to the ephesians and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus  eph ii 6  235  ah these blessed considerations and scriptures with many others of like nature were in those days made to spangle in mine eyes so that i have cause to say praise ye the lord  praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts  praise him according to his excellent greatness  psalm cl 1 2  236  having thus in a few words given you a taste of the sorrow and affliction that my soul went under by the guilt and terror that this my wicked thought did lay me under and having given you also a touch of my deliverance therefrom and of the sweet and blessed comfort that i met with afterwards which comfort dwelt about a twelvemonth with my heart to my unspeakable admiration  i will now god willing before i proceed any farther give you in a word or two what as i conceive was the cause of this temptation and also after that what advantage at the last it became unto my soul  237  for the causes i conceived they were principally two  of which two also i was deeply convinced all the time this trouble lay upon me  the first was for that i did not when i was delivered from the temptation that went before still pray to god to to keep me from the temptations that were to come for though as i can say in truth my soul was much in prayer before this trial seized me yet then i prayed only or at the most principally for the removal of present troubles and for fresh discoveries of his love in christ which i saw afterwards was not enough to do i also should have prayed that the great god would keep me from the evil that was to come  238  of this i was made deeply sensible by the prayer of holy david who when he was under present mercy yet prayed that god would hold him back from sin and temptation to come then saith he shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression  psalm xix 13  by this very word was i galled and condemned quite through this long temptation  239  that was also another word that did much condemn me for my folly in the neglect of this duty  heb iv 16  let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need  this i had not done and therefore was thus suffered to sin and fall according to what is written pray that ye enter not into temptation  and truly this very thing is to this day of such weight and awe upon me that i dare not when i come before the lord go of my knees until i intreat him for help and mercy against the temptations that are to come and i do beseech thee reader that thou learn to beware of my negligence by the afflictions that for this thing i did for days and months and years with sorrow undergo  240  another cause of this temptation was that i had tempted god and on this manner did i do it  upon a time my wife was great with child and before her full time was come her pangs as of a woman in travail were fierce and strong upon her even as if she would have fallen immediately in labour and been delivered of an untimely birth  now at this very time it was that i had been so strongly tempted to question the being of god wherefore as my wife lay crying by me i said but with all secrecy imaginable even thinking in my heart lord if thou wilt now remove this sad affliction from my wife and cause that she be troubled no more therewith this night and now were her pangs just upon her then i shall know that thou canst discern the most secret thoughts of the heart  241  i had no sooner said it in my heart but her pangs were taken from her and she was cast into a deep sleep and so continued till morning at this i greatly marvelled not knowing what to think but after i had been awake a good while and heard her cry no more i fell asleep also so when i awaked in the morning it came upon me again even what i had said in my heart the last night and how the lord had showed me that he knew my secret thoughts which was a great astonishment unto me for several weeks after  242  well about a year and a half afterwards that wicked sinful thought of which i have spoken before went through my wicked heart even this thought let christ go if he will  so when i was fallen under the guilt for this the remembrance of my other thought and of the effect thereof would also come upon me with this retort which also carried rebuke along with it now you may see that god doth know the most secret thoughts of the heart  243  and with this that of the passages that were betwixt the lord and his servant gideon fell upon my spirit how because that gideon tempted god with his fleece both wet and dry when he should have believed and ventured upon his word therefore the lord did afterwards so try him as to send him against an innumerable company of enemies and that too as to outward appearance without any strength or help  judges vi 7  thus he served me and that justly for i should have believed his word and not have put an if upon the allseeingness of god  244  and now to show you something of the advantages that i also have gained by this temptation  and first by this i was made continually to possess in my soul a very wonderful sense both of the blessing and glory of god and of his beloved son in the temptation that went before my soul was perplexed with unbelief blasphemy hardness of heart questions about the being of god christ the truth of the word and certainty of the world to come i say then i was greatly assaulted and tormented with atheism but now the case was otherwise now was god and christ continually before my face though not in a way of comfort but in a way of exceeding dread and terror  the glory of the holiness of god did at this time break me to pieces and the bowels and compassion of christ did break me as on the wheel for i could not consider him but as a lost and rejected christ the remembrance of which was as the continual breaking of my bones  245  the scriptures also were wonderful things unto me i saw that the truth and verity of them were the keys of the kingdom of heaven those that the scriptures favour they must inherit bliss but those that they oppose and condemn must perish for evermore oh this word for the scriptures cannot be broken would rend the caul of my heart  and so would that other whose sins ye remit they are remitted but whose sins ye retain they are retained now i saw the apostles to be the elders of the city of refuge joshua xx 4  those that they were to receive in were received to life but those that they shut out were to be slain by the avenger of blood  246  oh one sentence of the scripture did more afflict and terrify my mind i mean those sentences that stood against me as sometimes i thought they every one did more i say than an army of forty thousand men that might have come against me  woe be to him against whom the scriptures bend themselves  247  by this temptation i was made to see more into the nature of the promises than ever i was before for i lying now trembling under the mighty hand of god continually torn and rent by the thundering of his justice  this made me with careful heart and watchful eye with great fearfulness to turn over every leaf and with much diligence mixed with trembling to consider every sentence together with its natural force and latitude  248  by this temptation also i was greatly holden off from my former foolish practice of putting by the word of promise when saw it came into my mind for now though i could not suck that comfort and sweetness from the promise as i had done at other times yet like to a man sinking i would catch at all i saw  formerly i thought i might not meddle with the promise unless i felt its comfort but now twas no time thus to do the avenger of blood too hardly did pursue me  249  now therefore i was glad to catch at that word which yet i feared i had no ground or right to own and even to leap into the bosom of that promise that yet i feared did shut its heart against me  now also i should labour to take the word as god hath laid it down without restraining the natural force of one syllable thereof  o what did i now see in that blessed sixth of john  and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  john vi 37 now i began to consider with myself that god hath a bigger mouth to speak with than i had a heart to conceive with i thought also with myself that he spake not his words in haste or in an unadvised heat but with infinite wisdom and judgment and in very truth and faithfulness  2 sam iii 28  250  i should in these days often in my greatest agonies even flounce towards the promise as the horses do towards sound ground that yet stick in the mire concluding though as one almost bereft of his wits through fear on this i will rest and stay and leave the fulfilling of it to the god of heaven that made it  oh many a pull hath my heart had with satan for that blessed sixth of john  i did not now as at other times look principally for comfort though o how welcome would it have been unto me  but now a word a word to lean a weary soul upon that it might not sink for ever twas that i hunted for  251  yea often when i have been making to the promise i have seen as if the lord would refuse my soul for ever i was often as if i had run upon the pikes and as if the lord had thrust at me to keep me from him as with a flaming sword  then i should think of esther who went to petition the king contrary to the law esther iv 16  i thought also of benhadads servants who went with ropes upon their heads to their enemies for mercy  1 kings xx 31 etc  the woman of canaan also that would not be daunted though called dog by christ matt xv 22 etc and the man that went to borrow bread at midnight luke xi 58 etc were great encouragements unto me  252  i never saw those heights and depths in grace and love and mercy as i saw after this temptation great sins to draw out great grace and where guilt is most terrible and fierce there the mercy of god in christ when showed to the soul appears most high and mighty  when job had passed through his captivity he had twice as much as he had before  job xlii 10  blessed be god for jesus christ our lord  many other things i might here make observation of but i would be brief and therefore shall at this time omit them and do pray god that my harms may make others fear to offend lest they also be made to bear the iron yoke as i did  i had two or three times at or about my deliverance from this temptation such strange apprehensions of the grace of god that i could hardly bear up under it  it was so out of measure amazing when i thought it could reach me that i do think if that sense of it had abode long upon me it would have made me incapable for business  253  now i shall go forward to give you a relation of other of the lords dealings with me at sundry other seasons and of the temptations i then did meet withal  i shall begin with what i met with when first i did join in fellowship with the people of god in bedford  after i had propounded to the church that my desire was to walk in the order and ordinances of christ with them and was also admitted by them  while i thought of that blessed ordinance of christ which was his last supper with his disciples before his death that scripture do this in remembrance of me luke xxii 19 was made a very precious word unto me for by it the lord did come down upon my conscience with the discovery of his death for my sins and as i then felt did as if he plunged me in the virtue of the same  but behold i had not been long a partaker at that ordinance but such fierce and sad temptations did attend me at all times therein both to blaspheme the ordinance and to wish some deadly thing to those that then did eat thereof  that lest i should at any time be guilty of consenting to these wicked and fearful thoughts i was forced to bend myself all the while to pray to god to keep me from such blasphemies  and also to cry to god to bless the bread and cup to them as it went from mouth to mouth  the reason of this temptation i have thought since was because i did not with that reverence that became me at first approach to partake thereof  254  thus i continued for three quarters of a year and could never have rest nor ease  but at the last the lord came in upon my soul with that same scripture by which my soul was visited before and after that i have been usually very well and comfortable in the partaking of that blessed ordinance and have i trust therein discerned the lords body as broken for my sins and that his precious blood hath been shed for my transgressions  255  upon a time i was something inclining to a consumption wherewith about the spring i was suddenly and violently seized with much weakness in my outward man insomuch that i thought i could not live  now began i afresh to give myself up to a serious examination after my state and condition for the future and of my evidences for that blessed world to come  for it hath i bless the name of god been my usual course as always so especially in the day of affliction to endeavour to keep my interest in the life to come clear before mine eyes  256  but i had no sooner began to recall to mind my former experience of the goodness of god to my soul but there came flocking into my mind an innumerable company of my sins and transgressions amongst which these were at this time most to my affliction namely my deadness dulness and coldness in holy duties my wanderings of heart of my wearisomeness in all good things my want of love to god his ways and people with this at the end of all are these the fruits of christianity  are these tokens of a blessed man  257  at the apprehensions of these things my sickness was doubled upon me for now i was sick in my inward man my soul was clogged with guilt now also was my former experience of gods goodness to me quite taken out of my mind and hid as if they had never been or seen  now was my soul greatly pinched between these two considerations live i must not die i dare not  now i sunk and fell in my spirit and was giving up all for lost but as i was walking up and down in the house as a man in a most woeful state that word of god took hold of my heart ye are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus  rom iii 24  but oh what a turn it made upon me  258  now was i as one awaked out of some troublesome sleep and dream and listening to this heavenly sentence i was as if i had heard it thus expounded to me  sinner thou thinkest that because thy sins and infirmities i cannot save thy soul but behold my son is by me and upon him i look and not on thee and shall deal with thee according as i am pleased with him  at this i was greatly lightened in my mind and made to understand that god could justify a sinner at any time it was but his looking upon christ and imputing his benefits to us and the work was forthwith done  259  and as i was thus in a muse that scripture also came with great power upon my spirit not by works of righteousness that we have done but according to his mercy he hath saved us etc  2 tim i 9 tit iii 5  now was i got on high i saw myself within the arms of grace and mercy and though i was before afraid to think of a dying hour yet now i cried let me die  now death was lovely and beautiful in my sight for i saw we shall never live indeed till we be gone to the other world  oh methought this life is but a slumber in comparison with that above  at this time also i saw more in these words heirs of god rom viii 17 than ever i shall be able to express while i live in this world  heirs of god  god himself is the portion of the saints  this i saw and wondered at but cannot tell you what i saw  260  again as i was at another time very ill and weak all that time also the tempter did beset me strongly for i find he is much for assaulting the soul when it begins to approach towards the grave then is his opportunity labouring to hide from me my former experience of gods goodness  also setting before me the terrors of death and the judgment of god insomuch that at this time through my fear of miscarrying for ever should i now die i was as one dead before death came and was as if i had felt myself already descending into the pit methought i said there were no way but to hell i must  but behold just as i was in the midst of those fears these words of the angels carrying lazarus into abrahams bosom darted in upon me as who should say so it shall be with thee when thou dost leave this world  this did sweetly revive my spirit and help me to hope in god which when i had with comfort mused on a while that word fell with great weight upon my mind o death where is thy sting  o grave where is thy victory 1 cor xv 55  at this i became both well in body and mind at once for my sickness did presently vanish and i walked comfortably in my work for god again  261  at another time though just before i was pretty well and savoury in my spirit yet suddenly there fell upon me a great cloud of darkness which did so hide from me the things of god and christ that i was as if i had never seen or known them in my life i was also so overrun in my soul with a senseless heartless frame of spirit that i could not feel my soul to move or stir after grace and life by christ i was as if my loins were broken or as if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains  at this time also i felt some weakness to seize upon my outward man which made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable to me  262  after i had been in this condition some three or four days as i was sitting by the fire i suddenly felt this word to sound in my heart i must go to jesus  at this my former darkness and atheism fled away and the blessed things of heaven were set in my view  while i was on this sudden thus overtaken with surprise wife said i is there ever such a scripture i must go to jesus she said she could not tell therefore i sat musing still to see if i could remember such a place  i had not sat above two or three minutes but that came bolting in upon me and to an innumerable company of angels and withal hebrews twelfth about the mount sion was set before mine eyes  heb xii 2224  263  then with joy i told my wife o now i know i know  but that night was a good night to me i never had but few better i longed for the company of some of gods people that i might have imparted unto them what god had showed me  christ was a precious christ to my soul that night i could scarce lie in my bed for joy and peace and triumph through christ  this great glory did not continue upon me until morning yet the twelfth of the author to the hebrews heb xii 22 23 was a blessed scripture to me for many days together after this  264  the words are these  ye are come to mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel  through this blessed sentence the lord led me over and over first to this word and then to that and showed me wonderful glory in every one of them  these words also have oft since that time been great refreshment to my spirit  blessed be god for having mercy on me   a brief account of the authors call to the work of the ministry   265  and now i am speaking my experience i will in this place thrust in a word or two concerning my preaching the word and of gods dealing with me in that particular also  for after i had been about five or six years awakened and helped myself to see both the want and worth of jesus christ our lord and also enabled to venture my soul upon him some of the most able among the saints with us i say the most able for judgment and holiness of life as they conceived did perceive that god had counted me worth to understand something of his will in his holy and blessed word and had given me utterance in some measure to express what i saw to others for edification therefore they desired me and that with much earnestness that i would be willing at sometimes to take in hand in one of the meetings to speak a word of exhortation unto them  266  the which though at the first it did much dash and abash my spirit yet being still by them desired and entreated i consented to their request and did twice at two several assemblies but in private though with much weakness and infirmity discover my gift amongst them at which they not only seemed to be but did solemnly protest as in the sight of the great god they were both affected and comforted and gave thanks to the father of mercies for the grace bestowed on me  267  after this sometimes when some of them did go into the country to teach they would also that i should go with them where though as yet i did not nor durst not make use of my gift in an open way yet more privately still as i came amongst the good people in those places i did sometimes speak a word of admonition unto them also the which they as the other received with rejoicing at the mercy of god to meward professing their souls were edified thereby  268  wherefore to be brief at last being still desired by the church after some solemn prayer to the lord with fasting i was more particularly called forth and appointed to a more ordinary and public preaching of the word not only to and amongst them that believed but also to offer the gospel to those who had not yet received the faith thereof about which time i did evidently find in my mind a secret pricking forward thereto though i bless god not for desire of vainglory for at that time i was most sorely afflicted with the fiery darts of the devil concerning my eternal state  269  but yet could not be content unless i was found in the exercise of my gift unto which also i was greatly animated not only by the continual desires of the godly but also by that saying of paul to the corinthians  i beseech you brethren ye know the household of stephanas that it is the first fruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth  1 cor xvi 15 16  270   by this text i was made to see that the holy ghost never intended that men who have gifts and abilities should bury them in the earth but rather did command and stir up such to the exercise of their gift and also did commend those that were apt and ready so to do  they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints  this scripture in these days did continually run in my mind to encourage me and strengthen me in this my work for god i have also been encouraged from several other scriptures and examples of the godly both specified in the word and other ancient histories  acts viii 4 and xviii 24 25 etc 1 pet iv 10 rom xii 6 foxs acts and mon  271  wherefore though of myself of all the saints the most unworthy yet i but with great fear and trembling at the sight of my own weakness did set upon the work and did according to my gift and the proportion of my faith preach that blessed gospel that god had showed me in the holy word of truth  which when the country understood they came in to hear the word by hundreds and that from all parts though upon sundry and divers accounts  272  and i thank god he gave unto me some measure of bowels and pity for their souls which also did put me forward to labour with great diligence and earnestness to find out such a word as might if god would bless lay hold of and awaken the conscience in which also the good lord had respect to the desire of his servant for i had not preached long before some began to be touched and be greatly afflicted in their minds at the apprehension of the greatness of their sin and of their need of jesus christ  273  but i first could not believe that god should speak by me to the heart of any man still counting myself unworthy yet those who thus were touched would love me and have a particular respect for me and though i did put it from me that they should be awakened by me still they would confess it and affirm it before the saints of god  they would also bless god for me unworthy wretch that i am and count me gods instrument that showed to them the way of salvation  274  wherefore seeing them in both their words and deeds to be so constant and also in their hearts so earnestly pressing after the knowledge of jesus christ rejoicing that ever god did send me where they were then i began to conclude it might be so that god had owned in his work such a foolish one as i and then came that word of god to my heart with much sweet refreshment the blessing of him that was ready to perish is come upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy  job xxix 13  275  at this therefore i rejoiced yea the tears of those whom god did awaken by my preaching would be both solace and encouragement to me  for i thought on those sayings who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me 2 cor ii 2  and again if i be not an apostle to others yet doubtless i am unto you  for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord  1 cor ix 2  these things therefore were as another argument unto me that god had called me to and stood by me in this work  276  in my preaching of the word i took special notice of this one thing namely that the lord did lead me to begin where his word begins with sinners that is to condemn all flesh and to open and allege that the curse of god by the law doth belong to and lay hold on all men as they come into the world because of sin  now this part of my work i fulfilled with great sense for the terrors of the law and guilt for my transgressions lay heavy on my conscience  i preached what i felt what i smartingly did feel even that under which my poor soul did groan and tremble to astonishment  277  indeed i have been as one sent to them from the dead i went myself in chains to preach to them in chains and carried that fire in my own conscience that i persuaded them to be aware of  i can truly say and that without dissembling that when i have been to preach i have gone full of guilt and terror even to the pulpit door and there it hath been taken off and i have been at liberty in my mind until i have done my work and then immediately even before i could get down the pulpit stairs i have been as bad as i was before yet god carried me on but surely with a strong hand for neither guilt nor hell could take me off my work  278  thus i went on for the space of two years crying out against mens sins and their fearful state because of them  after which the lord came in upon my own soul with some staid peace and comfort through christ for he did give me many sweet discoveries of his blessed grace through him wherefore now i altered in my preaching for still i preached what i saw and felt now therefore i did much labour to hold forth jesus christ in all his offices relations and benefits unto the world and did strive also to discover to condemn and remove those false supports and props on which the world doth both lean and by them fall and perish  on these things also i staid as long as on the other  279  after this god led me into something of the mystery of the union of christ wherefore that i discovered and showed to them also  and when i had travelled through these three chief points of the word of god about the space of five years or more i was caught in my present practice and cast into prison where i have lain above as long again to confirm the truth by way of suffering as i was before in testifying of it according to the scriptures in a way of preaching  280  when i have been in preaching i thank god my heart hath often all the time of this and the other exercise with great earnestness cried to god that he would make the word effectual to the salvation of the soul still being grieved lest the enemy should take the word away from the conscience and so it should become unfruitful  wherefore i should labour to speak the word as that thereby if it were possible the sin and person guilty might be particularized by it  281  and when i have done the exercise it hath gone to my heart to think the word should now fall as rain on stony places still wishing from my heart oh that they who have heard me speak this day did but see as i do what sin death hell and the curse of god is and also what the grace and love and mercy of god is through christ to men in such a case as they are who are yet estranged from him  and indeed i did often say in my heart before the lord that if to be hanged up presently before their eyes would be a means to awaken them and confirm them in the truth i gladly should be contented  282  for i have been in my preaching especially when i have been engaged in the doctrine of life by christ without works as if an angel of god had stood by at my back to encourage me  oh it hath been with such power and heavenly evidence upon my own soul while i have been labouring to unfold it to demonstrate it and to fasten it upon the conscience of others that i could not be contented with saying i believe and am sure methought i was more than sure if it be lawful to express myself that those things which then i asserted were true  283  when i first went to preach the word abroad the doctors and priests of the country did open wide against me  but i was persuaded of this not to render railing for railing but to see how many of their carnal professors i could convince of their miserable state by the law and of the want and worth of christ for thought i this shall answer for me in time to come when they shall be for my hire before their face  gen xxx 33  284  i never cared to meddle with things that were controverted and in dispute among the saints especially things of the lowest nature yet it pleased me much to contend with great earnestness for the word of faith and the remission of sins by the death and sufferings of jesus  but i say as to other things i should let them alone because i saw they engendered strife and because that they neither in doing nor in leaving undone did commend us to god to be his  besides i saw my work before me did run into another channel even to carry an awakening word to that therefore did i stick and adhere  285  i never endeavoured to nor durst make use of other mens lines rom xv 18 though i condemn not all that do for i verily thought and found by experience that what was taught me by the word and spirit of christ could be spoken maintained and stood to by the soundest and best established conscience and though i will not now speak all that i know in this matter yet my experience hath more interest in that text of scripture gal i 11 12 than many amongst men are aware  286  if any of those who were awakened by my ministry did after that fall back as sometimes too many did i can truly say their loss hath been more to me than if one of my own children begotten of my own body had been going to its grave  i think verily i may speak it without any offence to the lord nothing has gone so near me as that unless it was the fear of the loss of the salvation of my own soul  i have counted as if i had goodly buildings and lordships in those places where my children were born my heart hath been so wrapped up in the glory of this excellent work that i counted myself more blessed and honoured of god by this than if he had made me the emperor of the christian world or the lord of all the glory of the earth without it  oh these words  he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death  james v 20  the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise  prov xi 30  they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever dan xii 3  for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming  for ye are our glory and joy  1 thes ii 19 20  these i say with many others of a like nature have been great refreshments to me  287  i have observed that where i have had a work to do for god i have had first as it were the going of god upon my spirit to desire i might preach there  i have also observed that such and such souls in particular have been strongly set upon my heart and i stirred up to wish for their salvation and that these very souls have after this been given in as the fruits of my ministry  i have observed that a word cast in bythebye hath done more execution in a sermon than all that was spoken besides  sometimes also when i have thought i did no good then i did the most of all and at other times when i thought i should catch them i have fished for nothing  288  i have also observed that where there has been a work to do upon sinners there the devil hath begun to roar in the hearts and by the mouths of his servants  yea oftentimes when the wicked world hath raged most there hath been souls awakened by the word i could instance particulars but i forbear  289  my great desire in my fulfilling my ministry was to get into the darkest places of the country even amongst those people that were farthest off of profession yet not because i could not endure the light for i feared not to show my gospel to any but because i found my spirit did lean most after awakening and converting work and the word that i carried did lean itself most that way also yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation  rom xv 20  290  in my preaching i have really been in pain and have as it were travailed to bring forth children to god neither could i be satisfied unless some fruits did appear in my work  if i were fruitless it mattered not who commanded me  but if i were fruitful i cared not who did condemn  i have thought of that lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his rewardas arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth  happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them  they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate  psalm cxxvii 35  291  it pleased me nothing to see people drink in opinions if they seemed ignorant of jesus christ and the worth of their own salvation sound conviction for sin especially for unbelief and a heart set on fire to be saved by christ with strong breathings after a truly sanctified soul  that it was that delighted me those were the souls i counted blessed  292  but in this work as in all other i had my temptations attending me and that of divers kinds as sometimes i should be assaulted with great discouragement therein fearing that i should not be able to speak a word at all to edification nay that i should not be able to speak sense unto the people at which times i should have such a strange faintness and strengthlessness seize upon my body that my legs have scarce been able to carry me to the place of exercise  293  sometimes again when i have been preaching i have been violently assaulted with thoughts of blasphemy and strongly tempted to speak the words with my mouth before the congregation i have also at some times even when i have begun to speak the word with much clearness evidence and liberty of speech yet been before the ending of that opportunity so blinded and so estranged from the things i have been speaking and have been also so straightened in my speech as to utterance before the people that i have been as if i had not known or remembered what i have been about or as if my head had been in a bag all the time of my exercise  294  again when as sometimes i have been about to preach upon some smart and searching portion of the word i have found the tempter suggest what will you preach this  this condemns yourself of this your own soul is guilty wherefore preach not of it at all or if you do yet so mince it as to make way for your own escape lest instead of awakening others you lay that guilt upon your own soul that you will never get from under  295  but i thank the lord i have been kept from consenting to these so horrid suggestions and have rather as sampson bowed myself with all my might to condemn sin and transgression wherever i found it yea though therein also i did bring guilt upon my own conscience  let me die thought i with the philistines judges xvi 29 30 rather than deal corruptly with the blessed word of god  thou that teachest another teachest thou not thyself  it is far better that thou do judge thyself even by preaching plainly unto others than that thou to save thyself imprison the truth in righteousness  blessed be god for his help also in this  296  i have also while found in this blessed work of christ been often tempted to pride and liftings up of heart  and though i dare not say i have not been affected with this yet truly the lord of his precious mercy hath so carried it towards me that for the most part i have had but small joy to give way to such a thing for it hath been my every days portion to be let into the evil of my own heart and still made to see such a multitude of corruptions and infirmities therein that it hath caused hanging down of the head under all my gifts and attainments i have felt this thorn in the flesh 2 cor xii 8 9 the very mercy of god to me  297  i have also had together with this some notable place or other of the word presented before me which word hath contained in it some sharp and piercing sentence concerning the perishing of the soul notwithstanding gifts and parts  as for instance that hath been of great use to me  though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal  1 cor xiii 1 2  298  a tinkling cymbal is an instrument of music with which a skilful player can make such melodious and heartinflaming music that all who hear him play can scarcely hold from dancing and yet behold the cymbal hath not life neither comes the music from it but because of the art of him that plays therewith so then the instrument at last may come to nought and perish though in times past such music hath been made upon it  299  just thus i saw it was and will be with them who have gifts but want saving grace they are in the hand of christ as the cymbal in the hand of david  and as david could with the cymbal make that mirth in the service of god as to elevate the hearts of the worshippers so christ can use these gifted men as with them to affect the souls of his people in his church yet when he hath done all hang them by as lifeless though sounding cymbals  300  this consideration therefore together with some others were for the most part as a maul on the head of pride and desire of vainglory  what thought i shall i be proud because i am a sounding brass  is it so much to be a fiddle hath not the least creature that hath life more of god in it than these  besides i knew twas love should never die but these must cease and vanish so i concluded a little grace a little love a little of the true fear of god is better than all the gifts  yea and i am fully convinced of it that it is possible for souls that can scarce give a man an answer but with great confusion as to method i say it is possible for them to have a thousand times more grace and so to be more in the love and favour of the lord than some who by the virtue of the gift of knowledge can deliver themselves like angels  301  thus therefore i came to perceive that though gifts in themselves were good to the thing for which they are designed to wit the edification of others yet empty and without power to save the soul of him that hath them if they be alone  neither are they as so any sign of a mans state to be happy being only a dispensation of god to some of whose improvement or non improvement they must when a little love more is over give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead  302  this showed me too that gifts being alone were dangerous not in themselves but because of those evils that attend them that have them to wit pride desire of vain glory selfconceit etc all which were easily blown up at the applause and commendation of every unadvised christian to the endangering of a poor creature to fall into the condemnation of the devil  303  i saw therefore that he that hath gifts had need be let into a sight of the nature of them to wit that they come short of making of him to be in a truly saved condition lest he rest in them and so fall short of the grace of god  304  he hath cause also to walk humbly with god and be little in his own eyes and to remember withal that his gifts are not his own but the churches and that by them he is made a servant to the church and he must also give at last an account of his stewardship unto the lord jesus and to give a good account will be a blessed thing  305  let all men therefore prize a little with the fear of the lord gifts indeed are desirable but yet great grace and small gifts are better than great gifts and no grace  it doth not say the lord gives gifts and glory but the lord gives grace and glory and blessed is such an one to whom the lord gives grace true grace for that is a certain forerunner of glory  306  but when satan perceived that his thus tempting and assaulting of me would not answer his design to wit to overthrow the ministry and make it ineffectual as to the ends thereof then he tried another way which was to stir up the minds of the ignorant and malicious to load me with slanders and reproaches now therefore i may say that what the devil could devise and his instruments invent was whirled up and down the country against me thinking as i said that by that means they should make my ministry to be abandoned   307  it began therefore to be rumoured up and down among the people that i was a witch a jesuit a highwayman and the like   308  to all which i shall only say god knows that i am innocent  but as for mine accusers let them provide themselves to meet me before the tribunal of the son of god there to answer for all these things with all the rest of their iniquities unless god shall give them repentance for them for the which i pray with all my heart  309  but that which was reported with the boldest confidence was that i had my misses my whores my bastards yea two wives at once and the like   now these slanders with the others i glory in because but slanders foolish or knavish lies and falsehoods cast upon me by the devil and his seed and should i not be dealt with thus wickedly by the world i should want one sign of a saint and a child of god  blessed are ye said the lord jesus when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you  matt iv 11  310  these things therefore upon mine own account trouble me not no though they were twenty times more than they are  i have a good conscience and whereas they speak evil of me as an evil doer they shall be ashamed that falsely accuse my good conversation in christ  311  so then what shall i say to those who have thus bespattered me  shall i threaten them  shall i chide them  shall i flatter them  shall i entreat them to hold their tongues  no not i were it not for that these things make them ripe for damnation that are the authors and abettors i would say unto them report it because twill increase my glory  312  therefore i bind these lies and slanders to me as an ornament it belongs to my christian profession to be vilified slandered reproached and reviled and since all this is nothing else as my god and my conscience do bear me witness i rejoice in reproaches for christs sake  313  i also call all these fools or knaves that have thus made it any thing of their business to affirm any of the things aforenamed of me namely that i have been naught with other women or the like  when they have used the utmost of their endeavours and made the fullest inquiry that they can to prove against me truly that there is any woman in heaven or earth or hell that can say i have at any time in any place by day or night so much as attempted to be naught with them and speak i thus to beg my enemies into a good esteem of me  no not i  i will in this beg belief of no man  believe or disbelieve me in this all is acase to me  314  my foes have missed their mark in this shooting at me  i am not the man  i wish that they themselves be guiltless  if all the fornicators and adulterers in england were hanged up by the neck till they be dead john bunyan the object of their envy would be still alive and well  i know not whether there be such a thing as a woman breathing under the copes of the whole heaven but by their apparel their children or by common fame except my wife  315  and in this i admire the wisdom of god that he made me shy of women from my first conversion until now  those shy of women know and can also bear me witness with whom i have been most intimately concerned that it is a rare thing to see me carry it pleasant towards a woman  the common salutation of women i abhor tis odious to me in whomsoever i see it  their company alone i cannot away with i seldom so much as touch a womans hand for i think these things are not so becoming me  when i have seen good men salute those women that they have visited or that have visited them i have at times made my objection against it and when they have answered that it was but a piece of civility i have told them it is not a comely sight  some indeed have urged the holy kiss but then i have asked why they made baulks why they did salute the most handsome and let the illfavoured go  thus how laudable soever such things have been in the eyes of others they have been unseemly in my sight  316  and now for a windup in this matter i calling not only men but angels to prove me guilty of having carnally to do with any woman save my wife  nor am i afraid to do it a second time knowing that it cannot offend the lord in such a case to call god for a record upon my soul that in these things i am innocent  not that i have been thus kept because of any goodness in me more than any other but god has been merciful to me and has kept me to whom i pray that he will keep me still not only from this but every evil way and work and preserve me to his heavenly kingdom amen  317  now as satan laboured by reproaches and slanders to make me vile among my countrymen that if possible my preaching might be made of none effect so there was added hereto a long and tedious imprisonment that thereby i might be frightened from my service for christ and the world terrified and made afraid to hear me preach of which i shall in the next place give you a brief account   a brief account of the authors imprisonment   318  having made profession of the glorious gospel of christ a long time and preached the same about five years i was apprehended at a meeting of good people in the country among whom had they let me alone i should have preached that day but they took me away from amongst them and had me before a justice who after i had offered security for my appearing at the next sessions yet committed me because my sureties would not consent to be bound that i should preach no more to the people  319  at the sessions after i was indicted for an upholder and maintainer of unlawful assemblies and conventicles and for not conforming to the national worship of the church of england and after some conference there with the justices they taking my plain dealing with them for a confession as they termed it of the indictment did sentence me to a perpetual banishment because i refused to conform  so being again delivered up to the jailers hands i was had home to prison and there have lain now complete twelve years waiting to see what god would suffer these men to do with me  320  in which condition i have continued with much content through grace but have met with many turnings and goings upon my heart both from the lord satan and my own corruptions by all which glory be to jesus christ i have also received among many things much conviction instruction and understanding of which at large i shall not here discourse only give you a hint or two a word that may stir up the godly to bless god and to pray for me and also to take encouragement should the case be their ownnot to fear what man can do unto them  321  i never had in all my life so great an inlet into the word of god as now  those scriptures that i saw nothing in before are made in this place and state to shine upon me jesus christ also was never more real and apparent than now here i have seen and felt him indeed  oh that word we have not preached unto you cunningly devised fables 2 pet i 16 and that god raised christ from the dead and gave him glory that our faith and hope might be in god 1 pet i 21 were blessed words unto me in this my imprisoned condition  322  these three or four scriptures also have been great refreshments in this condition to me  john xiv 14 john xvi 33 col iii 3 4 heb xii 2224  so that sometimes when i have been in the savour of them i have been able to laugh at destruction and to fear neither the horse nor his rider  i have had sweet sights of the forgiveness of my sins in this place and of my being with jesus in another world  oh the mount sion the heavenly jerusalem the innumerable company of angels and god the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect and jesus have been sweet unto me in this place  i have seen that here that i am persuaded i shall never while in this world be able to express  i have seen a truth in this scripture whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory  1 pet i 8  323  i never knew what it was for god to stand by me at all turns and at every offer of satan to afflict me etc as i have found him since i came in hither  for look how fears have presented themselves so have supports and encouragements yea when i have started even as it were at nothing else but my shadow yet god as being very tender of me hath not suffered me to be molested but would with one scripture or another strengthen me against all insomuch that i have often said were it lawful i could pray for greater trouble for the greater comforts sake  eccl vii 14 2 cor i 5  324  before i came to prison i saw what was coming and had especially two considerations warm upon my heart the first was how to be able to encounter death should that be here my portion for the first of these that scripture col i 11 was great information to me namely to pray to god to be strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness  i could seldom go to prayer before i was imprisoned but for not so little as a year together this sentence or sweet petition would as it were thrust itself into my mind and persuade me that if ever i would go through long suffering i must have all patience especially if i would endure it joyfully  325  as to the second consideration that saying  2 cor i 9 was of great use to me but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead  by this scripture i was made to see that if ever i would suffer rightly i must first pass a sentence of death upon every thing that can properly be called a thing of this life even to reckon myself my wife my children my health my enjoyments and all as dead to me and myself as dead to them  326  the second was to live upon god that is invisible as paul said in another place the way not to faint is to look not on the things that are seen but at the things that are not seen for the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal  and thus i reasoned with myself if i provide only for a prison then the whip comes at unawares and so doth also the pillory  again if i only provide for these then i am not fit for banishment  further if i conclude that banishment is the worst then if death comes i am surprised  so that i see the best way to go through sufferings is to trust in god through christ as touching the world to come and as touching this world to count the grave my house to make my bed in darkness to say to corruption thou art my father and to the worm thou art my mother and sister  that is to familiarize these things to me  327  but notwithstanding these helps i found myself a man and compassed with infirmities the parting with my wife and poor children hath often been to me in this place as the pulling the flesh from the bones and that not only because i am somewhat too fond of these great mercies but also because i should have often brought to my mind the many hardships miseries and wants that my poor family was like to meet with should i be taken from them especially my poor blind child who lay nearer my heart than all besides  oh the thoughts of the hardship i thought my poor blind one might go under would break my heart to pieces  328  poor child thought i what sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this world  thou must be beaten must beg suffer hunger cold nakedness and a thousand calamities though i cannot now endure the wind should blow upon thee  but yet recalling myself thought i i must venture you all with god though it goeth to the quick to leave you  oh i saw in this condition i was as a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his wife and children yet thought i i must do it i must do it  and now i thought on those two milch kine that were to carry the ark of god into another country and to leave their calves behind them  1 sam vi 1012  329  but that which helped me in this temptation was divers considerations of which three in special here i will name the first was the consideration of these two scriptures leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me  and again the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in time of affliction  jer xlix 11 xv 11  330  i had also this consideration that if i should not venture all for god i engaged god to take care of my concernments  but if i forsook him and his ways for fear of any trouble that should come to me or mine then i should not only falsify my profession but should count also that my concernments were not so sure if left at gods feet whilst i stood to and for his name as they would be if they were under my own care though with the denial of the way of god  this was a smarting consideration and as spurs unto my flesh  that scripture also greatly helped it to fasten the more upon me where christ prays against judas that god would disappoint him in his selfish thoughts which moved him to sell his master  pray read it soberly  psalm cix 68 etc  331  i had also another consideration and that was the dread of the torments of hell which i was sure they must partake of that for fear of the cross do shrink from their profession of christ his words and laws before the sons of men  i thought also of the glory that he had prepared for those that in faith and love and patience stood to his ways before them  these things i say have helped me when the thoughts of the misery that both myself and mine might for the sake of my profession be exposed to hath lain pinching on my mind  332  when i have indeed conceited that i might be banished for my profession then i have thought of that scripture  they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy for all they thought they were too bad to dwell and abide amongst them  i have also thought of that saying the holy ghost witnesseth in every city that bonds and afflictions abide me  i have verily thought that my soul and it have sometimes reasoned about the sore and sad estate of a banished and exiled condition how they were exposed to hunger to cold to perils to nakedness to enemies and a thousand calamities and at last it may be to die in a ditch like a poor and desolate sheep  but i thank god hitherto i have not been moved by these most delicate reasonings but have rather by them more approved my heart to god  333  i will tell you a pretty business i was once above all the rest in a very sad and low condition for many weeks at which time also i being but a young prisoner and not acquainted with the laws had this lying much upon my spirits that my imprisonment might end at the gallows for ought that i could tell  now therefore satan laid hard at me to beat me out of heart by suggesting thus unto me  but how if when you come indeed to die you should be in this condition that is as not to savour the things of god nor to have any evidence upon your soul for a better state hereafter for indeed at that time all the things of god were hid from my soul  334  wherefore when i at first began to think of this it was a great trouble to me for i thought with myself that in the condition i now was in i was not fit to die neither indeed did i think i could if i should be called to it besides i thought with myself if i should make a scrambling shift to clamber up the ladder yet i should either with quaking or other symptoms of fainting give occasion to the enemy to reproach the way of god and his people for their timorousness  this therefore lay with great trouble upon me for methought i was ashamed to die with a pale face and tottering knees in such a cause as this  335  wherefore i prayed to god that he would comfort me and give me strength to do and suffer me what he should call me to yet no comfort appeared but all continued hid  i was also at this time so really possessed with the thought of death that oft i was as if i was on a ladder with the rope about my neck only this was some encouragement to me i thought i might now have an opportunity to speak my last words to a multitude which i thought would come to see me die and thought i if it must be so if god will but convert one soul by my very last words i shall not count my life thrown away nor lost  336  but yet all the things of god were kept out of my sight and still the tempter followed me with but whither must you go when you die what will become of you where will you be found in another world what evidence have you for heaven and glory and an inheritance among them that are sanctified  thus was i tossed for many weeks and knew not what to do at last this consideration fell with weight upon me that it was for the word and way of god that i was in this condition wherefore i was engaged not to flinch an hairs breadth from it  337  i thought also that god might choose whether he would give me comfort now or at the hour of death but i might not therefore choose whether i would hold my profession or no  i was bound but he was free yea twas my duty to stand to his word whether he would ever look upon me or save me at the last  wherefore thought i save the point being thus i am for going on and venturing my eternal state with christ whether i have comfort here or no if god doth not come in thought i i will leap off the ladder even blindfold into eternity sink or swim come heaven come hell lord jesus if thou wilt catch me do if not i will venture for thy name  338  i was no sooner fixed in this resolution but the word dropped upon me doth job serve god for nought  as if the accuser had said lord job is no upright man be serves thee for bye respects  hast thou not made an hedge about him etc  but put forth now thine hand and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face  how now thought i is this the sign of an upright soul to desire to serve god when all is taken from him is he a godly man that will serve god for nothing rather than give out  blessed be god then i hope i have an upright heart for i am resolved god giving me strength never to deny my profession though i have nothing at all for my pains  and as i was thus considering that scripture was set before me  psalm xliv 12 etc  339  now was my heart full of comfort for i hoped it was sincere i would not have been without this trial for much i am comforted every time i think of it and i hope i shall bless god for ever for the teaching i have had by it  many more of the dealings towards me i might relate but these out of the spoils won in battle i have dedicated to maintain the house of god  1 chron xxvi 27   the conclusion   1  of all the temptations that ever i met with in my life to question the being of god and truth of his gospel is the worst and the worst to be borne when this temptation comes it takes away my girdle from me and removeth the foundation from under me oh i have often thought of that word have your loins girt about with truth and of that when the foundations are destroyed what can the righteous do  2  sometimes when after sin committed i have looked for sore chastisement from the hand of god the very next that i have had from him hath been the discovery of his grace  sometimes when i have been comforted i have called myself a fool for my so sinking under trouble  and then again when i have been cast down i thought i was not wise to give such way to comfort with such strength and weight have both these been upon me  3  i have wondered much at this one thing that though god doth visit my soul with never so blessed a discovery of himself yet i have found again that such hours have attended me afterwards that i have been in my spirit so filled with darkness that i could not so much as once conceive what that god and that comfort was with which i have been refreshed  4  i have sometimes seen more in a line of the bible than i could well tell how to stand under and yet at another time the whole bible hath been to me as dry as a stick or rather my heart hath been so dead and dry unto it that i could not conceive the refreshment though i have looked it all over  5  of all fears they are best that are made by the blood of christ and of all joy that is the sweetest that is mixed with mourning over christ  oh it is a goodly thing to be on our knees with christ in our arms before god  i hope i know something of these things  6  i find to this day seven abominations in my heart  1 inclining to unbelief 2 suddenly to forget the love and mercy that christ manifesteth 3 a leaning to the works of the law 4 wanderings and coldness in prayer 5 to forget to watch for that i pray for 6 apt to murmur because i have no more and yet ready to abuse what i have 7 i can do none of those things which god commands me but my corruptions will thrust in themselves  when i would do good evil is present with me  7  these things i continually see and feel and am afflicted and oppressed with yet the wisdom of god doth order them for my good 1 they make me abhor myself 2 they keep me from trusting my heart 3 they convince me of the insufficiency of all inherent righteousness 4 they show me the necessity of flying to jesus 5 they press me to pray unto god 6 they show me the need i have to watch and be sober 7 and provoke me to pray unto god through christ to help me and carry me through this world    a relation of my imprisonment in the month of november 1660    when by the good hand of my god i had for five or six years together without any interruption freely preached the blessed gospel of our lord jesus christ and had also through his blessed grace some encouragement by his blessing thereupon the devil that old enemy of mans salvation took his opportunity to inflame the hearts of his vassals against me insomuch that at the last i was laid out for by the warrant of a justice and was taken and committed to prison  the relation thereof is as followeth  upon the 12th of this instant november 1660 i was desired by some of the friends in the country to come to teach at samsell by harlington in bedfordshire  to whom i made a promise if the lord permitted to be with them on the time aforesaid  the justice hearing thereof whose name is mr francis wingate forthwith issued out his warrant to take me and bring me before him and in the meantime to keep a very strong watch about the house where the meeting should be kept as if we that were to meet together in that place did intend to do some fearful business to the destruction of the country when alas the constable when he came in found us only with our bibles in our hands ready to speak and hear the word of god for we were just about to begin our exercise  nay we had begun in prayer for the blessing of god upon our opportunity intending to have preached the word of the lord unto them there present  but the constable coming in prevented us  so i was taken and forced to depart the room  but had i been minded to have played the coward i could have escaped and kept out of his hands for when i was come to my friends house there was whispering that that day i should be taken for there was a warrant out to take me which when my friend heard he being somewhat timorous questioned whether we had best have our meeting or not and whether it might not be better for me to depart lest they should take me and have me before the justice and after that send me to prison for he knew better than i what spirit they were of living by them  to whom i said no by no means i will not stir neither will i have the meeting dismissed for this  come be of good cheer let us not be daunted our cause is good we need not be ashamed of it to preach gods word is so good a work that we shall be well rewarded if we suffer for that or to this purposebut as for my friend i think he was more afraid of me than of himself  after this i walked into the close where i somewhat seriously considering the matter this came into my mind that i had showed myself hearty and courageous in my preaching and had blessed be grace made it my business to encourage others therefore thought i if i should now run and make an escape it will be of a very ill savour in the country  for what will my weak and newly converted brethren think of it but that i was not so strong in deed as i was in word  also i feared that if i should run now there was a warrant out for me i might by so doing make them afraid to stand when great words only should be spoken to them besides i thought that seeing god of his mercy should choose me to go upon the forlorn hope in this country that is to be the first that should be opposed for the gospel if i should fly it might be a discouragement to the whole body that might follow after  and further i thought the world thereby would take occasion at my cowardliness to have blasphemed the gospel and to have had some ground to suspect worse of me and my profession than i deserved these things with others considered by me i came in again to the house with a full resolution to keep the meeting and not to go away though i could have been gone about an hour before the officer apprehended me but i would not for i was resolved to see the utmost of what they could say or do unto me  for blessed be the lord i knew of no evil that i had said or done  and so as aforesaid i begun the meeting  but being prevented by the constables coming in with his warrant to take me i could not proceed  but before i went away i spake some few words of counsel and encouragement to the people declaring to them that they saw we were prevented of our opportunity to speak and hear the word of god and were like to suffer for the same desiring them that they would not be discouraged for it was a mercy to suffer upon so good account  for we might have been apprehended as thieves or murderers or for other wickedness but blessed be god it was not so but we suffer as christians for well doing  and we had better be the persecuted than the persecutors etc  but the constable and the justices man waiting on us would not be at quiet till they had me away and that we departed the house  but because the justice was not at home that day there was a friend of mine engaged for me to bring me to the constable on the morrow morning otherwise the constable must have charged a watch with me or have secured me some other way my crime was so great  so on the next morning we went to the constable and so to the justice  he asked the constable what we did where we was met together and what we had with us  i trow he meant whether we had armour or not but when the constable told him that there were only met a few of us together to preach and hear the word and no sign of anything else he could not well tell what to say  yet because he had sent for me he did adventure to put out a few proposals to me which were to this effect namely what i did there  and why i did not content myself with following my calling for it was against the law that such as i should be admitted to do as i did  john bunyan  to which i answered that the intent of my coming thither and to other places was to instruct and counsel people to forsake their sins and close in with christ lest they did miserably perish and that i could do both these without confusion to wit follow my calling and preach the word also  at which words he was in a chafe as it appeared for he said that he would break the neck of our meetings  bun  i said it may be so  then he wished me to get sureties to be bound for me or else he would send me to the jail  my sureties being ready i called them in and when the bond for my appearance was made he told them that they was bound to keep me from preaching and that if i did preach their bonds would be forfeited  to which i answered that then i should break them for i should not leave speaking the word of god  even to counsel comfort exhort and teach the people among whom i came and i thought this to be a work that had no hurt in it  but was rather worthy of commendation than blame  wingate  whereat he told me that if they would not be so bound my mittimus must be made and i sent to the jail there to lie to the quarter sessions  now while my mittimus was making the justice was withdrawn and in comes an old enemy to the truth dr lindale who when he was come in fell to taunting at me with many reviling terms  bun  to whom i answered that i did not come thither to talk with him but with the justice  whereat he supposed that i had nothing to say for myself and triumphed as if he had got the victory charging and condemning me for meddling with that for which i could show no warrant and asked me if i had taken the oaths and if i had not it was pity but that i should be sent to prison etc  i told him that if i was minded i could answer to any sober question that he should put to me  he then urged me again how i could prove it lawful for me to preach with a great deal of confidence of the victory  but at last because he should see that i could answer him if i listed i cited to him that verse in peter which saith every man hath received the gift even so let him minister the same etc  lind  aye saith he to whom is that spoken  bun  to whom said i why to every man that hath received a gift from god  mark saith the apostle as every man that hath received a gift from god etc and again you may all prophesy one by one whereat the man was a little stopt and went a softlier pace  but not being willing to lose the day he began again and said  lind  indeed i do remember that i have read of one alexander a coppersmith who did much oppose and disturb the apostles aiming it is like at me because i was a tinker  bun  to which i answered that i also had read of very many priests and pharisees that had their hands in the blood of our lord jesus christ  lind  aye saith he and you are one of those scribes and pharisees  for you with a pretence make long prayers to devour widows houses  bun  i answered that if he had got no more by preaching and praying than i had done he would not be so rich as now he was but that scripture coming into my mind answer not a fool according to his folly i was as sparing of my speech as i could without prejudice to truth  now by this time my mittimus was made and i committed to the constable to be sent to the jail in bedford etc  but as i was going two of my brethren met with me by the way and desired the constable to stay supposing that they should prevail with the justice through the favour of a pretended friend to let me go at liberty  so we did stay while they went to the justice and after much discourse with him it came to this  that if i would come to him again and say some certain words to him i should be released  which when they told me i said if the words was such that might be said with a good conscience i should or else i should not  so through their importunity went back again but not believing that i should be delivered  for i feared their spirit was too full of opposition to the truth to let me go unless i should in something or other dishonour my god and wound my conscience  wherefore as i went i lifted up my heart to god for light and strength to be kept that i might not do any thing that might either dishonour him or wrong my own soul or be a grief or discouragement to any that was inclining after the lord jesus christ  well when i came to the justice again there was mr foster of bedford who coming out of another room and seeing me by the light of the candle for it was dark night when i went thither he said unto me who is there john bunyan with such seeming affection as if he would have leaped on my neck and kissed me which made me somewhat wonder that such a man as he with whom i had so little acquaintance and besides that had ever been a close opposer of the ways of god should carry himself so full of love to me but afterwards when i saw what he did it caused me to remember those sayings their tongues are smoother than oil but their words are drawn swords   and again beware of men etc when i had answered him that blessed be god i was well he said what is the occasion of your being here or to that purpose  to whom i answered that i was at a meeting of people a little way off intending to speak a word of exhortation to them the justice hearing thereof said i was pleased to send his warrant to fetch me before him etc  fost  so said he i understand  but well if you will promise to call the people no more together you shall have your liberty to go home for my brother is very loath to send you to prison if you will be but ruled  bun  sir said i pray what do you mean by calling the people together my business is not anything among them when they are come together but to exhort them to look after the salvation of their souls that they may be saved etc  fost  saith he we must not enter into explication or dispute now but if you will say you will call the people no more together you may have your liberty if not you must be sent away to prison  bun  sir said i i shall not force or compel any man to hear me but yet if i come into any place where there is a people met together i should according to the best of my skill and wisdom exhort and counsel them to seek out after the lord jesus christ for the salvation of their souls  fost  he said that was none of my work i must follow my calling and if i would but leave off preaching and follow my calling i should have the justices favour and be acquitted presently  bun  to whom i said that i could follow my calling and that too namely preaching the word  and i did look upon it as my duty to do them both as i had an opportunity  fost  he said to have any such meetings was against the law and therefore he would have me leave off and say i would call the people no more together  bun  to whom i said that i durst not make any further promise for my conscience would not suffer me to do it  and again i did look upon it as my duty to do as much good as i could not only in my trade but also in communicating to all people wheresoever i came the best knowledge i had in the word  fost  he told me that i was the nearest the papists of any and that he would convince me of immediately  bun  i asked him wherein  fost  he said in that we understood the scriptures literally  bun  i told him that those that were to be understood literally we understood them so but for those that was to be understood otherwise we endeavoured so to understand them  fost  he said which of the scriptures do you understand literally  bun  i said this he that believes shall be saved  this was to be understood just as it is spoken that whosoever believeth in christ shall according to the plain and simple words of the text be saved  fost  he said that i was ignorant and did not understand the scriptures for how said he can you understand them when you know not the original greek etc  bun  to whom i said that if that was his opinion that none could understand the scriptures but those that had the original greek etc then but a very few of the poorest sort should be saved this is harsh yet the scripture saith that god hides these things from the wise and prudent that is from the learned of the world and reveals them to babes and sucklings  fost  he said there were none that heard me but a company of foolish people  bun  i told him that there was the wise as well as the foolish that do hear me and again those that were most commonly counted foolish by the world are the wisest before god also that god had rejected the wise and mighty and noble and chosen the foolish and the base  fost  he told me that i made people neglect their calling and that god had commanded people to work six days and serve him on the seventh  bun  i told him that it was the duty of people both rich and poor to look out for their souls on them days as well as for their bodies and that god would have his people exhort one another daily while it is called today  fost  he said again that there were none but a company of poor simple ignorant people that come to hear me  bun  i told him that the foolish and the ignorant had most need of teaching and information and therefore it would be profitable for me to go on in that work  fost  well said he to conclude but will you promise that you will not call the people together any more and then you may be released and go home  bun  i told him that i durst say no more than i had said for i durst not leave off that work which god had called me to  so he withdrew from me and then came several of the justices servants to me and told me that i stood so much upon a nicety their master they said was willing to let me go and if i would but say i would call the people no more together i might have my liberty etc  bun  i told them there were more ways than one in which a man might be said to call the people together  as for instance if a man get upon the marketplace and there read a book or the like though he do not say to the people sirs come hither and hear yet if they come to him because he reads he by his very reading may be said to call them together because they would not have been there to hear if he had not been there to read  and seeing this might be termed a calling the people together i durst not say i would not call them together for then by the same argument my preaching might be said to call them together  wing and fost  then came the justice and mr foster to me again we had a little more discourse about preaching but because the method of it is out of my mind i pass it and when they saw that i was at a point and would not be moved nor persuaded mr foster the man that did at first express so much love to me told the justice that then he must send me away to prison  and that he would do well also if he would present all those that were the cause of my coming among them to meetings  thus we parted  and verily as i was going forth of the doors i had much ado to forbear saying to them that i carried the peace of god along with me but i held my peace and blessed be the lord went away to prison with gods comfort in my poor soul  after i had lain in the jail five or six days the brethren sought means again to get me out by bondsmen for so ran my mittimus that i should lie there till i could find sureties  they went to a justice at elstow one mr crumpton to desire him to take bond for my appearing at the quarter sessions  at the first he told them he would but afterwards he made a demur at the business and desired first to see my mittimus which ran to this purpose  that i went about to several conventicles in the county to the great disparagement of the government of the church of england etc when he had seen it he said that there might be something more against me than was expressed in my mittimus and that he was but a young man therefore he durst not do it  this my jailor told me and whereat i was not at all daunted but rather glad and saw evidently that the lord had heard me for before i went down to the justice i begged of god that if i might do more good by being at liberty than in prison that then i might be set at liberty but if not his will be done for i was not altogether without hopes but that my imprisonment might be an awakening to the saints in the country therefore i could not tell well which to choose only i in that manner did commit the thing to god  and verily at my return i did meet my god sweetly in the prison again comforting of me and satisfying of me that it was his will and mind that i should be there  when i came back again to prison as i was musing at the slender answer of the justice this word dropt in upon my heart with some life for he knew that for envy they had delivered him  thus have i in short declared the manner and occasion of my being in prison where i lie waiting the good will of god to do with me as he pleaseth knowing that not one hair of my head can fall to the ground without the will of my father which is in heaven  let the rage and malice of men be never so great they can do no more nor go any further than god permits them but when they have done their worst we know all things shall work together for good to them that love god  farewell    here is the sum of my examination before justice keelin justice chester justice blundale justice beecher justice snagg etc    after i had lain in prison above seven weeks the quartersessions were to be kept in bedford for the county thereof unto which i was to be brought and when my jailor had set me before those justices there was a bill of indictment preferred against me  the extent thereof was as followeth  that john bunyan of the town of bedford labourer being a person of such and such conditions he hath since such a time devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church to hear divine service and is a common upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom contrary to the laws of our sovereign lord the king etc  the clerk  when this was read the clerk of the sessions said unto me what say you to this  bun  i said that as to the first part of it i was a common frequenter of the church of god  and was also by grace a member with the people over whom christ is the head  keelin  but saith justice keelin who was the judge in that court do you come to church you know what i mean to the parish church to hear divine service  bun  i answered no i did not  keel  he asked me why  bun  i said because i did not find it commanded in the word of god  keel  he said we were commanded to pray  bun  i said but not by the common prayerbook  keel  he said how then  bun  i said with the spirit  as the apostle saith i will pray with the spirit and with the understanding  1 cor xiv 15  keel  he said we might pray with the spirit and with the understanding and with the common prayerbook also  bun  i said that the prayers in the common prayerbook were such as was made by other men and not by the motions of the holy ghost within our hearts and as i said the apostle saith he will pray with the spirit and with the understanding not with the spirit and the common prayerbook  another justice  what do you count prayer  do you think it is to say a few words over before or among a people  bun  i said no not so for men might have many elegant or excellent words and yet not pray at all but when a man prayeth he doth through a sense of those things which he wants which sense is begotten by the spirit pour out his heart before god through christ though his words be not so many and so excellent as others are  justices  they said that was true  bun  i said this might be done without the common prayerbook  another  one of them said i think it was justice blundale or justice snagg how should we know that you do not write out your prayers first and then read them afterwards to the people  this he spake in a laughing way  bun  i said it is not our use to take a pen and paper and write a few words thereon and then go and read it over to a company of people  but how should we know it said he  bun  sir it is none of our custom said i  keel  but said justice keelin it is lawful to use the common prayer and such like forms  for christ taught his disciples to pray as john also taught his disciples  and further said he cannot one man teach another to pray  faith comes by hearing and one man may convince another of sin and therefore prayers made by men and read over are good to teach and help men to pray  while he was speaking these words god brought that word into my mind in the eighth of the romans at the 26th verse  i say god brought it for i thought not on it before  but as he was speaking it came so fresh into my mind and was set so evidently before me as if the scripture had said take me take me so when he had done speaking  bun  i said sir the scripture saith that it is the spirit that helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought  but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with sighs and groanings which cannot be uttered  mark said i it doth not say the common prayerbook teacheth us how to pray but the spirit  and it is the spirit that helpeth our infirmities saith the apostle he doth not say it is the common prayerbook  and as to the lords prayer although it be an easy thing to say our father etc with the mouth yet there is very few that can in the spirit say the two first words in that prayer that is that can call god their father as knowing what it is to be born again and as having experience that they are begotten of the spirit of god  which if they do not all is but babbling etc  keel  justice keelin said that that was a truth  bun  and i say further as to your saying that one man may convince another of sin and that faith comes by hearing and that one man may tell another how he should pray etc i say men may tell each other of their sins but it is the spirit that must convince them  and though it be said that faith comes by hearing  yet it is the spirit that worketh faith in the heart through hearing or else they are not profited by hearing  heb iv 12  and that though one man may tell another how he should pray  yet as i said before he cannot pray nor make his condition known to god except the spirit help  it is not the common prayerbook that can do this  it is the spirit that showeth us our sins and the spirit that showeth us a saviour jn xvi 16 and the spirit that stirreth up in our hearts desires to come to god for such things as we stand in need of matt xi 27 even sighing out our souls unto him for them with groans which cannot be uttered  with other words to the same purpose  at this they were set  keel  but says justice keelin what have you against the common prayerbook  bun  i said sir if you will hear me i shall lay down my reasons against it  keel  he said i should have liberty but first said he let me give you one caution take heed of speaking irreverently of the common prayerbook for if you do so you will bring great damage upon yourself  bun  so i proceeded and said my first reason was because it was not commanded in the word of god and therefore i could not use it  another  one of them said where do you find it commanded in the scripture that you should go to elstow or bedford and yet it is lawful to go to either of them is it not  bun  i said to go to elstow or bedford was a civil thing and not material though not commanded and yet gods word allowed me to go about my calling and therefore if it lay there then to go thither etc  but to pray was a great part of the divine worship of god and therefore it ought to be done according to the rule of gods word   another  one of them said he will do harm let him speak no further  keel  justice keelin said no no never fear him we are better established than so he can do no harm we know the common prayer book hath been ever since the apostles time and it is lawful for it to be used in the church  bun  i said show me the place in the epistles where the common prayerbook is written or one text of scripture that commands me to read it and i will use it  but yet notwithstanding said i they that have a mind to use it they have their liberty that is i would not keep them from it but for our parts we can pray to god without it  blessed be his name  with that one of them said who is your god  beelzebub moreover they often said that i was possessed with the spirit of delusion and of the devil  all which sayings i passed over the lord forgive them  and further i said blessed be the lord for it we are encouraged to meet together and to pray and exhort one another for we have had the comfortable presence of god among us for ever blessed be his holy name  keel  justice keelin called this pedlers french saying that i must leave off my canting  the lord open his eyes  bun  i said that we ought to exhort one another daily while it is called today etc  keel  justice keelin said that i ought not to preach and asked me where i had my authority with other such like words  bun  i said that i would prove that it was lawful for me and such as i am to preach the word of god  keel  he said unto me by what scripture  bun  i said by that in the first epistle of peter chap iv 10 11 and acts xviii with other scriptures which he would not suffer me to mention  but said hold not so many which is the first  bun  i said this  as every man hath received the gift even so let him minister the same unto another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god  if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god etc  keel  he said let me a little open that scripture to you  as every man hath received the gift that is said he as every one hath received a trade so let him follow it  if any man have received a gift of tinkering as thou hast done let him follow his tinkering  and so other men their trades  and the divine his calling etc  bun  nay sir said i but it is most clear that the apostle speaks here of preaching the word if you do but compare both the verses together the next verse explains this gift what it is saying if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god  so that it is plain that the holy ghost doth not so much in this place exhort to civil callings as to the exercising of those gifts that we have received from god  i would have gone on but he would not give me leave  keel  he said we might do it in our families but not otherways  bun  i said if it was lawful to do good to some it was lawful to do good to more  if it was a good duty to exhort our families it was good to exhort others but if they held it a sin to meet together to seek the face of god and exhort one another to follow christ i should sin still for so we should do  keel  he said he was not so well versed in scripture as to dispute or words to that purpose  and said moreover that they could not wait upon me any longer but said to me then you confess the indictment do you not  now and not till now i saw i was indicted  bun  i said this i confess we have had many meetings together both to pray to god and to exhort one another and that we had the sweet comforting presence of the lord among us for our encouragement blessed be his name therefore  i confessed myself guilty no otherwise  keel  then said he bear your judgment  you must be had back again to prison and there lie for three months following and at three months end if you do not submit to go to church to hear divine service and leave your preaching you must be banished the realm  and if after such a day as shall be appointed you to be gone you shall be found in this realm etc or be found to come over again without special licence from the king etc you must stretch by the neck for it i tell you plainly  and so he bid my jailor have me away  bun  i told him as to this matter i was at a point with him for if i were out of prison today i would preach the gospel again to morrow by the help of god  another  to which one made me some answer  but my jailor pulling me away to be gone i could not tell what he said  thus i departed from them and i can truly say i bless the lord jesus christ for it that my heart was sweetly refreshed in the time of my examination and also afterwards at my returning to the prison  so that i found christs words more than bare trifles where he saith i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist  luke xxi 15  and that his peace no man can take from us  thus have i given you the substance of my examination  the lord make this profitable to all that shall read or hear it  farewell    the substance of some discourse had between the clerk of the peace and myself when he came to admonish me according to the tenor of that law by which i was in prison    when i had lain in prison other twelve weeks and now not knowing what they intended to do with me upon the third of april 1661 comes mr cobb unto me as he told me being sent by the justices to admonish me and demand of me submittance to the church of england etc  the extent of our discourse was as followeth  cobb  when he was come into the house he sent for me out of my chamber who when i was come unto him he said neighbour bunyan how do you do  bun  i thank you sir said i very well blessed be the lord  cobb  saith he i come to tell you that it is desired you would submit yourself to the laws of the land or else at the next sessions it will go worse with you even to be sent away out of the nation or else worse than that  bun  i said that i did desire to demean myself in the world both as becometh a man and a christian  cobb  but saith he you must submit to the laws of the land and leave off those meetings which you was wont to have for the statutelaw is directly against it and i am sent to you by the justices to tell you that they do intend to prosecute the law against you if you submit not  bun  i said sir i conceive that that law by which i am in prison at this time doth not reach or condemn either me or the meetings which i do frequent that law was made against those that being designed to do evil in their meetings making the exercise of religion their pretence to cover their wickedness  it doth not forbid the private meetings of those that plainly and simply make it their only end to worship the lord and to exhort one another to edification  my end in meeting with others is simply to do as much good as i can by exhortation and counsel according to that small measure of light which god hath given me and not to disturb the peace of the nation  cobb  every one will say the same said he you see the late insurrection at london under what glorious pretences they went and yet indeed they intended no less than the ruin of the kingdom and commonwealth  bun  that practice of theirs i abhor said i yet it doth not follow that because they did so therefore all others will do so i look upon it as my duty to behave myself under the kings government both as becomes a man and a christian and if an occasion were offered me i should willingly manifest my loyalty to my prince both by word and deed  cobb  well said he i do not profess myself to be a man that can dispute but this i say truly neighbour bunyan i would have you consider this matter seriously and submit yourself you may have your liberty to exhort your neighbour in private discourse so be you do not call together an assembly of people and truly you may do much good to the church of christ if you would go this way and this you may do and the law not abridge you of it  it is your private meetings that the law is against  bun  sir said i if i may do good to one by my discourse why may i not do good to two  and if to two why not to four and so to eight etc  cobb  ay saith he and to a hundred i warrant you  bun  yes sir said i i think i should not be forbid to do as much good as i can  cobb  but saith he you may but pretend to do good and instead notwithstanding do harm by seducing the people you are therefore denied your meeting so many together lest you should do harm  bun  and yet said i you say the law tolerates me to discourse with my neighbour surely there is no law tolerates me seduce any one therefore if i may by the law discourse with one surely it is to do him good and if i by discoursing may do good to one surely by the same law i may do good to many  cobb  the law saith he doth expressly forbid your private meetings therefore they are not to be tolerated  bun  i told him that i would not entertain so much uncharitableness of that parliament in the 35th of elizabeth or of the queen herself as to think they did by that law intend the oppressing of any of gods ordinances or the interrupting any in way of god but men may in the wresting of it turn it against the way of god but take the law in itself and it only fighteth against those that drive at mischief in their hearts and meeting making religion only their cloak colour or pretence for so are the words of the statute  if any meetings under colour or pretence of religion etc  cobb  very good therefore the king seeing that pretences are usually in and among people so as to make religion their pretence only therefore he and the law before him doth forbid such private meetings and tolerates only public you may meet in public  bun  sir said i let me answer you in a similitude  set the case that at such a wood corner there did usually come forth thieves to do mischief must there therefore a law be made that every one that cometh out there shall be killed  may not there come out true men as well as thieves out from thence  just thus is it in this case i do think there may be many that may design the destruction of the commonwealth but it doth not follow therefore that all private meetings are unlawful those that transgress let them be punished  and if at any time i myself should do any act in my conversation as doth not become a man and christian let me bear the punishment  and as for your saying i may meet in public if i may be suffered i would gladly do it  let me have but meeting enough in public and i shall care the less to have them in private  i do not meet in private because i am afraid to have meetings in public  i bless the lord that my heart is at that point that if any man can lay any thing to my charge either in doctrine or in practice in this particular that can be proved error or heresy i am willing to disown it even in the very marketplace but if it be truth then to stand to it to the last drop of my blood  and sir said i you ought to commend me for so doing  to err and to be a heretic are two things i am no heretic because i will not stand refractorily to defend any one thing that is contrary to the word  prove any thing which i hold to be an error and i will recant it  cobb  but goodman bunyan said he methinks you need not stand so strictly upon this one thing as to have meetings of such public assemblies  cannot you submit and notwithstanding do as much good as you can in a neighbourly way without having such meetings  bun  truly sir said i i do not desire to commend myself but to think meanly of myself yet when i do most despise myself taking notice of that small measure of light which god hath given me also that the people of the lord by their own saying are edified thereby  besides when i see that the lord through grace hath in some measure blessed my labour i dare not but exercise that gift which god hath given me for the good of the people  and i said further that i would willingly speak in public if i might  cobb  he said that i might come to the public assemblies and hear  what though you do not preach you may hear  do not think yourself so well enlightened and that you have received a gift so far above others but that you may hear other men preach  or to that purpose  bun  i told him i was as willing to be taught as to give instruction and i looked upon it as my duty to do both for said i a man that is a teacher he himself may learn also from another that teacheth as the apostle saith we may all prophesy one by one that all may learn  1 cor xiv 31  that is every man that hath received a gift from god he may dispense it that others may be comforted and when he hath done he may hear and learn and be comforted himself of others  cobb  but said he what if you should forbear awhile and sit still till you see further how things will go  bun  sir said i wickliffe saith that he which leaveth off preaching and hearing of the word of god for fear of excommunication of men he is already excommunicated of god and shall in the day of judgment be counted a traitor to christ  cobb  ay saith he they that do not hear shall be so counted indeed do you therefore hear  bun  but sir said i he saith he that shall leave off either preaching or hearing etc  that is if he hath received a gift for edification it is his sin if he doth not lay it out in a way of exhortation and counsel according to the proportion of his gift as well as to spend his time altogether in hearing others preach  cobb  but said he how shall we know that you have received a gift  bun  said i let any man hear and search and prove the doctrine by the bible  cobb  but will you be willing said he that two indifferent persons shall determine the case and will you stand by their judgment  bun  i said are they infallible  cobb  he said no  bun  then said i it is possible my judgment may be as good as theirs  but yet i will pass by either and in this matter be judged by the scriptures i am sure that is infallible and cannot err  cobb  but said he who shall be judge between you for you take the scriptures one way and they another  bun  i said the scripture should  and that by comparing one scripture with another for that will open itself if it be rightly compared  as for instance if under the different apprehensions of the word mediator you would know the truth of it the scriptures open it and tell us that he that is a mediator must take up the business between two and a mediator is not a mediator of onebut god is one and there is one mediator between god and men even the man christ jesus  gal iii 20 1 tim ii 5  so likewise the scripture calleth christ a complete or perfect or able high priest  that is opened in that he is called man and also god his blood also is discovered to be effectually efficacious by the same things  so the scripture as touching the matter of meeting together etc doth likewise sufficiently open itself and discover its meaning  cobb  but are you willing said he to stand to the judgment of the church  bun  yes sir said i to the approbation of the church of god the churchs judgment is best expressed in scripture  we had much other discourse which i cannot well remember about the laws of the nation and submission to governments to which i did tell him that i did look upon myself as bound in conscience to walk according to all righteous laws and that whether there was a king or no and if i did any thing that was contrary i did hold it my duty to bear patiently the penalty of the law that was provided against such offenders with many more words to the like effect and said moreover that to cut off all occasions of suspicion from any as touching the harmlessness of my doctrine in private i would willingly take the pains to give any one the notes of all my sermons for i do sincerely desire to live quietly in my country and to submit to the present authority  cobb  well neighbour bunyan said he but indeed i would wish you seriously to consider of these things between this and the quartersessions and to submit yourself  you may do much good if you continue still in the land but alas what benefit will it be to your friends or what good can you do to them if you should be sent away beyond the seas into spain or constantinople or some other remote part of the world  pray be ruled  jailor  indeed sir i hope he will be ruled  bun  i shall desire said i in all honesty to behave myself in the nation whilst i am in it  and if i must be so dealt withal as you say i hope god will help me to bear what they shall lay upon me  i know no evil that i have done in this matter to be so used  i speak as in the presence of god  cobb  you know saith he that the scripture saith the powers that be are ordained of god  bun  i said yes and that i was to submit to the king as supreme and also to the governors as to them who are sent by him  cobb  well then said he the king then commands you that you should not have any private meetings because it is against his law and he is ordained of god therefore you should not have any  bun  i told him that paul did own the powers that were in his day to be of god and yet he was often in prison under them for all that  and also though jesus christ told pilate that he had no power against him but of god yet he died under the same pilate and yet said i i hope you will not say that either paul or christ were such as did deny magistracy and so sinned against god in slighting the ordinance  sir said i the law hath provided two ways of obeying  the one to do that which i in my conscience do believe that i am bound to do actively and where i cannot obey actively there i am willing to lie down and to suffer what they shall do unto me  at this he sat still and said no more which when he had done i did thank him for his civil and meek discoursing with me and so we parted  o that we might meet in heaven  farewell  j b    here followeth a discourse between my wife and the judges with others touching my deliverance at the assizes following the which i took from her own mouth    after that i had received this sentence of banishing or hanging from them and after the former admonition touching the determination of the justices if i did not recant just when the time drew nigh in which i should have abjured or have done worse as mr cobb told me came the time in which the king was to be crowned  now at the coronation of kings there is usually a releasement of divers prisoners by virtue of his coronation in which privilege also i should have had my share but that they took me for a convicted person and therefore unless i sued out a pardon as they called it i could have no benefit thereby notwithstanding yet forasmuch as the coronation proclamation did give liberty from the day the king was crowned to that day twelvemonth to sue them out therefore though they would not let me out of prison as they let out thousands yet they could not meddle with me as touching the execution of their sentence because of the liberty offered for the suing out of pardons whereupon i continued in prison till the next assizes which are called midsummer assizes being then kept in august 1661  now at that assizes because i would not leave any possible means unattempted that might be lawful i did by my wife present a petition to the judges three times that i might be heard and that they would impartially take my case into consideration  the first time my wife went she presented it to judge hale who very mildly received it at her hand telling her that he would do her and me the best good he could but he feared he said he could do none  the next day again lest they should through the multitude of business forget me we did throw another petition into the coach to judge twisdon who when he had seen it snapt her up and angrily told her that i was a convicted person and could not be released unless i would promise to preach no more etc  well after this she yet again presented another to judge hale as he sat on the bench who as it seemed was willing to give her audience  only justice chester being present stept up and said that i was convicted in the court and that i was a hotspirited fellow or words to that purpose whereat he waived it and did not meddle therewith  but yet my wife being encouraged by the highsheriff did venture once more into their presence as the poor widow did before the unjust judge to try what she could do with them for my liberty before they went forth of the town  the place where she went to them was to the swanchamber where the two judges and many justices and gentry of the country was in company together  she then coming into the chamber with a bashed face and a trembling heart began her errand to them in this manner  woman  my lord directing herself to judge hale i make bold to come once again to your lordship to know what may be done with my husband  judge hale  to whom he said woman i told thee before i could do thee no good because they have taken that for a conviction which thy husband spoke at the sessions  and unless there be something done to undo that i can do thee no good  woman  my lord said she he is kept unlawfully in prison they clapped him up before there was any proclamation against the meetings the indictment also is false  besides they never asked him whether he was guilty or no neither did he confess the indictment  one of the justices  then one of the justices that stood by whom she knew not said my lord he was lawfully convicted  wom  it is false said she for when they said to him do you confess the indictment he said only this that he had been at several meetings both where there were preaching the word and prayer and that they had gods presence among them  judge twisdon  whereat judge twisdon answered very angrily saying what you think we can do what we list your husband is a breaker of the peace and is convicted by the law etc  whereupon judge hale called for the statute book  wom  but said she my lord he was not lawfully convicted  chester  then justice chester said my lord he was lawfully convicted  wom  it is false said she it was but a word of discourse that they took for a conviction as you heard before  chest  but it is recorded woman it is recorded said justice chester as if it must be of necessity true because it was recorded  with which words he often endeavoured to stop her mouth having no other argument to convince her but it is recorded it is recorded  wom  my lord said she i was a while since at london to see if i could get my husbands liberty and there i spoke with my lord barkwood one of the house of lords to whom i delivered a petition who took it of me and presented it to some of the rest of the house of lords for my husbands releasement who when they had seen it they said that they could not release him but had committed his releasement to the judges at the next assizes  this he told me and now i am come to you to see if any thing may be done in this business and you give neither releasement nor relief to which they gave her no answer but made as if they heard her not  chest  only justice chester was often up with thishe is convicted and it is recorded  wom  if it be it is false said she  chest  my lord said justice chester he is a pestilent fellow there is not such a fellow in the country again  twis  what will your husband leave preaching  if he will do so then send for him  wom  my lord said she he dares not leave preaching as long as he can speak  twis  see here what should we talk any more about such a fellow must he do what he lists  he is a breaker of the peace  wom  she told him again that he desired to live peaceably and to follow his calling that his family might be maintained and moreover said my lord i have four small children that cannot help themselves one of which is blind and have nothing to live upon but the charity of good people  hale  hast thou four children said judge hale thou art but a young woman to have four children  wom  my lord said she i am but motherinlaw to them having not been married to him yet full two years  indeed i was with child when my husband was first apprehended but being young and unaccustomed to such things said she i being smayed at the news fell into labour and so continued for eight days and then was delivered but my child died  hale  whereat he looking very soberly on the matter said alas poor woman  twis  but judge twisdon told her that she made poverty her cloak and said moreover that he understood i was maintained better by running up and down a preaching than by following my calling  hale  what is his calling said judge hale  answer  then some of the company that stood by said a tinker my lord  wom  yes said she and because he is a tinker and a poor man therefore he is despised and cannot have justice  hale  then judge hale answered very mildly saying i tell thee woman seeing it is so that they have taken what thy husband spake for a conviction thou must either apply thyself to the king or sue out his pardon or get a writ of error  chest  but when justice chester heard him give her this counsel and especially as she supposed because he spoke of a writ of error he chafed and seemed to be very much offended saying my lord he will preach and do what he lists  wom  he preacheth nothing but the word of god said she  twis  he preach the word of god said twisdon and withal she thought he would have struck her he runneth up and down and doth harm  wom  no my lord said she it is not so god hath owned him and done much good by him  twis  god said he his doctrine is the doctrine of the devil  wom  my lord said she when the righteous judge shall appear it will be known that his doctrine is not the doctrine of the devil  twis  my lord said he to judge hale do not mind her but send her away  hale  then said judge hale i am sorry woman that i can do thee no good thou must do one of those three things aforesaid namely either to apply thyself to the king or sue out his pardon or get a writ of error but a writ of error will be cheapest  wom  at which chester again seemed to be in a chafe and put off his hat and as she thought scratched his head for anger  but when i saw said she that there was no prevailing to have my husband sent for though i often desired them that they would send for him that he might speak for himself telling them that he could give them better satisfaction than i could in what they demanded of him with several other things which now i forget only this i remember that though i was somewhat timorous at my first entrance into the chamber yet before i went out i could not but break forth into tears not so much because they were so hard hearted against me and my husband but to think what a sad account such poor creatures will have to give at the coming of the lord when they shall there answer for all things whatsoever they have done in the body whether it be good or whether it be bad  so when i departed from them the book of statutes was brought but what they said of it i know nothing at all neither did i hear any more from them    some carriages of the adversaries of gods truth with me at the next assizes which was on the 19th of the first month 1662    i shall pass by what befell between these two assizes how i had by my jailor some liberty granted me more than at the first and how i followed my wonted course of preaching taking all occasions that were put into my hand to visit the people of god exhorting them to be steadfast in the faith of jesus christ and to take heed that they touched not the common prayer etc but to mind the word of god which giveth direction to christians in every point being able to make the man of god perfect in all things through faith in jesus christ and thoroughly to furnish him unto all good works  2 tim iii 17  also how i having i say somewhat more liberty did go to see the christians at london which my enemies hearing of were so angry that they had almost cast my jailor out of his place threatening to indict him and to do what they could against him  they charged me also that i went thither to plot and raise division and make insurrection which god knows was a slander whereupon my liberty was more straitened than it was before so that i must not now look out of the door  well when the next sessions came which was about the 10th of the 11th month 1661 i did expect to have been very roundly dealt withal but they passed me by and would not call me so that i rested till the assizes which was held the 19th of the first month 1662 following and when they came because i had a desire to come before the judge i desired my jailor to put my name into the calendar among the felons and made friends of the judge and highsheriff who promised that i should be called  so that i thought what i had done might have been effectual for the obtaining of my desire  but all was in vain for when the assizes came though my name was in the calendar and also though both the judge and sheriff had promised that i should appear before them yet the justices and the clerk of the peace did so work it about that i notwithstanding was deferred and was not suffered to appear  and although i say i do not know of all their carriages towards me yet this i know that the clerk of the peace mr cobb did discover himself to be one of my greatest opposers  for first he came to my jailor and told him that i must not go down before the judge and therefore must not be put into the calendar to whom my jailor said that my name was in already  he bid him put it out again my jailor told him that he could not  for he had given the judge a calendar with my name in it and also the sheriff another  at which he was very much displeased and desired to see that calendar that was yet in my jailors hand who when he had given it him he looked on it and said it was a false calendar he also took the calendar and blotted out my accusation as my jailor had written it which accusation i cannot tell what it was because it was so blotted out and he himself put in words to this purpose  that john bunyan was committed to prison being lawfully convicted for upholding of unlawful meetings and conventicles etc  but yet for all this fearing that what he had done unless he added thereto it would not do he first ran to the clerk of the assizes then to the justices and afterwards because he would not leave any means unattempted to hinder me he came again to my jailor and told him that if i did go down before the judge and was released he would make him pay my fees which he said was due to him and further told him that he would complain of him at the next quarter sessions for making of false calendars though my jailor himself as i afterwards learned had put in my accusation worse than in itself it was by far  and thus was i hindered and prevented at that time also from appearing before the judge  and left in prison  farewell  john bunyan    a continuation of mr bunyans life beginning where he left off and concluding with the time and manner of his death and burial together with his true character etc    reader the painful and industrious author of this book has already given you a faithful and very moving relation of the beginning and middle of the days of his pilgrimage on earth and since there yet remains somewhat worthy of notice and regard which occurred in the last scene of his life the which for want of time or fear some overcensorious people should impute it to him as an earnest coveting of praise from men he has not left behind him in writing  wherefore as a true friend and long acquaintance of mr bunyans that his good end may be known as well as his evil beginning i have taken upon me from my knowledge and the best account given by other of his friends to piece this to the thread too soon broke off and so lengthen it out to his entering upon eternity  he has told you at large of his birth and education the evil habits and corruptions of his youth the temptations he struggled and conflicted so frequently with the mercies comforts and deliverances he found how he came to take upon him the preaching of the gospel the slanders reproaches and imprisonments that attended him and the progress he notwithstanding made by the assistance of gods grace no doubt to the saving of many souls therefore take these things as he himself hath methodically laid them down in the words of verity and so i pass on to what remains  after his being freed from his twelve years imprisonment and upwards for nonconformity wherein he had time to furnish the world with sundry good books etc and by his patience to move dr barlow the then bishop of lincoln and other churchmen to pity his hard and unreasonable sufferings so far as to stand very much his friends in procuring his enlargement or there perhaps he had died by the noisomeness and ill usage of the place  being now i say again at liberty and having through mercy shaken off his bodily fettersfor those upon his soul were broken before by the abounding grace that filled his hearthe went to visit those that had been a comfort to him in his tribulation with a christianlike acknowledgment of their kindness and enlargement of charity giving encouragement by his example if it happened to be their hard haps to fall into affliction or trouble then to suffer patiently for the sake of a good conscience and for the love of god in jesus christ towards their souls and by many cordial persuasions supported some whose spirits began to sink low through the fear of danger that threatened their worldly concernment so that the people found a wonderful consolation in his discourse and admonitions  as often as opportunity would admit he gathered them together though the law was then in force against meetings in convenient places and fed them with the sincere milk of the word that they might grow up in grace thereby  to such as were anywhere taken and imprisoned upon these accounts he made it another part of his business to extend his charity and gather relief for such of them as wanted  he took great care to visit the sick and strengthen them against the suggestions of the tempter which at such times are very prevalent so that they had cause for ever to bless god who had put it into his heart at such a time to rescue them from the power of the roaring lion who sought to devour them nor did he spare any pains or labour in travel though to remote counties where he knew or imagined any people might stand in need of his assistance insomuch that some by these visitations that he made which was two or three every year some though in a jeering manner no doubt gave him the epithet of bishop bunyan whilst others envied him for his so earnestly labouring in christs vineyard yet the seed of the word he all this while sowed in the hearts of his congregation watered with the grace of god brought forth in abundance in bringing in disciples to the church of christ  another part of his time is spent in reconciling differences by which he hindered many mischiefs and saved some families from ruin and in such fallingsout he was uneasy till he found a means to labour a reconciliation and become a peacemaker on whom a blessing is promised in holy writ and indeed in doing this good office he may be said to sum up his days it being the last undertaking of his life as will appear in the close of this paper  when in the late reign liberty of conscience was unexpectedly given and indulged to dissenters of all persuasions his piercing wit penetrated the veil and found that it was not for the dissenters sakes they were so suddenly freed from the hard prosecutions that had long lain heavy upon them and set in a manner on an equal foot with the church of england which the papists were undermining and about to subvert  he foresaw all the advantages that could have redounded to the dissenters would have been no more than what polyphemus the monstrous giant of sicily would have allowed ulysses viz  that he would eat his men first and do him the favour of being eaten last  for although mr bunyan following the examples of others did lay hold of this liberty as an acceptable thing in itself knowing god is the only lord of conscience and that it is good at all times to do according to the dictates of a good conscience and that the preaching the glad tidings of the gospel is beautiful in the preacher yet in all this he moved with caution and a holy fear earnestly praying for the averting impending judgments which he saw like a black tempest hanging over our heads for our sins and ready to break in upon us and that the ninevites remedy was now highly necessary  hereupon he gathered his congregation at bedford where he mostly lived and had lived and spent the greatest part of his life and there being no convenient place to be had for the entertainment of so great a confluence of people as followed him upon the account of his teaching he consulted with them for the building of a meeting house to which they made their voluntary contributions with all cheerfulness and alacrity and the first time he appeared there to edify the place was so thronged that many was constrained to stay without though the house was very spacious every one striving to partake of his instructions that were of his persuasion and show their goodwill towards him by being present at the opening of the place and here he lived in much peace and quiet of mind contenting himself with that little god had bestowed upon him and sequestering himself from all secular employments to follow that of his call to the ministry for as god said to moses he that made the lips and heart can give eloquence and wisdom without extraordinary acquirements in an university  during these things there were regulators sent into all cities and towns corporate to new model the government in the magistracy etc by turning out some and putting in others  against this mr bunyan expressed his zeal with some weariness as foreseeing the bad consequence that would attend it and laboured with his congregation to prevent their being imposed on in this kind and when a great man in those days coming to bedford upon some such errand sent for him as tis supposed to give him a place of public trust he would by no means come at him but sent his excuse  when he was at leisure from writing and teaching he often came up to london and there went among the congregations of the non conformists and used his talent to the great goodliking of the hearers and even some to whom he had been misrepresented upon the account of his education were convinced of his worth and knowledge in sacred things as perceiving him to be a man of round judgment delivering himself plainly and powerfully insomuch that many who came mere spectators for novelty sake rather than to edify and be improved went away well satisfied with what they heard and wondered as the jews did at the apostles viz  whence this man should have these things perhaps not considering that god more immediately assists those that make it their business industriously and cheerfully to labour in his vineyard  thus he spent his latter years in imitation of his great lord and master the everblessed jesus he went about doing good so that the most prying critic or even malice herself is defied to find even upon the narrowest search or observation any sully or stain upon his reputation with which he may be justly charged and this we note as a challenge to those that have the least regard for him or them of his persuasion and have one way or other appeared in the front of those that oppressed him and for the turning whose hearts in obedience to the commission and commandment given him of god he frequently prayed and sometimes sought a blessing for them even with tears the effects of which they may peradventure though undeservedly have found in their persons friends relations or estates for god will hear the prayer of the faithful and answer them even for them that vex them as it happened in the case of jobs praying for the three persons that had been grievous in their reproach against him even in the day of his sorrow  but yet let me come a little nearer to particulars and periods of time for the better refreshing the memories of those that knew his labour and suffering and for the satisfaction of all that shall read this book  after he was sensibly convicted of the wicked state of his life and converted he was baptized into the congregation and admitted a member thereof viz in the year 1655 and became speedily a very zealous professor but upon the return of king charles to the crown in 1660 he was the 12th of november taken as he was edifying some good people that were got together to hear the word and confined in bedford jail for the space of six years till the act of indulgence to dissenters being allowed he obtained his freedom by the intercession of some in trust and power that took pity on his sufferings but within six years afterwards he was again taken up viz in the year 1666 and was then confined for six years more when even the jailor took such pity of his rigorous sufferings that he did as the egyptian jailor did to joseph put all the care and trust in his hand  when he was taken this last time he was preaching on these words viz  dost thou believe the son of god  and this imprisonment continued six years and when this was over another short affliction which was an imprisonment of half a year fell to his share  during these confinements he wrote the following books viz  of prayer by the spirit  the holy citys resurrection  grace abounding  pilgrims progress the first part  in the last year of his twelve years imprisonment the pastor of the congregation at bedford died and he was chosen to that care of souls on the 12th of december 1671  and in this his charge he often had disputes with scholars that came to oppose him as supposing him an ignorant person and though he argued plainly and by scripture without phrases and logical expressions yet he nonplussed one who came to oppose him in his congregation by demanding whether or no we had the true copies of the original scriptures and another when he was preaching accused him of uncharitableness for saying it was very hard for most to be saved saying by that he went about to exclude most of his congregation but he confuted him and put him to silence with the parable of the stony ground and other texts out of the 13th chapter of st matthew in our saviours sermon out of a ship all his methods being to keep close to the scriptures and what he found not warranted there himself would not warrant nor determine unless in such cases as were plain wherein no doubts or scruples did arise  but not to make any further mention of this kind it is well known that this person managed all his affairs with such exactness as if he had made it his study above all other things not to give occasion of offence but rather suffer many inconveniences to avoid being never heard to reproach or revile any what injury soever he received but rather to rebuke those that did and as it was in his conversation so it is manifested in those books he has caused to be published to the world where like the archangel disputing with satan about the body of moses as we find it in the epistle of st jude brings no railing accusation but leaves the rebukers those that persecuted him to the lord  in his family he kept up a very strict discipline in prayer and exhortation being in this like joshua as the good man expresses it viz whatsoever others did as for me and my house we will serve the lord  and indeed a blessing waited on his labours and endeavours so that his wife as the psalmist says was like a pleasant vine upon the walls of his house and his children like olive branches round his table for so shall it be with the man that fears the lord and though by reason of the many losses he sustained by imprisonment and spoil of his chargeable sickness etc his earthly treasure swelled not to excess he always had sufficient to live decently and creditably and with that he had the greatest of all treasures which is content for as the wise man says that is a continual feast  but where content dwells even a poor cottage is a kingly palace and this happiness he had all his life long not so much minding this world as knowing he was here as a pilgrim and stranger and had no tarrying city but looked for one made with hands eternal in the highest heavens  but at length was worn out with sufferings age and often teaching the day of his dissolution drew near and death that unlocks the prison of the soul to enlarge it for a more glorious mansion put a stop to his acting his part on the stage of mortality heaven like earthly princes when it threatens war being always so kind as to call home its ambassadors before it be denounced and even the last act or undertaking of his was a labour of love and charity for it so falling out that a young gentleman a neighbour of mr bunyans happening into the displeasure of his father and being much troubled in mind upon that account and also for that he heard his father purposed to disinherit him or otherwise deprive him of what he had to leave he pitched upon mr bunyan as a fit man to make way for his submission and prepare his fathers mind to receive him and he as willing to do any good office as it could be requested as readily undertook it and so riding to reading in berkshire he then there used such pressing arguments and reasons against anger and passion as also for love and reconciliation that the father was mollified and his bowels yearned to his returning son  but mr bunyan after he had disposed all things to the best for accommodation returning to london and being overtaken with excessive rains coming to his lodgings extremely wet fell sick of a violent fever which he bore with much constancy and patience and expressed himself as if he desired nothing more than to be dissolved and be with christ in that case esteeming death as gain and life only a tedious delaying felicity expected and finding his vital strength decay having settled his mind and affairs as well as the shortness of time and the violence of his disease would permit with a constant and christian patience he resigned his soul into the hands of his most merciful redeemer following his pilgrim from the city of destruction to the new jerusalem his better part having been all along there in holy contemplation pantings and breathings after the hidden manna and water of life as by many holy and humble consolations expressed in his letters to several persons in prison and out of prison too many to be inserted at present  he died at the house of one mr struddock a grocer at the star on snow hill in the parish of st sepulchres london on the 12th of august 1688 and in the sixtieth year of his age after ten days sickness and was buried in the new burying place near the artillery ground where he sleeps to the morning of the resurrection in hopes of a glorious rising to an incorruptible immortality of joy and happiness where no more trouble and sorrow shall afflict him but all tears be wiped away when the just shall be incorporated as members of christ their head and reign with him as kings and priests for ever    a brief character of mr john bunyan    he appeared in countenance to be of a stern and rough temper but in his conversation mild and affable not given to loquacity or much discourse in company unless some urgent occasion required it observing never to boast of himself or his parts but rather seem low in his own eyes and submit himself to the judgment of others abhorring lying and swearing being just in all that lay in his power to his word not seeming to revenge injuries loving to reconcile differences and make friendship with all he had a sharp quick eye accompanied with an excellent discerning of persons being of good judgment and quick wit  as for his person he was tall of stature strong boned though not corpulent somewhat of a ruddy face with sparkling eyes wearing his hair on his upper lip after the old british fashion his hair reddish but in his latter days time had sprinkled it with grey his nose well set but not declining or bending and his mouth moderate large his forehead somewhat high and his habit always plain and modest  and thus have we impartially described the internal and external parts of a person whose death hath been much regretted a person who had tried the smiles and frowns of time not puffed up in prosperity nor shaken in adversity always holding the golden mean   in him at once did three great worthies shine historian poet and a choice divine then let him rest in undisturbed dust until the resurrection of the just    postscript    in this his pilgrimage god blessed him with four children one of which named mary was blind and died some years before his other children were thomas joseph and sarah his wife elizabeth having lived to see him overcome his labour and sorrow and pass from this life to receive the reward of his work long survived him not but in 1692 she died to follow her faithful pilgrim from this world to the other whither he was gone before her whilst his works which consist of sixty books remain for the edifying of the reader and praise of the author
