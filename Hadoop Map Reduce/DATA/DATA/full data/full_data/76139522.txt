introduction    samuel taylor coleridge was born on the 21st of october 1772 youngest of many children of the rev john coleridge vicar of the parish and head master of the grammar school of ottery st mary in devonshire  one of the poets elder brothers was the grandfather of lord chief justice coleridge  coleridges mother was a notable housewife as was needful in the mother of ten children who had three more transmitted to her from her husbands former wife coleridges father was a kindly and learned man little sophisticated and distinguishing himself now and then by comical acts of what is called absence of mind  charles buller afterwards a judge was one of his boys and when her husbands life seemed to be failing had promised what help he could give to the anxious wife when his father died samuel taylor coleridge was but eight years old and charles buller obtained for him his presentation to christs hospital  coleridges mind delighted in far wandering over the fields of thought from a boy he took intense delight in dreamy speculation on the mysteries that lie around the life of man  from a boy also he proved his subtleties of thought through what charles lamb called the deep and sweet intonations of such speech as could come only from a poet  from the charterhouse coleridge went to jesus college cambridge where he soon won a gold medal for a greek ode on the slave trade but through indolence he slipped into a hundred pounds of debt  the stir of the french revolution was then quickening young minds into bold freedom of speculation resentment against tyranny of custom and yearning for a higher life in this world  old opinions that familiarity had made to the multitude conventional were for that reason distrusted and discarded  coleridge no longer held his religious faith in the form taught by his father  he could not sign the thirtynine articles and felt his career closed at the university  his debt also pressed upon him heavily  after a long vacation with a burdened mind in which one pleasant day of picnic gave occasion to his songs of the pixies coleridge went back to cambridge  but soon afterwards he threw all up in despair  he resolved to become lost to his friends and find some place where he could earn in obscurity bare daily bread  he came to london and then enlisted as a private in the 15th light dragoons  after four months he was discovered his discharge was obtained and he went back to cambridge  but he had no career before him there for his religious opinions then excluded belief in the doctrine of the trinity and the universities were not then open to dissenters  a visit to oxford brought him into relation with robert southey and fellowstudents of southeys who were also touched with revolutionary ardour  coleridge joined with them in the resolve to leave the old world and create a better in the new as founders of a pantisocracyan allequal governmenton the banks of the susquehannah  they would need wives and southey knew of three good liberalminded sisters at bristol one of them designed for himself her two sisters he recommended for as far as they would go  the chief promoters of the pantisocracy removed to bristol and one of the three sisters sarah fricker was married by coleridge southey marrying another edith while another young oxford enthusiast married the remaining miss fricker and so they made three pairs of future patriarchs and matriarchs  nothing came of the pantisocracy for want of money to pay fares to the new world  coleridge supported himself by giving lectures and in 1797 published poems  they included his religious musings which contain expression of his fervent revolutionary hopes  then he planned a weekly paper the watchman that was to carry the lantern of philosophic truth and call the hour for those who cared about the duties of the day  when only three or four hundred subscribers had been got together in bristol coleridge resolved to travel from town to town in search of subscriptions  wherever he went his eloquence prevailed and he came back with a very large subscription list  but the power of close daily work by which alone coleridge could carry out such a design was not in him and the watchman only reached to its tenth number  then coleridge settled at nether stowey by the bristol channel partly for convenience of neighbourhood to thomas poole from whom he could borrow at need  he had there also a yearly allowance from the wedgwoods of etruria who had a strong faith in his future  from nether stowey coleridge walked over to make friends with wordsworth at racedown and the friendship there established caused wordsworth and his sister to remove to the neighbourhood of nether stowey  out of the relations with wordsworth thus established came coleridges best achievements as a poet the ancient mariner and christabel the ancient mariner was finished and was the chief part of coleridges contribution to the lyrical ballads which the two friends published in 1798  christabel being unfinished was left unpublished until 1816  with help from the wedgwoods coleridge went abroad with wordsworth and his sister left them at hamburg and during fourteen months increased his familiarity with german  he came back in the late summer of 1799 full of enthusiasm for schillers last great work his wallenstein which coleridge had seen acted  the camp had been first acted at weimar on the 18th of october 1798 the piccolomini on the 30th of january 1799 and wallensteins death on the 10th of the next following april  coleridge under the influence of fresh enthusiasm rapidly completed for messrs longman his translation of wallensteins death into an english poem of the highest mark  then followed a weakening of health  coleridge earned fitfully as journalist settled at keswick found his tendency to rheumatism increased by the damp of the lake country took a remedy containing opium and began to acquire that taste for the excitement of opium which ruined the next years of his life  he was invited to malta for the benefit of the climate by his friend john stoddart who was there  at malta he made the acquaintance of the governor sir alexander ball whose worth he celebrates in essays of the friend which are included under the title of a sailors fortune in this little volume  for a short time he acted as secretary to sir alexander then returned to the lakes and planned his journal the friend published at penrith of which the first number appeared on the 1st of august 1809 the twentyeighth and last towards the end of march 1810  next followed six years of struggle to live as journalist and lecturer in london and elsewhere while the habit of taking opium grew year by year and at last advanced from two quarts of laudanum a week to a pint a day  coleridge put himself under voluntary restraint for a time with a mr morgan at calne  finally he placed himself in april 1816the year of the publication of christabel with a surgeon at highgate mr gillman under whose friendly care he was restored to himself and in whose house he died on the 25th of july 1834  it was during this calm autumn of his life that coleridge turning wholly to the higher speculations on philosophy and religion upon which his mind was chiefly fixed a revert to the church and often actively antagonist to the opinions he had held for a few years wrote his lay sermons and his biographia literaria and arranged also a volume of essays of the friend  he lectured on shakespeare wrote aids to reflection and showed how his doubts were set at rest in these confessions of an inquiring spirit which were first published in 1840 after their writers death  h m    confessions of an inquiring spirit    letters on the inspiration of the scriptures    letter i    my dear friend  i employed the compelled and most unwelcome leisure of severe indisposition in reading the confessions of a fair saint in mr carlyles recent translation of the wilhelm meister which might i think have been better rendered literally the confessions of a beautiful soul  this acting in conjunction with the concluding sentences of your letter threw my thoughts inward on my own religious experience and gave immediate occasion to the following confessions of one who is neither fair nor saintly but who groaning under a deep sense of infirmity and manifold imperfection feels the want the necessity of religious support who cannot afford to lose any the smallest buttress but who not only loves truth even for itself and when it reveals itself aloof from all interest but who loves it with an indescribable awe which too often withdraws the genial sap of his activity from the columnar trunk the sheltering leaves the bright and fragrant flower and the foodful or medicinal fruitage to the deep root ramifying in obscurity and labyrinthine waywinning    in darkness there to house unknown far underground pierced by no sound save such as live in fancys ear alone that listens for the uptorn mandrakes parting groan   i should perhaps be a happierat all events a more usefulman if my mind were otherwise constituted  but so it is and even with regard to christianity itself like certain plants i creep towards the light even though it draw me away from the more nourishing warmth  yea i should do so even if the light had made its way through a rent in the wall of the temple  glad indeed and grateful am i that not in the temple itself but only in one or two of the side chapels not essential to the edifice and probably not coeval with it have i found the light absent and that the rent in the wall has but admitted the free light of the temple itself  i shall best communicate the state of my faith by taking the creed or system of credenda common to all the fathers of the reformation overlooking as nonessential the differences between the several reformed churches according to the five main classes or sections into which the aggregate distributes itself to my apprehension  i have then only to state the effect produced on my mind by each of these or the quantum of recipiency and coincidence in myself relatively thereto in order to complete my confession of faith  i  the absolute the innominable greek text which cannot be reproduced et causa sui in whose transcendent i am as the ground is whatever verily is the triune god by whose word and spirit as the transcendent cause exists whatever substantially exists god almightyfather son and holy ghost undivided unconfounded co eternal  this class i designate by the word greek text which cannot be reproduced  ii  the eternal possibilities the actuality of which hath not its origin in god  chaos spirituale greek text which cannot be reproduced  iii  the creation and formation of the heaven and earth by the redemptive word the apostasy of man the redemption of man the incarnation of the word in the son of man the crucifixion and resurrection of the son of man the descent of the comforter repentance greek text which cannot be reproduced regeneration faith prayer gracecommunion with the spirit conflict self abasement assurance through the righteousness of christ spiritual growth love discipline perseverance hope in death greek text which cannot be reproduced  iv  but these offers gifts and graces are not for one or for a few  they are offered to all  even when the gospel is preached to a single individual it is offered to him as to one of a great household  not only man but says st paul the whole creation is included in the consequences of the fallgreek text which cannot be reproducedso also in those of the change at the redemptiongreek text which cannot be reproduced  we too shall be raised in the body  christianity is fact no less than truth  it is spiritual yet so as to be historical and between these two poles there must likewise be a midpoint in which the historical and spiritual meet christianity must have its historya history of itself and likewise the history of its introduction its spread and its outward becoming and as the midpoint abovementioned a portion of these facts must be miraculous that is phenomena in nature that are beyond nature  furthermore the history of all historical nations must in some sense be its historyin other words all history must be providential and this a providence a preparation and a looking forward to christ  here then we have four out of the five classes  and in all these the sky of my belief is serene unclouded by a doubt  would to god that my faith that faith which works on the whole man confirming and conforming were but in just proportion to my belief to the full acquiescence of my intellect and the deep consent of my conscience the very difficulties argue the truth of the whole scheme and system for my understanding since i see plainly that so must the truth appear if it be the truth  v  but there is a book of two parts each part consisting of several books  the first part i speak in the character of an uninterested critic or philologist contains the relics of the literature of the hebrew people while the hebrew was still the living language  the second part comprises the writings and with one or two inconsiderable and doubtful exceptions all the writings of the followers of christ within the space of ninety years from the date of the resurrection  i do not myself think that any of these writings were composed as late as ad 120 but i wish to preclude all dispute  this book i resume as read and yet unreadread and familiar to my mind in all parts but which is yet to be perused as a whole or rather a work cujus particulas et sententiolas omnes et singulas recogniturus sum but the component integers of which and their conspiration i have yet to study  i take up this work with the purpose to read it for the first time as i should read any other work as far at least as i can or dare  for i neither can nor dare throw off a strong and awful prepossession in its favourcertain as i am that a large part of the light and life in and by which i see love and embrace the truths and the strengths coorganised into a living body of faith and knowledge in the four preceding classes has been directly or indirectly derived to me from this sacred volume and unable to determine what i do not owe to its influences  but even on this account and because it has these inalienable claims on my reverence and gratitude i will not leave it in the power of unbelievers to say that the bible is for me only what the koran is for the deaf turk and the vedas for the feeble and acquiescent hindoo  no i will retire up into the mountain and hold secret commune with my bible above the contagious blastments of prejudice and the fogblight of selfish superstition  for fear hath torment and what though my reason be to the power and splendour of the scriptures but as the reflected and secondary shine of the moon compared with the solar radiance yet the sun endures the occasional copresence of the unsteady orb and leaving it visible seems to sanction the comparison  there is a light higher than all even the word that was in the beginning the light of which light itself is but the shechinah and cloudy tabernacle the word that is light for every man and life for as many as give heed to it  if between this word and the written letter i shall anywhere seem to myself to find a discrepance i will not conclude that such there actually is nor on the other hand will i fall under the condemnation of them that would lie for god but seek as i may be thankful for what i haveand wait  with such purposes with such feelings have i perused the books of the old and new testaments each book as a whole and also as an integral part  and need i say that i have met everywhere more or less copious sources of truth and power and purifying impulses that i have found words for my inmost thoughts songs for my joy utterances for my hidden griefs and pleadings for my shame and my feebleness  in short whatever finds me bears witness for itself that it has proceeded from a holy spirit even from the same spirit which remaining in itself yet regenerateth all other powers and in all ages entering into holy souls maketh them friends of god and prophets  wisd vii  and here perhaps i might have been content to rest if i had not learned that as a christian i cannot must not stand alone or if i had not known that more than this was holden and required by the fathers of the reformation and by the churches collectively since the council of nice at latest the only exceptions being that doubtful one of the corrupt romish church implied though not avowed in its equalisation of the apocryphal books with those of the hebrew canon and the irrelevant one of the few and obscure sects who acknowledge no historical christianity this somewhat more in which jerome augustine luther and hooker were of one and the same judgment and less than which not one of them would have toleratedwould it fall within the scope of my present doubts and objections  i hope it would not  let only their general expressions be interpreted by their treatment of the scriptures in detail and i dare confidently trust that it would not for i can no more reconcile the doctrine which startles my belief with the practice and particular declarations of these great men than with the convictions of my own understanding and conscience  at all eventsand i cannot too early or too earnestly guard against any misapprehension of my meaning and purposelet it be distinctly understood that my arguments and objections apply exclusively to the following doctrine or dogma  to the opinions which individual divines have advanced in lieu of this doctrine my only objection as far as i object isthat i do not understand them  the precise enunciation of this doctrine i defer to the commencement of the next letter  farewell    letter ii    my dear friend  in my last letter i said that in the bible there is more that finds me than i have experienced in all other books put together that the words of the bible find me at greater depths of my being and that whatever finds me brings with it an irresistible evidence of its having proceeded from the holy spirit  but the doctrine in question requires me to believe that not only what finds me but that all that exists in the sacred volume and which i am bound to find therein wasnot alone inspired by that is composed by men under the actuating influence of the holy spirit but likewisedictated by an infallible intelligence that the writers each and all were divinely informed as well as inspired  now here all evasion all excuse is cut off  an infallible intelligence extends to all things physical no less than spiritual  it may convey the truth in any one of the three possible languagesthat of sense as objects appear to the beholder on this earth or that of science which supposes the beholder placed in the centre or that of philosophy which resolves both into a supersensual reality  but whichever be chosenand it is obvious that the incompatibility exists only between the first and second both of them being indifferent and of equal value to the thirdit must be employed consistently for an infallible intelligence must intend to be intelligible and not to deceive  and moreover whichever of these three languages be chosen it must be translatable into truth  for this is the very essence of the doctrine that one and the same intelligence is speaking in the unity of a person which unity is no more broken by the diversity of the pipes through which it makes itself audible than is a tune by the different instruments on which it is played by a consummate musician equally perfect in all  one instrument may be more capacious than another but as far as its compass extends and in what it sounds forth it will be true to the conception of the master  i can conceive no softening here which would not nullify the doctrine and convert it to a cloud for each mans fancy to shift and shape at will  and this doctrine i confess plants the vineyard of the word with thorns for me and places snares in its pathways these may be delusions of an evil spirit but ere i so harshly question the seeming angel of lightmy reason i mean and moral sense in conjunction with my clearest knowledgei must inquire on what authority this doctrine rests  and what other authority dares a truly catholic christian admit as coercive in the final decision but the declarations of the book itselfthough i should not without struggles and a trembling reluctance gainsay even a universal tradition  i return to the book  with a full persuasion of soul respecting all the articles of the christian faith as contained in the first four classes i receive willingly also the truth of the history namely that the word of the lord did come to samuel to isaiah to others and that the words which gave utterance to the same are faithfully recorded  but though the origin of the words even as of the miraculous acts be supernatural yet the former once uttered the latter once having taken their place among the phenomena of the senses the faithful recording of the same does not of itself imply or seem to require any supernatural working other than as all truth and goodness are such  in the books of moses and once or twice in the prophecy of jeremiah i find it indeed asserted that not only the words were given but the recording of the same enjoined by the special command of god and doubtless executed under the special guidance of the divine spirit  as to all such passages therefore there can be no dispute and all others in which the words are by the sacred historian declared to have been the word of the lord supernaturally communicated i receive as such with a degree of confidence proportioned to the confidence required of me by the writer himself and to the claims he himself makes on my belief  let us therefore remove all such passages and take each book by itself and i repeat that i believe the writer in whatever he himself relates of his own authority and of its origin  but i cannot find any such claim as the doctrine in question supposes made by these writers explicitly or by implication  on the contrary they refer to other documents and in all points express themselves as sober minded and veracious writers under ordinary circumstances are known to do  but perhaps they bear testimony the successor to his predecessor  or some one of the number has left it on record that by special inspiration he was commanded to declare the plenary inspiration of all the rest  the passages which can without violence be appealed to as substantiating the latter position are so few and these so incidentalthe conclusion drawn from them involving likewise so obviously a petitio principii namely the supernatural dictation word by word of the book in which the question is found for until this is established the utmost that such a text can prove is the current belief of the writers age and country concerning the character of the books then called the scriptures that it cannot but seem strange and assuredly is against all analogy of gospel revelation that such a doctrinewhich if true must be an article of faith and a most important yea essential article of faithshould be left thus faintly thus obscurely and if i may so say obitaneously declared and enjoined  the time of the formation and closing of the canon unknownthe selectors and compilers unknown or recorded by known fabulistsand more perplexing still the belief of the jewish churchthe belief i mean common to the jews of palestine and their more cultivated brethren in alexandria no reprehension of which is to be found in the new testament concerning the nature and import of the greek text which cannot be reproduced attributed to the precious remains of their temple librarythese circumstances are such especially the last as in effect to evacuate the tenet of which i am speaking of the only meaning in which it practically means anything at all tangible steadfast or obligatory  in infallibility there are no degrees the power of the high and holy one is one and the same whether the sphere which it fills be larger or smallerthe area traversed by a comet or the oracle of the house the holy place beneath the wings of the cherubimthe pentateuch of the legislator who drew near to the thick darkness where god was and who spake in the cloud whence the thunderings and lightnings came and whom god answered by a voice or but a letter of thirteen verses from the affectionate elder to the elect lady and her children whom he loved in the truth  but at no period was this the judgment of the jewish church respecting all the canonical books  to moses aloneto moses in the recording no less than in the receiving of the lawand to all and every part of the five books called the books of moses the jewish doctors of the generation before and coeval with the apostles assigned that unmodified and absolute theopneusty which our divines in words at least attribute to the canon collectively  in fact it was from the jewish rabbiswho in opposition to the christian scheme contended for a perfection in the revelation by moses which neither required nor endured any addition and who strained their fancies in expressing the transcendency of the books of moses in aid of their opinionthat the founders of the doctrine borrowed their notions and phrases respecting the bible throughout  remove the metaphorical drapery from the doctrine of the cabbalists and it will be found to contain the only intelligible and consistent idea of that plenary inspiration which later divines extend to all the canonical books as thus the pentateuch is but one word even the word of god and the letters and articulate sounds by which this word is communicated to our human apprehensions are likewise divinely communicated  now for pentateuch substitute old and new testament and then i say that this is the doctrine which i reject as superstitious and unscriptural  and yet as long as the conceptions of the revealing word and the inspiring spirit are identified and confounded i assert that whatever says less than this says little more than nothing for how can absolute infallibility be blended with fallibility where is the infallible criterion  how can infallible truth be infallibly conveyed in defective and fallible expressions  the jewish teachers confined this miraculous character to the pentateuch between the mosaic and the prophetic inspiration they asserted such a difference as amounts to a diversity and between both the one and the other and the remaining books comprised under the tithe of hagiographa the interval was still wider and the inferiority in kind and not only in degree was unequivocally expressed  if we take into account the habit universal with the hebrew doctors of referring all excellent or extraordinary things to the great first cause without mention of the proximate and instrumental causesa striking illustration of which may be obtained by comparing the narratives of the same event in the psalms and in the historical books and if we further reflect that the distinction of the providential and the miraculous did not enter into their forms of thinkingat all events not into their mode of conveying their thoughtsthe language of the jews respecting the hagiographa will be found to differ little if at all from that of religious persons among ourselves when speaking of an author abounding in gifts stirred up by the holy spirit writing under the influence of special grace and the like  but it forms no part of my present purpose to discuss the point historically or to speculate on the formation of either canon rather such inquiries are altogether alien from the great object of my pursuits and studies which is to convince myself and others that the bible and christianity are their own sufficient evidence  but it concerns both my character and my peace of mind to satisfy unprejudiced judges that if my present convictions should in all other respects be found consistent with the faith and feelings of a christianand if in many and those important points they tend to secure that faith and to deepen those feelingsthe words of the apostle rightly interpreted do not require their condemnation enough if what has been stated above respecting the general doctrine of the hebrew masters under whom the apostle was bred shall remove any misconceptions that might prevent the right interpretation of his words  farewell    letter iii    my dear friend  having in the former two letters defined the doctrine which i reject i am now to communicate the views that i would propose to substitute in its place  before however i attempt to lay down on the theological chart the roadplace to which my bark has drifted and to mark the spot and circumscribe the space within which i swing at anchor let me first thank you for and then attempt to answer the objectionsor at least the questionswhich you have urged upon me  the present bible is the canon to which christ and the apostles referred  doubtless  and in terms which a christian must tremble to tamper with  yea  the expressions are as direct as strong and a true believer will neither attempt to divert nor dilute their strength  the doctrine which is considered as the orthodox view seems the obvious and most natural interpretation of the text in question  yea and nay  to those whose minds are prepossessed by the doctrine itselfwho from earliest childhood have always meant this doctrine by the very word biblethe doctrine being but its exposition and paraphraseyea  in such minds the words of our lord and the declarations of st paul can awaken no other sense  to those on the other hand who find the doctrine senseless and selfconfuting and who take up the bible as they do other books and apply to it the same rules of interpretationnay  and lastly he who like myself recognises in neither of the two the state of his own mindwho cannot rest in the former and feels or fears a presumptuous spirit in the negative dogmatism of the latterhe has his answer to seek  but so far i dare hazard a reply to the questionin what other sense can the words be interpreted beseeching you however to take what i am about to offer but as an attempt to delineate an arc of oscillationthat the eulogy of st paul is in nowise contravened by the opinion to which i incline who fully believe the old testament collectively both in the composition and in its preservation a great and precious gift of providence who find in it all that the apostle describes and who more than believe that all which the apostle spoke of was of divine inspiration and a blessing intended for as many as are in communion with the spirit through all ages  and i freely confess that my whole heart would turn away with an angry impatience from the cold and captious mortal who the moment i had been pouring out the love and gladness of my soulwhile book after book law and truth and example oracle and lovely hymn and choral song of ten thousand thousands and accepted prayers of saints and prophets sent back as it were from heaven like doves to be let loose again with a new freight of spiritual joys and griefs and necessities were passing across my memoryat the first pause of my voice and whilst my countenance was still speakingshould ask me whether i was thinking of the book of esther or meant particularly to include the first six chapters of daniel or verses 620 of the 109th psalm or the last verse of the 137th psalm  would any conclusion of this sort be drawn in any other analogous case  in the course of my lectures on dramatic poetry i in half a score instances referred my auditors to the precious volume before meshakespeareand spoke enthusiastically both in general and with detail of particular beauties of the plays of shakespeare as in all their kinds and in relation to the purposes of the writer excellent  would it have been fair or according to the common usage and understanding of men to have inferred an intention on my part to decide the question respecting titus andronicus or the larger portion of the three parts of henry vi  would not every genial mind understand by shakespeare that unity or total impression comprising and resulting from the thousandfold several and particular emotions of delight admiration gratitude excited by his works  but if it be answered aye but we must not interpret st paul as we may and should interpret any other honest and intelligent writer or speakerthen i say this is the very petitio principii of which i complain  still less do the words of our lord apply against my view  have i not declareddo i not begin by declaringthat whatever is referred by the sacred penman to a direct communication from god and wherever it is recorded that the subject of the history had asserted himself to have received this or that command this or that information or assurance from a superhuman intelligence or where the writer in his own person and in the character of an historian relates that the word of the lord came unto priest prophet chieftain or other individualhave i not declared that i receive the same with full belief and admit its inappellable authority  who more convinced than i amwho more anxious to impress that conviction on the minds of othersthat the law and the prophets speak throughout of christ that all the intermediate applications and realisations of the words are but types and repetitionstranslations as it were from the language of letters and articulate sounds into the language of events and symbolical persons  and here again let me recur to the aid of analogy  suppose a life of sir thomas more by his soninlaw or a life of lord bacon by his chaplain that a part of the records of the court of chancery belonging to these periods were lost that in ropers or in rawleys biographical work there were preserved a series of dicta and judgments attributed to these illustrious chancellors many and important specimens of their table discourses with large extracts from works written by them and from some that are no longer extant let it be supposed too that there are no grounds internal or external to doubt either the moral intellectual or circumstantial competence of the biographers  suppose moreover that wherever the opportunity existed of collating their documents and quotations with the records and works still preserved the former were found substantially correct and faithful the few differences in nowise altering or disturbing the spirit and purpose of the paragraphs in which they were found and that of what was not collatable and to which no test ab extra could be applied the far larger part bore witness in itself of the same spirit and origin and that not only by its characteristic features but by its surpassing excellence it rendered the chances of its having had any other author than the giantmind to whom the biographer ascribes it small indeed  now from the nature and objects of my pursuits i have we will suppose frequent occasion to refer to one or other of these works for example to rawleys dicta et facta francisci de verulam  at one time i might refer to the work in some such words asremember what francis of verulam said or judged or if you believe not me yet believe lord bacon  at another time i might take the running title of the volume and at another the name of the biographerturn to your rawley  he will set you right or there you will find a depth which no research will ever exhaust or whatever other strong expression my sense of bacons greatness and of the intrinsic worth and the value of the proofs and specimens of that greatness contained and preserved in that volume would excite and justify but let my expressions be as vivid and unqualified as the most sanguine temperament ever inspired would any man of sense conclude from them that i meantand meant to make others believethat not only each and all of these anecdotes adages decisions extracts incidents had been dictated word by word by lord bacon and that all rawleys own observations and inferences all the connectives and disjunctives all the recollections of time place and circumstance together with the order and succession of the narrative were in like manner dictated and revised by the spirit of the deceased chancellor the answer will bemust beno man in his senses  no man in his sensesin this instance but in that of the bible it is quite otherwise for i take it as an admitted point that it is quite otherwise  and here i renounce any advantage i might obtain for my argument by restricting the application of our lords and the apostles words to the hebrew canon  i admit the justicei have long felt the full forceof the remarkwe have all that the occasion allowed  and if the same awful authority does not apply so directly to the evangelical and apostolical writings as to the hebrew canon yet the analogy of faith justifies the transfer  if the doctrine be less decisively scriptural in its application to the new testament or the christian canon the temptation to doubt it is likewise less  so at least we are led to infer since in point of fact it is the apparent or imagined contrast the diversity of spirit which sundry individuals have believed themselves to find in the old testament and in the gospel that has given occasion to the doubtand in the heart of thousands who yield a faith of acquiescence to the contrary and find rest in their humilitysupplies fuel to a fearful wish that it were permitted to make a distinction  but lastly you object thateven granting that no coercive positive reasons for the beliefno direct and not inferred assertionsof the plenary inspiration of the old and new testament in the generally received import of the term could be adduced yet in behalf of a doctrine so catholic and during so long a succession of ages affirmed and acted on by jew and christian greek romish and protestant you need no other answer than tell me first why it should not be received  why should i not believe the scriptures throughout dictated in word and thought by an infallible intelligence  i admit the fairness of the retort and eagerly and earnestly do i answer  for every reason that makes me prize and revere these scripturesprize them love them revere them beyond all other books  why should i not  because the doctrine in question petrifies at once the whole body of holy writ with all its harmonies and symmetrical gradationsthe flexile and the rigidthe supporting hard and the clothing softthe blood which is the lifethe intelligencing nerves and the rudely woven but soft and springy cellular substance in which all are imbedded and lightly bound together  this breathing organism this glorious panharmonicon which i had seen stand on its feet as a man and with a mans voice given to it the doctrine in question turns at once into a colossal memnons head a hollow passage for a voice a voice that mocks the voices of many men and speaks in their names and yet is but one voice and the same and no man uttered it and never in a human heart was it conceived  why should i notbecause the doctrine evacuates of all sense and efficacy the sure and constant tradition that all the several books bound up together in our precious family bible were composed in different and widelydistant ages under the greatest diversity of circumstances and degrees of light and information and yet that the composers whether as uttering or as recording what was uttered and what was done were all actuated by a pure and holy spirit one and

grateful for the clearer and purer radiance which shines on a christians paths neither blunted by the preparatory veil nor crimsoned in its struggle through the all enwrapping mist of the worlds ignorance  whilst in the self oblivion of these heroes of the old testament their elevation above all low and individual interestsabove all in the entire and vehement devotion of their total being to the service of their divine master i find a lesson of humility a ground of humiliation and a shaming yet rousing example of faith and fealty  but let me once be persuaded that all these heartawakening utterances of human heartsof men of like faculties and passions with myself mourning rejoicing suffering triumphingare but as a divina commedia of a superhumano bear with me if i sayventriloquistthat the royal harper to whom i have so often submitted myself as a manystringed instrument for his firetipt fingers to traverse while every several nerve of emotion passion thought that thrids the fleshandblood of our common humanity responded to the touchthat this sweet psalmist of israel was himself as mere an instrument as his harp an automaton poet mourner and supplicantall is goneall sympathy at least and all example  i listen in awe and fear but likewise in perplexity and confusion of spirit  yet one other instance and let this be the crucial test of the doctrine  say that the book of job throughout was dictated by an infallible intelligence  then reperuse the book and still as you proceed try to apply the tenet try if you can even attach any sense or semblance of meaning to the speeches which you are reading  what were the hollow truisms the unsufficing halftruths the false assumptions and malignant insinuations of the supercilious bigots who corruptly defended the truth were the impressive facts the piercing outcries the pathetic appeals and the close and powerful reasoning with which the poor sufferersmarting at once from his wounds and from the oil of vitriol which the orthodox liars for god were dropping into themimpatiently but uprightly and holily controverted this truth while in will and in spirit he clung to it were both dictated by an infallible intelligencealas if i may judge from the manner in which both indiscriminately are recited quoted appealed to preached upon by the routiniers of desk and pulpit i cannot doubt that they think soor rather without thinking take for granted that so they are to thinkthe more readily perhaps because the so thinking supersedes the necessity of all afterthought  farewell    letter iv    my dear friend  you reply to the conclusion of my letter  what have we to do with routiniers  quid mihi cum homunculis putata putide reputantibus let nothings count for nothing and the dead bury the dead  who but such ever understood the tenet in this sense  in what sense then i rejoin do others understand it  if with exception of the passages already excepted namely the recorded words of godconcerning which no christian can have doubt or scruplethe tenet in this sense be inapplicable to the scripture destructive of its noblest purposes and contradictory to its own express declarationsagain and again i ask what am i to substitute  what other sense is conceivable that does not destroy the doctrine which it professes to interpretthat does not convert it into its own negative  as if a geometrician should name a sugar loaf an ellipse addingby which term i here mean a coneand then justify the misnomer on the pretext that the ellipse is among the conic sections  and yetnotwithstanding the repugnancy of the doctrine in its unqualified sense to scripture reason and common sense theoretically while to all practical uses it is intractable unmalleable and altogether unprofitablenotwithstanding its irrationality and in the face of your expostulation grounded on the palpableness of its irrationalityi must still avow my belief that however fittingly and unsteadily as through a mist it is the doctrine which the generality of our popular divines receive as orthodox and this the sense which they attach to the words  for on what other ground can i account for the whimsical subintelligiturs of our numerous harmonistsfor the curiously inferred facts the inventive circumstantial detail the complemental and supplemental history which in the utter silence of all historians and absence of all historical documents they bring to light by mere force of logic  and all to do away some half score apparent discrepancies in the chronicles and memoirs of the old and new testamentsdiscrepancies so analogous to what is found in all other narratives of the same story by several narratorsso analogous to what is found in all other known and trusted histories by contemporary historians when they are collated with each other nay not seldom when either historian is compared with himself as to form in the eyes of all competent judges a characteristic mark of the genuineness independency and if i may apply the word to a book the veraciousness of each several document a mark the absence of which would warrant a suspicion of collusion invention or at best of servile transcription discrepancies so trifling in circumstance and import that although in some instances it is highly probable and in all instances perhaps possible that they are only apparent and reconcilable no wise man would care a staw whether they were real or apparent reconciled or left in harmless and friendly variance  what i ask could have induced learned and intelligent divines to adopt or sanction subterfuges which neutralising the ordinary criteria of full or defective evidence in historical documents would taken as a general rule render all collation and crossexamination of written records ineffective and obliterate the main character by which authentic histories are distinguished from those traditional tales which each successive reporter enlarges and fashions to his own fancy and purpose and every different edition of which more or less contradicts the other  allow me to create chasms ad libitum and ad libitum to fill them up with imagined facts and incidents and i would almost undertake to harmonise falstaffs account of the rogues in buckram into a coherent and consistent narrative  what i say could have tempted grave and pious men thus to disturb the foundation of the temple in order to repair a petty breach or rathole in the wall or fasten a loose stone or two in the outer court if not an assumed necessity arising out of the peculiar character of bible history  the substance of the syllogism by which their procedure was justified to their own minds can be no other than this  that without which two assertionsboth of which must be alike true and correctwould contradict each other and consequently be one or both false or incorrect must itself be true  but every word and syllable existing in the original text of the canonical books from the cherethi and phelethi of david to the name in the copy of a family register the site of a town or the course of a river were dictated to the sacred amanuensis by an infallible intelligence here there can be neither more nor less  important or unimportant gives no ground of difference and the number of the writers as little  the secretaries may have been manythe historian was one and the same and he infallible  this is the minor of the syllogism and if it could be proved the conclusion would be at least plausible and there would be but one objection to the procedure namely its uselessness  for if it had been proved already what need of proving it over again and by meansthe removal namely of apparent contradictionswhich the infallible author did not think good to employ  but if it have not been proved what becomes of the argument which derives its whole force and legitimacy from the assumption  in fact it is clear that the harmonists and their admirers held and understood the doctrine literally  and must not that divine likewise have so understood it who in answer to a question concerning the transcendant blessedness of jael and the righteousness of the act in which she inhospitably treacherously perfidiously murdered sleep the confiding sleep closed the controversy by observing that he wanted no better morality than that of the bible and no other proof of an actions being praiseworthy than that the bible had declared it worthy to be praisedan observation as applied in this instance so slanderous to the morality and moral spirit of the bible as to be inexplicable except as a consequence of the doctrine in dispute  but let a man be once fully persuaded that there is no difference between the two positions  the bible contains the religion revealed by god and whatever is contained in the bible is religion and was revealed by god and that whatever can be said of the bible collectively taken may and must be said of each and every sentence of the bible taken for and by itself and i no longer wonder at these paradoxes  i only object to the inconsistency of those who profess the same belief and yet affect to look down with a contemptuous or compassionate smile on john wesley for rejecting the copernican system as incompatible therewith or who exclaim wonderful when they hear that sir matthew hale sent a crazy old woman to the gallows in honour of the witch of endor  in the latter instance it might i admit have been an erroneous though even at this day the all but universally received interpretation of the word which we have rendered by witch but i challenge these divines and their adherents to establish the compatibility of a belief in the modern astronomy and natural philosophy with their and wesleys doctrine respecting the inspired scriptures without reducing the doctrine itself to a plaything of wax or rather to a halfinflated bladder which when the contents are rarefied in the heat of rhetorical generalities swells out round and without a crease or wrinkle but bring it into the cool temperature of particulars and you may press and as it were except what part you likeso it be but one part at a timebetween your thumb and finger  now i pray you which is the more honest nay which the more reverential proceedingto play at fast and loose in this way or to say at once see here in these several writings one and the same holy spirit now sanctifying a chosen vessel and fitting it for the reception of heavenly truths proceeding immediately from the mouth of god and elsewhere working in frail and fallible men like ourselves and like ourselves instructed by gods word and laws  the first christian martyr had the form and features of an ordinary man nor are we taught to believe that these features were miraculously transfigured into superhuman symmetry but he being filled with the holy ghost they that looked steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel  even so has it ever been and so it ever will be with all who with humble hearts and a rightly disposed spirit scan the sacred volume  and they who read it with an evil heart of unbelief and an alien spirit what boots for them the assertion that every sentence was miraculously communicated to the nominal author by god himself  will it not rather present additional temptations to the unhappy scoffers and furnish them with a pretext of selfjustification  when in my third letter i first echoed the question why should i not the answers came crowding on my mind  i am well content however to have merely suggested the main points in proof of the positive harm which both historically and spiritually our religion sustains from this doctrine  of minor importance yet not to be overlooked are the forced and fantastic interpretations the arbitrary allegories and mystic expansions of proper names to which this indiscriminate bibliolatry furnished fuel spark and wind  a still greater evil and less attributable to the visionary humour and weak judgment of the individual expositors is the literal rendering of scripture in passages which the number and variety of images employed in different places to express one and the same verity plainly mark out for figurative  and lastly add to all these the strangein all other writings unexampledpractice of bringing together into logical dependency detached sentences from books composed at the distance of centuries nay sometimes a millennium from each other under different dispensations and for different objects  accommodations of elder scriptural phrasesthat favourite ornament and garnish of jewish eloquence incidental allusions to popular notions traditions apologues for example the dispute between the devil and the archangel michael about the body of moses jude 9 fancies and anachronisms imported from the synagogue of alexandria into palestine by or together with the septuagint version and applied as mere argumenta ad homines for example the delivery of the law by the disposition of angels acts vii 53 gal iii 19 heb ii 2these detached from their context and contrary to the intention of the sacred writer first raised into independent theses and then brought together to produce or sanction some new credendum for which neither separately could have furnished a pretence  by this strange mosaic scripture texts have been worked up into passable likenesses of purgatory popery the inquisition and other monstrous abuses  but would you have a protestant instance of the superstitious use of scripture arising out of this dogma passing by the cabbala of the hutchinsonian school as the dotage of a few weakminded individuals i refer you to bishop hackets sermons on the incarnation  and if you have read the same authors life of archbishop williams and have seen and felt as every reader of this latter work must see and feel his talent learning acuteness and robust good sense you will have no difficulty in determining the quality and character of a dogma which could engraft such fruits on such a tree  it will perhaps appear a paradox if after all these reasons i should avow that they weigh less in my mind against the doctrine than the motives usually assigned for maintaining and enjoining it such for instance are the arguments drawn from the anticipated loss and damage that would result from its abandonment as that it would deprive the christian world of its only infallible arbiter in questions of faith and duty suppress the only common and inappellable tribunal that the bible is the only religious bond of union and ground of unity among protestants and the like  for the confutation of this whole reasoning it might be sufficient to ask has it produced these effects  would not the contrary statement be nearer to the fact  what did the churches of the first four centuries hold on this point  to what did they attribute the rise and multiplication of heresies  can any learned and candid protestant affirm that there existed and exists no ground for the charges of bossuet and other eminent romish divines  it is no easy matter to know how to handle a party maxim so framed that with the exception of a single word it expresses an important truth but which by means of that word is made to convey a most dangerous error  the bible is the appointed conservatory an indispensable criterion and a continual source and support of true belief  but that the bible is the sole source that it not only contains but constitutes the christian religion that it is in short a creed consisting wholly of articles of faith that consequently we need no rule help or guide spiritual or historical to teach us what parts are and what are not articles of faithall being suchand the difference between the bible and the creed being this that the clauses of the latter are all unconditionally necessary to salvation but those of the former conditionally so that is as soon as the words are known to exist in any one of the canonical books and that under this limitation the belief is of the same necessity in both and not at all affected by the greater or lesser importance of the matter to be believedthis scheme differs widely from the preceding though its adherents often make use of the same words in expressing their belief  and this latter scheme i assert was brought into currency by and in favour of those by whom the operation of grace the aids of the spirit the necessity of regeneration the corruption of our nature in short all the peculiar and spiritual mysteries of the gospel were explained and diluted away  and how have these men treated this very bible  i who indeed prize and reverence this sacred library as of all outward means and conservatives of christian faith and practice the surest and the most reflective of the inward word i who hold that the bible contains the religion of christians but who dare not say that whatever is contained in the bible is the christian religion and who shrink from all question respecting the comparative worth and efficacy of the written word as weighed against the preaching of the gospel the discipline of the churches the continued succession of the ministry and the communion of saints lest by comparing them i should seem to detach them i tremble at the processes which the grotian divines without scruple carry on in their treatment of the sacred writers as soon as any texts declaring the peculiar tenets of our faith are cited against themeven tenets and mysteries which the believer at his baptism receives as the titlewrit and bosomroll of his adoption and which according to my scheme every christian born in churchmembership ought to bring with him to the study of the sacred scriptures as the masterkey of interpretation  whatever the doctrine of infallible dictation may be in itself in their hands it is to the last degree nugatory and to be paralleled only by the romish tenet of infallibilityin the existence of which all agree but where and in whom it exists stat adhuc sub lite  every sentence found in a canonical book rightly interpreted contains the dictum of an infallible mind but what the right interpretation is or whether the very words now extant are corrupt or genuinemust be determined by the industry and understanding of fallible and alas more or less prejudiced theologians  and yet i am told that this doctrine must not be resisted or called in question because of its fitness to preserve unity of faith and for the prevention of schism and sectarian byways  let the man who holds this language trace the history of protestantism and the growth of sectarian divisions ending with dr hawkers ultra calvinistic tracts and mr belshams new version of the testament and then let him tell me that for the prevention of an evil which already exists and which the boasted preventive itself might rather seem to have occasioned i must submit to be silenced by the first learned infidel who throws in my face the blessing of deborah or the cursings of david or the grecisms and heavier difficulties in the biographical chapters of the book of daniel or the hydrography and natural philosophy of the patriarchal ages  i must forego the means of silencing and the prospect of convincing an alienated brother because i must not thus answer my brother  what has all this to do with the truth and the worth of christianity  if you reject a priori all communion with the holy spirit there is indeed a chasm between us over which we cannot even make our voices intelligible to each other  but ifthough but with the faith of a seneca or an antonineyou admit the cooperation of a divine spirit in souls desirous of good even as the breath of heaven works variously in each several plant according to its kind character period of growth and circumstance of soil clime and aspect on what ground can you assume that its presence is incompatible with all imperfection in the subjecteven with such imperfection as is the natural accompaniment of the unripe season  if you call your gardener or husbandman to account for the plants or crops he is raising would you not regard the special purpose in each and judge of each by that which it was tending to  thorns are not flowers nor is the husk serviceable  but it was not for its thorns but for its sweet and medicinal flowers that the rose was cultivated and he who cannot separate the husk from the grain wants the power because sloth or malice has prevented the will  i demand for the bible only the justice which you grant to other books of grave authority and to other proved and acknowledged benefactors of mankind  will you deny a spirit of wisdom in lord bacon because in particular facts he did not possess perfect science or an entire immunity from the positive errors which result from imperfect insight  a davy will not so judge his great predecessor for he recognises the spirit that is now working in himself and which under similar defects of light and obstacles of error had been his guide and guardian in the morning twilight of his own genius  must not the kindly warmth awaken and vivify the seed in order that the stem may spring up and rejoice in the light  as the genial warmth to the informing light even so is the predisposing spirit to the revealing word  if i should reason thusbut why do i say if  i have reasoned thus with more than one serious and welldisposed sceptic and what was the answeryou speak rationally but seem to forget the subject i have frequently attended meetings of the british and foreign bible society where i have heard speakers of every denomination calvinist and arminian quaker and methodist dissenting ministers and clergymen nay dignitaries of the established church and still have i heard the same doctrinethat the bible was not to be regarded or reasoned about in the way that other good books are or may bethat the bible was different in kind and stood by itself  by some indeed this doctrine was rather implied than expressed but yet evidently implied  but by far the greater number of the speakers it was asserted in the strongest and most unqualified words that language could supply  what is more their principal arguments were grounded on the position that the bible throughout was dictated by omniscience and therefore in all its parts infallibly true and obligatory and that the men whose names are prefixed to the several books or chapters were in fact but as different pens in the hand of one and the same writer and the words the words of god himself  and that on this account all notes and comments were superfluous nay presumptuousa profane mixing of human with divine the notions of fallible creatures with the oracles of infallibilityas if gods meaning could be so clearly or fitly expressed in mans as in gods own words  but how often you yourself must have heard the same language from the pulpit  what could i reply to this  i could neither deny the fact nor evade the conclusionnamely that such is at present the popular belief yesi at length rejoinedi have heard this language from the pulpit and more than once from men who in any other place would explain it away into something so very different from the literal sense of their words as closely to resemble the contrary  and this indeed is the peculiar character of the doctrine that you cannot diminish or qualify but you reverse it  i have heard this language from men who knew as well as myself that the best and most orthodox divines have in effect disclaimed the doctrine inasmuch as they confess it cannot be extended to the words of the sacred writers or the particular importthat therefore the doctrine does not mean all that the usual wording of it expresses though what it does mean and why they continue to sanction this hyperbolical wording i have sought to learn from them in vain  but let a thousand orators blazon it at public meetings and let as many pulpits echo it surely it behoves you to inquire whether you cannot be a christian on your own faith and it cannot but be beneath a wise man to be an infidel on the score of what other men think fit to include in their christianity  now supposeand believe me the supposition will vary little from the factthat in consequence of these views the sceptics mind had gradually opened to the reception of all the truths enumerated in my first letter  suppose that the scriptures themselves from this time had continued to rise in his esteem and affectionthe better understood the more dear as in the countenance of one whom through a cloud of prejudices we have at least learned to love and value above all others new beauties dawn on us from day to day till at length we wonder how we could at any time have thought it other than most beautiful  studying the sacred volume in the light and in the freedom of a faith already secured at every fresh meeting my sceptic friend has to tell me of some new passage formerly viewed by him as a dry stick on a rotten branch which has budded and like the rod of aaron brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds let these results i say be supposedand shall i still be told that my friend is nevertheless an alien in the household of faith scrupulously orthodox as i know you to be will you tell me that i ought to have left this sceptic as i found him rather than attempt his conversion by such means or that i was deceiving him when i said to him  friend  the truth revealed through christ has its evidence in itself and the proof of its divine authority in its fitness to our nature and needs the clearness and cogency of this proof being proportionate to the degree of selfknowledge in each individual hearer  christianity has likewise its historical evidences and these as strong as is compatible with the nature of history and with the aims and objects of a religious dispensation  and to all these christianity itself as an existing power in the world and christendom as an existing fact with the no less evident fact of a progressive expansion give a force of moral demonstration that almost supersedes particular testimony  these proofs and evidences would remain unshaken even though the sum of our religion were to be drawn from the theologians of each successive century on the principle of receiving that only as divine which should be found in allquod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus  be only my friend as orthodox a believer as you would have abundant reason to be though from some accident of birth country or education the precious boon of the bible with its additional evidence had up to this moment been concealed from youand then read its contents with only the same piety which you freely accord on other occasions to the writings of men considered the best and wisest of their several ages  what you find therein coincident with your preestablished convictions you will of course recognise as the revealed word while as you read the recorded workings of the word and the spirit in the minds lives and hearts of spiritual men the influence of the same spirit on your own being and the conflicts of grace and infirmity in your own soul will enable you to discern and to know in and by what spirit they spake and actedas far at least as shall be needful for you and in the times of your need  thenceforward therefore your doubts will be confined to such parts or passages of the received canon as seem to you irreconcilable with known truths and at variance with the tests given in the scriptures themselves and as shall continue so to appear after you have examined each in reference to the circumstances of the writer or speaker the dispensation under which he lived the purpose of the particular passage and the intent and object of the scriptures at large  respecting these decide for yourself  and fear not for the result  i venture to tell it you beforehand  the result will be a confidence in the judgment and fidelity of the compilers of the canon increased by the apparent exceptions  for they will be found neither more nor greater than may well be supposed requisite on the one hand to prevent us from sinking into a habit of slothful undiscriminating acquiescence and on the other to provide a check against those presumptuous fanatics who would rend the urim and thummim from the breastplate of judgment and frame oracles by private divination from each letter of each disjointed gem uninterpreted by the priest and deserted by the spirit which shines in the parts only as it pervades and irradiates the whole  such is the language in which i have addressed a halting friend halting yet with his face toward the right path  if i have erred enable me to see my error  correct me or confirm me  farewell    letter v    yes my dear friend it is my conviction that in all ordinary cases the knowledge and belief of the christian religion should precede the study of the hebrew canon  indeed with regard to both testaments i consider oral and catechismal instruction as the preparative provided by christ himself in the establishment of a visible church  and to make the bible apart from the truths doctrines and spiritual experiences contained therein the subject of a special article of faith i hold an unnecessary and useless abstraction which in too many instances has the effect of substituting a barren acquiescence in the letter for the lively faith that cometh by hearing even as the hearing is productive of this faith because it is the word of god that is heard and preached  rom x 8 17  and here i mean the written word preserved in the armoury of the church to be the sword of faith out of the mouth of the preacher as christs ambassador and representative rev i 16 and out of the heart of the believer from generation to generation  who shall dare dissolve or loosen this holy bond this divine reciprocality of faith and scripture  who shall dare enjoin aught else as an object of saving faith beside the truths that appertain to salvation  the imposers take on themselves a heavy responsibility however defensible the opinion itself as an opinion may be  for by imposing it they counteract their own purposes  they antedate questions and thus in all cases aggravate the difficulty of answering them satisfactorily and not seldom they create difficulties that might never have occurred  but worst of all they convert things trifling or indifferent into mischievous pretexts for the wanton fearful difficulties for the weak and formidable objections for the inquiring  for what man fearing god dares think any the least point indifferent which he is required to receive as gods own immediate word miraculously infused miraculously recorded and by a succession of miracles preserved unblended and without changethrough all the pages of a large and multifold volume at each successive period at every sentence must the question recur dare i believedo i in my heart believethese words to have been dictated by an infallible reason and the immediate utterance of almighty godno  it is due to christian charity that a question so awful should not be put unnecessarily and should not be put out of time  the necessity i deny  and out of time the question must be put if after enumerating the several articles of the catholic faith i am bound to add and further you are to believe with equal faith as having the same immediate and miraculous derivation from god whatever else you shall hereafter read in any of the sixtysix books collected in the old and new testaments  i would never say this  yet let me not be misjudged as if i treated the scriptures as a matter of indifference  i would not say this but where i saw a desire to believe and a beginning love of christ i would there say there are likewise sacred writings which taken in connection with the institution and perpetuity of a visible church all believers revere as the most precious boon of god next to christianity itself and attribute both their communication and preservation to an especial providence  in them you will find all the revealed truths which have been set forth and offered to you clearly and circumstantially recorded and in addition to these examples of obedience and disobedience both in states and individuals the lives and actions of men eminent under each dispensation their sentiments maxims hymns and prayerstheir affections emotions and conflictsin all which you will recognise the influence of the holy spirit with a conviction increasing with the growth of your own faith and spiritual experience  farewell    letter vi    my dear friend  in my last two letters i have given the state of the argument as it would stand between a christian thinking as i do and a serious welldisposed deist  i will now endeavour to state the argument as between the former and the advocates for the popular beliefsuch of them i mean as are competent to deliver a dispassionate judgment in the cause  and again more particularly i mean the learned and reflecting part of them who are influenced to the retention of the prevailing dogma by the supposed consequences of a different view and especially by their dread of conceding to all alike simple and learned the privilege of picking and choosing the scriptures that are to be received as binding on their consciences  between these persons and myself the controversy may be reduced to a single question  is it safer for the individual and more conducive to the interests of the church of christ in its twofold character of pastoral and militant to conclude thus the bible is the word of god and therefore true holy and in all parts unquestionable  or thus the bible considered in reference to its declared ends and purposes is true and holy and for all who seek truth with humble spirits an unquestionable guide and therefore it is the word of god  in every generation and wherever the light of revelation has shone men of all ranks conditions and states of mind have found in this volume a correspondent for every movement toward the better felt in their own hearts the needy soul has found supply the feeble a help the sorrowful a comfort yea be the recipiency the least that can consist with moral life there is an answering grace ready to enter the bible has been found a spiritual world spiritual and yet at the same time outward and common to all  you in one place i in another all men somewhere or at some time meet with an assurance that the hopes and fears the thoughts and yearnings that proceed from or tend to a right spirit in us are not dreams or fleeting singularities no voices heard in sleep or spectres which the eye suffers but not perceives  as if on some dark night a pilgrim suddenly beholding a bright star moving before him should stop in fear and perplexity  but lo traveller after traveller passes by him and each being questioned whither he is going makes answer i am following yon guiding star  the pilgrim quickens his own steps and presses onward in confidence  more confident still will he be if by the wayside he should find here and there ancient monuments each with its votive lamp and on each the name of some former pilgrim and a record that there he had first seen or begun to follow the benignant star  no otherwise is it with the varied contents of the sacred volume the hungry have found food the thirsty a living spring the feeble a staff and the victorious warfarer songs of welcome and strains of music and as long as each man asks on account of his wants and asks what he wants no man will discover aught amiss or deficient in the vast and manychambered storehouse  but if instead of this an idler or scoffer should wander through the rooms peering and peeping and either detects or fancies he has detected here a rusted sword or pointless shaft there a tool of rude construction and superseded by later improvements and preserved perhaps to make us more grateful for themwhich of two things will a soberminded manwho from his childhood upward had been fed clothed armed and furnished with the means of instruction from this very magazine think the fitter plan  will he insist that the rust is not rust or that it is a rust sui generis intentionally formed on the steel for some mysterious virtue in it and that the staff and astrolabe of a shepherdastronomer are identical with or equivalent to the quadrant and telescope of newton or herschel  or will he not rather give the curious inquisitor joy of his mighty discoveries and the credit of them for his reward  or lastly put the matter thus  for more than a thousand years the bible collectively taken has gone hand in hand with civilisation science lawin short with the moral and intellectual cultivation of the species always supporting and often leading the way  its very presence as a believed book has rendered the nations emphatically a chosen race and this too in exact proportion as it is more or less generally known and studied  of those nations which in the highest degree enjoy its influences it is not too much to affirm that the differences public and private physical moral and intellectual are only less than what might be expected from a diversity in species  good and holy men and the best and wisest of mankind the kingly spirits of history enthroned in the hearts of mighty nations have borne witness to its influences have declared it to be beyond compare the most perfect instrument the only adequate organ of humanity the organ and instrument of all the gifts powers and tendencies by which the individual is privileged to rise above himselfto leave behind and lose his individual phantom self in order to find his true self in that distinctness where no division can bein the eternal i am the everliving word of whom all the elect from the archangel before time throne to the poor wrestler with the spirit until the breaking of day are but the fainter and still fainter echoes  and are all these testimonies and lights of experience to lose their value and efficiency because i feel no warrant of history or holy writ or of my own heart for denying that in the framework and outward case of this instrument a few parts may be discovered of less costly materials and of meaner workmanship  is it not a fact that the books of the new testament were tried by their consonance with the rule and according to the analogy of faith  does not the universally admitted canonthat each part of scripture must be interpreted by the spirit of the wholelead to the same practical conclusion as that for which i am now contendingnamely that it is the spirit of the bible and not the detached words and sentences that is infallible and absolute practical i say and spiritual too and what knowledge not practical or spiritual are we entitled to seek in our bibles  is the grace of god so confinedare the evidences of the present and actuating spirit so dim and doubtfulthat to be assured of the same we must first take for granted that all the life and coagency of our humanity is miraculously suspended  whatever is spiritual is eo nomine supernatural but must it be always and of necessity miraculous  miracles could open the eyes of the body and he that was born blind beheld his redeemer  but miracles even those of the redeemer himself could not open the eyes of the selfblinded of the sadducean sensualist or the self righteous phariseewhile to have said i saw thee under the fig tree sufficed to make a nathanael believe  to assert and to demand miracles without necessity was the vice of the unbelieving jews of old and from the rabbis and talmudists the infection has spread  and would i could say that the symptoms of the disease are confined to the churches of the apostasy  but all the miracles which the legends of monk or rabbi contain can scarcely be put in competition on the score of complication inexplicableness the absence of all intelligible use or purpose and of circuitous selffrustration with those that must be assumed by the maintainers of this doctrine in order to give effect to the series of miracles by which all the nominal composers of the hebrew nation before the time of ezra of whom there are any remains were successively transformed into automaton compositorsso that the original text should be in sentiment image word syntax and composition an exact impression of the divine copy  in common consistency the theologians who impose this belief on their fellow christians ought to insist equally on the superhuman origin and authority of the masora and to use more respectful terms than has been their wont of late in speaking of the false aristeass legend concerning the septuagint  and why the miracle should stop at the greek version and not include the vulgate i can discover no ground in reason  or if it be an objection to the latter that this belief is actually enjoined by the papal church yet the number of christians who road the lutheran the genevan or our own authorised bible and are ignorant of the dead languages greatly exceeds the number of those who have access to the septuagint  why refuse the writ of consecration to these or to the one at least appointed by the assertors own church  i find much more consistency in the opposition made under pretext of this doctrine to the proposals and publications of kennicot mill bentley and archbishop newcome  but i am weary of discussing a tenet which the generality of divines and the leaders of the religious public have ceased to defend and yet continue to assert or imply  the tendency manifested in this conduct the spirit of this and the preceding century on which not indeed the tenet itself but the obstinate adherence to it against the clearest light of reason and experience is groundedthis it is which according to my conviction gives the venom to the error and justifies the attempt to substitute a juster view  as long as it was the common and effective belief of all the reformed churches and by none was it more sedulously or more emphatically enjoined than by the great reformers of our church that by the good spirit were the spirits tried and that the light which beams forth from the written word was its own evidence for the children of light as long as christians considered their bible as a plenteous entertainment where every guest duly called and attired found the food needful and fitting for him and where eachinstead of troubling himself about the covers not within his reachbeholding all around him glad and satisfied praised the banquet and thankfully glorified the master of the feastso long did the tenetthat the scriptures were written under the special impulse of the holy ghost remain safe and profitable  nay in the sense and with the feelings in which it was asserted it was a trutha truth to which every spiritual believer now and in all times will bear witness by virtue of his own experience  and if in the overflow of love and gratitude they confounded the power and presence of the holy spirit working alike in weakness and in strength in the morning mists and in the clearness of the full day if they confounded this communion and co agency of divine grace attributable to the scripture generally with those express and expressly recorded communications and messages of the most high which form so large and prominent a portion of the same scriptures if in short they did not always duly distinguish the inspiration the imbreathment of the predisposing and assisting spirit from the revelation of the informing word it was at worst a harmless hyperbole  it was holden by all that if the power of the spirit from without furnished the text the grace of the same spirit from within must supply the comment  in the sacred volume they saw and reverenced the bounden wheatsheaf that stood upright and had obeisance from all the other sheaves the writings i mean of the fathers and doctors of the church sheaves depreciated indeed more or less with tares   and furrowweeds darnel and many an idle flower that grew mid the sustaining corn   yet sheaves of the same harvest the sheaves of brethren  nor did it occur to them that in yielding the more full and absolute honour to the sheaf of the highly favoured of their father they should be supposed to attribute the same worth and quality to the strawbands which held it together  the bread of life was there  and this in an especial sense was bread from heaven for no where had the same been found wild no soil or climate dared claim it for its natural growth in simplicity of heart they received the bible as the precious gift of god providential alike in origin preservation and distribution without asking the nice question whether all and every part were likewise miraculous  the distinction between the providential and the miraculous between the divine will working with the agency of natural causes and the same will supplying their place by a special fiatthis distinction has i doubt not many uses in speculative divinity  but its weightiest practical application is shown when it is employed to free the souls of the unwary and weak in faith from the nets and snares the insidious queries and captious objections of the infidel by calming the flutter of their spirits  they must be quieted before we can commence the means necessary for their disentanglement  and in no way can this be better effected than when the frightened captives are made to see in how many points the disentangling itself is a work of expedience rather than of necessity so easily and at so little loss might the web be cut or brushed away  first let their attention be fixed on the history of christianity as learnt from universal tradition and the writers of each successive generation  draw their minds to the fact of the progressive and still continuing fulfilment of the assurance of a few fishermen that both their own religion though of divine origin and the religion of their conquerors which included or recognised all other religious of the known world should be superseded by the faith in a man recently and ignominiously executed  then induce them to meditate on the universals of christian faithon christianity taken as the sum of belief common to greek and latin to romanist and protestant  show them that this and only this is the ordo traditionis quam tradiderunt apostoli iis quibus committebant ecclesias and which we should have been bound to follow says irenaeus si neque apostoli quidem scripturas reliquissent  this is that regula fidei that sacramentum symboli memoriae mandatum of which st augustine says noveritis hoc esse fidei catholicae fundamentum super quod edificium surrexit ecclesiae  this is the norma catholici et ecclesiastici sensus determined and explicated but not augmented by the nicene fathers as waterland has irrefragably shown a norm or model of faith grounded on the solemn affirmations of the bishops collected from all parts of the roman empire that this was the essential and unalterable gospel received by them from their predecessors in all the churches as the greek text which cannot be reproduced cui says irenaeus assentiunt multae gentes eorum qui in christum credunt sine charta et atramento scriptam habentes per spiritum in cordibus suis salutem et veterum traditionem diligenter custodientes  let the attention of such as have been shaken by the assaults of infidelity be thus directed and then tell me wherein a spiritual physician would be blameworthy if he carried on the cure by addressing his patient in this manner  all men of learning even learned unbelievers admit that the greater part of the objections urged in the popular works of infidelity to this or that verse or chapter of the bible prove only the ignorance or dishonesty of the objectors  but let it be supposed for a moment that a few remain hitherto unanswerednay that to your judgment and feelings they appear unanswerable  what follows  that the apostles and nicene creed is not credible the ten commandments not to be obeyed the clauses of the lords prayer not to be desired or the sermon on the mount not to be practised  see how the logic would look  david cruelly tortured the inhabitants of rabbah 2 sam xii 31 1 chron xx 3 and in several of the psalms he invokes the bitterest curses on his enemies  therefore it is not to be believed that the love of god toward us was manifested in sending his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 1 john iv 9  or abijah is said to have collected an army of 400000 men and jeroboam to have met him with an army of 800000 men each army consisting of chosen men 2 chron xiii 3 and making together a host of 1200000 and abijah to have slain 500000 out of the 800000  therefore the words which admonish us that if god so loved us we ought also to love one another 1 john iv 11 even our enemies yea to bless them that curse us and to do good to them that hate us matt v 44 cannot proceed from the holy spirit  or the first six chapters of the book of daniel contain several words and phrases irreconcilable with the commonly received dates and those chapters and the book of esther have a traditional and legendary character unlike that of the other historical books of the old testament therefore those other books by contrast with which the former appear suspicious and the historical document 1 cor xv 18 are not to be credited  we assuredly believe that the bible contains all truths necessary to salvation and that therein is preserved the undoubted word of god we assert likewise that besides these express oracles and immediate revelations there are scriptures which to the soul and conscience of every christian man bear irresistible evidence of the divine spirit assisting and actuating the authors and that both these and the former are such as to render it morally impossible that any passage of the small inconsiderable portion not included in one or other of these can supply either ground or occasion of any error in faith practice or affection except to those who wickedly and wilfully seek a pretext for their unbelief  and if in that small portion of the bible which stands in no necessary connection with the known and especial ends and purposes of the scriptures there should be a few apparent errors resulting from the state of knowledge then existing errors which the best and holiest men might entertain uninjured and which without a miracle those men must have entertained if i find no such miraculous prevention asserted and see no reason for supposing itmay i not to ease the scruples of a perplexed inquirer venture to say to him be it so  what then  the absolute infallibility even of the inspired writers in matters altogether incidental and foreign to the objects and purposes of their inspiration is no part of my creed  and even if a professed divine should follow the doctrine of the jewish church so far as not to attribute to the hagiographa in every word and sentence the same height and fulness of inspiration as to the law and the prophets i feel no warrant to brand him as a heretic for an opinion the admission of which disarms the infidel without endangering a single article of the catholic faithif to an unlearned but earnest and thoughtful neighbour i give the adviceuse the old testament to express the affections excited and to confirm the faith and morals taught you in the new and leave all the rest to the students and professors of theology and church history  you profess only to be a christianam i misleading my brother in christ  this i believe by my own dear experiencethat the more tranquilly an inquirer takes up the bible as he would any other body of ancient writings the livelier and steadier will be his impressions of its superiority to all other books till at length all other books and all other knowledge will be valuable in his eyes in proportion as they help him to a better understanding of his bible  difficulty after difficulty has been overcome from the time that i began to study the scriptures with free and unboding spirit under the conviction that my faith in the incarnate word and his gospel was secure whatever the result might bethe difficulties that still remain being so few and insignificant in my own estimation that i have less personal interest in the question than many of those who will most dogmatically condemn me for presuming to make a question of it  so much for scholarsfor men of like education and pursuits as myself  with respect to christians generally i object to the consequence drawn from the doctrine rather than to the doctrine itselfa consequence not only deducible from the premises but actually and imperiously deduced according to which every man that can but read is to sit down to the consecutive and connected perusal of the bible under the expectation and assurance that the whole is within his comprehension and that unaided by note or comment catechism or liturgical preparation he is to find out for himself what he is bound to believe and practise and that whatever he conscientiously understands by what he reads is to be his religion for he has found it in his bible and the bible is the religion of protestants  would i then withhold the bible from the cottager and the artisan heaven forfend  the fairest flower that ever clomb up a cottage window is not so fair a sight to my eyes as the bible gleaming through the lower panes  let it but be read as by such men it used to be read when they came to it as to a ground covered with manna even the bread which the lord had given for his people to eat where he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack  they gathered every man according to his eating  they came to it as to a treasurehouse of scriptures each visitant taking what was precious and leaving as precious for othersyea more says our worthy old churchhistorian fuller where the same man at several times may in his apprehension prefer several scriptures as best formerly most affected with one place for the present more delighted with another and afterwards conceiving comfort therein not so clear choose other places as more pregnant and pertinent to his purpose  thus god orders it that divers men and perhaps the same man at divers times make use of all his gifts gleaning and gathering comfort as it is scattered through the whole field of the scripture  farewell    letter vii    you are now my dear friend in possession of my whole mind on this pointone thing only excepted which has weighed with me more than all the rest and which i have therefore reserved for my concluding letter  this is the impelling principle or way of thinking which i have in most instances noticed in the assertors of what i have ventured to call bibliolatry and which i believe to be the main ground of its prevalence at this time and among men whose religious views are anything rather than enthusiastic  and i here take occasion to declare that my conviction of the danger and injury of this principle was and is my chief motive for bringing the doctrine itself into question the main error of which consists in the confounding of two distinct conceptionsrevelation by the eternal word and actuation of the holy spirit  the former indeed is not always or necessarily united with the latterthe prophecy of balaam is an instance of the contrarybut yet being ordinarily and only not always so united the term inspiration has acquired a double sense  first the term is used in the sense of information miraculously communicated by voice or vision and secondly where without any sensible addition or infusion the writer or speaker uses and applies his existing gifts of power and knowledge under the predisposing aiding and directing actuation of gods holy spirit  now between the first sense that is inspired revelation and the highest degree of that grace and communion with the spirit which the church under all circumstances and every regenerate member of the church of christ is permitted to hope and instructed to pray for there is a positive difference of kinda chasm the pretended overleaping of which constitutes imposture or betrays insanity  of the first kind are the law and the prophets no jot or tittle of which can pass unfulfilled and the substance and last interpretation of which passes not away for they wrote of christ and shadowed out the everlasting gospel  but with regard to the second neither the holy writersthe socalled hagiographithemselves nor any fair interpretations of scripture assert any such absolute diversity or enjoin the belief of any greater difference of degree than the experience of the christian world grounded on and growing with the comparison of these scriptures with other works holden in honour by the churches has established  and this difference i admit and doubt not that it has in every generation been rendered evident to as many as read these scriptures under the gracious influence of the spirit in which they were written  but alas this is not sufficient this cannot but be vague and unsufficing to those with whom the christian religion is wholly objective to the exclusion of all its correspondent subjective  it must appear vague i say to those whose christianity as matter of belief is wholly external and like the objects of sense common to all alike altogether historical an opus operatumits existing and present operancy in no respect differing from any other fact of history and not at all modified by the supernatural principle in which it had its origin in time  divines of this persuasion are actually though without their own knowledge in a state not dissimilar to that into which the latin church sank deeper amid deeper from the sixth to the fourteenth century during which time religion was likewise merely objective and superstitiousa letter proudly emblazoned and illuminated but yet a dead letter that was to be read by its own outward glories without the light of the spirit in the mind of the believer  the consequence was too glaring not to be anticipated and if possible prevented  without that spirit in each true believer whereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error in all things appertaining to salvation the consequence must beso many men so many minds  and what was the antidote which the priests and rabbis of this purely objective faith opposed to this peril  why an objective outward infallibility concerning which however the differences were scarcely less or fewer than those which it was to heal an infallibility which taken literally and unqualified became the source of perplexity to the welldisposed of unbelief to the wavering and of scoff and triumph to the common enemy and which was therefore to be qualified and limited and then it meant so munch and so little that to men of plain understandings and single hearts it meant nothing at all  it resided here  no there  no but in a third subject  nay neither here nor there nor in the third but in all three conjointly  but even this failed to satisfy and what was the final resourcethe doctrine of those who would not be called a protestant church but in which doctrine the fathers of protestantism in england would have found little other fault than that it might be affirmed as truly of the decisions of any other bishop as of the bishop of rome  the final resource was to restore what ought never to have been removed the correspondent subjective that is the assent and confirmation of the spirit promised to all true believers as proved and manifested in the reception of such decision by the church universal in all its rightful members  i comprise and conclude the sum of my conviction in this one sentence  revealed religion and i know of no religion not revealed is in its highest contemplation the unity that is the identity or coinherence of subjective and objective  it is in itself and irrelatively at once inward life and truth and outward fact and luminary  but as all power manifests itself in the harmony of correspondent opposites each supposing and supporting the other so has religion its objective or historic and ecclesiastical pole and its subjective or spiritual and individual pole  in the miracles and miraculous parts of religionboth in the first communication of divine truths and in the promulgation of the truths thus communicatedwe have the union of the two that is the subjective and supernatural displayed objectivelyoutwardly and phenomenally as subjective and supernatural  lastly in the scriptures as far as they are not included in the above as miracles and in the mind of the believing and regenerate reader and meditater there is proved to us the reciprocity or reciprocation of the spirit as subjective and objective which in conformity with the scheme proposed by me in aid of distinct conception and easy recollection i have named the indifference what i mean by this a familiar acquaintance with the more popular parts of luthers works especially his commentaries and the delightful volume of his table talk would interpret for me better than i can do for myself  but i do my best when i say that no christian probationer who is earnestly working out his salvation and experiences the conflict of the spirit with the evil and the infirmity within him and around him can find his own state brought before him and as it were antedated in writings reverend even for their antiquity and enduring permanence and far more and more abundantly consecrated by the reverence love and grateful testimonies of good men through the long succession of ages in every generation and under all states of minds and circumstances of fortune that no man i say can recognise his own inward experiences in such writings and not find an objectiveness a confirming and assuring outwardness and all the main characters of reality reflected therefrom on the spirit working in himself and in his own thoughts emotions and aspirations warring against sin and the motions of sin  the unsubstantial insulated self passes away as a stream but these are the shadows and reflections of the rock of ages and of the tree of life that starts forth from its side  on the other hand as much of reality as much of objective truth as the scriptures communicate to the subjective experiences of the believer so much of present life of living and effective import do these experiences give to the letter of these scriptures  in the one the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we have received the spirit of adoption in the other our spirit bears witness to the power of the word that it is indeed the spirit that proceedeth from god  if in the holy men thus actuated all imperfection of knowledge all participation in the mistakes and limits of their several ages had been excluded how could these writings be or become the history and example the echo and more lustrous image of the work and warfare of the sanctifying principle in us  if after all this and in spite of all this some captious litigator should lay hold of a text here or therest pauls cloak left at troas with carpus or a verse from the canticles and ask of what spiritual use is thisthe answer is ready it proves to us that nothing can be so trifling as not to supply an evil heart with a pretext for unbelief  archbishop leighton has observed that the church has its extensive and intensive states and that they seldom fall together  certain it is that since kings have been her nursing fathers and queens her nursing mothers our theologians seem to act in the spirit of fear rather than in that of faith and too often instead of inquiring after the truth in the confidence that whatever is truth must be fruitful of good to all who are in him that is true they seek with vain precautions to guard against the possible inferences which perverse and distempered minds may pretend whose whole christianity do what we willis and will remain nothing but a pretence  you have now my entire mind on this momentous question the grounds on which it rests and the motives which induce me to make it known and i now conclude by repeating my request  correct me or confirm me  farewell    essay on faith    faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being so far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses and hence by clear inference or implication to being generally as far as the same is not the object of the senses and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition or concomitant or consequence of the same  this will be best explained by an instance or example  that i am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as i would they should do unto me in other words a categorical that is primary and unconditional imperative that the maxim regula maxima or supreme rule of my actions both inward and outward should be such as i could without any contradiction arising therefrom will to be the law of all moral and rational beings this i say is a fact of which i am no less conscious though in a different way nor less assured than i am of any appearance presented by my outward senses  nor is this all but in the very act of being conscious of this in my own nature i know that it is a fact of which all men either are or ought to be conscious a fact the ignorance of which constitutes either the nonpersonality of the ignorant or the guilt in which latter case the ignorance is equivalent to knowledge wilfully darkened  i know that i possess this knowledge as a man and not as samuel taylor coleridge hence knowing that consciousness of this fact is the root of all other consciousness and the only practical contradistinction of man from the brutes we name it the conscience by the natural absence or presumed presence of which the law both divine and human determines whether x y z be a thing or a person the conscience being that which never to have had places the objects in the same order of things as the brutes for example idiots and to have lost which implies either insanity or apostasy  well this we have affirmed is a fact of which every honest man is as fully assured as of his seeing hearing or smelling  but though the former assurance does not differ from the latter in the degree it is altogether diverse in the kind the senses being morally passive while the conscience is essentially connected with the will though not always nor indeed in any case except after frequent attempts and aversions of will dependent on the choice  thence we call the presentations of the senses impressions those of the conscience commands or dictates  in the senses we find our receptivity and as far as our personal being is concerned we are passive but in the fact of the conscience we are not only agents but it is by this alone that we know ourselves to be suchnay that our very passiveness in this latter is an act of passiveness and that we are patient patientes not as in the other case simply passive  the result is the consciousness of responsibility and the proof is afforded by the inward experience of the diversity between regret and remorse  if i have sound ears and my companion speaks to me with a due proportion of voice i may persuade him that i did not hear but cannot deceive myself  but when my conscience speaks to me i can by repeated efforts render myself finally insensible to which add this other difference namely that to make myself deaf is one and the same thing with making my conscience dumb till at length i became unconscious of my conscience  frequent are the instances in which it is suspended and as it were drowned in the inundation of the appetites passions and imaginations to which i have resigned myself making use of my will in order to abandon my freewill and there are not i fear examples wanting of the conscience being utterly destroyed or of the passage of wickedness into madness that species of madness namely in which the reason is lost  for so long as the reason continues so long must the conscience exist either as a good conscience or as a bad conscience  it appears then that even the very first stepthat the initiation of the process the becoming conscious of a consciencepartakes of the nature of an act  it is an act in and by which we take upon ourselves an allegiance and consequently the obligation of fealty and this fealty or fidelity implying the power of being unfaithful it is the first and fundamental sense of faith  it is likewise the commencement of experience and the result of all other experience in other words conscience in this its simplest form must be supposed in order to consciousness that is to human consciousness brutes may be and are scions but those beings only who have an i scire possunt hoc vel illud una cum seipsis that is conscire vel scire aliquid mecum or to know a thing in relation to myself and in the act of knowing myself as acted upon by that something  now the third person could never have been distinguished from the first but by means of the second  there can be no he without a previous thou  much less could an i exist for us except as it exists during the suspension of the will as in dreams and the nature of brutes may be best understood by considering them as somnambulists this is a deep meditation though the position is capable of the strictest proof namely that there can be no i without a thou and that a thou is only possible by an equation in which i is taken as equal to thou and yet not the same  and this again is only possible by putting them in opposition as correspondent opposites or correlatives  in order to this a something must be affirmed in the one which is rejected in the other and this something is the will i do not will to consider myself as equal to myself for in the very act of constructing myself i i take it as the same and therefore as incapable of comparison that is of any application of the will if then i minus the will be the thesis thou plus will must be the antithesis but the equation of thou with i by means of a free act negativing the sameness in order to establish the equality is the true definition of conscience  but as without a thou there can be no you so without a you no they these or those and as all these conjointly form the materials and subjects of consciousness and the conditions of experience it is evident that conscience is the root of all consciousnessa fortiori the precondition of all experienceand that the conscience cannot have been in its first revelation deduced from experience  soon however experience comes into play  we learn that there are other impulses beside the dictates of conscience that there are powers within us and without us ready to usurp the throne of conscience and busy in tempting us to transfer our allegiance  we learn that there are many things contrary to conscience and therefore to be rejected and utterly excluded and many that can coexist with its supremacy only by being subjugated as beasts of burthen and others again as for instance the social tendernesses and affections and the faculties and excitations of the intellect which must be at least subordinated  the preservation of our loyalty and fealty under these trials and against these rivals constitutes the second sense of faith and we shall need but one more point of view to complete its full import  this is the consideration of what is presupposed in the human conscience  the answer is ready  as in the equation of the correlative i and thou one of the twin constituents is to be taken as plus will the other as minus will so is it here and it is obvious that the reason or superindividual of each man whereby he is a man is the factor we are to take as minus will and that the individual will or personalising principle of free agency arbitrement is miltons word is the factor marked plus will and again that as the identity or coinherence of the absolute will and the reason is the peculiar character of god so is the synthesis of the individual will and the common reason by the subordination of the former to the latter the only possible likeness or image of the prothesis or identity and therefore the required proper character of man  conscience then is a witness respecting the identity of the will and the reason effected by the self subordination of the will or self to the reason as equal to or representing the will of god  but the personal will is a factor in other moral synthesis for example appetite plus personal will  sensuality lust of power plus personal will  ambition and so on equally as in the synthesis on which the conscience is grounded  not this therefore but the other synthesis must supply the specific character of the conscience and we must enter into an analysis of reason  such as the nature and objects of the reason are such must be the functions and objects of the conscience  and the former we shall best learn by recapitulating those constituents of the total man which are either contrary to or disparate from the reason  i  reason and the proper objects of reason are wholly alien from sensation  reason is supersensual and its antagonist is appetite and the objects of appetite the lust of the flesh  ii  reason and its objects do not appertain to the world of the senses inward or outward that is they partake not of sense or fancy  reason is supersensuous and here its antagonist is the lust of the eye  iii  reason and its objects are not things of reflection association discursion discourse in the old sense of the word as opposed to intuition discursive or intuitive as milton has it reason does not indeed necessarily exclude the finite either in time or in space but it includes them eminenter  thus the prime mover of the material universe is affirmed to contain all motion as its cause but not to be or to suffer motion in itself  reason is not the faculty of the finite  but here i must premise the following  the faculty of the finite is that which reduces the confused impressions of sense to their essential formsquantity quality relation and in these action and reaction cause and effect and the like thus raises the materials furnished by the senses and sensations into objects of reflection and so makes experience possible  without it mans representative powers would be a delirium a chaos a scudding cloudage of shapes and it is therefore most appropriately called the understanding or substantiative faculty  our elder metaphysicians down to hobbes inclusively called this likewise discourse discuvsus discursio from its mode of action as not staying at any one object but running as it were to and fro to abstract generalise and classify  now when this faculty is employed in the service of the pure reason it brings out the necessary and universal truths contained in the infinite into distinct contemplation by the pure act of the sensuous imaginationthat is in the production of the forms of space and time abstracted from all corporeity and likewise of the inherent forms of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of particulars as in the case of geometry numeral mathematics universal logic and pure metaphysics  the discursive faculty then becomes what our shakespeare with happy precision calls discourse of reason  we will now take up our reasoning again from the words motion in itself  it is evident then that the reason as the irradiative power and the representative of the infinite judges the understanding as the faculty of the finite and cannot without error be judged by it when this is attempted or when the understanding in its synthesis with the personal will usurps the supremacy of the reason or affects to supersede the reason it is then what st paul calls the mind of the flesh greek text or the wisdom of this world  the result is that the reason is superfinite and in this relation its antagonist is the insubordinate understanding or mind of the flesh  iv  reason as one with the absolute will in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god and therefore for man the certain representative of the will of god is above the will of man as an individual will  we have seen in iii that it stands in antagonism to all mere particulars but here it stands in antagonism to all mere individual interests as so many selves to the personal will as seeking its objects in the manifestation of itself for itselfsit pro ratione voluntas whether this be realised with adjuncts as in the lust of the flesh and in the lust of the eye or without adjuncts as in the thirst and pride of power despotism egoistic ambition  the fourth antagonist then of reason is the lust of the will  corollary  unlike a million of tigers a million of men is very different from a million times one man  each man in a numerous society is not only coexistent with but virtually organised into the multitude of which he is an integral part  his idem is modified by the alter  and there arise impulses and objects from this synthesis of the alter et idem myself and my neighbour  this again is strictly analogous to what takes place in the vital organisation of the individual man  the cerebral system of the nerves has its correspondent antithesis in the abdominal system  but hence arises a synthesis of the two in the pectoral system as the intermediate and like a drawbridge at once conductor and boundary in the latter as objectised by the former arise the emotions the affections and in one word the passions as distinguished from the cognitions and appetites  now the reason has been shown to be superindividual generally and therefore not less so when the form of an individualisation subsists in the alter than when it is confined to the idem not less when the emotions have their conscious or believed object in another than when their subject is the individual personal self  for though these emotions affections attachments and the like are the prepared ladder by which the lower nature is taken up into and made to partake of the highest roomas we are taught to give a feeling of reality to the higher per medium commune with the lower and thus gradually to see the reality of the higher namely the objects of reason and finally to know that the latter are indeed and preeminently real as if you love your earthly parents whom you see by these means you will learn to love your heavenly father who is invisibleyet this holds good only so far as the reason is the president and its objects the ultimate aim and cases may arise in which the christ as the logos or redemptive reason declares he that loves father or another more than me is not worthy of me nay he that can permit his emotions to rise to an equality with the universal reason is in enmity with that reason here then reason appears as the love of god and its antagonist is the attachment to individuals wherever it exists in diminution of or in competition with the love which is reason  in these five paragraphs i have enumerated and explained the several powers or forces belonging or incidental to human nature which in all matters of reason the man is bound either to subjugate or subordinate to reason  the application to faith follows of its own accord  the first or most indefinite sense of faith is fidelity then fidelity under previous contract or particular moral obligation in this sense faith is fealty to a rightful superior  faith is the duty of a faithful subject to a rightful governor  then it is allegiance in active service fidelity to the liege lord under circumstances and amid the temptations of usurpation rebellion and intestine discord  next we seek for that rightful superior on our duties to whom all our duties to all other superiors on our faithfulness to whom all our bounden relations to all other objects of fidelity are founded  we must inquire after that duty in which all others find their several degrees and dignities and from which they derive their obligative force  we are to find a superior whose rights including our duties are presented to the mind in the very idea of that supreme being whose sovereign prerogatives are predicates implied in the subjects as the essential properties of a circle are coassumed in the first assumption of a circle consequently underived unconditional and as rationally unsusceptible so probably prohibitive of all further question  in this sense then faith is fidelity fealty allegiance of the moral nature to god in opposition to all usurpation and in resistance to all temptation to the placing any other claim above or equal with our fidelity to god  the will of god is the last ground and final aim of all our duties and to that the whole man is to be harmonised by subordination subjugation or suppression alike in commission and omission  but the will of god which is one with the supreme intelligence is revealed to man through the conscience  but the conscience which consists in an inappellable bearingwitness to the truth and reality of our reason may legitimately be construed with the term reason so far as the conscience is prescriptive while as approving or condemning it is the consciousness of the subordination or insubordination the harmony or discord of the personal will of man to and with the representative of the will of god  this brings me to the last and fullest sense of faith that is the obedience of the individual will to the reason in the lust of the flesh as opposed to the supersensual in the lust of the eye as opposed to the supersensuous in the pride of the understanding as opposed to the infinite in the greek text which cannot be reproduced in contrariety to the spiritual truth in the lust of the personal will as opposed to the absolute and universal and in the love of the creature as far as it is opposed to the love which is one with the reason namely the love of god  thus then to conclude  faith subsists in the synthesis of the reason and the individual will  by virtue of the latter therefore it must be an energy and inasmuch as it relates to the whole moral man it must be exerted in each and all of his constituents or incidents faculties and tendenciesit must be a total not a partiala continuous not a desultory or occasionalenergy  and by virtue of the former that is reason faith must be a light a form of knowing a beholding of truth  in the incomparable words of the evangelist therefore faith must be a light originating in the logos or the substantial reason which is coeternal and one with the holy will and which light is at the same time the life of men now as life is here the sum or collective of all moral and spiritual acts in suffering doing and being so is faith the source and the sum the energy and the principle of the fidelity of man to god by the subordination of his human will in all provinces of his nature to his reason as the sum of spiritual truth representing and manifesting the will divine    notes on the book of common prayer    prayer  a man may pray night and day and yet deceive himself but no man can be assured of his sincerity who does not pray  prayer is faith passing into act a union of the will and the intellect realising in an intellectual act  it is the whole man that prays  less than this is wishing or lipwork a charm or a mummery  pray always says the apostle  that is have the habit of prayer turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them with the idea of the redeeming god and even so reconverting your actions into thoughts  the sacrament of the eucharist  the best preparation for taking this sacrament better than any or all of the books or tracts composed for this end is to read over and over again and often on your kneesat all events with a kneeling and praying heartthe gospel according to st john till your mind is familiarised to the contemplation of christ the redeemer and mediator of mankind yea of every creature as the living and self subsisting word the very truth of all true being and the very being of all enduring truth the reality which is the substance and unity of all reality the light which lighteth every man so that what we call reason is itself a light from that light lumen a luce as the latin more distinctly expresses this fact  but it is not merely light but therein is life and it is the life of christ the co eternal son of god that is the only true lifegiving light of men we are assured and we believe that christ is god god manifested in the flesh  as god he must be present entire in every creature for how can god or indeed any spirit exist in partsbut he is said to dwell in the regenerate to come to them who receive him by faith in his name that is in his power and influence for this is the meaning of the word name in scripture when applied to god or his christ  where true belief exists christ is not only present with or among usfor so he is in every man even the most wicked but to us and for us  that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not  but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe in his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us  john i 914  againwe will come unto him and make our abode with him  john xiv 23  as truly and as really as your soul resides constitutively in your living body personally and substantially does christ dwell in every regenerate man  after this course of study you may then take up and peruse sentence by sentence the communion service the best of all comments on the scriptures appertaining to this mystery  and this is the preparation which will prove with gods grace the surest preventive of or antidote against the freezing poison the lethargising hemlock of the doctrine of the sacramentaries according to whom the eucharist is a mere practical metaphor in which things are employed instead of articulated sounds for the exclusive purpose of recalling to our minds the historical fact of our lords crucifixion in shortthe profaneness is with them not with mejust the same as when protestants drink a glass of wine to the glorious memory of william iii  true it is that the remembrance is one end of the sacrament but it is do this in remembrance of meof all that christ was and is hath done and is still doing for fallen mankind and of course of his crucifixion inclusively but not of his crucifixion alone  14 december 1827  companion to the altar  first then that we may come to this heavenly feast holy and adorned with the wedding garment matt xxii ii we must search our hearts and examine our consciences not only till we see our sins but until we hate them  but what if a man seeing his sin earnestly desire to hate it shall he not at the altar offer up at once his desire and the yet lingering sin and seek for strength  is not this sacrament medicine as well as food  is it an end only and not likewise the means  is it merely the triumphal feast or is it not even more truly a blessed refreshment for and during the conflict  this confession of sins must not be in general terms only that we are sinners with the rest of mankind but it must be a special declaration to god of all our most heinous sins in thought word and deed  luther was of a different judgment  he would have us feel and groan under our sinfulness and utter incapability of redeeming ourselves from the bondage rather than hazard the pollution of our imaginations by a recapitulation and renewing of sins and their images in detail  do not he says stand picking the flaws out one by one but plunge into the river and drown themi venture to be of luthers doctrine  communion service  in the first exhortation before the words meritorious cross and passion i should propose to insert his assumption of humanity his incarnation and  likewise a little lower down after the word sustenance i would insert as  for not in that sacrament exclusively but in all the acts of assimilative faith of which the eucharist is a solemn eminent and representative instance an instance and the symbol christ is our spiritual food and sustenance  marriage service  marriage simply as marriage is not the means for the procreation of children but for the humanisation of the offspring procreated therefore in the declaration at the beginning after the words procreation of children i would insert and as the means of securing to the children procreated enduring care and that they may be c  communion of the sick  third rubric at the end  but if a man either by reason of extremity of sickness c  i think this rubric in what i conceive to be its true meaning a precious doctrine as fully acquitting our church of all romish superstition respecting the nature of the eucharist in relation to the whole scheme of mans redemption  but the latter part of ithe doth eat and drink the body and blood of our saviour christ profitably to his souls health although he do not receive the sacrament with his mouthseems to me very incautiously expressed and scarcely to be reconciled with the churchs

for the most part but a galaxy or milky way as it were of certain obscure virtues without a name  does fortune favour fools  or how do you explain the origin of the proverb which differently worded is to be found in all the languages of europe  this proverb admits of various explanations according to the mood of mind in which it is used  it may arise from pity and the soothing persuasion that providence is eminently watchful over the helpless and extends an especial care to those who are not capable of caring for themselves  so used it breathes the same feeling as god tempers the wind to the shorn lambor the more sportive adage that the fairies take care of children and tipsy folk  the persuasion itself in addition to the general religious feeling of mankind and the scarcely less general love of the marvellous may be accounted for from our tendency to exaggerate all effects that seem disproportionate to their visible cause and all circumstances that are in any way strongly contrasted with our notions of the persons under them  secondly it arises from the safety and success which an ignorance of danger and difficulty sometimes actually assists in procuring inasmuch as it precludes the despondence which might have kept the more foresighted from undertaking the enterprise the depression which would retard its progress and those overwhelming influences of terror in cases where the vivid perception of the danger constitutes the greater part of the danger itself  thus men are said to have swooned and even died at the sight of a narrow bridge over which they had ridden the night before in perfect safety or at tracing the footmarks along the edge of a precipice which the darkness had concealed from them  a more obscure cause yet not wholly to be omitted is afforded by the undoubted fact that the exertion of the reasoning faculties tends to extinguish or bedim those mysterious instincts of skill which though for the most part latent we nevertheless possess in common with other animals  or the proverb may be used invidiously and folly in the vocabulary of envy or baseness may signify courage and magnanimity  hardihood and foolhardiness are indeed as different as green and yellow yet will appear the same to the jaundiced eye  courage multiplies the chances of success by sometimes making opportunities and always availing itself of them  and in this sense fortune may be said to favour fools by those who however prudent in their own opinion are deficient in valour and enterprise  again  an emiently good and wise man for whom the praises of the judicious have procured a high reputation even with the world at large proposes to himself certain objects and adapting the right means to the right end attains them but his objects not being what the world calls fortune neither money nor artificial rank his admitted inferiors in moral and intellectual worth but more prosperous in their worldly concerns are said to have been favoured by fortune and be slighted although the fools did the same in their line as the wise man in his they adapted the appropriate means to the desired end and so succeeded  in this sense the proverb is current by a misuse or a catachresis at least of both the words fortune and fools   how seldom friend a good great man inherits honour or wealth with all his worth and pains it sounds like stories from the land of spirits if any man obtain that which he merits or any merit that which he obtains  reply  for shame dear friend renounce this canting strain what wouldst thou have a good great man obtain place titles salary a gilded chain or throne of corses which his sword hath slain greatness and goodness are not means but ends hath he not always treasures always friends the good great man  three treasures love and light and calm thoughts regular as infants breath and three firm friends more sure than day and night himself his maker and the angel death s t c   but lastly there is doubtless a true meaning attached to fortune distinct both from prudence and from courage and distinct too from that absence of depressing or bewildering passions which according to my favourite proverb extremes meet the fool not seldom obtains in as great perfection by his ignorance as the wise man by the highest energies of thought and selfdiscipline  luck has a real existence in human affairs from the infinite number of powers that are in action at the same time and from the coexistence of things contingent and accidental such as to us at least are accidental with the regular appearances and general laws of nature  a familiar instance will make these words intelligible  the moon waxes and wanes according to a necessary law  the clouds likewise and all the manifold appearances connected with them are governed by certain laws no less than the phases of the moon  but the laws which determine the latter are known and calculable while those of the former are hidden from us  at all events the number and variety of their effects baffle our powers of calculation and that the sky is clear or obscured at any particular time we speak of in common language as a matter of accident  well at the time of the full moon but when the sky is completely covered with black clouds i am walking on in the dark aware of no particular danger  a sudden gust of wind rends the cloud for a moment and the moon emerging discloses to me a chasm or precipice to the very brink of which i had advanced my foot  this is what is meant by luck and according to the more or less serious mood or habit of our mind we exclaim how lucky or how providential  the copresence of numberless phaenomena which from the complexity or subtlety of their determining causes are called contingencies and the coexistence of these with any regular or necessary phaenomenon as the clouds with the moon for instance occasion coincidences which when they are attended by any advantage or injury and are at the same time incapable of being calculated or foreseen by human prudence form good or ill luck  on a hot sunshiny afternoon came on a sudden storm and spoilt the farmers hay and this is called ill luck  we will suppose the same event to take place when meteorology shall have been perfected into a science provided with unerring instruments but which the farmer had neglected to examine  this is no longer ill luck but imprudence now apply this to our proverb  unforeseen coincidences may have greatly helped a man yet if they have done for him only what possibly from his own abilities he might have effected for himself his good luck will excite less attention and the instances be less remembered  that clever men should attain their objects seems natural and we neglect the circumstances that perhaps produced that success of themselves without the intervention of skill or foresight but we dwell on the fact and remember it as something strange when the same happens to a weak or ignorant man  so too though the latter should fail in his undertakings from concurrences that might have happened to the wisest man yet his failure being no more than might have been expected and accounted for from his folly it lays no hold on our attention but fleets away among the other undistinguished waves in which the stream of ordinary life murmurs by us and is forgotten  had it been as true as it was notoriously false that those allembracing discoveries which have shed a dawn of science on the art of chemistry and give no obscure promise of some one great constitutive law in the light of which dwell dominion and the power of prophecy if these discoveries instead of having been as they really were preconcerted by meditation and evolved out of his own intellect had occurred by a set of lucky accidents to the illustrious father and founder of philosophic alchemy if they presented themselves to sir humphry davy exclusively in consequence of his luck in possessing a particular galvanic battery if this battery as far as davy was concerned had itself been an accident and not as in point of fact it was desired and obtained by him for the purpose of insuring the testimony of experience to his principles and in order to bind down material nature under the inquisition of reason and force from her as by torture unequivocal answers to prepared and preconceived questionsyet still they would not have been talked of or described as instances of luck but as the natural results of his admitted genius and known skill  but should an accident have disclosed similar discoveries to a mechanic at birmingham or sheffield and if the man should grow rich in consequence and partly by the envy of his neighbours and partly with good reason be considered by them as a man below par in the general powers of his understanding then oh what a lucky fellow well fortune does favour foolsthats certain  it is always so and forthwith the exclaimer relates half a dozen similar instances thus accumulating the one sort of facts and never collecting the other we do as poets in their diction and quacks of all denominations do in their reasoning put a part for the whole and at once soothe our envy and gratify our love of the marvellous by the sweeping proverb fortune favours fools    essay ii    quod me non movet aestimatione verum est greek text which cannot be reproduced mei sodalis catull xii  translationit interests not by any conceit of its value but it is a remembrance of my honoured friend  the philosophic ruler who secured the favours of fortune by seeking wisdom and knowledge in preference to them has pathetically observedthe heart knoweth its own bitterness and there is a joy in which the stranger intermeddleth not  a simple question founded on a trite proverb with a discursive answer to it would scarcely suggest to an indifferent person any other notion than that of a mind at ease amusing itself with its own activity  once before i believe about this time last year i had taken up the old memorandum book from which i transcribed the preceding essay and they had then attracted my notice by the name of the illustrious chemist mentioned in the last illustration  exasperated by the base and cowardly attempt that had been made to detract from the honours due to his astonishing genius i had slightly altered the concluding sentences substituting the more recent for his earlier discoveries and without the most distant intention of publishing what i then wrote i had expressed my own convictions for the gratification of my own feelings and finished by tranquilly paraphrasing into a chemical allegory the homeric adventure of menelaus with proteus  oh with what different feelings with what a sharp and sudden emotion did i reperuse the same question yestermorning having by accident opened the book at the page upon which it was written  i was moved for it was admiral sir alexander ball who first proposed the question to me and the particular satisfaction which he expressed had occasioned me to note down the substance of my reply  i was moved because to this conversation i was indebted for the friendship and confidence with which he afterwards honoured me and because it recalled the memory of one of the most delightful mornings i ever passed when as we were riding together the same person related to me the principal events of his own life and introduced them by adverting to this conversation  it recalled too the deep impression left on my mind by that narrativethe impression that i had never known any analogous instance in which a man so successful had been so little indebted to fortune or lucky accidents or so exclusively both the architect and builder of his own success  the sum of his history may be comprised in this one sentencehaec sab numine nobismet fecimas sapientia duce fortune permittente  ie these things under god we have done for ourselves through the guidance of wisdom and with the permission of fortune  luck gave him nothing  in her most generous moods she only worked with him as with a friend not for him as for a fondling but more often she simply stood neuter and suffered him to work for himself  ah how could i be otherwise than affected by whatever reminded me of that daily and familiar intercourse with him which made the fifteen months from may 1804 to october 1805 in many respects the most memorable and instructive period of my life ah how could i be otherwise than most deeply affected when there was still lying on my table the paper which the day before had conveyed to me the unexpected and most awful tidings of this mans death his death in the fulness of all his powers in the rich autumn of ripe yet undecaying manhood  i once knew a lady who after the loss of a lovely child continued for several days in a state of seeming indifference the weather at the same time as if in unison with her being calm though gloomy till one morning a burst of sunshine breaking in upon her and suddenly lighting up the room where she was sitting she dissolved at once into tears and wept passionately  in no very dissimilar manner did the sudden gleam of recollection at the sight of this memorandum act on myself  i had been stunned by the intelligence as by an outward blow till this trifling incident startled and disentranced me the sudden pang shivered through my whole frame and if i repressed the outward shows of sorrow it was by force that i repressed them and because it is not by tears that i ought to mourn for the loss of sir alexander ball  he was a man above his age but for that very reason the age has the more need to have the masterfeatures of his character portrayed and preserved  this i feel it my duty to attempt and this alone for having received neither instructions nor permission from the family of the deceased i cannot think myself allowed to enter into the particulars of his private history strikingly as many of them would illustrate the elements and composition of his mind  for he was indeed a living confutation of the assertion attributed to the prince of conde that no man appeared great to his valet de chambrea saying which i suspect owes its currency less to its truth than to the envy of mankind and the misapplication of the word great to actions unconnected with reason and free will  it will be sufficient for my purpose to observe that the purity and strict propriety of his conduct which precluded rather than silenced calumny the evenness of his temper and his attentive and affectionate manners in private life greatly aided and increased his public utility and if it should please providence that a portion of his spirit should descend with his mantle the virtues of sir alexander ball as a master a husband and a parent will form a no less remarkable epoch in the moral history of the maltese than his wisdom as a governor has made in that of their outward circumstances  that the private and personal qualities of a first magistrate should have political effects will appear strange to no reflecting englishman who has attended to the workings of mens minds during the first ferment of revolutionary principles and must therefore have witnessed the influence of our own sovereigns domestic character in counteracting them  but in malta there were circumstances which rendered such an example peculiarly requisite and beneficent  the very existence for so many generations of an order of lay celibates in that island who abandoned even the outward shows of an adherence to their vow of chastity must have had pernicious effects on the morals of the inhabitants  but when it is considered too that the knights of malta had been for the last fifty years or more a set of useless idlers generally illiterate for they thought literature no part of a soldiers excellence and yet effeminate for they were soldiers in name only when it is considered that they were moreover all of them aliens who looked upon themselves not merely as of a superior rank to the native nobles but as beings of a different race i had almost said species from the maltese collectively and finally that these men possessed exclusively the government of the island it may be safely concluded that they were little better than a perpetual influenza relaxing and diseasing the hearts of all the families within their sphere of influence  hence the peasantry who fortunately were below their reach notwithstanding the more than childish ignorance in which they were kept by their priests yet compared with the middle and higher classes were both in mind and body as ordinary men compared with dwarfs  every respectable family had some one knight for their patron as a matter of course and to him the honour of a sister or a daughter was sacrificed equally as a matter of course  but why should i thus disguise the truth  alas in nine instances out of ten this patron was the common paramour of every female in the family  were i composing a state memorial i should abstain from all allusion to moral good or evil as not having now first to learn that with diplomatists and with practical statesmen of every denomination it would preclude all attention to its other contents and have no result but that of securing for its authors name the official private mark of exclusion or dismission as a weak or suspicions person  but among those for whom i am now writing there are i trust many who will think it not the feeblest reason for rejoicing in our possession of malta and not the least worthy motive for wishing its retention that one source of human misery and corruption has been dried up  such persons will hear the name of sir alexander ball with additional reverence as of one who has made the protection of great britain a double blessing to the maltese and broken the bonds of iniquity as well as unlocked the fetters of political oppression  when we are praising the departed by our own firesides we dwell most fondly on those qualities which had won our personal affection and which sharpen our individual regrets  but when impelled by a loftier and more meditative sorrow we would raise a public monument to their memory we praise them appropriately when we relate their actions faithfully and thus preserving their example for the imitation of the living alleviate the loss while we demonstrate its magnitude my funeral eulogy of sir alexander ball must therefore he a narrative of his life and this friend of mankind will be defrauded of honour in proportion as that narrative is deficient and fragmentary  it shall however be as complete as my information enables and as prudence and a proper respect for the feelings of the living permit me to render it  his fame i adopt the words of our elder writers is so great throughout the world that he stands in no need of an encomium and yet his worth is much greater these his fame  it is impossible not to speak great things of him and yet it will be very difficult to speak what he deserves  but custom requires that something should be said it is a duty and a debt which we owe to ourselves and to mankind not less than to his memory and i hope his great soul if it hath any knowledge of what is done here below will not be offended at the smallness even of my offering  ah how little when among the subjects of the friend i promised characters met with in real life did i anticipate the sad event which compels one to weave on a cypress branch those sprays of laurel which i had destined for his bust not his monument  he lived as we should all live and i doubt not left the world as we should all wish to leave it  such is the power of dispensing blessings which providence has attached to the truly great and good that they cannot even die without advantage to their fellowcreatures for death consecrates their example and the wisdom which might have been slighted at the counciltable becomes oracular from the shrine those rare excellences which make our grief poignant make it likewise profitable and the tears which wise men shed for the departure of the wise are among those that are preserved in heaven it is the fervent aspiration of my spirit that i may so perform the task which private gratitude and public duty impose on me that as god hath cut this tree of paradise down from its seat of earth the dead trunk may yet support a part of the declining temple or at least serve to kindle the fire on the altar    essay iii    si partem tacuisse velim quodeumque relinquam majus erit  veteres actus primamque juventam prosequar  ad sese mentem praesentia ducunt

resplendent  shall i relate his strength in arms  he performed yet greater things unarmed  there is something says harrington in the preliminaries to the oceana first in the making of a commonwealth then in the governing of it and last of all in the leading of its armies which though there be great divines great lawyers great men in all ranks of life seems to be peculiar only to the genius of a gentleman  for so it is in the universal series of history that if any man has founded a commonwealth he was first a gentleman  such also he adds as have got any fame as civil governors have been gentlemen or persons of known descents  sir alexander ball was a gentleman by birth a younger brother of an old and respectable family in gloucestershire he went into the navy at an early age from his own choice and as he himself told me in consequence of the deep impression and vivid images left on his mind by the perusal of robinson crusoe  it is not my intention to detail the steps of his promotion or the services in which he was engaged as a subaltern  i recollect many particulars indeed but not the dates with such distinctness as would enable me to state them as it would be necessary to do if i stated them at all in the order of time  these dates might perhaps have been procured from the metropolis but incidents that are neither characteristic nor instructive even such as would be expected with reason in a regular life are no part of my plan while those which are both interesting and illustrative i have been precluded from mentioning some from motives which have been already explained and others from still higher considerations  the most important of these may be deduced from a reflection with which he himself once concluded a long and affecting narration  namely that no body of men can for any length of time be safely treated otherwise than as rational beings and that therefore the education of the lower classes was of the utmost consequence to the permanent security of the empire even for the sake of our navy  the dangers apprehended from the education of the lower classes arose he said entirely from its not being universal and from the unusualness in the lowest classes of those accomplishments which he like dr bell regarded as one of the means of education and not as education itself  if he observed the lower classes in general possessed but one eye or one arm the few who were so fortunate as to possess two would naturally become vain and restless and consider themselves as entitled to a higher situation  he illustrated this by the faults attributed to learned women and that the same objections were formerly made to educating women at all namely that their knowledge made them vain affected and neglectful of their proper duties  now that all women of condition are well educated we hear no more of these apprehensions or observe any instances to justify them  yet if a lady understood the greek onetenth part as well as the whole circle of her acquaintances understood the french language it would not surprise us to find her less pleasing from the consciousness of her superiority in the possession of an unusual advantage  sir alexander ball quoted the speech of an old admiral one of whose two great wishes was to have a ships crew composed altogether of serious scotchmen  he spoke with great reprobation of the vulgar notion the worse man the better sailor  courage he said was the natural product of familiarity with danger which thoughtlessness would oftentimes turn into foolhardiness and that he always found the most usefully brave sailors the gravest and most rational of his crew  the best sailor he had ever had first attracted his notice by the anxiety which he expressed concerning the means of remitting some money which he had received in the west indies to his sister in england and this man without any tinge of methodism was never heard to swear an oath and was remarkable for the firmness with which he devoted a part of every sunday to the reading of his bible i record this with satisfaction as a testimony of great weight and in all respects unexceptionable for sir alexander balls opinions throughout life remained unwarped by zealotry and were those of a mind seeking after truth in calmness and complete selfpossession he was much pleased with an unsuspicious testimony furnished by dampier vol ii part 2 page 89  i have particularly observed writes this famous old navigator there and in other places that such as had been wellbred were generally most careful to improve their time and would be very industrious and frugal where there was any probability of considerable gain but on the contrary such as had been bred up in ignorance and hard labour when they came to have plenty would extravagantly squander away their time and money in drinking and making a bluster  indeed it is a melancholy proof how strangely power warps the minds of ordinary men that there can be a doubt on this subject among persons who have been themselves educated  it tempts a suspicion that unknown to themselves they find a comfort in the thought that their inferiors are something less than men or that they have an uneasy halfconsciousness that if this were not the case they would themselves have no claim to be their superiors  for a sober education naturally inspires self respect  but he who respects himself will respect others and he who respects both himself and others must of necessity be a brave man the great importance of this subject and the increasing interest which good men of all denominations feel in the bringing about of a national education must be my excuse for having entered so minutely into sir alexander balls opinions on this head in which however i am the more excusable being now on that part of his life which i am obliged to leave almost a blank  during his lieutenancy and after he had perfected himself in the knowledge and duties of a practical sailor he was compelled by the state of his health to remain in england for a considerable length of time  of this he industriously availed himself to the acquirement of substantial knowledge from books and during his whole life afterwards he considered those as his happiest hours which without any neglect of official or professional duty he could devote to reading  he preferred indeed he almost confined himself to history political economy voyages and travels natural history and latterly agricultural works in short to such books as contain specific facts or practical principles capable of specific application  his active life and the particular objects of immediate utility some one of which he had always in his view precluded a taste for works of pure speculation and abstract science though he highly honoured those who were eminent in these respects and considered them as the benefactors of mankind no less than those who afterwards discovered the mode of applying their principles or who realised them in practice  works of amusement as novels plays etc did not appear even to amuse him and the only poetical composition of which i have ever heard him speak was a manuscript poem written by one of my friends which i read to his lady in his presence  to my surprise he afterwards spoke of this with warm interest but it was evident to me that it was not so much the poetic merit of the composition that had interested him as the truth and psychological insight with which it represented the practicability of reforming the most hardened minds and the various accidents which may awaken the most brutalised person to a recognition of his nobler being  i will add one remark of his own knowledge acquired from books which appears to me both just and valuable  the prejudice against such knowledge he said and the custom of opposing it to that which is learnt by practice originated in those times when books were almost confined to theology and to logical and metaphysical subtleties but that at present there is scarcely any practical knowledge which is not to be found in books  the press is the means by which intelligent men now converse with each other and persons of all classes and all pursuits convey each the contribution of his individual experience  it was therefore he said as absurd to hold bookknowledge at present in contempt as it would be for a man to avail himself only of his own eyes and ears and to aim at nothing which could not be performed exclusively by his own arms the use and necessity of personal experience consisted in the power of choosing and applying what had been read and of discriminating by the light of analogy the practicable from the impracticable and probability from mere plausibility  without a judgment matured and steadied by actual experience a man would read to little or perhaps to bad purpose but yet that experience which in exclusion of all other knowledge has been derived from one mans life is in the present day scarcely worthy of the nameat least for those who are to act in the higher and wider spheres of duty  an ignorant general he said inspired him with terror for if he were too proud to take advice he would ruin himself by his own blunders and if hewere not by adopting the worst that was offered  a great genius may indeed form an exception but we do not lay down rules in expectation of wonders  a similar remark i remember to have heard from a gallant officer who to eminence in professional science and the gallantry of a tried soldier adds all the accomplishments of a sound scholar and the powers of a man of genius  one incident which happened at this period of sir alexanders life is so illustrative of his character and furnishes so strong a presumption that the thoughtful humanity by which he was distinguished was not wholly the growth of his latter years that though it may appear to some trifling in itself i will insert it in this place with the occasion on which it was communicated to me  in a large party at the grand masters palace i had observed a naval officer of distinguished merit listening to sir alexander ball whenever he joined in the conversation with so marked a pleasure that it seemed as if his very voice independent of what he said had been delightful to him and once as he fixed his eyes on sir alexander ball i could not but notice the mixed expressions of awe and affection which gave a more than common interest to so manly a countenance  during his stay in the island this officer honoured me not unfrequently with his visits and at the conclusion of my last conversation with him in which i had dwelt on the wisdom of the governors conduct in a recent and difficult emergency he told me that he considered himself as indebted to the same excellent person for that which was dearer to him than his life  sir alexander ball said he has i dare say forgotten the circumstance but when he was lieutenant ball he was the officer whom i accompanied in my first boat expedition being then a midshipman and only in my fourteenth year  as we were rowing up to the vessel which we were to attack amid a discharge of musketry i was overpowered by fear my knees trembled under me and i seemed on the point of fainting away lieutenant ball who saw the condition i was in placed himself close beside me and still keeping his countenance directed toward the enemy took hold of my hand and pressing it in the most friendly manner said in a low voice courage my dear boy dont be afraid of yourself you will recover in a minute or so  i was just the same when i first went out in this way  sir added the officer to me it was as if an angel had put a new soul into me  with the feeling that i was not yet dishonoured the whole burden of agony was removed and from that moment i was as fearless and forward as the oldest of the boats crew and on our return the lieutenant spoke highly of me to our captain  i am scarcely less convinced of my own being than that i should have been what i tremble to think of if instead of his humane encouragement he had at that moment scoffed threatened or reviled me  and this was the more kind in him because as i afterwards understood his own conduct in his first trial had evinced to all appearances the greatest fearlessness and that he said this therefore only to give me heart and restore me to my own good opinion  this anecdote i trust will have some weight with those who may have lent an ear to any of those vague calumnies from which no naval commander can secure his good name who knowing the paramount necessity of regularity and strict discipline in a ship of war adopts an appropriate plan for the attainment of these objects and remains constant and immutable in the execution  to an athenian who in praising a public functionary had said that every one either applauded him or left him without censure a philosopher replied how seldom then must he have done his duty  of sir alexander balls character as captain ball of his measures as a disciplinarian and of the wise and dignified principle on which he grounded those measures i have already spoken in a former part of this work and must content myself therefore with entreating the reader to reperuse that passage as belonging to this place and as a part of the present narration  ah little did i expect at the time i wrote that account that the motives of delicacy which then impelled me to withhold the name would so soon be exchanged for the higher duty which now justifies me in adding it  at the thought of such events the language of a tender superstition is the voice of nature itself and those facts alone presenting themselves to our memory which had left an impression on our hearts we assent to and adopt the poets pathetic complaint   o sir the good die first and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket wordsworth   thus the humane plan described in the pages now referred to that a system in pursuance of which the captain of a manofwar uniformly regarded his sentences not as dependent on his own will or to be affected by the state of his feelings at the moment but as the pre established determinations of known laws and himself as the voice of the law in pronouncing the sentence and its delegate in enforcing the execution could not but furnish occasional food to the spirit of detraction must be evident to every reflecting mind  it is indeed little less than impossible that he who in order to be effectively humane determines to be inflexibly just and who is inexorable to his own feelings when they would interrupt the course of justice who looks at each particular act by the light of all its consequences and as the representative of ultimate good or evil should not sometimes be charged with tyranny by weak minds  and it is too certain that the calumny will be willingly believed and eagerly propagated by all those who would shun the presence of an eye keen in the detection of imposture incapacity and misconduct and of a resolution as steady in their exposure  we soon hate the man whose qualities we dread and thus have a double interest an interest of passion as well as of policy in decrying and defaming him  but good men will rest satisfied with the promise made to them by the divine comforter that by her children shall wisdom be justified    essay iv     the generous spirit who when brought among the tasks of real life hath wrought upon the plan that pleased his childish thought whose high endeavours are an inward light that makes the path before him always bright who doomd to go in company with pain and fear and bloodshed miserable train turns his necessity to glorious gain by objects which might force the soul to abate her feeling rendered more compassionate wordsworth  at the close of the american war captain ball was entrusted with the protection and convoying of an immense mercantile fleet to america and by his great prudence and unexampled attention to the interests of all and each endeared his name to the american merchants and laid the foundation of that high respect and predilection which both the americans and their government ever afterwards entertained for him  my recollection does not enable me to attempt any accuracy in the date or circumstances or to add the particulars of his services in the west indies and on the coast of america i now therefore merely allude to the fact with a prospective reference to opinions and circumstances which i shall have to mention hereafter  shortly after the general peace was established captain ball who was now a married man passed some time with his lady in france and if i mistake not at nantes  at the same time and in the same town among the other english visitors lord then captain nelson happened to be one  in consequence of some punctilio as to whose business it was to pay the compliment of the first call they never met and this trifling affair occasioned a coldness between the two naval commanders or in truth a mutual prejudice against each other  some years after both their ships being together close off minorca and near port mahon a violent storm nearly disabled lord nelsons vessel and in addition to the fury of the wind it was night time and the thickest darkness  captain ball however brought his vessel at length to nelsons assistance took his ship in tow and used his best endeavours to bring her and his own vessel into port mahon  the difficulties and the dangers increased  nelson considered the case of his own ship as desperate and that unless she was immediately left to her own fate both vessels would inevitably be lost  he therefore with the generosity natural to him repeatedly requested captain ball to let him loose and on captain balls refusal he became impetuous and enforced his demand with passionate threats captain ball then himself took the speakingtrumpet which the fury of the wind and waves rendered necessary and with great solemnity and without the least disturbance of temper called out in reply i feel confident that i can bring you in safe i therefore must not and by the help of almighty god i will not leave you  what he promised he performed and after they were safely anchored nelson came on board of balls ship and embracing him with all the ardour of acknowledgment exclaimed a friend in need is a friend indeed at this time and on this occasion commenced that firm and perfect friendship between these two great men which was interrupted only by the death of the former  the pleasing task of dwelling on this mutual attachment i defer to that part of the present sketch which will relate to sir alexander balls opinions of men and things  it will be sufficient for the present to say that the two men whom lord nelson especially honoured were sir thomas troubridge and sir alexander ball and once when they were both present on some allusion made to the loss of his arm he replied who shall dare tell me that i want an arm when i have three right armsthis putting forward his own and ball and troubridge  in the plan of the battle of the nile it was lord nelsons design that captains troubridge and ball should have led up the attack  the former was stranded and the latter by accident of the wind could not bring his ship into the line of battle till some time after the engagement had become general  with his characteristic forecast and activity of which may not improperly be called practical imagination he had made arrangements to meet every probable contingency  all the shrouds and sails of the ship not absolutely necessary for its immediate management were thoroughly wetted and so rolled up that they were as hard and as little inflammable as so many solid cylinders of wood every sailor had his appropriate place and function and a certain number were appointed as the firemen whose sole duty it was to be on the watch if any part of the vessel should take fire and to these men exclusively the charge of extinguishing it was committed  it was already dark when he brought his ship into action and laid her alongside lorient  one particular only i shall add to the known account of the memorable engagement between these ships and this i received from sir alexander ball himself  he had previously made a combustible preparation but which from the nature of the engagement to be expected he had purposed to reserve for the last emergency  but just at the time when from several symptoms he had every reason to believe that the enemy would soon strike to him one of the lieutenants without his knowledge threw in the combustible matter and this it was that occasioned the tremendous explosion of that vessel which with the deep silence and interruption of the engagement which succeeded to it has been justly deemed the sublimest war incident recorded in history  yet the incident which followed and which has not i believe been publicly made known is scarcely less impressive though its sublimity is of a different character  at the renewal of the battle captain ball though his ship was then on fire in three different parts laid her alongside a french eightyfour and a second longer obstinate contest began  the firing on the part of the french ship having at length for some time slackened and then altogether ceased and yet no sign given of surrender the senior lieutenant came to captain ball and informed him that the hearts of his men were as good as ever but that they were so completely exhausted that they were scarcely capable of lifting an arm  he asked therefore whether as the enemy had now ceased firing the men might be permitted to lie down by their guns for a short time  after some reflection sir alexander acceded to the proposal taking of course the proper precautions to rouse them again at the moment he thought requisite  accordingly with the exception of himself his officers and the appointed watch the ships crew lay down each in the place to which he was stationed and slept for twenty minutes  they were then roused and started up as sir alexander expressed it more like men out of an ambush than from sleep so coinstantaneously did they all obey the summons they recommenced their fire and in a few minutes the enemy surrendered and it was soon after discovered that during that interval and almost immediately after the french ship had first ceased firing the crew had sunk down by their guns and there slept almost by the side as it were of their sleeping enemy    essay v     whose powers shed round him in the common strife or mild concerns of ordinary life a constant influence a peculiar grace but who if he be calld upon to face same awful moment to which heaven has joind great issues good or bad for human kind is happy as a lover is attired with sudden brightness like a man inspired and through the heat of conflict keeps the law in calmness made and sees what he foresaw wordsworth  an accessibility to the sentiments of others on subjects of importance often accompanies feeble minds yet it is not the less a true and constituent part of practical greatness when it exists wholly free from that passiveness to impression which renders counsel itself injurious to certain characters and from that weakness of heart which in the literal sense of the word is always craving advice  exempt from all such imperfections say rather in perfect harmony with the excellences that preclude them this openness to the influxes of good sense and information from whatever quarter they might come equally characterised both lord nelson and sir alexander ball though each displayed it in the way best suited to his natural temper  the former with easy hand collected as it passed by him whatever could add to his own stores appropriated what he could assimilate and levied subsidies of knowledge from all the accidents of social life and familiar intercourse  even at the jovial board and in the height of unrestrained merriment a casual suggestion that flashed a new light on his mind changed the boon companion into the hero and the man of genius and with the most graceful transition he would make his company as serious as himself  when the taper of his genius seemed extinguished it was still surrounded by an inflammable atmosphere of its own and rekindled at the first approach of light and not seldom at a distance which made it seem to flame up selfrevived  in sir alexander ball the same excellence was more an affair of system and he would listen even to weak men with a patience which in so careful an economist of time always demanded my admiration and not seldom excited my wonder  it was one of his maxims that a man may suggest what he cannot give adding that a wild or silly plan had more than once from the vivid sense or distinct perception of its folly occasioned him to see what ought to be done in a new light or with a clearer insight  there is indeed a hopeless sterility a mere negation of sense and thought which suggesting neither difference nor contrast cannot even furnish hints for recollection  but on the other hand there are minds so whimsically constituted that they may sometimes be profitably interpreted by contraries a process of which the great tycho brahe is said to have availed himself in the case of the little lackwit who used to sit and mutter at his feet while he was studying  a mind of this sort we may compare to a magnetic needle the poles of which have been suddenly reversed by a flash of lightning or other more obscure accident of nature  it may be safely concluded that to those whose judgment or information he respected sir alexander ball did not content himself with giving access and attention  no he seldom failed of consulting them whenever the subject permitted any disclosure and where secrecy was necessary he well knew how to acquire their opinion without exciting even a conjecture concerning his immediate object  yet with all this readiness of attention and with all this zeal in collecting the sentiments of the well informed never was a man more completely uninfluenced by authority than sir alexander ball never one who sought less to tranquillise his own doubts by the mere suffrage and coincidence of others  the ablest suggestions had no conclusive weight with him till he had abstracted the opinion from its author till he had reduced it into a part of his own mind  the thoughts of others were always acceptable as affording him at least a chance of adding to his materials for reflection but they never directed his judgment much less superseded it  he even made a point of guarding against additional confidence in the suggestions of his own mind from finding that a person of talents had formed the same conviction unless the person at the same time furnished some new argument or had arrived at the same conclusion by a different road on the latter circumstance he set an especial value and i may almost say courted the company and conversation of those whose pursuits had least resembled his own if he thought them men of clear and comprehensive faculties  during the period of our intimacy scarcely a week passed in which he did not desire me to think on some particular subject and to give him the result in writing  most frequently by the time i had fulfilled his request he would have written down his own thoughts and then with the true simplicity of a great mind as free from ostentation as it was above jealousy he would collate the two papers in my presence and never expressed more pleasure than in the few instances in which i had happened to light on all the arguments and points of view which had occurred to himself with some additional reasons which had escaped him  a single new argument delighted him more than the most perfect coincidence unless as before stated the train of thought had been very different from his own and yet just and logical  he had one quality of mind which i have heard attributed to the late mr fox that of deriving a keen pleasure from clear and powerful reasoning for its own sakea quality in the intellect which is nearly connected with veracity and a love of justice in the moral character  valuing in others merits which he himself possessed sir alexander ball felt no jealous apprehension of great talent  unlike those vulgar functionaries whose place is too big for them a truth which they attempt to disguise from themselves and yet feel he was under no necessity of arming himself against the natural superiority of genius by factitious contempt and an industrious association of extravagance and impracticability with every deviation from the ordinary routine as the geographers in the middle ages used to designate on their meagre maps the greater part of the world as deserts or wildernesses inhabited by griffins and chimaeras competent to weigh each system or project by its own arguments he did not need these preventive charms and cautionary amulets against delusion  he endeavoured to make talent instrumental to his purposes in whatever shape it appeared and with whatever imperfections it might be accompanied but wherever talent was blended with moral worth he sought it out loved and cherished it  if it had pleased providence to preserve his life and to place him on the same course on which nelson ran his race of glory there are two points in which sir alexander ball would most closely have resembled his illustrious friend  the first is that in his enterprises and engagements he would have thought nothing done till all had been done that was possible   nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum   the second that he would have called forth all the talent and virtue that existed within his sphere of influence and created a band of heroes a gradation of officers strong in head and strong in heart worthy to have been his companions and his successors in fame and public usefulness  never was greater discernment shown in the selection of a fit agent than when sir alexander ball was stationed off the coast of malta to intercept the supplies destined for the french garrison and to watch the movements of the french commanders and those of the inhabitants who had been so basely betrayed into their power  encouraged by the welltimed promises of the english captain the maltese rose through all their casals or country towns and themselves commenced the work of their emancipation by storming the citadel at civita vecchia the ancient metropolis of malta and the central height of the island without discipline without a military leader and almost without arms these brave peasants succeeded and destroyed the french garrison by throwing them over the battlements into the trench of the citadel  in the course of this blockade and of the tedious siege of valetta sir alexander ball displayed all that strength of character that variety and versatility of talent and that sagacity derived in part from habitual circumspection but which when the occasion demanded it appeared intuitive and like an instinct at the union of which in the same man one of our oldest naval commanders once told me he could never exhaust his wonder  the citizens of valetta were fond of relating their astonishment and that of the french at captain balls ship wintering at anchor out of the reach of the guns in a depth of fathom unexampled on the assured impracticability of which the garrison had rested their main hope of regular supplies nor can i forget or remember without some portion of my original feeling the solemn enthusiasm with which a venerable old man belonging to one of the distant casals showed me the sea coombe where their father ball for so they commonly called him first landed and afterwards pointed out the very place on which he first stepped on their island while the countenances of his townsmen who accompanied him gave lively proofs that the old mans enthusiasm was the representative of the common feeling  there is no reason to suppose that sir alexander ball was at any time chargeable with that weakness so frequent in englishmen and so injurious to our interests abroad of despising the inhabitants of other countries of losing all their good qualities in their vices of making no allowance for those vices from their religious or political impediments and still more of mistaking for vices a mere difference of manners and customs  but if ever he had any of this erroneous feeling he completely freed himself from it by living among the maltese during their arduous trials as long as the french continued masters of their capital  he witnessed their virtues and learnt to understand in what various shapes and even disguises the valuable parts of human nature may exist  in many individuals whose littleness and meanness in the common intercourse of life would have stamped them at once as contemptible and worthless with ordinary englishmen he had found such virtues of disinterested patriotism fortitude and selfdenial as would have done honour to an ancient roman  there exists in england a gentlemanly character a gentlemanly feeling very different even from that which is the most like it the character of a wellborn spaniard and unexampled in the rest of europe  this feeling probably originated in the fortunate circumstance that the titles of our english nobility follow the law of their property and are inherited by the eldest sons only  from this source under the influences of our constitution and of our astonishing trade it has diffused itself in different modifications through the whole country  the uniformity of our dress among all classes above that of the day labourer while it has authorised all classes to assume the appearance of gentlemen has at the same time inspired the wish to conform their manners and still more their ordinary actions in social intercourse to their notions of the gentlemanly the most commonly received attribute of which character is a certain generosity in trifles  on the other hand the encroachments of the lower classes on the higher occasioned and favoured by this resemblance in exteriors by this absence of any cognisable marks of distinction have rendered each class more reserved and jealous in their general communion and far more than our climate or natural temper have caused that haughtiness and reserve in our outward demeanour which is so generally complained of among foreigners  far be it from me to depreciate the value of this gentlemanly feeling  i respect it under all its forms and varieties from the house of commons to the gentleman in the shilling gallery it is always the ornament of virtue and oftentimes a support but it is a wretched substitute for it  its worth as a moral good is by no means in proportion to its value as a social advantage  these observations are not irrelevant for to the want of reflection that this diffusion of gentlemanly feeling among us is not the growth of our moral excellence but the effect of various accidental advantages peculiar to england to our not considering that it is unreasonable and uncharitable to expect the same consequences where the same causes have not existed to produce them and lastly to our proneness to regard the absence of this character which as i have before said does for the greater part and in the common apprehension consist in a certain frankness and generosity in the detail of action as decisive against the sum total of personal or national worth we must i am convinced attribute a large portion of that conduct which in many instances has left the inhabitants of countries conquered or appropriated by great britain doubtful whether the various solid advantages which they derived from our protection and just government were not bought dearly by the wounds inflicted on their feelings and prejudices by the contemptuous and insolent demeanour of the english as individuals  the reader who bears this remark in mind will meet in the course of this narration more than one passage that will serve as its comment and illustration  it was i know a general opinion among the english in the mediterranean that sir alexander ball thought too well of the maltese and did not share in the enthusiasm of britons concerning their own superiority  to the former part of the charge i shall only reply at present that a more venial and almost desirable fault can scarcely be attributed to a governor than that of a strong attachment to the people whom he was sent to govern  the latter part of the charge is false if we are to understand by it that he did not think his countrymen superior on the whole to the other nations of europe but it is true as far as relates to his belief that the english thought themselves still better than they are that they dwelt on and exaggerated their national virtues and weighed them by the opposite vices of foreigners instead of the virtues which those foreigners possessed and they themselves wanted  above all as statesmen we must consider qualities by their practical uses  thus he entertained no doubt that the english were superior to all others in the kind and the degree of their courage which is marked by far greater enthusiasm than the courage of the germans and northern nations and by a far greater steadiness and selfsubsistency than that of the french  it is more closely connected with the character of the individual  the courage of an english army he used to say is the sum total of the courage which the individual soldiers bring with them to it rather than of that which they derive from it  this remark of sir alexanders was forcibly recalled to my mind when i was at naples  a russian and an english regiment were drawn up together in the same square  see said a neapolitan to me who had mistaken me for one of his countrymen there is but one face in that whole regiment while in that pointing to the english every soldier has a face of his own  on the other hand there are qualities scarcely less requisite to the completion of the military character in which sir a did not hesitate to think the english inferior to the continental nations as for instance both in the power and the disposition to endure privations in the friendly temper necessary when troops of different nations are to act in concert in their obedience to the regulations of their commanding officers respecting their treatment of the inhabitants of the countries through which they are marching as well as in many other points not immediately connected with their conduct in the field  and above all in sobriety and temperance  during the siege of valetta especially during the sore distress to which the besiegers were for some time exposed from the failure of provision sir alexander ball had an ample opportunity of observing and weighing the separate merits and demerits of the native and of the english troops and surely since the publication of sir john moores campaign there can be no just offence taken though i should say that before the walls of valetta as well as in the plains of galicia an indignant commander might with too great propriety have addressed the english soldiery in the words of an old dramatist    will you still owe your virtues to your bellies and only then think nobly when yare full doth fodder keep you honest  are you bad when out of flesh  and think yout an excuse of vile and ignominious actions that y are lean and out of liking cartwrights loves convert  from the first insurrectionary movement to the final departure of the french from the island though the civil and military powers and the whole of the island save valetta were in the hands of the peasantry not a single act of excess can be charged against the maltese if we except the razing of one house at civita vecchia belonging to a notorious and abandoned traitor the creature and hireling of the french  in no instance did they injure insult or plunder any one of the native nobility or employ even the appearance of force toward them except in the collection of the lead and iron from their houses and gardens in order to supply themselves with bullets and this very appearance was assumed from the generous wish to shelter the nobles from the resentment of the french should the patriotic efforts of the peasantry prove unsuccessful  at the dire command of famine the maltese troops did indeed once force their way to the ovens in which the bread for the british soldiery was baked and were clamorous that an equal division should be made  i mention this unpleasant circumstance because it brought into proof the firmness of sir alexander balls character his presence of mind and generous disregard of danger and personal responsibility where the slavery or emancipation the misery or the happiness of an innocent and patriotic people were involved and because his conduct in this exigency evinced that his general habits of circumspection and deliberation were the results of wisdom and complete self possession and not the easy virtues of a spirit constitutionally timorous and hesitating  he was sitting at table with the principal british officers when a certain general addressed him in strong and violent terms concerning this outrage of the maltese reminding him of the necessity of exerting his commanding influence in the present case or the consequences must be taken  what replied sir alexander ball would you have us do  would you have us threaten death to men dying with famine  can you suppose that the hazard of being shot will weigh with whole regiments acting under a common necessity  does not the extremity of hunger take away all difference between men and animals and is it not as absurd to appeal to the prudence of a body of men starving as to a herd of famished wolves no general i will not degrade myself or outrage humanity by menacing famine with massacre  more effectual means must be taken with these words he rose and left the room and having first consulted with sir thomas troubridge he determined at his own risk on a step which the extreme necessity warranted and which the conduct of the neapolitan court amply justified  for this court though terrorstricken by the french was still actuated by hatred to the english and a jealousy of their power in the mediterranean and in this so strange and senseless a manner that we must join the extremes of imbecility and treachery in the same cabinet in order to find it comprehensible  though the very existence of naples and sicily as a nation depended wholly and exclusively on british support though the royal family owed their personal safety to the british fleet though not only their dominions and their rank but the liberty and even the lives of ferdinand and his family were interwoven with our success yet with an infatuation scarcely credible the most affecting representations of the distress of the besiegers and of the utter insecurity of sicily if the french remained possessors of malta were treated with neglect and the urgent remonstrances for the permission of importing corn from messina were answered only by sanguinary edicts precluding all supply  sir alexander ball sent for his senior lieutenant and gave him orders to proceed immediately to the port of messina and there to seize and bring with him to malta the ships laden with corn of the number of which sir alexander had received accurate information these orders were executed without delay to the great delight and profit of the shipowners and proprietors the necessity of raising the siege was removed and the author of the measure waited in calmness for the consequences that might result to himself personally  but not a complaint not a murmur proceeded from the court of naples  the sole result was that the governor of malta became an especial object of its hatred its fear and its respect  the whole of this tedious siege from its commencement to the signing of the capitulation called forth into constant activity the rarest and most difficult virtues of a commanding mind virtues of no show or splendour in the vulgar apprehension yet more infallible characteristics of true greatness than the most unequivocal displays of enterprise and active daring  scarcely a day passed in which sir alexander balls patience forbearance and inflexible constancy were not put to the severest trial  he had not only to remove the misunderstandings that arose between the maltese and their allies to settle the differences among the maltese themselves and to organise their efforts he was likewise engaged in the more difficult and unthankful task of counteracting the weariness discontent and despondency of his own countrymena task however which he accomplished by management and address and an alternation of real firmness with apparent yielding  during many months he remained the only englishman who did not think the siege hopeless and the object worthless  he often spoke of the time in which he resided at the country seat of the grand master at st antonio four miles from valetta as perhaps the most trying period of his life  for some weeks captain vivian was his sole english companion of whom as his partner in anxiety he always expressed himself with affectionate esteem  sir alexander balls presence was absolutely necessary to the maltese who accustomed to be governed by him became incapable of acting in concert without his immediate influence  in the outburst of popular emotion the impulse which produces an insurrection is for a brief while its sufficient pilot  the attraction constitutes the cohesion and the common provocation supplying an immediate object not only unites but directs the multitude  but this first impulse had passed away and sir alexander ball was the one individual who possessed the general confidence  on him they relied with implicit faith and even after they had long enjoyed the blessings of british government and protection it was still remarkable with what childlike helplessness they were in the habit of applying to him even in their private concerns  it seemed as if they thought him made on purpose to think for them all  yet his situation at st antonio was one of great peril and he attributed his preservation to the dejection which had now begun to prey on the spirits of the french garrison and which rendered them unenterprising and almost passive aided by the dread which the nature of the country inspired  for subdivided as it was into small fields scarcely larger than a cottage garden and each of these little squares of land inclosed with substantial stone walls these too from the necessity of having the fields perfectly level rising in tiers above each other the whole of the inhabited part of the island was an effective fortification for all the purposes of annoyance and offensive warfare  sir alexander ball exerted himself successfully in procuring information respecting the state and temper of the garrison and by the assistance of the clergy and the almost universal fidelity of the maltese contrived that the spies in the pay of the french should be in truth his own confidential agents  he had already given splendid proofs that he could outfight them but here and in his after diplomatic intercourse previous to the recommencement of the war he likewise outwitted them  he once told me with a smile as we were conversing on the practice of laying wagers that he was sometimes inclined to think that the final perseverance in the siege was not a little indebted to several valuable bets of his own he well knowing at the time and from information which himself alone possessed that he should certainly lose them  yet this artifice had a considerable effect in suspending the impatience of the officers and in supplying topics for dispute and conversation  at length however the two french frigates the sailing of which had been the subject of these wagers left the great harbour on the 24th of august 1800 with a part of the garrison and one of them soon became a prize to the english  sir alexander ball related to me the circumstances which occasioned the escape of the other but i do not recollect them with sufficient accuracy to dare repeat them in this place  on the 15th of september following the capitulation was signed and after a blockade of two years the english obtained possession of valetta and remained masters of the whole island and its dependencies  anxious not to give offence but more anxious to communicate the truth it is not without pain that i find myself under the moral obligation of remonstrating against the silence concerning sir alexander balls services or the transfer of them to others  more than once has the latter aroused my indignation in the reported speeches of the house of commons  and as to the former i need only state that in reess encyclopaedia there is an historical article of considerable length under the word malta in which sir alexanders name does not once occur  during a residence of eighteen months in that island i possessed and availed myself of the best possible means of information not only from eyewitnesses but likewise from the principal agents themselves  and i now thus publicly and unequivocally assert that to sir a ball preeminentlyand if i had said to sir a ball alone the ordinary use of the word under such circumstances would bear me outthe capture and the preservation of malta were owing with every blessing that a powerful mind and a wise heart could confer on its docile and grateful inhabitants  with a similar pain i proceed to avow my sentiments on this capitulation by which malta was delivered up to his britannic majesty and his allies without the least mention made of the maltese  with a warmth honourable both to his head and his heart sir alexander ball pleaded as not less a point of sound policy than of plain justice that the maltese by some representative should be made a party in the capitulation and a joint subscriber in the signature  they had never been the slaves or the property of the knights of st john but freemen and the true landed proprietors of the country the civil and military government of which under certain restrictions had been vested in that order yet checked by the rights and influences of the clergy and the native nobility and by the customs and ancient laws of the island  this trust the knights had with the blackest treason and the most profligate perjury betrayed and abandoned  the right of government of course reverted to the landed proprietors and the clergy  animated by a just sense of this right the maltese had risen of their own accord had contended for it in defiance of death and danger had fought bravely and endured patiently  without undervaluing the military assistance afterwards furnished by great britain though how scanty this was before the arrival of general pigot is well known it remains undeniable that the maltese had taken the greatest share both in the fatigues and in the privations consequent on the siege and that had not the greatest virtues and the most exemplary fidelity been uniformly displayed by them the english troops they not being more numerous than they had been for the greater part of the two years could not possibly have remained before the fortifications of valetta defended as that city was by a french garrison that greatly outnumbered the british besiegers still less could there have been the least hope of ultimate success as if any part of the maltese peasantry had been friendly to the french or even indifferent if they had not all indeed been most zealous and persevering in their hostility towards them it would have been impracticable so to blockade that island as to have precluded the arrival of supplies  if the siege had proved unsuccessful the maltese were well aware that they should be exposed to all the horrors which revenge and wounded pride could dictate to an unprincipled rapacious and sanguinary soldiery and now that success has crowned their efforts is this to be their reward that their own allies are to bargain for them with the french as for a herd of slaves whom the french had before purchased from a former proprietor  if it be urged that there is no established government in malta is it not equally true that through the whole population of the island there is not a single dissentient and thus that the chief inconvenience which an established authority is to obviate is virtually removed by the admitted fact of their unanimity  and have they not a bishop and a dignified clergy their judges and municipal magistrates who were at all times sharers in the power of the government and now supported by the unanimous suffrage of the inhabitants have a rightful claim to be considered as its representatives  will it not be oftener said than answered that the main difference between french and english injustice rests in this point alone that the french seized on the maltese without any previous pretences of friendship while the english procured possession of the island by means of their friendly promises and by the cooperation of the natives afforded in confident reliance on these promises  the impolicy of refusing the signature on the part of the maltese was equally evident since such refusal could answer no one purpose but that of alienating their affections by a wanton insult to their feelings  for the maltese were not only ready but desirous and eager to place themselves at the same time under british protection to take the oaths of loyalty as subjects of the british crown and to acknowledge their island to belong to it  these representations however were overruled and i dare affirm from my own experience in the mediterranean that our conduct in this instance added to the impression which had been made at corsica minorca and elsewhere and was often referred to by men of reflection in sicily who have more than once said to me a connection with great britain with the consequent extension and security of our commerce are indeed great blessings  but who can rely on their permanence or that we shall not be made to pay bitterly for our zeal as partisans of england whenever it shall suit its plans to deliver us back to our old oppressors    essay vi    the way of ancient ordinance though it winds is yet no devious way  straight forward goes the lightnings path and straight the fearful path of the cannonball  direct it flies and rapid shattering that it may reach and shattering what it reaches my son the road the human being travels that on which blessing comes and goes doth follow the rivers course the valleys playful windings curves round the cornfield and the hill of vines honouring the holy bounds of property there exists a higher than the warriors excellence wallenstein  captain balls services in malta were honoured with his sovereigns approbation transmitted in a letter from the secretary dundas and with a baronetcy  a thousand pounds were at the same time directed to be paid him from the maltese treasury  the best and most appropriate addition to the applause of his king and his country sir alexander ball found in the feelings and faithful affection of the maltese  the enthusiasm manifested in reverential gestures and shouts of triumph whenever their friend and deliverer appeared in public was the utterance of a deep feeling and in nowise the mere ebullition of animal sensibility which is not indeed a part of the maltese character  the truth of this observation will not be doubted by any person who has witnessed the religious processions in honour of the favourite saints both at valetta and at messina or palermo and who must have been struck with the contrast between the apparent apathy or at least the perfect sobriety of the maltese and the fanatical agitations of the sicilian populace  among the latter each mans soul seems hardly containable in his body like a prisoner whose gaol is on fire flying madly from one barred outlet to another while the former might suggest the suspicion that their bodies were on the point of sinking into the same slumber with their understandings  but their political deliverance was a thing that came home to their hearts and intertwined with their most impassioned recollections personal and patriotic  to sir alexander ball exclusively the maltese themselves attributed their emancipation on him too they rested their hopes of the future whenever he appeared in valetta the passengers on each side through the whole length of the street stopped and remained uncovered till he had passed the very clamours of the marketplace were hushed at his entrance and then exchanged for shouts of joy and welcome  even after the lapse of years he never appeared in any one of their casals which did not lie in the direct road between valetta and st antonio his summer residence but the women and children with such of the men who were not at labour in their fields fell into ranks and followed or preceded him singing the maltese song which had been made in his honour and which was scarcely less familiar to the inhabitants of malta and gozo than god save the king to britons when he went to the gate through the city the young men refrained talking and the aged arose and stood up  when the ear heard then it blessed him and when the eye saw him it gave witness to him because he delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and those that had none to help them  the blessing of them that were ready to perish came upon him and he caused the widows heart to sing for joy  these feelings were afterwards amply justified by his administration of the government and the very excesses of their gratitude on their first deliverance proved in the end only to be acknowledgments antedated  for some time after the departure of the french the distress was so general and so severe that a large proportion of the lower classes became mendicants and one of the greatest thoroughfares of valetta still retains the name of the nix mangiare stairs from the crowd who used there to assail the ears of the passengers with cries of nix mangiare or nothing to eat the former word nix being the low german pronunciation of nichts nothing  by what means it was introduced into malta i know not but it became the common vehicle both of solicitation and refusal the maltese thinking it an english word and the english supposing it to be maltese  i often felt it as a pleasing remembrancer of the evil day gone by when a tribe of little children quite naked as is the custom of that climate and each with a pair of gold earrings in its ears and all fat and beautifully proportioned would suddenly leave their play and looking round to see that their parents were not in sight change their shouts of merriment for nix mangiare awkwardly imitating the plaintive tones of mendicancy while the white teeth in their little swarthy faces gave a splendour to the happy and confessing laugh with which they received the goodhumoured rebuke or refusal and ran back to their former sport  in the interim between the capitulation of the french garrison and sir alexander balls appointment as his majestys civil commissioner for malta his zeal for the maltese was neither suspended nor unproductive of important benefits  he was enabled to remove many prejudices and misunderstandings and to persons of no inconsiderable influence gave juster notions of the true importance of the island to great britain  he displayed the magnitude of the trade of the mediterranean in its existing state showed the immense extent to which it might be carried and the hollowness of the opinion that this trade was attached to the south of france by any natural or indissoluble bond of connection  i have some reason for likewise believing that his wise and patriotic representations prevented malta from being made the seat of and pretext for a numerous civil establishment in hapless imitation of corsica ceylon and the cape of good hope  it was at least generally rumoured that it had been in the contemplation of the ministry to appoint sir ralph abercrombie as governor with a salary of 10000 pounds a year and to reside in england while one of his countrymen was to be the lieutenant governor at 5000 pounds a year to which were to be added a long etcetera of other offices and places of proportional emolument  this threatened appendix to the state calendar may have existed only in the imaginations of the reporters yet inspired some uneasy apprehensions in the minds of many wellwishers to the maltese who knew thatfor a foreign settlement at least and one too possessing in all the ranks and functions of society an ample population of its ownsuch a stately and widebranching tree of patronage though delightful to the individuals who are to pluck its golden apples sheds like the manchineel unwholesome and corrosive dews on the multitude who are to rest beneath its shade  it need not however be doubted that sir alexander ball would exert himself to preclude any such intention by stating and evincing the extreme impolicy and injustice of the plan as well as its utter inutility in the case of malta  with the exception of the governor and of the public secretary both of whom undoubtedly should be natives of great britain and appointed by the british government there was no civil office that could be of the remotest advantage to the island which was not already filled by the natives and the functions of which none could perform so well as they  the number of inhabitants he would state was prodigious compared with the extent of the island though from the fear of the moors onefourth of its surface remained unpeopled and uncultivated  to deprive therefore the middle and lower classes of such places as they had been accustomed to hold would be cruel while the places held by the nobility were for the greater part such as none but natives could perform the duties of by any innovation we should affront the higher classes and alienate the affections of all not only without any imaginable advantage but with the certainty of great loss  were englishmen to be employed the salaries must be increased fourfold and would yet be scarcely worth acceptance and in higher offices such as those of the civil and criminal judges the salaries must be augmented more than tenfold  for greatly to the credit of their patriotism and moral character the maltese gentry sought these places as honourable distinctions which endeared them to their fellowcountrymen and at the same time rendered the yoke of the order somewhat less grievous and galling  with the exception of the maltese secretary whose situation was one of incessant labour and who at the same time performed the duties of law counsellor to the government the highest salaries scarcely exceeded 100 pounds a year and were barely sufficient to defray the increased expenses of the functionaries for an additional equipage or one of more imposing appearance  besides it was of importance that the person placed at the head of that government should be looked up to by the natives and possess the means of distinguishing and rewarding those who had been most faithful and zealous in their attachment to great britain and hostile to their former tyrants  the number of the employments to be conferred would give considerable influence to his majestys civil representative while the trifling amount of the emolument attached to each precluded all temptation of abusing it  sir alexander ball would likewise it is probable urge that the commercial advantages of malta which were most intelligible to the english public and best fitted to render our retention of the island popular must necessarily be of very slow growth though finally they would become great and of an extent not to be calculated  for this reason therefore it was highly desirable that the possession should be and appear to be at least inexpensive  after the british government had made one advance for a stock of corn sufficient to place the island a year beforehand the sum total drawn from great britain need not exceed 25000 pounds or at most 30000 pounds annually  excluding of course the expenditure connected with our own military and navy and the repair of the fortifications which latter expense ought to be much less than at gibraltar from the multitude and low wages of the labourers in malta and from the softness and admirable quality of the stone  indeed much more might safely be promised on the assumption that a wise and generous system of policy were adopted and persevered in  the monopoly of the maltese corn trade by the government formed an exception to a general rule and by a strange yet valid anomaly in the operations of political economy was not more necessary than advantageous to the inhabitants  the chief reason is that the produce of the island itself barely suffices for onefourth of its inhabitants although fruits and vegetables form so large a part of their nourishment  meantime the harbours of malta and its equidistance from europe asia and africa gave it a vast and unnatural importance in the present relations of the great european powers and imposed on its government whether native or dependent the necessity of considering the whole island as a single garrison the provisioning of which could not be trusted to the casualties of ordinary commerce  what is actually necessary is seldom injurious  thus in malta bread is better and cheaper on an average than in italy or the coast of barbary while a similar interference with the corntrade in sicily impoverishes the inhabitants and keeps the agriculture in a state of barbarism  but the point in question is the expense to great britain  whether the monopoly be good or evil in itself it remains true that in this established usage and in the gradual enclosure of the uncultivated district such resources exist as without the least oppression might render the civil government in valetta independent of the treasury at home finally taking upon itself even the repair of the fortifications and thus realise one instance of an important possession that cost the country nothing  but now the time arrived which threatened to frustrate the patriotism of the maltese themselves and all the zealous efforts of their disinterested friend  soon after the war had for the first time become indisputably just and necessary the people at large and a majority of independent senators incapable as it might seem of translating their fanatical antijacobinism into a wellgrounded yet equally impassioned antigallicanism grew impatient for peace or rather for a name under which the most terrific of all wars would be incessantly waged against us  our conduct was not much wiser than that of the weary traveller who having proceeded half way on his journey procured a short rest for himself by getting up behind a chaise which was going the contrary road  in the strange treaty of amiens in which we neither recognised our former relations with france nor with the other european powers nor formed any new ones the compromise concerning malta formed the prominent feature and its nominal redelivery to the order of st john was authorised in the minds of the people by lord nelsons opinion of its worthlessness to great britain in a political or naval view  it is a melancholy fact and one that must often sadden a reflective and philanthropic mind how little moral considerations weigh even with the noblest nations how vain are the strongest appeals to justice humanity and national honour unless when the public mind is under the immediate influence of the cheerful or vehement passions indignation or avaricious hope in the whole class of human infirmities there is none that make such loud appeals to prudence and yet so frequently outrages its plainest dictates as the spirit of fear  the worst cause conducted in hope is an overmatch for the noblest managed by despondency in both cases an unnatural conjunction that recalls the old fable of love and death taking each the arrows of the other by mistake  when islands that had courted british protection in reliance upon british honour are with their inhabitants and proprietors abandoned to the resentment which we had tempted them to provoke what wonder if the opinion becomes general that alike to england as to france the fates and fortunes of other nations are but the counters with which the bloody game of war is played and that notwithstanding the great and acknowledged difference between the two governments during possession yet the protection of france is more desirable because it is more likely to endure for what the french take they keep  often both in sicily and malta have i heard the case of minorca referred to where a considerable portion of the most respectable gentry and merchants no provision having been made for their protection on the redelivery of that island to spain expiated in dungeons the warmth and forwardness of their predilection for great britain  it has been by some persons imagined that lord nelson was considerably influenced in his public declaration concerning the value of malta by ministerial flattery and his own sense of the great serviceableness of that opinion to the persons in office  this supposition is however wholly false and groundless  his lordships opinion was indeed greatly shaken afterwards if not changed but at that time he spoke in strictest correspondence with his existing convictions  he said no more than he had often previously declared to his private friends  it was the point on which after some amicable controversy his lordship and sir alexander ball had agreed to differ  though the opinion itself may have lost the greatest part of its interest and except for the historian is as it were superannuated yet the grounds and causes of it as far as they arose out of lord nelsons particular character and may perhaps tend to reenliven our recollection of a hero so deeply and justly beloved will for ever possess an interest of their own  in an essay too which purports to be no more than a series of sketches and fragments the reader it is hoped will readily excuse an occasional digression and a more desultory style of narration than could be tolerated in a work of regular biography  lord nelson was an admiral every inch of him  he looked at everything not merely in its possible relations to the naval service in general but in its immediate bearings on his own squadron to his officers his men to the particular ships themselves his affections were as strong and ardent as those of a lover  hence though his temper was constitutionally irritable and uneven yet never was a commander so enthusiastically loved by men of all ranks from the captain of the fleet to the youngest shipboy  hence too the unexampled harmony which reigned in his fleet year after year under circumstances that might well have undermined the patience of the bestbalanced dispositions much more of men with the impetuous character of british sailors  year after year the same dull duties of a wearisome blockade of doubtful policylittle if any opportunity of making prizes and the few prizes which accident might throw in the way of little or no value and when at last the occasion presented itself which would have compensated for all then a disappointment as sudden and unexpected as it was unjust and cruel and the cup dashed from their lips  add to these trials the sense of enterprises checked by feebleness and timidity elsewhere not omitting the tiresomeness of the mediterranean sea sky and climate and the unjarring and cheerful spirit of affectionate brotherhood which linked together the hearts of that whole squadron will appear not less wonderful to us than admirable and affecting  when the resolution was taken of commencing hostilities against spain before any intelligence was sent to lord nelson another admiral with two or three ships of the line was sent into the mediterranean and stationed before cadiz for the express purpose of intercepting the spanish prizes  the admiral despatched on this lucrative service gave no information to lord nelson of his arrival in the same sea and five weeks elapsed before his lordship became acquainted with the circumstance  the prizes thus taken were immense  a month or two sufficed to enrich the commander and officers of this small and highlyfavoured squadron while to nelson and his fleet the sense of having done their duty and the consciousness of the glorious services which they had performed were considered it must be presumed as an abundant remuneration for all their toils and long suffering  it was indeed an unexampled circumstance that a small squadron should be sent to the station which had been long occupied by a large fleet commanded by the darling of the navy and the glory of the british empire to the station where this fleet had for years been wearing away in the most barren repulsive and spirittrying service in which the navy can be employed and that this minor squadron should be sent independently of and without any communication with the commander of the former fleet for the express and solitary purpose of stepping between it and the spanish prizes and as soon as this short and pleasant service was performed of bringing home the unshared booty with all possible caution and despatch  the substantial advantages of naval service were perhaps deemed of too gross a nature for men already rewarded with the grateful affections of their own countrymen and the admiration of the whole world  they were to be awarded therefore on a principle of compensation to a commander less rich in fame and whose laurels though not scanty were not yet sufficiently luxuriant to hide the golden crown which is the appropriate ornament of victory in the bloodless war of commercial capture  of all the wounds which were ever inflicted on nelsons feelings and there were not a few this was the deepestthis rankled most  i had thought said the gallant man in a letter written on the first feelings of the affront i fanciedbut nay it must have been a dream an idle dreamyet i confess it i did fancy that i had done my country serviceand thus they use me  it was not enough to have robbed me once before of my west india harvestnow they have taken away the spanishand under what circumstances and with what pointed aggravations  yet if i know my own thoughts it is not for myself or on my own account chiefly that i feel the sting and the disappointment no it is for my brave officers for my nobleminded friends and comradessuch a gallant set of fellows such a hand of brothers  my heart swells at the thought of them  this strong attachment of the heroic admiral to his fleet faithfully repaid by an equal attachment on their part to their admiral had no little influence in attuning their hearts to each other and when he died it seemed as if no man was a stranger to another for all were made acquaintances by the rights of a common anguish  in the fleet itself many a private quarrel was forgotten no more to be remembered many who had been alienated became once more good friends yea many a one was reconciled to his very enemy and loved and as it were thanked him for the bitterness of his grief as if it had been an act of consolation to himself in an intercourse of private sympathy  the tidings arrived at naples on the day that i returned to that city from calabria and never can i forget the sorrow and consternation that lay on every countenance  even to this day there are times when i seem to see as in a vision separate groups and individual faces of the picture  numbers stopped and shook hands with me because they had seen the tears on my cheek and conjectured that i was an englishman and several as they held my hand burst themselves into tears  and though it may awake a smile yet it pleased and affected me as a proof of the goodness of the human heart struggling to exercise its kindness in spite of prejudices the most obstinate and eager to carry on its love and honour into the life beyond life that it was whispered about naples that lord nelson had become a good catholic before his death  the absurdity of the fiction is a sort of measurement of the fond and affectionate esteem which had ripened the pious wish of some kind individual through all the gradations of possibility and probability into a confident assertion believed and affirmed by hundreds  the feelings of great britain on this awful event have been described well and worthily by a living poet who has happily blended the passion and wild transitions of lyric song with the swell and solemnity of epic narration  thou art falln falln in the lap of victory  to thy country thou camst back thou conqueror to triumphal albion camst a corse  i saw before thy hearse pass on the comrades of thy perils and renown the frequent tear upon their dauntless breasts fell  i beheld the pomp thick gathered round the trophied car that bore thy graced remains through armed ranks and a nation gazing on bright glowed the sun and not a cloud distained heavens arch of gold but all was gloom beneath a holy and unutterable pang thrilled on the soul  awe and mute anguish fell on allyet high the public bosom throbbed with triumph  and if one mid that vast pomp if but the voice of one had shouted forth the name of nelson thou hadst past along thou in thy hearse to burial past as oft before the van of battle proudly rode thy prow down britains line shout after shout rending the air with triumph ere thy hand had lanced the bolt of victory  sotheby saul p 80  i introduced this digression with an apology yet have extended it so much further than i had designed that i must once more request my reader to excuse me  it was to be expected i have said that lord nelson would appreciate the isle of malta from its relations to the british fleet on the mediterranean station  it was the fashion of the day to style egypt the key of india and malta the key of egypt nelson saw the hollowness of this metaphor or if he only doubted its applicability in the former instance he was sure that it was false in the latter  egypt might or might not be the key of india but malta was certainly not the key of egypt  it was not intended to keep constantly two distinct fleets in that sea and the largest naval force at malta would not supersede the necessity of a squadron off toulon  malta does not lie in the direct course from toulon to alexandria and from the nature of the winds taking one time with another the comparative length of the voyage to the latter port will be found far less than a view of the map would suggest and in truth of little practical importance  if it were the object of the french fleet to avoid malta in its passage to egypt the portadmiral at valetta would in all probability receive his first intelligence of its course from minorca or the squadron off toulon instead of communicating it  in what regards the refitting and provisioning of the fleet either on ordinary or extraordinary occasions malta was as inconvenient as minorca was advantageous not only from its distance which yet was sufficient to render it almost useless in cases of the most pressing necessity as after a severe action or injuries of tempest but likewise from the extreme difficulty if not impracticability of leaving the harbour of valetta with a nw wind which often lasts for weeks together  in all these points his lordships observations were perfectly just and it must be conceded by all persons acquainted with the situation and circumstances of malta that its importance as a british possession if not exaggerated on the whole was unduly magnified in several important particulars  thus lord minto in a speech delivered at a county meeting and afterwards published affirms that supposing what no one could consider as unlikely to take place that the court of naples should be compelled to act under the influence of france and that the barbary powers were unfriendly to us either in consequence of french intrigues or from their own caprice and insolence there would not be a single port harbour bay creek or roadstead in the whole mediterranean from which our menofwar could obtain a single ox or a hogshead of fresh water unless great britain retained possession of malta  the noble speaker seems not to have been aware that under the circumstances supposed by him odessa too being closed against us by a russian war the island of malta itself would be no better than a vast almshouse of 75000 persons exclusive of the british soldiery all of whom must be regularly supplied with corn and salt meat from great britain or ireland  the population of malta and gozo exceeds 100000 while the food of all kinds produced on the two islands would barely suffice for onefourth of that number  the deficit is procured by the growth and spinning of cotton for which corn could not be substituted from the nature of the soil or were it attempted would produce but a small proportion of the quantity which the cotton raised on the same fields and spun into thread enables the maltese to purchase not to mention that the substitution of grain for cotton would leave half of the inhabitants without employment  as to live stock it is quite out of the question if we except the pigs and goats which perform the office of scavengers in the streets of valetta and the towns on the other side of the porto grande  against these arguments sir a ball placed the following considerations  it had been long his conviction that the mediterranean squadron should be supplied by regular storeships the sole business of which should be that of carriers for the fleet this he recommended as by far the most economic plan in the first instance  secondly beyond any other it would secure a system and regularity in the arrival of supplies  and lastly it would conduce to the discipline of the navy and prevent both ships and officers from being out of the way on any sudden emergency  if this system were introduced the objections to malta from its great distance c would have little force  on the other hand the objections to minorca he deemed irremovable  the same disadvantages which attended the getting out of the harbour of valetta applied to vessels getting into port mahon but while fifteen hundred or two thousand british troops might be safely entrusted with the preservation of malta the troops for the defence of minorca must ever be in proportion to those which the enemy may be supposed likely to send against it  it is so little favoured by nature or by art that the possessors stood merely on the level with the invaders  caeteris paribus if there 12000 of the enemy landed there must be an equal number to repel them nor could the garrison or any part of it be spared for any sudden emergency without risk of losing the island  previously to the battle of marengo the most earnest representations were made to the governor and commander at minorca by the british admiral who offered to take on himself the whole responsibility of the measure if he would permit the troops at minorca to join our allies  the governor felt himself compelled to refuse his assent  doubtless he acted wisely for responsibility is not transferable  the fact is introduced in proof of the defenceless state of minorca and its constant liability to attack  if the austrian army had stood in the same relation to eight or nine thousand british soldiers at malta a single regiment would have precluded all alarms as to the island itself and the remainder have perhaps changed the destiny of europe what might not almost i would say what must not eight thousand britons have accomplished at the battle of marengo nicely poised as the fortunes of the two armies are now known to have been  minorca too is alone useful or desirable during a war and on the supposition of a fleet off toulon  the advantages of malta are permanent and national  as a second gibraltar it must tend to secure gibraltar itself for if by the loss of that one place we could be excluded from the mediterranean it is difficult to say what sacrifices of blood and treasure the enemy would deem too high a price for its conquest  whatever malta may or may not be respecting egypt its high importance to the independence of sicily cannot be doubted or its advantages as a central station for any portion of our disposable force  neither is the influence which it will enable us to exert on the barbary powers to be wholly neglected  i shall only add that during the plague at gibraltar lord nelson himself acknowledged that he began to see the possession of malta in a different light  sir alexander ball looked forward to future contingencies as likely to increase the value of malta to great britain  he foresaw that the whole of italy would become a french province and he knew that the french government had been long intriguing on the coast of barbary the dey of algiers was believed to have accumulated a treasure of fifteen millions sterling and buonaparte had actually duped him into a treaty by which the french were to be permitted to erect a fort on the very spot where the ancient hippo stood the choice between which and the hellespont as the site of new rome is said to have perplexed the judgment of constantine  to this he added an additional point of connection with russia by means of odessa and on the supposition of a war in the baltic a still more interesting relation to turkey and the mores and the greek islands  it had been repeatedly signified to the british government that from the morea and the countries adjacent a considerable supply of ship timber and naval stores might be obtained such as would at least greatly lessen the pressure of a russian war  the agents of france were in full activity in the morea and the greek islands the possession of which by that government would augment the naval resources of the french to a degree of which few are aware who have not made the present state of commerce of the greeks an object of particular attention  in short if the possession of malta were advantageous to england solely as a convenient watchtower as a centre of intelligence its importance would be undeniable  although these suggestions did not prevent the signing away of malta at the peace of amiens they doubtless were not without effect when the ambition of buonaparte had given a full and final answer to the grand question  can we remain at peace with france  i have likewise reason to believe that sir alexander ball baffled by exposing an insidious proposal of the french government during the negotiations that preceded the recommencement of the warthat the fortifications of malta should be entirely dismantled and the island left to its inhabitants  without dwelling on the obvious inhumanity and flagitious injustice of exposing the maltese to certain pillage and slavery from their old and inveterate enemies the moors he showed that the plan would promote the interests of buonaparte even more than his actual possession of the island which france had no possible interest in desiring except as the means of keeping it out of the hands of great britain  but sir alexander ball is no more  the writer still clings to the hope that he may yet be able to record his good deeds more fully and regularly that then with a sense of comfort not without a subdued exultation he may raise heavenward from his honoured tomb the glistening eye of an humble but ever grateful friend
