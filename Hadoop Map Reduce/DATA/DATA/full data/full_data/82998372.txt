82998372	miss or mrs  by wilkie collins     persons of the story       sir joseph graybrooke         knight      richard turlington     of the levant trade      launcelot linzie  of the college of surgeons      james dicas     of the roll of attorneys      thomas wildfang     superannuated seaman      miss graybrooke      sir josephs sister      natalie         sir josephs daughter      lady winwood        sir josephs niece      amelia sophia lady winwoods stepdaughters      and dorothea    period the present time place england     first scene  at sea  the night had come to an end the newborn day waited for its quickening light in the silence that is never known on landthe silence before sunrise in a calm at sea  not a breath came from the dead air not a ripple stirred on the motionless water nothing changed but the softlygrowing light nothing moved but the lazy mist curling up to meet the sun its master on the eastward sea by fine gradations the airy veil of morning thinned in substance as it rosethinned till there dawned through it in the first rays of sunlight the tall white sails of a schooner yacht  from stem to stern silence possessed the vesselas silence possessed the sea  but one living creature was on deckthe man at the helm dozing peaceably with his arm over the useless tiller minute by minute the light grew and the heat grew with it and still the helmsman slumbered the heavy sails hung noiseless the quiet water lay sleeping against the vessels sides the whole orb of the sun was visible above the waterline when the first sound pierced its way through the morning silence from far off over the shining white ocean the cry of a seabird reached the yacht on a sudden out of the last airy circles of the waning mist  the sleeper at the helm woke looked up at the idle sails and yawned in sympathy with them looked out at the sea on either side of him and shook his head obstinately at the superior obstinacy of the calm  blow my little breeze said the man whistling the sailors invocation to the wind softly between his teeth blow my little breeze  hows her head cried a bold and brassy voice hailing the deck from the cabin staircase  anywhere you like master all round the compass  the voice was followed by the man the owner of the yacht appeared on deck  behold richard turlington esq of the great levant firm of pizzituti turlington  branca aged eightandthirty standing stiffly and sturdily at a height of not more than five feet sixmr turlington presented to the view of his fellowcreatures a face of the perpendicular order of human architecture his forehead was a straight line his upper lip was another his chin was the straightest and the longest line of all as he turned his swarthy countenance eastward and shaded his light gray eyes from the sun his knotty hand plainly revealed that it had got him his living by its own labor at one time or another in his life taken on the whole this was a man whom it might be easy to respect but whom it would be hard to love better company at the official desk than at the social table morally and physicallyif the expression may be permitteda man without a bend in him  a calm yesterday grumbled richard turlington looking with stubborn deliberation all round him and a calm today ha next season ill have the vessel fitted with engines i hate this  think of the filthy coals and the infernal vibration and leave your beautiful schooner as she is we are out for a holiday let the wind and the sea take a holiday too  pronouncing those words of remonstrance a slim nimble curlyheaded young gentleman joined richard turlington on deck with his clothes under his arm his towels in his hand and nothing on him but the nightgown in which he had stepped out of his bed  launcelot linzie you have been received on board my vessel in the capacity of medical attendant on miss natalie graybrooke at her fathers request keep your place if you please when i want your advice ill ask you for it answering in those terms the elder man fixed his colorless gray eyes on the younger with an expression which added plainly there wont be room enough in this schooner much longer for me and for you  launcelot linzie had his reasons apparently for declining to let his host offend him on any terms whatever  thank you he rejoined in a tone of satirical good humor it isnt easy to keep my place on board your vessel i cant help presuming to enjoy myself as if i was the owner the life is such a new oneto me its so delightfully easy for instance to wash yourself here on shore its a complicated question of jugs and basins and tubs one is always in danger of breaking something or spoiling something here you have only to jump out of bed to run up on deck and to do this  he turned and scampered to the bows of the vessel in one instant he was out of his nightgown in another he was on the bulwark in a third he was gamboling luxuriously in sixty fathoms of saltwater  turlingtons eyes followed him with a reluctant uneasy attention as he swam round the vessel the only moving object in view turlingtons mind steady and slow in all its operations set him a problem to be solved on given conditions as follows  launcelot linzie is fifteen years younger than i am add to that launcelot linzie is natalie graybrookes cousin given those two advantagesquery has he taken natalies fancy  turning that question slowly over and over in his mind richard turlington seated himself in a corner at the stern of the vessel he was still at work on the problem when the young surgeon returned to his cabin to put the finishing touches to his toilet he had not reached the solution when the steward appeared an hour later and said breakfast is ready sir  they were a party of five round the cabin table  first sir joseph graybrooke inheritor of a handsome fortune made by his father and his grandfather in trade mayor twice elected of a thriving provincial town officially privileged while holding that dignity to hand a silver trowel to a royal personage condescending to lay a first stone of a charitable edifice knighted accordingly in honor of the occasion worthy of the honor and worthy of the occasion a type of his eminently respectable class possessed of an amiable rosy face and soft silky white hair sound in his principles tidy in his dress blessed with moderate politics and a good digestiona harmless healthy spruce speckless weakminded old man  secondly miss lavinia graybrooke sir josephs maiden sister personally sir joseph in petticoats if you knew one you knew the other  thirdly miss natalie graybrookesir josephs only child  she had inherited the personal appearance and the temperament of her motherdead many years since there had been a mixture of negro blood and french blood in the late lady graybrookes family settled originally in martinique natalie had her mothers warm dusky color her mothers superb black hair and her mothers melting lazy lovely brown eyes at fifteen years of age dating from her last birthday she possessed the development of the bosom and limbs which in england is rarely attained before twenty everything about the girlexcept her little rosy earswas on a grand amazonian scale her shapely hand was long and large her supple waist was the waist of a woman the indolent grace of all her movements had its motive power in an almost masculine firmness of action and profusion of physical resource this remarkable bodily development was far from being accompanied by any corresponding development of character natalies manner was the gentle innocent manner of a young girl she had her fathers sweet temper ingrafted on her mothers variable southern nature she moved like a goddess and she laughed like a child signs of maturing too rapidlyof outgrowing her strength as the phrase wenthad made their appearance in sir josephs daughter during the spring the family doctor had suggested a seavoyage as a wise manner of employing the fine summer months richard turlingtons yacht was placed at her disposal with richard turlington himself included as one of the fixtures of the vessel with her father and her aunt to keep up round her the atmosphere of homewith cousin launcelot more commonly known as launce to carry out if necessary the medical treatment prescribed by superior authority on shorethe lovely invalid embarked on her summer cruise and sprang up into a new existence in the lifegiving breezes of the sea after two happy months of lazy coasting round the shores of england all that remained of natalies illness was represented by a delicious languor in her eyes and an utter inability to devote herself to anything which took the shape of a serious occupation as she sat at the cabin breakfasttable that morning in her quaintlymade sailing dress of oldfashioned nankeenher inbred childishness of manner contrasting delightfully with the blooming maturity of her formthe man must have been trebly armed indeed in the modern philosophy who could have denied that the first of a womans rights is the right of being beautiful and the foremost of a womans merits the merit of being young  the other two persons present at the table were the two gentlemen who have already appeared on the deck of the yacht  not a breath of wind stirring said richard turlington the weather has got a grudge against us we have drifted about four or five miles in the last eightandforty hours you will never take another cruise with meyou must be longing to get on shore  he addressed himself to natalie plainly eager to make himself agreeable to the young ladyand plainly unsuccessful in producing any impression on her she made a civil answer and looked at her teacup instead of looking at richard turlington  you might fancy yourself on shore at this moment said launce the vessel is as steady as a house and the swingtable we are eating our breakfast on is as even as your diningroom table at home  he too addressed himself to natalie but without betraying the anxiety to please her which had been shown by the other for all that he diverted the girls attention from her teacup and his idea instantly awakened a responsive idea in natalies mind  it will be so strange on shore she said to find myself in a room that never turns on one side and to sit at a table that never tilts down to my knees at one time or rises up to my chin at another how i shall miss the wash of the water at my ear and the ring of the bell on deck when i am awake at night on land no interest there in how the wind blows or how the sails are set no asking your way of the sun when you are lost with a little brass instrument and a morsel of pencil and paper no delightful wandering wherever the wind takes you without the worry of planning beforehand where you are to go oh how i shall miss the dear changeable inconstant sea and how sorry i am im not a man and a sailor  this to the guest admitted on board on sufferance and not one word of it addressed even by chance to the owner of the yacht  richard turlingtons heavy eyebrows contracted with an unmistakable expression of pain  if this calm weather holds he went on addressing himself to sir joseph i am afraid graybrooke i shall not be able to bring you back to the port we sailed from by the end of the week  whenever you like richard answered the old gentleman resignedly any time will do for me  any time within reasonable limits joseph said miss lavinia evidently feeling that her brother was conceding too much she spoke with sir josephs amiable smile and sir josephs softlypitched voice two twin babies could hardly have been more like one another  while these few words were being exchanged among the elders a private communication was in course of progress between the two young people under the cabin table natalies smartlyslippered foot felt its way cautiously inch by inch over the carpet till it touched launces boot launce devouring his breakfast instantly looked up from his plate and then at a second touch from natalie looked down again in a violent hurry after pausing to make sure that she was not noticed natalie took up her knife under a perfectlyacted pretense of toying with it absently in the character of a young lady absorbed in thought she began dividing a morsel of ham left on the edge of her plate into six tiny pieces launces eye looked in sidelong expectation at the divided and subdivided ham he was evidently waiting to see the collection of morsels put to some telegraphic use previously determined on between his neighbor and himself  in the meanwhile the talk proceeded among the other persons at the breakfasttable miss lavinia addressed herself to launce  do you know you careless boy you gave me a fright this morning i was sleeping with my cabin window open and i was awoke by an awful splash in the water i called for the stewardess i declare i thought somebody had fallen overboard  sir joseph looked up briskly his sister had accidentally touched on an old association  talk of falling overboard he began reminds me of an extraordinary adventure  there launce broke in making his apologies  it shant occur again miss lavinia he said tomorrow morning ill oil myself all over and slip into the water as silently as a seal  of an extraordinary adventure persisted sir joseph which happened to me many years ago when i was a young man lavinia  he stopped and looked interrogatively at his sister miss graybrooke nodded her head responsively and settled herself in her chair as if summoning her attention in anticipation of a coming demand on it to persons well acquainted with the brother and sister these proceedings were ominous of an impending narrative protracted to a formidable length the two always told a story in couples and always differed with each other about the facts the sister politely contradicting the brother when it was sir josephs story and the brother politely contradicting the sister when it was miss lavinias story separated one from the other and thus relieved of their own habitual interchange of contradiction neither of them had ever been known to attempt the relation of the simplest series of events without breaking down  it was five years before i knew you richard proceeded sir joseph  six years said miss graybrooke  excuse me lavinia  no joseph i have it down in my diary  let us waive the point sir joseph invariably used this formula as a means of at once conciliating his sister and getting a fresh start for his story i was cruising off the mersey in a liverpool pilotboat i had hired the boat in company with a friend of mine formerly notorious in london society under the nickname derived from the peculiar brown color of his whiskers of mahogany dobbs  the color of his liveries joseph not the color of his whiskers  my dear lavinia you are thinking of seagreen shaw so called from the extraordinary liveries he adopted for his servants in the year when he was sheriff  i think not joseph  i beg your pardon lavinia  richard turlingtons knotty fingers drummed impatiently on the table he looked toward natalie she was idly arranging her little morsels of ham in a pattern on her plate launcelot linzie still more idly was looking at the pattern seeing what he saw now richard solved the problem which had puzzled him on deck it was simply impossible that natalies fancy could be really taken by such an emptyheaded fool as that  sir joseph went on with his story  we were some ten or a dozen miles off the mouth of the mersey  nautical miles joseph  it doesnt matter lavinia  excuse me brother the late great and good doctor johnson said accuracy ought always to be studied even in the most trifling things  they were common miles lavinia  they were nautical miles joseph  let us waive the point mahogany dobbs and i happened to be below in the cabin occupied  here sir joseph paused with his amiable smile to consult his memory miss lavinia waited with her amiable smile for the coming opportunity of setting her brother right at the same moment natalie laid down her knife and softly touched launce under the table when she thus claimed his attention the six pieces of ham were arranged as follows in her plate two pieces were placed opposite each other and four pieces were ranged perpendicularly under them launce looked and twice touched natalie under the table interpreted by the code agreed on between the two the signal in the plate meant i must see you in private and launces double touch answered after breakfast  sir joseph proceeded with his story natalie took up her knife again another signal coming  we were both down in the cabin occupied in finishing our dinner  just sitting down to lunch joseph  my dear i ought to know  i only repeat what i heard brother the last time you told the story you and your friend were sitting down to lunch  we wont particularize lavinia suppose we say occupied over a meal  if it is of no more importance than that joseph it would be surely better to leave it out altogether  let us waive the point well we were suddenly alarmed by a shout on deck man overboard we both rushed up the cabin stairs naturally under the impression that one of our crew had fallen into the sea an impression shared i ought to add by the man at the helm who had given the alarm  sir joseph paused again he was approaching one of the great dramatic points in his story and was naturally anxious to present it as impressively as possible he considered with himself with his head a little on one side miss lavinia considered with herself with her head a little on one side natalie laid down her knife again and again touched launce under the table this time there were five pieces of ham ranged longitudinally on the plate with one piece immediately under them at the center of the line interpreted by the code this signal indicated two ominous words bad news launce looked significantly at the owner of the yacht meaning of the look is he at the bottom of it natalie frowned in reply meaning of the frown yes he is launce looked down again into the plate natalie instantly pushed all the pieces of ham together in a little heap meaning of the heap no more to say  well said richard turlington turning sharply on sir joseph get on with your story what next  thus far he had not troubled himself to show even a decent pretense of interest in his old friends perpetuallyinterrupted narrative it was only when sir joseph had reached his last sentenceintimating that the man overboard might turn out in course of time not to be a man of the pilotboats crewit was only then that turlington sat up in his chair and showed signs of suddenly feeling a strong interest in the progress of the story  sir joseph went on  as soon as we got on deck we saw the man in the water astern our vessel was hove up in the wind and the boat was lowered the master and one of the men took the oars all told our crew were seven in number two away in the boat a third at the helm and to my amazement when i looked round the other four behind me making our number complete at the same moment mahogany dobbs who was looking through a telescope called out who the devil can he be the man is floating on a hencoop and we have got nothing of the sort on board this pilotboat  the one person present who happened to notice richard turlingtons face when those words were pronounced was launcelot linzie heand he alonesaw the levant traders swarthy complexion fade slowly to a livid ashen gray his eyes the while fixing themselves on sir joseph graybrooke with a furtive glare in them like the glare in the eyes of a wild beast apparently conscious that launce was looking at himthough he never turned his head launces wayhe laid his elbow on the table lifted his arm and so rested his face on his hand while the story went on as to screen it effectually from the young surgeons view  the man was brought on board proceeded sir joseph sure enough with a hencoopon which he had been found floating the poor wretch was blue with terror and exposure in the water he fainted when we lifted him on deck when he came to himself he told us a horrible story he was a sick and destitute foreign seaman and he had hidden himself in the hold of an english vessel bound to a port in his native country which had sailed from liverpool that morning he had been discovered and brought before the captain the captain a monster in human form if ever there was one yet  before the next word of the sentence could pass sir josephs lips turlington startled the little party in the cabin by springing suddenly to his feet  the breeze he cried the breeze at last  as he spoke he wheeled round to the cabin door so as to turn his back on his guests and hailed the deck  which way is the wind  there is not a breath of wind sir  not the slightest movement in the vessel had been perceptible in the cabin not a sound had been audible indicating the rising of the breeze the owner of the yachtaccustomed to the sea capable if necessary of sailing his own vesselhad surely committed a strange mistake he turned again to his friends and made his apologies with an excess of polite regret far from characteristic of him at other times and under other circumstances  go on he said to sir joseph when he had got to the end of his excuses i never heard such an interesting story in my life pray go on  the request was not an easy one to comply with sir josephs ideas had been thrown into confusion miss lavinias contradictions held in reserve had been scattered beyond recall both brother and sister were moreover additionally hindered in recovering the control of their own resources by the look and manner of their host he alarmed instead of encouraging the two harmless old people by fronting them almost fiercely with his elbows squared on the table and his face expressive of a dogged resolution to sit there and listen if need be for the rest of his life launce was the person who set sir joseph going again after first looking attentively at richard he took his uncle straight back to the story by means of a question thus  you dont mean to say that the captain of the ship threw the man overboard  that is just what he did launce the poor wretch was too ill to work his passage the captain declared he would have no idle foreign vagabond in his ship to eat up the provisions of englishmen who worked with his own hands he cast the hencoop into the water and assisted by one of his sailors he threw the man after it and told him to float back to liverpool with the evening tide  a lie cried turlington addressing himself not to sir joseph but to launce  are you acquainted with the circumstances asked launce quietly  i know nothing about the circumstances i say from my own experience that foreign sailors are even greater blackguards than english sailors the man had met with an accident no doubt the rest of his story was a lie and the object of it was to open sir josephs purse  sir joseph mildly shook his head  no lie richard witnesses proved that the man had spoken the truth  witnesses pooh more liars you mean  i went to the owners of the vessel pursued sir joseph i got from them the names of the officers and the crew and i waited leaving the case in the hands of the liverpool police the ship was wrecked at the mouth of the amazon but the crew and the cargo were saved the men belonging to liverpool came back they were a bad set i grant you but they were examined separately about the treatment of the foreign sailor and they all told the same story they could give no account of their captain nor of the sailor who had been his accomplice in the crime except that they had not embarked in the ship which brought the rest of the crew to england whatever may have become of the captain since he certainly never returned to liverpool  did you find out his name  the question was asked by turlington even sir joseph the least observant of men noticed that it was put with a perfectly unaccountable irritability of manner  dont be angry richard said the old gentleman what is there to be angry about  i dont know what you mean im not angryim only curious did you find out who he was  i did his name was goward he was well known at liverpool as a very clever and a very dangerous man quite young at the time i am speaking of and a firstrate sailor famous for taking command of unseaworthy ships and vagabond crews report described him to me as having made considerable sums of money in that way for a man in his position serving firms you know with a bad name and running all sorts of desperate risks a sad ruffian richard more than once in trouble on both sides of the atlantic for acts of violence and cruelty dead i dare say long since  or possibly said launce alive under another name and thriving in a new way of life with more desperate risks in it of some other sort  are you acquainted with the circumstances asked turlington retorting launces question on him with a harsh ring of defiance in his brassy voice  what became of the poor foreign sailor papa said natalie purposely interrupting launce before he could meet the question angrily asked of him by an angry reply  we made a subscription and spoke to his consul my dear he went back to his country poor fellow comfortably enough  and there is an end of sir josephs story said turlington rising noisily from his chair its a pity we havent got a literary man on boardhe would make a novel of it he looked up at the skylight as he got on his feet here is the breeze this time he exclaimed and no mistake  it was true at last the breeze had come the sails flapped the main boom swung over with a thump and the stagnant water stirred at last bubbled merrily past the vessels sides  come on deck natalie and get some fresh air said miss lavinia leading the way to the cabin door  natalie held up the skirt of her nankeen dress and exhibited the purple trimming torn away over an extent of some yards  give me half an hour first aunt in my cabin she said to mend this  miss lavinia elevated her venerable eyebrows in amazement  you have done nothing but tear your dresses my dear since you have been in mr turlingtons yacht most extraordinary i have torn none of mine during the whole cruise  natalies dark color deepened a shade she laughed a little uneasily i am so awkward on board ship she replied and turned away and shut herself up in her cabin  richard turlington produced his case of cigars  now is the time he said to sir joseph for the best cigar of the daythe cigar after breakfast come on deck  you will join us launce said sir joseph  give me half an hour first over my books launce replied i mustnt let my medical knowledge get musty at sea and i might not feel inclined to study later in the day  quite right my dear boy quite right  sir joseph patted his nephew approvingly on the shoulder launce turned away on his side and shut himself up in his cabin  the other three ascended together to the deck     second scene  the storeroom  persons possessed of sluggish livers and tender hearts find two serious drawbacks to the enjoyment of a cruise at sea it is exceedingly difficult to get enough walking exercise and it is next to impossible where secrecy is an object to make love without being found out reverting for the moment to the latter difficulty only life within the narrow and populous limits of a vessel may be defined as essentially life in public from morning to night you are in your neighbors way or your neighbor is in your way as a necessary result of these conditions the rarest of existing men may be defined as the man who is capable of stealing a kiss at sea without discovery an inbred capacity for stratagem of the finest sort inexhaustible inventive resources patience which can flourish under superhuman trials presence of mind which can keep its balance victoriously under every possible stress of emergencythese are some of the qualifications which must accompany love on a cruise when love embarks in the character of a contraband commodity not duly entered on the papers of the ship  having established a code of signals which enabled them to communicate privately while the eyes and ears of others were wide open on every side of them natalie and launce were next confronted by the more serious difficulty of finding a means of meeting together at stolen interviews on board the yacht possessing none of those precious moral qualifications already enumerated as the qualifications of an accomplished lover at sea launce had proved unequal to grapple with the obstacles in his way left to her own inventive resources natalie had first suggested the young surgeons medical studies as launces unanswerable excuse for shutting himself up at intervals in the lower regions and had then hit on the happy idea of tearing her trimmings and condemning herself to repair her own carelessness as the allsufficient reason for similar acts of selfseclusion on her side in this way the lovers contrived while the innocent ruling authorities were on deck to meet privately below them on the neutral ground of the main cabin and there by previous arrangement at the breakfasttable they were about to meet privately now  natalies door was as usual on these occasions the first that opened for this sound reason that natalies quickness was the quickness to be depended on in case of accident  she looked up at the skylight there were the legs of the two gentlemen and the skirts of her aunt visible and stationary on the lee side of the deck she advanced a few steps and listened there was a pause in the murmur of the voices above she looked up again one pair of legs not her fathers had disappeared without an instants hesitation natalie darted back to her own door just in time to escape richard turlington descending the cabin stairs all he did was to go to one of the drawers under the maincabin bookcase and to take out a map ascending again immediately to the deck natalies guilty conscience rushed instantly nevertheless to the conclusion that richard suspected her when she showed herself for the second time instead of venturing into the cabin she called across it in a whisper  launce  launce appeared at his door he was peremptorily checked before he could cross the threshold  dont stir a step richard has been down in the cabin richard suspects us  nonsense come out  nothing will induce me unless you can find some other place than the cabin  some other place how easy to find it on land how apparently impossible at sea there was the forecastle full of men at one end of the vessel there was the sail room full of sails at the other there was the ladies cabin used as the ladies dressingroom inaccessible in that capacity to every male human being on board was there any disposable inclosed space to be found amidships on one side there were the sleeping berths of the sailingmaster and his mate impossible to borrow them on the other side was the stewards storeroom launce considered for a moment the stewards storeroom was just the thing  where are you going asked natalie as her lover made straight for a closed door at the lower extremity of the main cabin  to speak to the steward darling wait one moment and you will see me again  launce opened the storeroom door and discovered not the steward but his wife who occupied the situation of stewardess on board the vessel the accident was in this case a lucky one having stolen several kisses at sea and having been discovered in every case either by the steward or his wife launce felt no difficulty in prefacing his request to be allowed the use of the room by the plainest allusion to his relations with natalie he could count on the silence of the sympathizing authorities in this region of the vessel having wisely secured them as accomplices by the usual persuasion of the pecuniary sort of the two however the stewardess as a woman was the more likely to lend a ready ear to launces entreaties in his present emergency after a faint show of resistance she consented not only to leave the room but to keep her husband out of it on the understanding that it was not to be occupied for more than ten minutes launce made the signal to natalie at one door while the stewardess went out by the other in a moment more the lovers were united in a private room is it necessary to say in what language the proceedings were opened surely not there is an inarticulate language of the lips in use on these occasions in which we are all proficient though we sometimes forget it in later life natalie seated herself on a locker the tea sugar and spices were at her back a side of bacon swung over her head and a net full of lemons dangled before her face it might not be roomy but it was snug and comfortable  suppose they call for the steward she suggested dont launce  never mind we shall be safe enough if they do the steward has only to show himself on deck and they will suspect nothing  do be quiet launce i have got dreadful news to tell you and besides my aunt will expect to see me with my braid sewn on again  she had brought her needle and thread with her whipping up the skirt of her dress on her knee she bent forward over it and set herself industriously to the repair of the torn trimming in this position her lithe figure showed charmingly its firm yet easy line the needle in her dexterous brown fingers flew through its work the locker was a broad one launce was able to seat himself partially behind her in this position who could have resisted the temptation to lift up her great knot of broadlyplaited black hair and to let the warm dusky nape of her neck disclose itself to view who looking at it could fail to revile the senseless modern fashion of dressing the hair which hides the double beauty of form and color that nestles at the back of a womans neck from time to time as the interview proceeded launces lips emphasized the more important words occurring in his share of the conversation on the soft fragrant skin which the lifted hair let him see at intervals in launces place sir you would have done it too  now natalie what is the news  he has spoken to papa launce  richard turlington  yes  dn him  natalie started a curse addressed to the back of your neck instantly followed by a blessing in the shape of a kiss is a little trying when you are not prepared for it  dont do that again launce it was while you were on deck smoking and when i was supposed to be fast asleep i opened the ventilator in my cabin door dear and i heard every word they said he waited till my aunt was out of the way and he had got papa all to himself and then he began it in that horrible downright voice of hisgraybrooke how much longer am i to wait  did he say that  no more swearing launce those were the words papa didnt understand them he only said poor dearbless my soul richard what do you want richard soon explained himself who could he be waiting forbut me papa said something about my being so young richard stopped his mouth directly girls were like fruit some ripened soon and some ripened late some were women at twenty and some were women at sixteen it was impossible to look at me and not see that i was like a new being after my two months at sea and so on and so on papa behaved like an angel he still tried to put it off plenty of time richard plenty of time plenty of time for her was the wretchs answer to that but not for me think of all i have to offer her as if i cared for his money think how long i have looked upon her as growing up to be my wife growing up for himmonstrous and dont keep me in a state of uncertainty which it gets harder and harder for a man in my position to endure he was really quite eloquent his voice trembled there is no doubt dear that he is very very fond of me  and you feel flattered by it of course  dont talk nonsense i feel a little frightened at it i can tell you  frightened did you notice him this morning  i when  when your father was telling that story about the man overboard  no what did he do tell me launce  ill tell you directly how did it all end last night did your father make any sort of promise  you know richards way richard left him no other choice papa had to promise before he was allowed to go to bed  to let turlington marry you  yes the week after my next birthday  the week after next christmasday  yes papa is to speak to me as soon as we are at home again and my married life is to begin with the new year  are you in earnest natalie do you really mean to say it has gone as far as that  they have settled everything the splendid establishment we are to set up the great income we are to have i heard papa tell richard that half his fortune should go to me on my weddingday it was sickening to hear how much they made of money and how little they thought of love what am i to do launce  thats easily answered my darling in the first place you are to make up your mind not to marry richard turlington  do talk reasonably you know i have done all i could i have told papa that i can think of richard as a friend but not as a husband he only laughs at me and says wait a little and you will alter your opinion my dear you see richard is everything to him richard has always managed his affairs and has saved him from losing by bad speculations richard has known me from the time when i was a child richard has a splendid business and quantities of money papa cant even imagine that i can resist richard i have tried my aunt i have told her he is too old for me all she says is look at your father he was much older than your mother and what a happy marriage theirs was even if i said in so many words i wont marry richard what good would it do to us papa is the best and dearest old man in the world but oh he is so fond of money he believes in nothing else he would be furiousyes kind as he is he would be furiousif i even hinted that i was fond of you any man who proposed to marry meif he couldnt match the fortune that i should bring him by a fortune of his ownwould be a lunatic in papas eyes he wouldnt think it necessary to answer him he would ring the bell and have him shown out of the house i am exaggerating nothing launce you know i am speaking the truth there is no hope in the futurethat i can seefor either of us  have you done natalie i have something to say on my side if you have  what is it  if things go on as they are going on now shall i tell you how it will end it will end in your being turlingtons wife  never  so you say now but you dont know what may happen between this and christmasday natalie there is only one way of making sure that you will never marry richard marry me  without papas consent  without saying a word to anybody till its done  oh launce launce  my darling every word you have said proves there is no other way think of it natalie think of it  there was a pause natalie dropped her needle and thread and hid her face in her hands if my poor mother was only alive she said if i only had an elder sister to advise me and to take my part  she was evidently hesitating launce took a mans advantage of her indecision he pressed her without mercy  do you love me he whispered with his lips close to her ear  you know i do dearly  put it out of richards power to part us natalie  part us we are cousins we have known each other since we were both children even if he proposed parting us papa wouldnt allow it  mark my words he will propose it as for your father richard has only to lift his finger and your father obeys him my love the happiness of both our lives is at stake he wound his arm round her and gently drew her head back on his bosom other girls have done it darling he pleaded why shouldnt you  the effort to answer him was too much for her she gave it up a low sigh fluttered through her lips she nestled closer to him and faintly closed her eyes the next instant she started up trembling from head to foot and looked at the skylight richard turlingtons voice was suddenly audible on deck exactly above them  graybrooke i want to say a word to you about launcelot linzie  natalies first impulse was to fly to the door hearing launces name on richards lips she checked herself something in richards tone roused in her the curiosity which suspends fear she waited with her hand in launces hand  if you remember the brassy voice went on i doubted the wisdom of taking him with us on this cruise you didnt agree with me and at your express request i gave way i did wrong launcelot linzie is a very presuming young man  sir josephs answer was accompanied by sir josephs mellow laugh  my dear richard surely you are a little hard on launce  you are not an observant man graybrooke i am i see signs of his presuming with all of us and especially with natalie i dont like the manner in which he speaks to her and looks at her he is unduly familiar he is insolently confidential there must be a stop put to it in my position my feelings ought to be regarded i request you to check the intimacy when we get on shore  sir josephs next words were spoken more seriously he expressed his surprise  my dear richard they are cousins they have been playmates from childhood how can you think of attaching the slightest importance to anything that is said or done by poor launce  there was a goodhumored contempt in sir josephs reference to poor launce which jarred on his daughter he might almost have been alluding to some harmless domestic animal natalies color deepened her hand pressed launces hand gently  turlington still persisted  i must once more requestseriously requestthat you will check this growing intimacy i dont object to your asking him to the house when you ask other friends i only wish you and expect you to stop his dropping in as it is called any hour of the day or evening when he may have nothing to do is that understood between us  if you make a point of it richard of course its understood between us  launce looked at natalie as weak sir joseph consented in those words  what did i tell you he whispered  natalie hung her head in silence there was a pause in the conversation on deck the two gentlemen walked away slowly toward the forward part of the vessel  launce pursued his advantage  your father leaves us no alternative he said the door will be closed against me as soon as we get on shore if i lose you natalie i dont care what becomes of me my profession may go to the devil i have nothing left worth living for  hush hush dont talk in that way  launce tried the soothing influence of persuasion once more  hundreds and hundreds of people in our situation have married privatelyand have been forgiven afterward he went on i wont ask you to do anything in a hurry i will be guided entirely by your wishes all i want to quiet my mind is to know that you are mine do do do make me feel sure that richard turlington cant take you away from me  dont press me launce she dropped on the locker see she said it makes me tremble only to think of it  who are you afraid of darling not your father surely  poor papa i wonder whether he would be hard on me for the first time in his life she stopped her moistening eyes looked up imploringly in launces face dont press me she repeated faintly you know its wrong we should have to confess itand then what would happen she paused again her eyes wandered nervously to the deck her voice dropped to its lowest tones think of richard she said and shuddered at the terrors which that name conjured up before it was possible to say a quieting word to her she was again on her feet richards name had suddenly recalled to her memory launces mysterious allusion at the outset of the interview to the owner of the yacht what was that you said about richard just now she asked you saw something or heard something strange while papa was telling his story what was it  i noticed richards face natalie when your father told us that the man overboard was not one of the pilotboats crew he turned ghastly pale he looked guilty  guilty of what  he was presenti am certain of itwhen the sailor was thrown into the sea for all i know he may have been the man who did it  natalie started back in horror  oh launce launce that is too bad you may not like richardyou may treat richard as your enemy but to say such a horrible thing of him as thatits not generous its not like you  if you had seen him you would have said it too i mean to make inquiriesin your fathers interests as well as in ours my brother knows one of the commissioners of police and my brother can get it done for me turlington has not always been in the levant tradei know that already  for shame launce for shame  the footsteps on deck were audible coming back natalie sprang to the door leading into the cabin launce stopped her as she laid her hand on the lock the footsteps went straight on toward the stern of the vessel launce clasped both arms round her natalie gave way  dont drive me to despair he said this is my last opportunity i dont ask you to say at once that you will marry me i only ask you to think of it my darling my angel will you think of it  as he put the question they might have heard if they had not been too completely engrossed in each other to listen the footsteps returningone pair of footsteps only this time natalies prolonged absence had begun to surprise her aunt and had roused a certain vague distrust in richards mind he walked back again along the deck by himself he looked absently in the main cabin as he passed it the storeroom skylight came next in his present frame of mind would he look absently into the storeroom too  let me go said natalie  launce only answered say yes and held her as if he would never let her go again  at the same moment miss lavinias voice rose shrill from the deck calling for natalie there was but one way of getting free from him she said ill think of it upon that he kissed her and let her go  the door had barely closed on her when the lowering face of richard turlington appeared on a level with the side of the skylight looking down into the storeroom at launce  halloo he called out roughly what are you doing in the stewards room  launce took up a box of matches on the dresser im getting a light he answered readily  i allow nobody below forward of the main cabin without my leave the steward has permitted a breach of discipline on board my vessel the steward will leave my service  the steward is not to blame  i am the judge of that not you  launce opened his lips to reply an outbreak between the two men appeared to be inevitable when the sailingmaster of the yacht joined his employer on deck and directed turlingtons attention to a question which is never to be trifled with at sea the question of wind and tide  the yacht was then in the bristol channel at the entrance to bideford bay the breeze fast freshening was also fast changing the direction from which it blew the favorable tide had barely three hours more to run  the winds shifting sir said the sailingmaster im afraid we shant get round the point this tide unless we lay her off on the other tack  turlington shook his head  there are letters waiting for me at bideford he said we have lost two days in the calm i must send ashore to the postoffice whether we lose the tide or not  the vessel held on her course off the port of bideford the boat was sent ashore to the postoffice the yacht standing off and on waiting the appearance of the letters in the shortest time in which it was possible to bring them on board the letters were in turlingtons hands  the men were hauling the boat up to the davits the yacht was already heading off from the land when turlington startled everybody by one peremptory wordstop  he had thrust all his letters but one into the pocket of his sailing jacket without reading them the one letter which he had opened he held in his closed hand rage was in his staring eyes consternation was on his pale lips  lower the boat he shouted i must get to london tonight he stopped sir joseph approaching him with opened mouth theres no time for questions and answers i must get back he swung himself over the side of the yacht and addressed the sailingmaster from the boat save the tide if you can if you cant put them ashore tomorrow at minehead or watchetwherever they like he beckoned to sir joseph to lean over the bulwark and hear something he had to say in private remember what i told you about launcelot linzie he whispered fiercely his parting look was for natalie he spoke to her with a strong constraint on himself as gently as he could dont be alarmed i shall see you in london he seated himself in the boat and took the tiller the last words they heard him say were words urging the men at the oars to lose no time he was invariably brutal with the men pull you lazy beggars he exclaimed with an oath pull for your lives     third scene  the money market  let us be seriousbusiness  the new scene plunges us head foremost into the affairs of the levant tradinghouse of pizzituti turlington  branca what on earth do we know about the levant trade courage if we have ever known what it is to want money we are perfectly familiar with the subject at starting the levant trade does occasionally get into difficultiesturlington wanted money  the letter which had been handed to him on board the yacht was from his third partner mr branca and was thus expressed  a crisis in the trade all right so farexcept our business with the small foreign firms bills to meet from those quarters say forty thousand poundsand i fear no remittances to cover them particulars stated in another letter addressed to you at postoffice ilfracombe i am quite broken down with anxiety and confined to my bed pizzituti is still detained at smyrna come back at once  the same evening turlington was at his office in austin friars investigating the state of affairs with his head clerk to help him  stated briefly the business of the firm was of the widely miscellaneous sort they plied a brisk trade in a vast variety of commodities nothing came amiss to them from manchester cotton manufactures to smyrna figs they had branch houses at alexandria and odessa and correspondents here there and everywhere along the shores of the mediterranean and in the ports of the east these correspondents were the persons alluded to in mr brancas letter as small foreign firms and they had produced the serious financial crisis in the affairs of the great house in austin friars which had hurried turlington up to london  every one of these minor firms claimed and received the privilege of drawing bills on pizzituti turlington  branca for amounts varying from four to six thousand poundson no better security than a verbal understanding that the money to pay the bills should be forwarded before they fell due competition it is needless to say was at the bottom of this insanely reckless system of trading the native firms laid it down as a rule that they would decline to transact business with any house in the trade which refused to grant them their privilege in the ease of turlingtons house the foreign merchants had drawn their bills on him for sums large in the aggregate if not large in themselves had long since turned those bills into cash in their own markets for their own necessities and had now left the money which their paper represented to be paid by their london correspondents as it fell due in some instances they had sent nothing but promises and excuses in others they had forwarded drafts on firms which had failed already or which were about to fail in the crisis after first exhausting his resources in ready money mr branca had provided for the more pressing necessities by pledging the credit of the house so far as he could pledge it without exciting suspicion of the truth this done there were actually left between that time and christmas liabilities to be met to the extent of forty thousand pounds without a farthing in hand to pay that formidable debt  after working through the night this was the conclusion at which richard turlington arrived when the rising sun looked in at him through the windows of his private room  the whole force of the blow had fallen on him the share of his partners in the business was of the most trifling nature the capital was his the risk was his personally and privately he had to find the money or to confront the one other alternativeruin  how was the money to be found  with his position in the city he had only to go to the famous moneylending and discounting house of bulpit brothersreported to turn over millions in their business every yearand to supply himself at once with the necessary funds forty thousand pounds was a trifling transaction to bulpit brothers  having got the money how in the present state of his trade was the loan to be paid back  his thoughts reverted to his marriage with natalie  curious he said to himself recalling his conversation with sir joseph on board the yacht graybrooke told me he would give his daughter half his fortune on her marriage half graybrookes fortune happens to be just forty thousand pounds he took a turn in the room no it was impossible to apply to sir joseph once shake sir josephs conviction of his commercial solidity and the marriage would be certainly deferredif not absolutely broken off sir josephs fortune could be made available in the present emergency in but one wayhe might use it to repay his debt he had only to make the date at which the loan expired coincide with the date of his marriage and there was his fatherinlaws money at his disposal or at his wifes disposalwhich meant the same thing its well i pressed graybrooke about the marriage when i did he thought i can borrow the money at a short date in three months from this natalie will be my wife  he drove to his club to get breakfast with his mind cleared for the time being of all its anxieties but one  knowing where he could procure the loan he was by no means equally sure of being able to find the security on which he could borrow the money living up to his income having no expectations from any living creature possessing in landed property only some thirty or forty acres in somersetshire with a quaint little dwelling half farm house halfcottage attachedhe was incapable of providing the needful security from his own personal resources to appeal to wealthy friends in the city would be to let those friends into the secret of his embarrassments and to put his credit in peril he finished his breakfast and went back to austin friarsfailing entirely so far to see how he was to remove the last obstacle now left in his way  the doors were open to the public business had begun he had not been ten minutes in his room before the shippingclerk knocked at the door and interrupted him still absorbed in his own anxious thoughts  what is it he asked irritably  duplicate bills of lading sir answered the clerk placing the documents on his ma sters table  found there was the security on his writingdesk staring him in the face he dismissed the clerk and examined the papers  they contained an account of goods shipped to the london house on board vessels sailing from smyrna and odessa and they were signed by the masters of the ships who thereby acknowledged the receipt of the goods and undertook to deliver them safely to the persons owning them as directed first copies of these papers had already been placed in the possession of the london house the duplicates had now followed in case of accident richard turlington instantly determined to make the duplicates serve as his security keeping the first copies privately under lock and key to be used in obtaining possession of the goods at the customary time the fraud was a fraud in appearance only the security was a pure formality his marriage would supply him with the funds needed for repaying the money and the profits of his business would provide in course of time for restoring the dowry of his wife it was simply a question of preserving his credit by means which were legitimately at his disposal within the lax limits of mercantile morality richard turlington had a conscience he put on his hat and took his false security to the moneylenders without feeling at all lowered in his own estimation as an honest man  bulpit brothers long desirous of having such a name as his on their books received him with open arms the security covering the amount borrowed was accepted as a matter of course the money was lent for three months with a stroke of the pen turlington stepped out again into the street and confronted the city of london in the character of the noblest work of mercantile creationa solvent man  the fallen angel walking invisibly behind in richards shadow flapped his crippled wings in triumph from that moment the fallen angel had got him        it may not be amiss to remind the incredulous reader that      a famous firm in the city accepted precisely the same      security as that here accepted by bulpit brothers with the      same sublime indifference to troubling themselves by making      any inquiry about it     fourth scene  muswell hill  the next day turlington drove to the suburbs on the chance of finding the graybrookes at home again sir joseph disliked london and could not prevail on himself to live any nearer to the metropolis than muswell hill when natalie wanted a change and languished for balls theaters flowershows and the like she had a room especially reserved for her in the house of sir josephs married sister mrs sancroft living in that central deep of the fashionable whirlpool known among mortals as berkeley square  on his way through the streets turlington encountered a plain proof that the graybrookes must have returned he was passed by launce driving in company with a gentleman in a cab the gentleman was launces brother and the two were on their way to the commissioners of police to make the necessary arrangements for instituting an inquiry into turlingtons early life  arrived at the gate of the villa the information received only partially fulfilled the visitors expectations the family had returned on the previous evening sir joseph and his sister were at home but natalie was away again already she had driven into town to lunch with her aunt turlington went into the house  have you lost any money those were the first words uttered by sir joseph when he and richard met again after the parting on board the yacht  not a farthing i might have lost seriously if i had not got back in time to set things straight stupidity on the part of my people left in chargenothing more its all right now  sir joseph lifted his eyes with heartfelt devotion to the ceiling thank god richard he said in tones of the deepest feeling he rang the bell tell miss graybrooke mr turlington is here he turned again to richard lavinia is like melavinia has been so anxious about you we have both of us passed a sleepless night miss lavinia came in sir joseph hurried to meet her and took her affectionately by both hands my dear the best of all good news richard has not lost a farthing miss lavinia lifted her eyes to the ceiling with heartfelt devotion and said thank god richardlike the echo of her brothers voice a little late perhaps for its reputation as an echo but accurate to half a note in its perfect repetition of sound  turlington asked the question which it had been his one object to put in paying his visit to muswell hill  have you spoken to natalie  this morning replied sir joseph an opportunity offered itself after breakfast i took advantage of it richardyou shall hear how  he settled himself in his chair for one of his interminable stories he began his opening sentenceand stopped struck dumb at the first word there was an unexpected obstacle in the wayhis sister was not attending to him his sister had silenced him at starting the story touching this time on the question of marriage miss lavinia had her womans interest in seeing full justice done to the subject she seized on her brothers narrative as on property in her own right  joseph should have told you she began addressing herself to turlington that our dear girl was unusually depressed in spirits this morning quite in the right frame of mind for a little serious talk about her future life she ate nothing at breakfast poor child but a morsel of dry toast  and marmalade said sir joseph striking in at the first opportunity the story on this occasion being miss lavinias story the polite contradictions necessary to its successful progress were naturally transferred from the sister to the brother and became contradictions on sir josephs side  no said miss lavinia gently if you will have it josephjam  i beg your pardon persisted sir joseph marmalade  what does it matter brother  sister the late great and good doctor johnson said accuracy ought always to be studied even in the most trifling things  you will have your way josephthis was the formulaanswering to sir josephs let us waive the pointwhich miss lavinia used as a means of conciliating her brother and getting a fresh start for her story well we took dear natalie out between us after breakfast for a little walk in the grounds my brother opened the subject with infinite delicacy and tact circumstances he said into which it was not then necessary to enter made it very desirable young as she was to begin to think of her establishment in life and then he referred richard so nicely to your faithful and devoted attachment  excuse me lavinia i began with richards attachment and then i got on to her establishment in life  excuse me joseph you managed it much more delicately than you suppose you didnt drag richard in by the head and shoulders in that way  lavinia i began with richard  joseph your memory deceives you  turlingtons impatience broke through all restraint  how did it end he asked did you propose to her that we should be married in the first week of the new year  yes said miss lavinia  no said sir joseph  the sister looked at the brother with an expression of affectionate surprise the brother looked at the sister with a fund of amiable contradiction expressed in a low bow  do you really mean to deny joseph that you told natalie we had decided on the first week in the new year  i deny the new year lavinia i said early in january  you will have your way joseph we were walking in the shrubbery at the time i had our dear girls arm in mine and i felt it tremble she suddenly stopped oh she said not so soon i said my dear consider richard she turned to her father she said dont pray dont press it so soon papa i respect richard i like richard as your true and faithful friend but i dont love him as i ought to love him if i am to be his wife imagine her talking in that way what could she possibly know about it of course we both laughed  you laughed lavinia  you laughed joseph  get on for gods sake cried turlington striking his hand passionately on the table by which he was sitting dont madden me by contradicting each other did she give way or not  miss lavinia turned to her brother contradicting each other joseph she exclaimed lifting her hands in blank amazement  contradicting each other repeated sir joseph equally astonished on his side my dear richard what can you be thinking of i contradict my sister we never disagreed in our lives  i contradict my brother we have never had a cross word between us from the time when we were children  turlington internally cursed his own irritable temper  i beg your pardonboth of you he said i didnt know what i was saying make some allowance for me all my hopes in life are centered in natalie and you have just told me in her own words miss lavinia that she doesnt love you dont mean any harm i dare say but you cut me to the heart  this confession and the look that accompanied it touched the ready sympathies of the two old people in the right place the remainder of the story dropped between them by common consent they vied with each other in saying the comforting words which would allay their dear richards anxiety how little he knew of young girls how could he be so foolish poor fellow as to attach any serious importance to what natalie had said as if a young creature in her teens knew the state of her own heart protestations and entreaties were matters of course in such cases tears even might be confidently expected from a rightminded girl it had all ended exactly as richard would have wished it to end sir joseph had said my child this is a matter of experience love will come when you are married and miss lavinia had added dear natalie if you remembered your poor mother as i remember her you would know that your fathers experience is to be relied on in that way they had put it to her and she had hung her head and had givenall that maiden modesty could be expected to givea silent consent the weddingday was fixed for the first week in the new year no joseph not januarythe new year and god bless you richard and may your married life be a long and happy one  so the average ignorance of human nature and the average belief in conventional sentiment complacently contemplated the sacrifice of one more victim on the alldevouring altar of marriage so sir joseph and his sister provided launcelot linzie with the one argument which he wanted to convince natalie choose between making the misery of your life by marrying him and making the happiness of your life by marrying me  when shall i see her asked turlington with miss lavinia in tears which did her credit in possession of one of his hands and sir joseph in tears which did him credit in possession of the other  she will be back to dinner dear richard stay and dine  thank you i must go into the city first i will come back and dine  with that arrangement in prospect he left them  an hour later a telegram arrived from natalie she had consented to dine as well as lunch in berkeley squaresleeping there that night and returning the next morning her father instantly telegraphed back by the messenger insisting on natalies return to muswell hill that evening in time to meet richard turlington at dinner  quite right joseph said miss lavinia looking over her brothers shoulder while he wrote the telegram  she is showing a disposition to coquet with richard rejoined sir joseph with the air of a man who knew female human nature in its remotest corners my telegram lavinia will have its effect  sir joseph was quite right his telegram had its effect it not only brought his daughter back to dinnerit produced another result which his prophetic faculty had altogether failed to foresee  the message reached berkeley square at five oclock in the afternoon let us follow the message     fifth scene  the square  between four and five in the afternoonwhen the women of the western regions are in their carriages and the men are at their clubslondon presents few places more conveniently adapted for purposes of private talk than the solitary garden inclosure of a square  on the day when richard turlington paid his visit to muswell hill two ladies with a secret between them unlocked the gate of the railed garden in berkeley square they shut the gate after entering the inclosure but carefully forbore to lock it as well and carefully restricted their walk to the westward side of the garden one of them was natalie graybrooke the other was mrs sancrofts eldest daughter a certain temporary interest attached in the estimation of society to this young lady she had sold well in the marriage market in other words she had recently been raised to the position of lord winwoods second wife his lordship conferring on the bride not only the honors of the peerage but the additional distinction of being stepmother to his three single daughters all older than herself in person lady winwood was little and fair in character she was dashing and resolutea complete contrast to natalie and on that very account natalies bosom friend  my dear one ambitious marriage in the family is quite enough i have made up my mind that you shall marry the man you love dont tell me your courage is failing youthe excuse is contemptible i decline to receive it natalie the men have a phrase which exactly describes your character you want backbone  the bonnet of the lady who expressed herself in these peremptory terms barely reached the height of natalies shoulder natalie might have blown the little airy lighthaired unsubstantial creature over the railings of the garden if she had taken a good long breath and stooped low enough but who ever met with a tall woman who had a will of her own natalies languid brown eyes looked softly down in submissive attention from an elevation of five feet seven lady winwoods brisk blue eyes looked brightly up in despotic command from an elevation of four feet eleven in her shoes  you are trifling with mr linzie my dear mr linzie is a nice fellow i like him i wont have that  louisa  mr turlington has nothing to recommend him he is not a wellbred old gentleman of exalted rank he is only an odious brute who happens to have made money you shall not marry mr turlington and you shall marry launcelot linzie  will you let me speak louisa  i will let you answernothing more didnt you come crying to me this morning didnt you say louisa they have pronounced sentence on me i am to be married in the first week of the new year help me out of it for heavens sake you said all that and more and what did i do when i heard your story  oh you were so kind  kind doesnt half express it i have committed crimes on your account i have deceived my husband and my mother for your sake i got mamma to ask mr linzie to lunch as my friend for your sake i have banished my unoffending husband not an hour since to his club you wretched girl who arranged a private conference in the library who sent mr linzie off to consult his friend in the temple on the law of clandestine marriage who suggested your telegraphing home and stopping here for the night who made an appointment to meet your young man privately in this detestable place in ten minutes time i did i did i did all in your interests all to prevent you from doing what i have donemarrying to please your family instead of to please yourself i dont complain mind of lord winwood or of his daughters he is charming his daughters i shall tame in course of time you are different and mr turlington as i observed before is a brute very well now what do you owe me on your side you owe it to me at least to know your own mind you dont know it you coolly inform me that you darent run the risk after all and that you cant face the consequences on second thoughts ill tell you what you dont deserve that nice fellow who worships the very ground you tread on you are a breadandbutter miss i dont believe you are fond of him  not fond of him natalie stopped and clasped her hands in despair of finding language strong enough for the occasion at the same moment the sound of a closing gate caught her ear she looked round launce had kept his appointment before his time launce was in the garden rapidly approaching them  now for the law of clandestine marriage said lady winwood mr linzie we will take it sitting she led the way to one of the benches in the garden and placed launce between natalie and herself well chief conspirator have you got the license no does it cost too much can i lend you the money  it costs perjury lady winwood in my case said launce natalie is not of age i can only get a license by taking my oath that i marry her with her fathers consent he turned piteously to natalie i couldnt very well do that he said in the tone of a man who feels bound to make an apology could i natalie shuddered lady winwood shrugged her shoulders  in your place a woman wouldnt have hesitated her ladyship remarked but men are so selfish well i suppose there is some other way  yes there is another way said launce but there is a horrid condition attached to it  something worse than perjury mr linzie murder  ill tell you directly lady winwood the marriage comes first the condition follows there is only one chance for us we must be married by banns  banns cried natalie why banns are publicly proclaimed in church  they neednt be proclaimed in your church you goose said lady winwood and even if they were nobody would be the wiser you may trust implicitly my dear in the elocution of an english clergyman  thats just what my friend said cried launce take a lodging near a large parish church in a remote part of londonthis is my friends advicego to the clerk tell him you want to be married by banns and say you belong to that parish as for the lady in your place i should simplify it i should say she belonged to the parish too give an address and have some one there to answer questions how is the clerk to know he isnt likely to be overanxious about ithis fee is eighteenpence the clerk makes his profit out of you after you are married the same rule applies to the parson he will have your names supplied to him on a strip of paper with dozens of other names and he will read them out all together in one inarticulate jumble in church you will stand at the altar when your time comes with brown and jones nokes and styles jack and gill all that you will have to do is to take care that your young lady doesnt fall to jack and you to gill by mistakeand there you are married by banns my friends opinion stated in his own words  natalie sighed and wrung her hands in her lap we shall never get through it she said despondingly  lady winwood took a more cheerful view  i see nothing very formidable as yet my dear but we have still to hear the end of it you mentioned a condition just now mr linzie  i am coming to the condition lady winwood you naturally suppose as i did that i put natalie into a cab and run away with her from the church door  certainly and i throw an old shoe after you for luck and go home again  launce shook his head ominously  natalie must go home again as well as you  lady winwood started is that the condition you mentioned just now she asked  that is the condition i may marry her without anything serious coming of it but if i run away with her afterward and if you are there aiding and abetting me we are guilty of abduction and we may stand side by side at the bar of the old bailey to answer for it  natalie sprang to her feet in horror lady winwood held up one finger warningly signing to her to let launce go on  natalie is not yet sixteen years old launce proceeded she must go straight back to her fathers house from the church and i must wait to run away with her till her next birthday when shes turned sixteen shes ripe for elopementnot an hour before there is the law of abduction despotism in a free countrythats what i call it  natalie sat down again with an air of relief  its a very comforting law i think she said it doesnt force one to take the dreadful step of running away from home all at once it gives one time to consider and plan and make up ones mind i can tell you this launce if i am to be persuaded into marrying you the law of abduction is the only thing that will induce me to do it you ought to thank the law instead of abusing it  launce listenedwithout conviction  its a pleasant prospect he said to part at the church door and to treat my own wife on the footing of a young lady who is engaged to marry another gentleman  is it any pleasanter for me retorted natalie to have richard turlington courting me when i am all the time your wife i shall never be able to do it i wish i was dead  come come interposed lady winwood its time to be serious natalies birthday mr linzie is next christmasday she will be sixteen  at seven in the morning said launce i got that out of sir joseph at one minute past seven greenwich mean time we may be off together i got that out of the lawyer  and it isnt an eternity to wait from now till christmasday you get that by way of completing the list of your acquisitions out of me in the mean time can you or can you not manage to meet the difficulties in the way of the marriage  i have settled everything launce answered confidently there is not a single difficulty left  he turned to natalie listening to him in amazement and explained himself it had struck him that he might appealwith his purse in his hand of courseto the interest felt in his affairs by the late stewardess of the yacht that excellent woman had volunteered to do all that she could to help him her husband had obtained situations for his wife and himself on board another yachtand they were both eager to assist in any conspiracy in which their late merciless master was destined to play the part of victim when on shore they lived in a populous london parish far away from the fashionable district of berkeley square and further yet from the respectable suburb of muswell hill a room in the house could be nominally engaged for natalie in the assumed character of the stewardesss niecethe stewardess undertaking to answer any purely formal questions which might be put by the church authorities and to be present at the marriage ceremony as for launce he would actually as well as nominally live in the district close by and the steward if needful would answer for him natalie might call at her parochial residence occasionally under the wing of lady winwood gaining leave of absence from muswell hill on the plea of paying one of her customary visits at her aunts house the conspiracy in brief was arranged in all its details nothing was now wanting but the consent of the young lady obtaining which launce would go to the parish church and give the necessary notice of a marriage by banns on the next day there was the plot what did the ladies think of it  lady winwood thought it perfect  natalie was not so easily satisfied  my father has always been so kind to me she said the one thing i cant get over launce is distressing papa if he had been hard on meas some fathers arei shouldnt mind she suddenly brightened as if she saw her position in a new light why should you hurry me she asked i am going to dine at my aunts today and you are coming in the evening give me time wait till tonight  launce instantly entered his protest against wasting a moment longer lady winwood opened her lips to support him they were both silenced at the same moment by the appearance of one of mrs sancrofts servants opening the gate of the square  lady winwood went forward to meet the man a suspicion crossed her mind that he might be bringing bad news  what do you want she asked  i beg your pardon my ladythe housekeeper said you were walking here with miss graybrooke a telegram for miss graybrooke  lady winwood took the telegram from the mans hand dismissed him and went back with it to natalie natalie opened it nervously she read the messageand instantly changed her cheeks flushed deep her eyes flashed with indignation even papa can be hard on me it seems when richard asks him she exclaimed she handed the telegram to launce her eyes suddenly filled with tears you love me she said gentlyand stopped marry me she added with a sudden burst of resolution ill risk it  as she spoke those words lady winwood read the telegram it ran thus  sir joseph graybrooke muswell hill to miss natalie graybrooke berkeley square come back immediately you are engaged to dine here with richard turlington  lady winwood folded up the telegram with a malicious smile well done sir joseph thought her ladyship we might never have persuaded nataliebut for you     sixth scene  the church  the time is morning the date is early in the month of november the place is a church in a poor and populous parish in the undiscovered regions of london eastward of the tower and hard by the riverside  a marriage procession of five approaches the altar the bridegroom is pale and the bride is frightened the brides friend a resolutelooking little lady encourages her in whispers the two respectable persons apparently man and wife who complete the procession seem to be not quite clear as to the position which they occupy at the ceremony the beadle as he marshals them before the altar sees something under the surface in this weddingparty marriages in the lower ranks of life are the only marriages celebrated here is this a runaway match the beadle anticipates something out of the common in the shape of a fee  the clergyman the junior curate appears from the vestry in his robes the clerk takes his place the clergymans eye rests with a sudden interest and curiosity on the bride and bridegroom and on the brides friend notices the absence of elderly relatives remarks in the two ladies especially evidences of refinement and breeding entirely unparalleled in his professional experience of brides and brides friends standing before the altar of that church questions silently and quickly the eye of the clerk occupied also in observing the strangers with interest jenkinson the clergymans look asks is this all right sir the clerks look answers a marriage by banns all the formalities have been observed the clergyman opens his book the formalities have been observed his duty lies plainly before him attention launcelot courage natalie the service begins  launce casts a last furtive look round the church will sir joseph graybrooke start up and stop it from one of the empty pews is richard turlington lurking in the organloft and only waiting till the words of the service appeal to him to prohibit the marriage or else hereafter forever to hold his peace no the clergyman proceeds steadily and nothing happens natalies charming face grows paler and paler natalies heart throbs faster and faster as the time comes nearer for reading the words which unite them for life lady winwood herself feels an unaccustomed fluttering in the region of the bosom her ladyships thoughts revert not altogether pleasantly to her own marriage ah me what was i thinking of when i was in this position of the brides beautiful dress and of lady winwoods coming presentation at court  the service advances to the words in which they plight their troth launce has put the ring on her finger launce has repeated the words after the clergyman launce has married her done come what may of it done  the service ends bridegroom bride and witnesses go into the vestry to sign the book the signing like the service is serious no trifling with the truth is possible here when it comes to lady winwoods turn lady winwood must write her name she does it but without her usual grace and decision she drops her handkerchief the clerk picks it up for her and notices that a coronet is embroidered in one corner  the fees are paid they leave the vestry other couples when it is over are talkative and happy these two are more silent and more embarrassed than ever stranger still while other couples go off with relatives and friends all socially united in honor of the occasion these two and their friends part at the church door the respectable man and his wife go their way on foot the little lady with the coronet on her handkerchief puts the bride into a cab gets in herself and directs the driver to close the door while the bridegroom is standing on the church steps the bridegrooms face is clouded as well it may be he puts his head in at the window of the cab he possesses himself of the brides hand he speaks in a whisper he is apparently not to be shaken off the little lady exerts her authority separates the clasped hands pushes the bridegroom away and cries peremptorily to the driver to go on the cab starts the deserted husband drifts desolately anyhow down the street the clerk who has seen it all goes back to the vestry and reports what has happened  the rector with his wife on his arm has just dropped into the vestry on business in passing he and the curate are talking about the strange marriage the rector gravely bent on ascertaining that no blame rests with the church interrogates and is satisfied the rectors wife is not so easy to deal with she has looked at the signatures in the book one of the names is familiar to her she crossexamines the clerk as soon as her husband is done with him when she hears of the coronet on the handkerchief she points to the signature of louisa winwood and says to the rector i know who it is lord winwoods second wife i went to school with his lordships daughters by his first marriage we occasionally meet at the sacred concerts on the ladies committee i shall find an opportunity of speaking to them one moment mr jenkinson i will write down the names before you put away the book launcelot linzie natalie graybrooke very pretty names quite romantic i do delight in a romance goodmorning  she gives the curate a parting smile and the clerk a parting nod and sails out of the vestry natalie silently returning in lady winwoods company to muswell hill and launce cursing the law of abduction as he roams the streetslittle think that the ground is already mined under their feet richard turlington may hear of it now or may hear of it later the discovery of the marriage depends entirely on a chance meeting between the lords daughters and the rectors wife     seventh scene  the evening party    mr turlington  lady winwood at home  wednesday december 15thten oclock   dearest natalieas the brute insists the brute must have the invitation which i inclose never mind my child you and launce are coming to dinner and i will see that you have your little private opportunities of retirement afterward all i expect of you in return is not to look when you come back as if your husband had been kissing you you will certainly let out the secret of those stolen kisses if you dont take care at mammas dinner yesterday your color when you came out of the conservatory was a sight to see even your shoulders were red they are charming shoulders i know and men take the strangest fancies sometimes but my dear suppose you wear a chemisette next time if you havent authority enough over him to prevent his doing it again  your affectionate louisa  the private history of the days that had passed since the marriage was written in that letter an additional chapterof some importance in its bearing on the futurewas contributed by the progress of events at lady winwoods party  by previous arrangement with natalie the graybrookes invited to dinner arrived early leaving her husband and her stepdaughters to entertain sir joseph and miss lavinia lady winwood took natalie into her own boudoir which communicated by a curtained opening with the drawingroom  my dear you are looking positively haggard this evening has anything happened  i am nearly worn out louisa the life i am leading is so unendurable that if launce pressed me i believe i should consent to run away with him when we leave your house tonight  you will do nothing of the sort if you please wait till you are sixteen i delight in novelty but the novelty of appearing at the old bailey is beyond my ambition is the brute coming tonight  of course he insists on following me wherever i go he lunched at muswell hill today more complaints of my incomprehensible coldness to him another scolding from papa a furious letter from launce if i let richard kiss my hand again in his presence launce warns me he will knock him down oh the meanness and the guiltiness of the life i am leading now i am in the falsest of all false positions louisa and you encouraged me to do it i believe richard turlington suspects us the last two times launce and i tried to get a minute together at my aunts he contrived to put himself in our way there he was my dear with his scowling face looking as if he longed to kill launce can you do anything for us tonight not on my account but launce is so impatient if he cant say two words to me alone this evening he declares he will come to muswell hill and catch me in the garden tomorrow  compose yourself my dear he shall say his two words tonight  how  lady winwood pointed through the curtained entrance of the boudoir to the door of the drawingroom beyond the door was the staircase landing and beyond the landing was a second drawingroom the smaller of the two  there are only three or four people coming to dinner her ladyship proceeded and a few more in the evening being a small party the small drawingroom will do for us this drawingroom will not be lighted and there will be only my readinglamp here in the boudoir i shall give the signal for leaving the diningroom earlier than usual launce will join us before the evening party begins the moment he appears send him in hereboldly before your aunt and all of us  for what  for your fan leave it there under the sofacushion before we go down to dinner you will sit next to launce and you will give him private instructions not to find the fan you will get impatientyou will go to find it yourselfand there you are take care of your shoulders mrs linzie i have nothing more to say  the guests asked to dinner began to arrive lady winwood was recalled to her duties as mistress of the house  it was a pleasant little dinnerwith one drawback it began too late the ladies only reached the small drawingroom at ten minutes to ten launce was only able to join them as the clock struck  too late whispered natalie he will be here directly  nobody comes punctually to an evening party said launce dont let us lose a moment send me for your fan  natalie opened her lips to say the necessary words before she could speak the servant announcedmr turlington  he came in with his stifflyupright shirt collar and his looselyfitting glossy black clothes he made his sullen and clumsy bow to lady winwood and then he did what he had done dozens of times alreadyhe caught natalie with her eyes still bright and her face still animated after talking to launcea striking contrast to the cold and unimpulsive young lady whom he was accustomed to see while natalie was talking to him  lord winwoods daughters were persons of some celebrity in the world of amateur music noticing the look that turlington cast at launce lady winwood whispered to miss laviniawho instantly asked the young ladies to sing launce in obedience to a sign from natalie volunteered to find the musicbooks it is needless to add that he pitched on the wrong volume at starting as he lifted it from the piano to take it back to the stand there dropped out from between the leaves a printed letter looking like a circular one of the young ladies took it up and ran her eye over it with a start  the sacred concerts she exclaimed  her two sisters standing by looked at each other guiltily what will the committee say to us we entirely forgot the meeting last month  is there a meeting this month  they all looked anxiously at the printed letter  yes the twentythird of december put it down in your book amelia amelia then and there put it down among the engagements for the latter end of the month and natalies unacknowledged husband placidly looked on  so did the merciless irony of circumstances make launce the innocent means of exposing his own secret to discovery thanks to his success in laying his hand on the wrong musicbook there would now be a meetingtwo good days before the elopement could take placebetween the lords daughters and the rectors wife  the guests of the evening began to appear by twos and threes the gentlemen below stairs left the dinnertable and joined them  the small drawingroom was pleasantly filled and no more sir joseph graybrooke taking turlingtons hand led him eagerly to their host the talk in the diningroom had turned on finance lord winwood was not quite satisfied with some of his foreign investments and sir josephs dear richard was the very man to give him a little sound advice the three laid their heads together in a corner launce watching them slyly pressed natalies hand a renowned virtuoso had arrived and was thundering on the piano the attention of the guests generally was absorbed in the performance a fairer chance of sending launce for the fan could not possibly have offered itself while the financial discussion was still proceeding the married lovers were ensconced together alone in the boudoir  lady winwood privately observant of their absence kept her eye on the corner watching richard turlington  he was talking earnestlywith his back toward the company he neither moved nor looked round it came to lord winwoods turn to speak he preserved the same position listening sir joseph took up the conversation next then his attention wanderedhe knew beforehand what sir joseph would say his eyes turned anxiously toward the place in which he had left natalie lord winwood said a word his head turned back again toward the corner sir joseph put an objection he glanced once more over his shoulderthis time at the place in which launce had been standing the next moment his host recalled his attention and made it impossible for him to continue his scrutiny of the room at the same times two among the evening guests bound for another party approached to take leave of the lady of the house lady winwood was obliged to rise and attend to them they had something to say to her before they left and they said it at terrible length standing so as to intercept her view of the proceedings of the enemy when she had got rid of them at last she lookedand behold lord winwood and sir joseph were the only occupants of the corner  delaying one moment to set the virtuoso thundering once more lady winwood slipped out of the room and crossed the landing at the entrance to the empty drawingroom she heard turlingtons voice low and threatening in the boudoir jealousy has a second sight of its own he had looked in the right place at startingand oh heavens he had caught them  her ladyships courage was beyond dispute but she turned pale as she approached the entrance to the boudoir  there stood natalieat once angry and afraidbetween the man to whom she was ostensibly engaged and the man to whom she was actually married turlingtons rugged face expressed a martyrdom of suppressed fury launcein the act of offering natalie her fansmiled with the cool superiority of a man who knew that he had won his advantage and who triumphed in knowing it  i forbid you to take your fan from that mans hands said turlington speaking to natalie and pointing to launce  isnt it rather too soon to begin forbidding asked lady winwood goodhumoredly  exactly what i say exclaimed launce it seems necessary to remind mr turlington that he is not married to natalie yet  those last words were spoken in a tone which made both the women tremble inwardly for results lady winwood took the fan from launce with one hand and took natalies arm with the other  there is your fan my dear she said in her easy offhand manner why do you allow these two barbarous men to keep you here while the great bootmann is playing the nightmare sonata in the next room launce mr turlington follow me and learn to be musical directly you have only to shut your eyes and you will fancy you hear four modern german composers playing instead of one and not the ghost of a melody among all the four she led the way out with natalie and whispered did he catch you natalie whispered back i heard him in time he only caught us looking for the fan the two men waited behind to have two words together alone in the boudoir  this doesnt end here mr linzie  launce smiled satirically for once i agree with you he answered it doesnt end here as you say  lady winwood stopped and looked back at them from the drawingroom door they were keeping her waitingthey had no choice but to follow the mistress of the house  arrived in the next room both turlington and launce resumed their places among the guests with the same object in view as a necessary result of the scene in the boudoir each had his own special remonstrance to address to sir joseph even here launce was beforehand with turlington he was the first to get possession of sir josephs private ear his complaint took the form of a protest against turlingtons jealousy and an appeal for a reconsideration of the sentence which excluded him from muswell hill watching them from a distance turlingtons suspicious eye detected the appearance of something unduly confidential in the colloquy between the two under cover of the company he stole behind them and listened  the great bootmann had arrived at that part of the nightmare sonata in which musical sound produced principally with the left hand is made to describe beyond all possibility of mistake the rising of the moon in a country churchyard and a dance of vampires round a maidens grave sir joseph having no chance against the vampires in a whisper was obliged to raise his voice to make himself audible in answering and comforting launce i sincerely sympathize with you turlington heard him say and natalie feels about it as i do but richard is an obstacle in our way we must look to the consequences my dear boy supposing richard found us out he nodded kindly to his nephew and declining to pursue the subject moved away to another part of the room  turlingtons jealous distrust wrought to the highest pitch of irritability for weeks past instantly associated the words he had just heard with the words spoken by launce in the boudoir which had reminded him that he was not married to natalie yet was there treachery at work under the surface and was the object to persuade weak sir joseph to reconsider his daughters contemplated marriage in a sense favorable to launce turlingtons blind suspicion overleaped at a bound all the manifest improbabilities which forbade such a conclusion as this after an instants consideration with himself he decided on keeping his own counsel and on putting sir josephs good faith then and there to a test which he could rely on as certain to take natalies father by surprise  graybrooke  sir joseph started at the sight of his future soninlaws face  my dear richard you are looking very strangely is the heat of the room too much for you  never mind the heat i have seen enough tonight to justify me in insisting that your daughter and launcelot linzie shall meet no more between this and the day of my marriage sir joseph attempted to speak turlington declined to give him the opportunity yes yes your opinion of linzie isnt mine i know i saw you as thick as thieves together just now sir joseph once more attempted to make himself heard wearied by turlingtons perpetual complaints of his daughter and his nephew he was sufficiently irritated by this time to have reported what launce had actually said to him if he had been allowed the chance but turlington persisted in going on i cannot prevent linzie from being received in this house and at your sisters he said but i can keep him out of my house in the country and to the country let us go i propose a change in the arrangements have you any engagement for the christmas holidays  he paused and fixed his eyes attentively on sir joseph sir joseph looking a little surprised replied briefly that he had no engagement  in that case resumed turlington i invite you all to somersetshire and i propose that the marriage shall take place from my house and not from yours do you refuse  it is contrary to the usual course of proceeding in such cases richard sir joseph began  do you refuse reiterated turlington i tell you plainly i shall place a construction of my own upon your motive if you do  no richard said sir joseph quietly i accept  turlington drew back a step in silence sir joseph had turned the tables on him and had taken him by surprise  it will upset several plans and be strongly objected to by the ladies proceeded the old gentleman but if nothing less will satisfy you i say yes i shall have occasion when we meet tomorrow at muswell hill to appeal to your indulgence under circumstances which may greatly astonish you the least i can do in the meantime is to set an example of friendly sympathy and forbearance on my side no more now richard hush the music  it was impossible to make him explain himself further that night turlington was left to interpret sir josephs mysterious communication with such doubtful aid to success as his own unassisted ingenuity might afford  the meeting of the next day at muswell hill had for its objectas turlington had already been informedthe drawing of natalies marriagesettlement was the question of money at the bottom of sir josephs contemplated appeal to his indulgence he thought of his commercial position the depression in the levant trade still continued never had his business at any previous time required such constant attention and repaid that attention with so little profit the bills of lading had been already used by the firm in the ordinary course of trade to obtain possession of the goods the duplicates in the hands of bulpit brothers were literally waste paper repayment of the loan of forty thousand pounds with interest was due in less than a months time there was his commercial position was it possible that moneyloving sir joseph had any modification to propose in the matter of his daughters dowry the bare dread that it might be so struck him cold he quitted the houseand forgot to wish natalie goodnight  meanwhile launce had left the evening party before himand launce also found matter for serious reflection presented to his mind before he slept that night in other words he found on reaching his lodgings a letter from his brother marked private had the inquiry into the secrets of turlingtons early lifenow prolonged over some weeksled to positive results at last launce eagerly opened the letter it contained a report and a summary he passed at once to the summary and read these words  if you only want moral evidence to satisfy your own mind your end is gained there is morally no doubt that turlington and the seacaptain who cast the foreign sailor overboard to drown are on e and the same man legally the matter is beset by difficulties turlington having destroyed all provable connection between his present self and his past life there is only one chance for us a sailor on board the ship who was in his masters secrets is supposed to be still living under his masters protection all the black deeds of turlingtons early life are known to this man he can prove the facts if we can find him and make it worth his while to speak under what alias he is hidden we do not know his own name is thomas wildfang if we are to make the attempt to find him not a moment is to be lost the expenses may be serious let me know whether we are to go on or whether enough has been done to attain the end you have in view  enough had been donenot only to satisfy launce but to produce the right effect on sir josephs mind if sir joseph proved obdurate when the secret of the marriage was revealed launce wrote a line directing the stoppage of the proceedings at the point which they had now reached here is a reason for her not marrying turlington he said to himself as he placed the papers under lock and key and if she doesnt marry turlington he added with a lovers logic why shouldnt she marry me     eighth scene  the library  the next day sir joseph graybrooke sir josephs lawyer mr dicas highly respectable and immensely rich and richard turlington were assembled in the library at muswell hill to discuss the question of natalies marriage settlement  after the usual preliminary phrases had been exchanged sir joseph showed some hesitation in openly approaching the question which the little party of three had met to debate he avoided his lawyers eye and he looked at turlington rather uneasily  richard he began at last when i spoke to you about your marriage on board the yacht i said i would give my daughter either his courage or his breath failed him at that point he was obliged to wait a moment before he could go on  i said i would give my daughter half my fortune on her marriage he resumed forgive me richard i cant do it  mr dicas waiting for his instructions laid down his pen and looked at sir josephs soninlaw elect what would mr turlington say  he said nothing sitting opposite the window he rose when sir joseph spoke and placed himself at the other side of the table with his back to the light  my eyes are weak this morning he said in an unnaturally low tone of voice the light hurts them  he could find no more plausible excuse than that for concealing his face in shadow from the scrutiny of the two men on either side of him the continuous moral irritation of his unhappy courtshipa courtship which had never advanced beyond the frigid familiarity of kissing natalies hand in the presence of othershad physically deteriorated him even his hardy nerves began to feel the long strain of suspicion that had been laid unremittingly on them for weeks past his power of selfcontrolhe knew it himselfwas not to be relied on he could hide his face he could no longer command it  did you hear what i said richard  i heard go on  sir joseph proceeded gathering confidence as he advanced  half my fortune he repeated its parting with half my life its saying goodby forever to my dearest friend my money has been such a comfort to me richard such a pleasant occupation for my mind i know no reading so interesting and so instructive as the reading of ones bankers book to watch the outgoings on one side said sir joseph with a gentle and pathetic solemnity and the incomings on the otherthe sad lessening of the balance at one time and the cheering and delightful growth of it at anotherwhat absorbing reading the best novel that ever was written isnt to be mentioned in a breath with it i can not richard i really can not see my nice round balance shrink up to half the figure that i have been used to for a lifetime it may be weak of me proceeded sir joseph evidently feeling that it was not weak of him at all but we all have our tender place and my bankers book is mine besides it isnt as if you wanted it if you wanted it of coursebut you dont want it you are a rich man you are marrying my dear natalie for love not for money you and she and my grandchildren will have it all at my death it can make no difference to you to wait a few years till the old mans chair at the fireside is empty will you say the fourth part richard instead of the half twenty thousand pleaded sir joseph piteously i can bear twenty thousand off for gods sake dont ask me for more  the lips of the lawyer twisted themselves sourly into an ironical smile he was quite as fond of his money as sir joseph he ought to have felt for his client but rich men have no sympathy with one another mr dicas openly despised sir joseph  there was a pause the robinredbreasts in the shrubbery outside must have had prodigious balances at their bankers they hopped up on the windowsill so fearlessly they looked in with so little respect at the two rich men  dont keep me in suspense richard proceeded sir joseph speak out is it yes or no  turlington struck his hand excitedly on the table and burst out on a sudden with the answer which had been so strangely delayed  twenty thousand with all my heart he said on this condition graybrooke that every farthing of it is settled on natalie and on her children after her not a halfpenny to me he cried magnanimously in his brassiest tones not a halfpenny to me  let no man say the rich are heartless sir joseph seized his soninlaws hand in silence and burst into tears  mr dicas habitually a silent man uttered the first two words that had escaped him since the business began highly creditable he said and took a note of his instructions on the spot  from that point the business of the settlement flowed smoothly on to its destined end sir joseph explained his views at the fullest length and the lawyers pen kept pace with him turlington remaining in his place at the table restricted himself to a purely passive part in the proceedings he answered briefly when it was absolutely necessary to speak and he agreed with the two elders in everything a man has no attention to place at the disposal of other people when he stands at a crisis in his life turlington stood at that crisis at the trying moment when sir josephs unexpected proposal pressed instantly for a reply two merciless alternatives confronted him either he must repay the borrowed forty thousand pounds on the day when repayment was due or he must ask bulpit brothers to grant him an extension of time and so inevitably provoke an examination into the fraudulent security deposited with the firm which could end in but one way his last literally his last chance after sir joseph had diminished the promised dowry by one half was to adopt the highminded tone which became his position and to conceal the truth until he could reveal it to his fatherinlaw in the privileged character of natalies husband i owe forty thousand pounds sir in a fortnights time and i have not got a farthing of my own pay for me or you will see your soninlaws name in the bankrupts list for his daughters sakewho could doubt itsir joseph would produce the money the one thing needful was to be married in time if either by accident or treachery sir joseph was led into deferring the appointed day by so much as a fortnight only the fatal call would come and the firm of pizzituti turlington  branca would appear in the gazette  so he reasoned standing on the brink of the terrible discovery which was soon to reveal to him that natalie was the wife of another man  richard  mr turlington  he started and roused his attention to present things sir joseph on one side and the lawyer on the other were both appealing to him and both regarding him with looks of amazement  have you done with the settlement he asked  my dear richard we have done with it long since replied sir joseph have you really not heard what i have been saying for the last quarter of an hour to good mr dicas here what can you have been thinking of  turlington did not attempt to answer the question am i interested he asked in what you have been saying to mr dicas  you shall judge for yourself answered sir joseph mysteriously i have been giving mr dicas his instructions for making my will i wish the will and the marriagesettlement to be executed at the same time read the instructions mr dicas  sir josephs contemplated will proved to have two meritsit was simple and it was short excepting one or two trifling legacies to distant relatives he had no one to think of miss lavinia being already provided for but his daughter and the children who might be born of her marriage in its various provisions made with these two main objects in view the will followed the precedents established in such cases it differed in no important respect from the tens of thousands of other wills made under similar circumstances sir josephs motive in claiming special attention for it still remained unexplained when mr dicas reached the clause devoted to the appointment of executors and trustees and announced that this portion of the document was left in blank  sir joseph graybrooke are you prepared to name the persons whom you appoint asked the lawyer  sir joseph rose apparently for the purpose of giving special importance to the terms in which he answered his lawyers question  i appoint he said as sole executor and trusteerichard turlington  it was no easy matter to astonish mr dicas sir josephs reply absolutely confounded him he looked across the table at his client and delivered himself on this special occasion of as many as three words  are you mad he asked  sir josephs healthy complexion slightly reddened i never was in more complete possession of myself mr dicas than at this moment  mr dicas was not to be silenced in that way  are you aware of what you do persisted the lawyer if you appoint mr turlington as sole executor and trustee you put it in the power of your daughters husband sir to make away with every farthing of your money after your death  turlington had hitherto listened with an appearance of interest in the proceedings which he assumed as an act of politeness to his view the future was limited to the date at which bulpit brothers had a right to claim the repayment of their loan the will was a matter of no earthly importance to him by comparison with the infinitely superior interest of the marriage it was only when the lawyers brutally plain language forced his attention to it that the question of his pecuniary interest in his fatherinlaws death assumed its fit position in his mind  his color rose and he too showed that he was offended by what mr dicas had just said  not a word richard let me speak for you as well as for myself said sir joseph for seven years past he continued turning to the lawyer i have been accustomed to place the most unlimited trust in richard turlington his disinterested advice has enabled me largely to increase my income without placing a farthing of the principal in jeopardy on more than one occasion i have entreated him to make use of my money in his business he has invariably refused to do so even his bitterest enemies sir have been obliged to acknowledge that my interests were safe when committed to his care am i to begin distrusting him now that i am about to give him my daughter in marriage am i to leave it on record that i doubt him for the first timewhen my will is opened after my death no i can confide the management of the fortune which my child will inherit after me to no more competent or more honorable hands than the hands of the man who is to marry her i maintain my appointment mr dicas i persist in placing the whole responsibility under my will in my soninlaws care  turlington attempted to speak the lawyer attempted to speak sir josephwith a certain simple dignity which had its effect on both of themdeclined to hear a word on either side no richard as long as i am alive this is my business not yours no mr dicas i understand that it is your business to protest professionally you have protested fill in the blank space as i have told you or leave the instructions on the table and i will send for the nearest solicitor to complete them in your place  those words placed the lawyers position plainly before him he had no choice but to do as he was bid or to lose a good client he did as he was bid and grimly left the room  sir joseph with oldfashioned politeness followed him as far as the hall returning to the library to say a few friendly words before finally dismissing the subject of the will he found himself seized by the arm and dragged without ceremony in turlingtons powerful grasp to the window  richard he exclaimed what does this mean  look cried the other pointing through the window to a grassy walk in the grounds bounded on either side by shrubberies and situated at a little distance from the house who is that manquick before we lose sight of himthe man crossing there from one shrubbery to the other sir joseph failed to recognize the figure before it disappeared turlington whispered fiercely close to his earlauncelot linzie  in perfect good faith sir joseph declared that the man could not possibly have been launce turlingtons frenzy of jealous suspicion was not to be so easily calmed he asked significantly for natalie she was reported to be walking in the grounds i knew it he said with an oathand hurried out into the grounds to discover the truth for himself  some little time elapsed before he came back to the house he had discovered nataliealone not a sign of launce had rewarded his search for the hundredth time he had offended natalie for the hundredth time he was compelled to appeal to the indulgence of her father and her aunt it wont happen again he said sullenly penitent you will find me quite another man when i have got you all at my house in the country mind he burst out with a furtive look which expressed his inveterate distrust of natalie and of every one about her mind its settled that you all come to me in somersetshire on monday next sir joseph answered rather dryly that it was settled turlington turned to leave the roomand suddenly came back its understood he went on addressing miss lavinia that the seventh of next month is the date fixed for the marriage not a day later miss lavinia replied rather dryly on her side of course richard not a day later he muttered all right and hurriedly left them  half an hour afterward natalie came in looking a little confused  has he gone she asked whispering to her aunt  relieved on this point she made straight for the librarya room which she rarely entered at that or any other period of the day miss lavinia followed her curious to know what it meant natalie hurried to the window and waved her handkerchiefevidently making a signal to some one outside miss lavinia instantly joined her and took her sharply by the hand  is it possible natalie she asked has launcelot linzie really been here unknown to your father or to me  where is the harm if he has answered natalie with a sudden outbreak of temper am i never to see my cousin again because mr turlington happens to be jealous of him  she suddenly turned away her head the rich color flowed over her face and neck miss lavinia proceeding sternly with the administration of the necessary reproof was silenced midway by a new change in her nieces variable temper natalie burst into tears satisfied with this appearance of sincere contrition the old lady consented to overlook what had happened and for this occasion only to keep her nieces secret they would all be in somersetshire she remarked before any more breaches of discipline could be committed richard had fortunately made no discoveries and the matter might safely be trusted all things considered to rest where it was  miss lavinia might possibly have taken a less hopeful view of the circumstances if she had known that one of the menservants at muswell hill was in richard turlingtons pay and that this servant had seen launce leave the grounds by the backgarden gate     ninth scene  the drawingroom   amelia  say something  ask him to sit down  thus addressing one another in whispers the three stepdaughters of lady winwood stood bewildered in their own drawingroom helplessly confronting an object which appeared before them on the threshold of the door  the date was the 23d of december the time was between two and three in the afternoon the occasion was the return of the three sisters from the committee meeting of the sacred concerts society and the object was richard turlington  he stood hat in hand at the door amazed by his reception i have come up this morning from somersetshire he said havent you heard a matter of business at the office has forced me to leave my guests at my house in the country i return to them tomorrow when i say my guests i mean the graybrookes dont you know they are staying with me sir joseph and miss lavinia and natalie on the utterance of natalies name the sisters roused themselves they turned about and regarded each other with looks of dismay turlingtons patience began to fail him will you be so good as to tell me what all this means he said a little sharply miss lavinia asked me to call here when she heard i was coming to town i was to take charge of a pattern for a dress which she said you would give me you ought to have received a telegram explaining it all hours since has the message not reached you  the leading spirit of the three sisters was miss amelia she was the first who summoned presence of mind enough to give a plain answer to turlingtons plain question  we received the telegram this morning she said something has happened since which has shocked and surprised us we beg your pardon she turned to one of her sisters sophia the pattern is ready in the drawer of that table behind you give it to mr turlington  sophia produced the packet before she handed it to the visitor she looked at her sister ought we to let mr turlington go she asked as if nothing had happened  amelia considered silently with herself dorothea the third sister who had not spoken yet came forward with a suggestion she proposed before proceeding further to inquire whether lady winwood was in the house the idea was instantly adopted sophia rang the bell amelia put the questions when the servant appeared  lady winwood had left the house for a drive immediately after luncheon lord winwoodinquired for nexthad accompanied her ladyship no message had been left indicating the hour of their return  the sisters looked at turlington uncertain what to say or do next miss amelia addressed him as soon as the servant had left the room  is it possible for you to remain here until either my father or lady winwood return she asked  it is quite impossible minutes are of importance to me today  will you give us one of your minutes we want to consider something which we may have to say to you before you go  turlington wondering took a chair miss amelia put the case before her sisters from the sternly conscientious point of view at the opposite end of the room  we have not found out this abominable deception by any underhand means she said the discovery has been forced upon us and we stand pledged to nobody to keep the secret knowing as we do how cruelly this gentleman has been used it seems to me that we are bound in honor to open his eyes to the truth if we remain silent we make ourselves lady winwoods accomplices i for onei dont care what may come of itrefuse to do that  her sisters agreed with her the first chance their clever stepmother had given them of asserting their importance against hers was now in their hands their jealous hatred of lady winwood assumed the mask of dutyduty toward an outraged and deceived fellowcreature could any earthly motive be purer than that tell him amelia cried the two young ladies with the headlong recklessness of the sex which only stops to think when the time for reflection has gone by  a vague sense of something wrong began to stir uneasily in turlingtons mind  dont let me hurry you he said but if you really have anything to tell me  miss amelia summoned her courage and began  we have something very dreadful to tell you she said interrupting him you have been presented in this house mr turlington as a gentleman engaged to marry lady winwoods cousin miss natalie graybrooke she paused thereat the outset of the disclosure a sudden change of expression passed over turlingtons face which daunted her for the moment we have hitherto understood she went on that you were to be married to that young lady early in next month  well  he could say that one word looking at their pale faces and their eager eyes he could say no more  take care whispered dorothea in her sisters ear look at him amelia not too soon  amelia went on more carefully  we have just returned from a musical meeting she said one of the ladies there was an acquaintance a former schoolfellow of ours she is the wife of the rector of st columb majora large church far from thisat the east end of london  i know nothing about the woman or the church interposed turlington sternly  i must beg you to wait a little i cant tell you what i want to tell you unless i refer to the rectors wife she knows lady winwood by name and she heard of lady winwood recently under very strange circumstancescircumstances connected with a signature in one of the books of the church  turlington lost his selfcontrol you have got something against my natalie he burst out i know it by your whispering i see it in your looks say it at once in plain words  there was no trifling with him now in plain words amelia said it            there was silence in the room they could hear the sound of passing footsteps in the street he stood perfectly still on the spot where they had struck him dumb by the disclosure supporting himself with his right hand laid on the head of a sofa near him the sisters drew back horrorstruck into the furthest corner of the room his face turned them cold through the mute misery which it had expressed at first there appeared slowly forcing its way to view a look of deadly vengeance which froze them to the soul they whispered feverishly one to the other without knowing what they were talking of without hearing their own voices one of them said ring the bell another said offer him something he will faint the third shuddered and repeated over and over again why did we do it why did we do it  he silenced them on the instant by speaking on his side he came on slowly by a step at a time with the big drops of agony falling slowly over his rugged face he said in a hoarse whisper write me down the name of the churchthere he held out his open pocketbook to amelia while he spoke she steadied herself and wrote the address she tried to say a word to soften him the word died on her lips there was a light in his eyes as they looked at her which transfigured his face to something superhuman and devilish she turned away from him shuddering  he put the book back in his pocket and passed his handkerchief over his face after a moment of indecision he suddenly and swiftly stole out of the room as if he was afraid of their calling somebody in and stopping him at the door he turned round for a moment and said you will hear how this ends i wish you goodmorning  the door closed on him left by themselves they began to realize it they thought of the consequences when his back was turned and it was too late  the graybrookes now he knew it what would become of the graybrookes what would he do when he got back even at ordinary timeswhen he was on his best behaviorhe was a rough man what would happen oh good god what would happen when he and natalie next stood face to face it was a lonely housenatalie had told them about itno neighbors near nobody by to interfere but the weak old father and the maiden aunt something ought to be done some steps ought to be taken to warn them advicewho could give advice who was the first person who ought to be told of what had happened lady winwood no even at that crisis the sisters still shrank from their stepmotherstill hated her with the old hatred not a word to her they owed no duty to her who else could they appeal to to their father yes there was the person to advise them in the meanwhile silence toward their stepmothersilence toward every one till their father came back  they waited and waited one after another the precious hours pregnant with the issues of life and death followed each other on the dial lady winwood returned alone she had left her husband at the house of lords dinnertime came and brought with it a note from his lordship there was a debate at the house lady winwood and his daughters were not to wait dinner for him     tenth scene  green anchor lane  an hour later than the time at which he had been expected richard turlington appeared at his office in the city  he met beforehand all the inquiries which the marked change in him must otherwise have provoked by announcing that he was ill before he proceeded to business he asked if anybody was waiting to see him one of the servants from muswell hill was waiting with another parcel for miss lavinia ordered by telegram from the country that morning turlington after ascertaining the servants name received the man in his private room he there heard for the first time that launcelot linzie had been lurking in the grounds exactly as he had supposed on the day when the lawyer took his instructions for the settlement and the will  in two hours more turlingtons work was completed on leaving the officeas soon as he was out of sight of the doorhe turned eastward instead of taking the way that led to his own house in town pursuing his course he entered the labyrinth of streets which led in that quarter of east london to the unsavory neighborhood of the riverside  by this time his mind was made up the forecast shadow of meditated crime traveled before him already as he threaded his way among his fellowmen  he had been to the vestry of st columb major and had satisfied himself that he was misled by no false report there was the entry in the marriage register the one unexplained mystery was the mystery of launces conduct in permitting his wife to return to her fathers house utterly unable to account for this proceeding turlington could only accept facts as they were and determine to make the most of his time while the woman who had deceived him was still under his roof a hideous expression crossed his face as he realized the idea that he had got her unprotected by her husband in his house when launcelot linzie does come to claim her he said to himself he shall find i have been even with him he looked at his watch was it possible to save the last train and get back that night nothe last train had gone would she take advantage of his absence to escape he had little fear of it she would never have allowed her aunt to send him to lord winwoods house if she had felt the slightest suspicion of his discovering the truth in that quarter returning by the first train the next morning he might feel sure of getting back in time meanwhile he had the hours of the night before him he could give his mind to the serious question that must be settled before he left londonthe question of repaying the forty thousand pounds there was but one way of getting the money now sir joseph had executed his will sir josephs death would leave his sole executor and trustee the lawyer had said it master of his fortune turlington determined to be master of it in fourandtwenty hoursstriking the blow without risk to himself by means of another hand in the face of the probabilities in the face of the facts he had now firmly persuaded himself that sir joseph was privy to the fraud that had been practiced on him the marriagesettlement the will the presence of the family at his country houseall these he believed to be so many stratagems invented to keep him deceived until the last moment the truth was in those words which he had overheard between sir joseph and launceand in launces presence privately encouraged no doubt at muswell hill her father shall pay me for it doubly with his purse and with his life with that thought in his heart richard turlington wound his way through the streets by the riverside and stopped at a blind alley called green anchor lane infamous to this day as the chosen resort of the most abandoned wretches whom london can produce  the policeman at the corner cautioned him as he turned into the alley they wont hurt me he answered and walked on to a publichouse at the bottom of the lane  the landlord at the door silently recognized him and led the way in they crossed a room filled with sailors of all nations drinking ascended a staircase at the back of the house and stopped at the door of the room on the second floor there the landlord spoke for the first time he has outrun his allowance sir as usual you will find him with hardly a rag on his back i doubt if he will last much longer he had another fit of the horrors last night and the doctor thinks badly of him with that introduction he opened the door and turlington entered the room  on the miserable bed lay a grayheaded old man of gigantic stature with nothing on him but a ragged shirt and a pair of patched filthy trousers at the side of the bed with a bottle of gin on the rickety table between them sat two hideous leering painted monsters wearing the dress of women the smell of opium was in the room as well as the smell of spirits at turlingtons appearance the old man rose on the bed and welcomed him with greedy eyes and outstretched hand  money master he called out hoarsely a crown piece in advance for the sake of old times  turlington turned to the women without answering purse in hand  his clothes are at the pawnbrokers of course how much  thirty shillings  bring them here and be quick about it you will find it worth your while when you come back  the women took the pawnbrokers tickets from the pockets of the mans trousers and hurried out  turlington closed the door and seated himself by the bedside he laid his hand familiarly on the giants mighty shoulder looked him full in the face and said in a whisper  thomas wildfang  the man started and drew his huge hairy hand across his eyes as if in doubt whether he was waking or sleeping its better than ten years master since you called me by my name if i am thomas wildfang what are you  your captain once more  thomas wildfang sat up on the side of the bed and spoke his next words cautiously in turlingtons ear  another man in the way  yes  the giant shook his bald bestial head dolefully too late im past the job look here  he held up his hand and showed it trembling incessantly im an old man he said and let his hand drop heavily again on the bed beside him  turlington looked at the door and whispered back  the man is as old as you are and the money is worth having  how much  a hundred pounds  the eyes of thomas wildfang fastened greedily on turlingtons face lets hear he said softly captain lets hear            when the women came back with the clothes turlington had left the room their promised reward lay waiting for them on the table and thomas wildfang was eager to dress himself and be gone they could get but one answer from him to every question they put he had business in hand which was not to be delayed they would see him again in a day or two with money in his purse with that assurance he took his cudgel from the corner of the room and stalked out swiftly by the back door of the house into the night     eleventh scene  outside the house  the evening was chilly but not cold for the time of year there was no moon the stars were out and the wind was quiet upon the whole the inhabitants of the little somersetshire village of baxdale agreed that it was as fine a christmaseve as they could remember for some years past  toward eight in the evening the one small street of the village was empty except at that part of it which was occupied by the publichouse for the most part people gathered round their firesides with an eye to their suppers and watched the process of cooking comfortably indoors the old bare gray church situated at some little distance from the village looked a lonelier object than usual in the dim starlight the vicarage nestling close under the shadow of the churchtower threw no illumination of firelight or candlelight on the dreary scene the clergymans shutters fitted well and the clergymans curtains were closely drawn the one ray of light that cheered the wintry darkness streamed from the unguarded window of a lonely house separated from the vicarage by the whole length of the churchyard a man stood at the window holding back the shutter and looking out attentively over the dim void of the burialground the man was richard turlington the room in which he was watching was a room in his own house  a momentary spark of light flashed up as from a kindled match in the burialground turlington instantly left the empty room in which he had been watching passing down the back garden of the house and crossing a narrow lane at the bottom of it he opened a gate in a low stone wall beyond and entered the churchyard the shadowy figure of a man of great stature lurking among the graves advanced to meet him midway in the dark and lonely place the two stopped and consulted together in whispers turlington spoke first  have you taken up your quarters at the publichouse in the village  yes master  did you find your way while the daylight lasted to the deserted malthouse behind my orchard wall  yes master  now listenwe have no time to lose hide there behind that monument before nine oclock tonight you will see me cross the churchyard as far as this place with the man you are to wait for he is going to spend an hour with the vicar at the house yonder i shall stop short here and say to him you cant miss your way in the dark nowi will go back when i am far enough away from him i shall blow a call on my whistle the moment you hear the call follow the man and drop him before he gets out of the churchyard have you got your cudgel  thomas wildfang held up his cudgel turlington took him by the arm and felt it suspiciously  you have had an attack of the horrors already he said what does this trembling mean  he took a spiritflask from his pocket as he spoke thomas wildfang snatched it out of his hand and emptied it at a draught all right now master he said turlington felt his arm once more it was steadier already wildfang brandished his cudgel and struck a heavy blow with it on one of the turf mounds near them will that drop him captain he asked  turlington went on with his instructions  rob him when you have dropped him take his money and his jewelry i want to have the killing of him attributed to robbery as the motive make sure before you leave him that he is dead then go to the malthouse there is no fear of your being seen all the people will be indoors keeping christmaseve you will find a change of clothes hidden in the malthouse and an old caldron full of quicklime destroy the clothes you have got on and dress yourself in the other clothes that you find follow the crossroad and when it brings you into the highroad turn to the left a fourmile walk will take you to the town of harminster sleep there tonight and travel to london by the train in the morning the next day go to my office see the head clerk and say i have come to sign my receipt sign it in your own name and you will receive your hundred pounds there are your instructions do you understand them  wildfang nodded his head in silent token that he understood and disappeared again among the graves turlington went back to the house  he had advanced midway across the garden when he was startled by the sound of footsteps in the laneat that part of it which skirted one of the corners of the house hastening forward he placed himself behind a projection in the wall so as to see the person pass across the stream of light from the uncovered window of the room that he had left the stranger was walking rapidly all turlington could see as he crossed the field of light was that his hat was pulled over his eyes and that he had a thick beard and mustache describing the man to the servant on entering the house he was informed that a stranger with a large beard had been seen about the neighborhood for some days past the account he had given of himself stated that he was a surveyor engaged in taking measurements for a new map of that part of the country shortly to be published  the guilty mind of turlington was far from feeling satisfied with the meager description of the stranger thus rendered he could not be engaged in surveying in the dark what could he want in the desolate neighborhood of the house and churchyard at that time of night  the man wantedwhat the man found a little lower down the lane hidden in a dismantled part of the churchyard walla letter from a young lady read by the light of the pocketlantern which he carried with him the letter first congratulated this person on the complete success of his disguiseand then promised that the writer would be ready at her bedroom window for flight the next morning before the house was astir the signature was natalie and the person addressed was dearest launce  in the meanwhile turlington barred the window shutters of the room and looked at his watch it wanted only a quarter to nine oclock he took his dogwhistle from the chimneypiece and turned his steps at once in the direction of the drawingroom in which his guests were passing the evening     twelfth scene  inside the house  the scene in the drawingroom represented the ideal of domestic comfort the fire of wood and coal mixed burned brightly the lamps shed a soft glow of light the solid shutters and the thick red curtains kept the cold night air on the outer side of two long windows which opened on the back garden snug armchairs were placed in every part of the room in one of them sir joseph reclined fast asleep in another miss lavinia sat knitting a third chair apart from the rest near a round table in one corner of the room was occupied by natalie her head was resting on her hand an unread book lay open on her lap she looked pale and harassed anxiety and suspense had worn her down to the shadow of her former self on entering the room turlington purposely closed the door with a bang natalie started miss lavinia looked up reproachfully the object was achievedsir joseph was roused from his sleep  if you are going to the vicars tonight graybrooke said turlington its time you were off isnt it  sir joseph rubbed his eyes and looked at the clock on the mantelpiece yes yes richard he answered drowsily i suppose i must go where is my hat  his sister and his daughter both joined in trying to persuade him to send an excuse instead of groping his way to the vicarage in the dark sir joseph hesitated as usual he and the vicar had run up a sudden friendship on the strength of their common enthusiasm for the oldfashioned game of backgammon victorious over his opponent on the previous evening at turlingtons house sir joseph had promised to pass that evening at the vicarage and give the vicar his revenge observing his indecision turlington cunningly irritated him by affecting to believe that he was really unwilling to venture out in the dark ill see you safe across the churchyard he said and the vicars servant will see you safe back the tone in which he spoke instantly roused sir joseph i am not in my second childhood yet richard he replied testily i can find my way by myself he kissed his daughter on the forehead no fear natalie i shall be back in time for the mulled claret no richard i wont trouble you he kissed his hand to his sister and went out into the hall for his hat turlington following him with a rough apology and asking as a favor to be permitted to accompany him part of the way only the ladies left behind in the drawingroom heard the apology accepted by kindhearted sir joseph the two went out together  have you noticed richard since his return asked miss lavinia i fancy he must have heard bad news in london he looks as if he had something on his mind  i havent remarked it aunt  for the time no more was said miss lavinia went monotonously on with her knitting natalie pursued her own anxious thoughts over the unread pages of the book in her lap suddenly the deep silence out of doors and in was broken by a shrill whistle sounding from the direction of the churchyard natalie started with a faint cry of alarm miss lavinia looked up from her knitting  my dear child your nerves must be sadly out of order what is there to be frightened at  i am not very well aunt it is so still here at night the slightest noises startle me  there was another interval of silence it was past nine oclock when they heard the back door opened and closed again turlington came hurriedly into the drawingroom as if he had some reason for wishing to rejoin the ladies as soon as possible to the surprise of both of them he sat down abruptly in the corner with his face to the wall and took up the newspaper without casting a look at them or uttering a word  is joseph safe at the vicarage asked miss lavinia  all right he gave the answer in a short surly tone still without looking round  miss lavinia tried him again did you hear a whistle while you were out it quite startled natalie in the stillness of this place  he turned halfway round my shepherd i suppose he said after a pausewhistling for his dog he turned back again and immersed himself in his newspaper  miss lavinia beckoned to her niece and pointed significantly to turlington after one reluctant look at him natalie laid her head wearily on her aunts shoulder sleepy my dear whispered the old lady uneasy aunti dont know why natalie whispered back i would give the world to be in london and to hear the carriages going by and the people talking in the street  turlington suddenly dropped his newspaper whats the secret between you two he called out roughly what are you whispering about  we wish not to disturb you over your reading that is all said miss lavinia coldly has anything happened to vex you richard  what the devil makes you think that  the old lady was offended and showed it by saying nothing more natalie nestled closer to her aunt one after another the clock ticked off the minutes with painful distinctness in the stillness of the room turlington suddenly threw aside the newspaper and left his corner lets be good friends he burst out with a clumsy assumption of gayety this isnt keeping christmaseve lets talk and be sociable dearest natalie he threw his arm roughly round natalie and drew her by main force away from her aunt she turned deadly pale and struggled to release herself i am sufferingi am illlet me go he was deaf to her entreaties what your husband that is to be treated in this way mustnt i have a kissi will he held her closer with one hand and seizing her head with the other tried to turn her lips to him she resisted with the inbred nervous strength which the weakest woman living has in reserve when she is outraged half indignant half terrified at turlingtons roughness miss lavinia rose to interfere in a moment more he would have had two women to overpower instead of one when a noise outside the window suddenly suspended the ignoble struggle  there was a sound of footsteps on the gravelwalk which ran between the house wall and the garden lawn it was followed by a tapa single faint tap no moreon one of the panes of glass  they all three stood still for a moment more nothing was audible then there was a heavy shock as of something falling outside then a groan then another interval of silencea long silence interrupted no more  turlingtons arm dropped from natalie she drew back to her aunt looking at him instinctively in the natural expectation that he would take the lead in penetrating the mystery of what had happened outside the window the two women were thunderstruck to see that he was to all appearance even more startled and more helpless than they were richard said miss lavinia pointing to the window there is something wrong out there see what it is he stood motionless as if he had not heard her his eyes fixed on the window his face livid with terror  the silence outside was broken once more this time by a call for help  a cry of horror burst from natalie the voice outsiderising wildly then suddenly dying away againwas not entirely strange to her ears she tore aside the curtain with voice and hand she roused her aunt to help her the two lifted the heavy bar from its socket they opened the shutters and the window the cheerful light of the room flowed out over the body of a prostrate man lying on his face they turned the man over natalie lifted his head  her father  his face was bedabbled with blood a wound a frightful wound was visible on the side of his bare head high above the ear he looked at her his eyes recognized her before he fainted again in her arms his hands and his clothes were covered with earth stains he must have traversed some distance in that dreadful condition he must have faltered and fallen more than once before he reached the house his sister wiped the blood from his face his daughter called on him frantically to forgive her before he diedthe harmless gentle kindhearted father who had never said a hard word to her the father whom she had deceived  the terrified servants hurried into the room their appearance roused their master from the extraordinary stupor that had seized him he was at the window before the footman could get there the two lifted sir joseph into the room and laid him on the sofa natalie knelt by him supporting his head miss lavinia stanched the flowing blood with her handkerchief the womenservants brought linen and cold water the man hurried away for the doctor who lived on the other side of the village left alone again with turlington natalie noticed that his eyes were fixed in immovable scrutiny on her fathers head he never said a word he looked looked looked at the wound  the doctor arrived before either the daughter or the sister of the injured man could put the question turlington put itwill he live or die  the doctors careful finger probed the wound  make your minds easy a little lower down or in front the blow might have been serious as it is there is no harm done keep him quiet and he will be all right again in two or three days  hearing those welcome words natalie and her aunt sank on their knees in silent gratitude after dressing the wound the doctor looked round for the master of the house turlington who had been so breathlessly eager but a few minutes since seemed to have lost all interest in the case now he stood apart at the window looking out toward the churchyard thinking the questions which it was the doctors duty to ask were answered by the ladies the servants assisted in examining the injured mans clothes they discovered that his watch and purse were both missing when it became necessary to carry him upstairs it was the footman who assisted the doctor the foot mans master without a word of explanation walked out bare headed into the back garden on the search as the doctor and the servants supposed for some trace of the robber who had attempted sir josephs life  his absence was hardly noticed at the time the difficulty of conveying the wounded man to his room absorbed the attention of all the persons present  sir joseph partially recovered his senses while they were taking him up the steep and narrow stairs carefully as they carried the patient the motion wrung a groan from him before they reached the top the bedroom corridor in the rambling irregularly built house rose and fell on different levels at the door of the first bedchamber the doctor asked a little anxiously if that was the room no there were three more stairs to go down and a corner to turn before they could reach it the first room was natalies she instantly offered it for her fathers use the doctor seeing that it was the airiest as well as the nearest room accepted the proposal sir joseph had been laid comfortably in his daughters bed the doctor had just left them with renewed assurances that they need feel no anxiety when they heard a heavy step below stairs turlington had reentered the house  he had been looking as they had supposed for the ruffian who had attacked sir joseph with a motive however for the search at which it was impossible for other persons to guess his own safety was now bound up in the safety of thomas wildfang as soon as he was out of sight in the darkness he made straight for the malthouse the change of clothes was there untouched not a trace of his accomplice was to be seen where else to look for him it was impossible to tell turlington had no alternative but to go back to the house and ascertain if suspicion had been aroused in his absence  he had only to ascend the stairs and to see through the open door that sir joseph had been placed in his daughters room  what does this mean he asked roughly  before it was possible to answer him the footman appeared with a message the doctor had come back to the door to say that he would take on himself the necessary duty of informing the constable of what had happened on his return to the village turlington started and changed color if wildfang was found by others and questioned in his employers absence serious consequences might follow the constable is my business said turlington hurriedly descending the stairs ill go with the doctor they heard him open the door below then close it again as if some sudden thought had struck him and call to the footman the house was badly provided with servants bedrooms the womenservants only slept indoors the footman occupied a room over the stables natalie and her aunt heard turlington dismiss the man for the night an hour earlier than usual at least his next proceeding was stranger still looking cautiously over the stairs natalie saw him lock all the doors on the groundfloor and take out the keys when he went away she heard him lock the front door behind him incredible as it seemed there could be no doubt of the factthe inmates of the house were imprisoned till he came back what did it mean  it meant that turlingtons vengeance still remained to be wreaked on the woman who had deceived him it meant that sir josephs life still stood between the man who had compassed his death and the money which the man was resolved to have it meant that richard turlington was driven to bay and that the horror and the peril of the night were not at an end yet  natalie and her aunt looked at each other across the bed on which sir joseph lay he had fallen into a kind of doze no enlightenment could come to them from him they could only ask each other with beating hearts and baffled minds what richards conduct meantthey could only feel instinctively that some dreadful discovery was hanging over them the aunt was the calmer of the twothere was no secret weighing heavily on her conscience she could feel the consolations of religion our dear one is spared to us my love said the old lady gently god has been good to us we are in his hands if we know that we know enough  as she spoke there was a loud ring at the doorbell the womenservants crowded into the bedroom in alarm strong in numbers and encouraged by nataliewho roused herself and led the waythey confronted the risk of opening the window and of venturing out on the balcony which extended along that side of the house a man was dimly visible below he called to them in thick unsteady accents the servants recognized him he was the telegraphic messenger from the railway they went down to speak to himand returned with a telegram which had been pushed in under the door the distance from the station was considerable the messenger had been keeping christmas in more than one beershop on his way to the house and the delivery of the telegram had been delayed for some hours it was addressed to natalie she opened itlooked at itdropped itand stood speechless her lips parted in horror her eyes staring vacantly straight before her  miss lavinia took the telegram from the floor and read these lines  lady winwood hertford street london to natalie graybrooke church meadows baxdale somersetshire dreadful news r t has discovered your marriage to launce the truth has been kept from me till today 24th instant flight with your husband is your only chance i would have communicated with launce but i do not know his address you will receive this i hope and believe before r t can return to somersetshire telegraph back i entreat you to say that you are safe i shall follow my message if i do not hear from you in reasonable time  miss lavinia lifted her gray head and looked at her niece is this true she saidand pointed to the venerable face laid back white on the white pillow of the bed natalie sank forward as her eyes met the eyes of her aunt miss lavinia saved her from falling insensible on the floor            the confession had been made the words of penitence and the words of pardon had been spoken the peaceful face of the father still lay hushed in rest one by one the minutes succeeded each other uneventfully in the deep tranquillity of the night it was almost a relief when the silence was disturbed once more by another sound outside the house a pebble was thrown up at the window and a voice called out cautiously miss lavinia  they recognized the voice of the manservant and at once opened the window  he had something to say to the ladies in private how could he say it a domestic circumstance which had been marked by launce as favorable to the contemplated elopement was now noticed by the servant as lending itself readily to effecting the necessary communication with the ladies the lock of the gardeners toolhouse in the shrubbery close by was under repair and the gardeners ladder was accessible to any one who wanted it at the short height of the balcony from the ground the ladder was more than long enough for the purpose required in a few minutes the servant had mounted to the balcony and could speak to natalie and her aunt at the window  i cant rest quiet said the man im off on the sly to see whats going on down in the village its hard on ladies like you to be locked in here is there anything i can do for either of you  natalie took up lady winwoods telegram launce ought to see this she said to her aunt he will be here at daybreak she added in a whisper if i dont tell him what has happened  miss lavinia turned pale if he and richard meet she began tell him she added hurriedlytell him before it is too late  natalie wrote a few lines addressed to launce in his assumed name at his lodgings in the village inclosing lady winwoods telegram and entreating him to do nothing rash when the servant had disappeared with the letter there was one hope in her mind and in her aunts mind which each was ashamed to acknowledge to the otherthe hope that launce would face the very danger that they dreaded for him and come to the house  they had not been long alone again when sir joseph drowsily opened his eyes and asked what they were doing in his room they told him gently that he was ill he put his hand up to his head and said they were right and so dropped off again into slumber worn out by the emotions through which they had passed the two women silently waited for the march of events the same stupor of resignation possessed them both they had secured the door and the window they had prayed together they had kissed the quiet face on the pillow they had said to each other we will live with him or die with him as god pleases miss lavinia sat by the bedside natalie was on a stool at her feetwith her eyes closed and her head on her aunts knee  time went on the clock in the hall had struckten or eleven they were not sure whichwhen they heard the signal which warned them of the servants return from the village he brought news and more than news he brought a letter from launce  natalie read these lines  i shall be with you dearest almost as soon as you receive this the bearer will tell you what has happened in the villageyour note throws a new light on it all i only remain behind to go to the vicar who is also the magistrate here and declare myself your husband all disguise must be at an end now my place is with you and yours it is even worse than your worst fears turlington was at the bottom of the attack on your father judge if you have not need of your husbands protection after thatl  natalie handed the letter to her aunt and pointed to the sentence which asserted turlingtons guilty knowledge of the attempt on sir josephs life in silent horror the two women looked at each other recalling what had happened earlier in the evening and understanding it now the servant roused them to a sense of present things by entering on the narrative of his discoveries in the village  the place was all astir when he reached it an old mana stranger in baxdalehad been found lying in the road close to the church in a fit and the person who had discovered him had been no other than launce himself he had literally stumbled over the body of thomas wildfang in the dark on his way back to his lodgings in the village  the gentleman gave the alarm miss said the servant describing the event as it had been related to him and the mana huge big old manwas carried to the inn the landlord identified him he had taken lodgings at the inn that day and the constable found valuable property on hima purse of money and a gold watch and chain there was nothing to show who the money and the watch belonged to it was only when my master and the doctor got to the inn that it was known whom he had robbed and tried to murder all he let out in his wanderings before they came was that some person had set him on to do it he called the person captain and sometimes captain goward it was thoughtif you could trust the ravings of a madmanthat the fit took him while he was putting his hand on sir josephs heart to feel if it had stopped beating a sort of vision as i understand it must have overpowered him at the moment they tell me he raved about the sea bursting into the church yard and a drowning sailor floating by on a hencoop a sailor who dragged him down to hell by the hair of his head and such like horrible nonsense miss he was still screeching at the worst of the fit when my master and the doctor came into the room at sight of one or other of themit is thought of mr turlington seeing that he came firsthe held his peace on a sudden and then fell back in convulsions in the arms of the men who were holding him the doctor gave it a learned name signifying drinkmadness and said the case was hopeless however he ordered the room to be cleared of the crowd to see what he could do my master was reported to be still with the doctor waiting to see whether the man lived or died when i left the village miss with the gentlemans answer to your note i didnt dare stay to hear how it ended for fear of mr turlingtons finding me out  having reached the end of his narrative the man looked round restlessly toward the window it was impossible to say when his master might not return and it might be as much as his life was worth to be caught in the house after he had been locked out of it he begged permission to open the window and make his escape back to the stables while there was still time as he unbarred the shutter they were startled by a voice hailing them from below it was launces voice calling to natalie the servant disappeared and natalie was in launces arms before she could breathe again  for one delicious moment she let her head lie on his breast then she suddenly pushed him away from her why do you come here he will kill you if he finds you in the house where is he  launce knew even less of turlingtons movements than the servant wherever he is thank god i am here before him that was all the answer he could give  natalie and her aunt heard him in silent dismay sir joseph woke and recognized launce before a word more could be said ah my dear boy he murmured faintly its pleasant to see you again how do you come here he was quite satisfied with the first excuse that suggested itself well talk about it tomorrow he said and composed himself to rest again  natalie made a second attempt to persuade launce to leave the house  we dont know what may have happened she said he may have followed you on your way here he may have purposely let you enter his house leave us while you have the chance  miss lavinia added her persuasions they were useless launce quietly closed the heavy windowshutters lined with iron and put up the bar natalie wrung her hands in despair  have you been to the magistrate she asked tell us at least are you here by his advice is he coming to help us  launce hesitated if he had told the truth he must have acknowledged that he was there in direct opposition to the magistrates advice he answered evasively if the vicar doesnt come the doctor will i have told him sir joseph must be moved cheer up natalie the doctor will be here as soon as turlington  as the name passed his lipswithout a sound outside to prepare them for what was comingthe voice of turlington himself suddenly penetrated into the room speaking close behind the window on the outer side  you have broken into my house in the night said the voice and you dont escape this way  miss lavinia sank on her knees natalie flew to her father his eyes were wide open in terror he moaned feebly recognizing the voice the next sound that was heard was the sound made by the removal of the ladder from the balcony turlington having descended by it had taken it away natalie had but too accurately guessed what would happen the death of the villains accomplice had freed him from all apprehension in that quarter he had deliberately dogged launces steps and had deliberately allowed him to put himself in the wrong by effecting a secret entrance into the house  there was an intervala horrible intervaland then they heard the front door opened without stopping judging by the absence of sound to close it again turlington rapidly ascended the stairs and tried the locked door  come out and give yourself up he called through the door i have got my revolver with me and i have a right to fire on a man who has broken into my house if the door isnt opened before i count three your blood be on your own head one  launce was armed with nothing but his stick he advanced without an instants hesitation to give himself up natalie threw her arms round him and clasped him fast before he could reach the door  two cried the voice outside as launce struggled to force her from him at the same moment his eye turned toward the bed it was exactly opposite the doorit was straight in the line of fire sir joseph s life as turlington had deliberately calculated was actually in greater danger than launces life he tore himself free rushed to the bed and took the old man in his arms to lift him out  three  the crash of the report sounded the bullet came through the door grazed launces left arm and buried itself in the pillow at the very place on which sir josephs head had rested the moment before launce had saved his fatherinlaws life turlington had fired his first shot for the money and had not got it yet  they were safe in the corner of the room on the same side as the doorsir joseph helpless as a child in launces arms the women pale but admirably calm they were safe for the moment when the second bullet fired at an angle tore its way through the wall on their right hand  i hear you cried the voice of the miscreant on the other side of the door ill have you yetthrough the wall  there was a pause they heard his hand sounding the wall to find out where there was solid wood in the material of which it was built and where there was plaster only at that dreadful moment launces composure never left him he laid sir joseph softly on the floor and signed to natalie and her aunt to lie down by him in silence their lives depended now on neither their voices nor their movements telling the murderer where to fire he chose his place the barrel of the revolver grated as he laid it against the wall he touched the hair trigger a faint click was the only sound that followed the third barrel had missed fire  they heard him ask himself with an oath whats wrong with it now  there was a pause of silence  was he examining the weapon  before they could ask themselves the question the report of the exploding charge burst on their ears it was instantly followed by a heavy fall they looked at the opposite wall of the room no sign of a bullet there or anywhere  launce signed to them not to move yet they waited and listened nothing stirred on the landing outside  suddenly there was a disturbance of the silence in the lower regionsa clamor of many voices at the open house door had the firing of the revolver been heard at the vicarage yes they recognized the vicars voice among the others a moment more and they heard a general exclamation of horror on the stairs launce opened the door of the room he instantly closed it again before natalie could follow him  the dead body of turlington lay on the landing outside the charge in the fourth barrel of the revolver had exploded while he was looking at it the bullet had entered his mouth and killed him on the spot     documentary hints in conclusion  first hint  derived from lady winwoods cardrack  sir joseph graybrooke and miss graybrooke request the honor of lord and lady winwoods company to dinner on wednesday february 10 at halfpast seven oclock to meet mr and mrs launcelot linzie on their return   second hint  derived from a recent money article in morning newspaper  we are requested to give the fullest contradiction to unfavorable rumors lately in circulation respecting the firm of pizzituti turlington and branca some temporary derangement in the machinery of the business was undoubtedly produced in consequence of the sudden death of the lamented managing partner mr turlington by the accidental discharge of a revolver which he was examining whatever temporary obstacles may have existed are now overcome we are informed on good authority that the wellknown house of messrs bulpit brothers has an interest in the business and will carry it on until further notice
