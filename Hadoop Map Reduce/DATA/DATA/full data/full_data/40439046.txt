40439046	black heart and white heart  by h rider haggard     dedication  to the memory of the child  nada burnham  who bound all to her and while her father cut his way through the hordes of the ingobo regiment perished of the hardships of war at buluwayo on 19th may 1896 i dedicate these talesand more particularly the last that of a faith which triumphed over savagery and death  h rider haggard  ditchingham     authors note  of the three stories that comprise this volume one the wizard a tale of victorious faith first appeared some years ago as a christmas annual another elissa is an attempt difficult enough owing to the scantiness of the material left to us by time to recreate the life of the ancient phoenician zimbabwe whose ruins still stand in rhodesia and with the addition of the necessary love story to suggest circumstances such as might have brought about or accompanied its fall at the hands of the surrounding savage tribes the third black heart and white heart is a story of the courtship trials and final union of a pair of zulu lovers in the time of king cetywayo        this text was prepared from a volume published in 1900      titled black heart and white heart and other stories      jb      black heart and white heart  a zulu idyll    chapter i  philip hadden and king cetywayo  at the date of our introduction to him philip hadden was a transportrider and trader in the zulu still on the right side of forty in appearance he was singularly handsome tall dark upright with keen eyes shortpointed beard curling hair and clearcut features his life had been varied and there were passages in it which he did not narrate even to his most intimate friends he was of gentle birth however and it was said that he had received a public school and university education in england at any rate he could quote the classics with aptitude on occasion an accomplishment which coupled with his refined voice and a bearing not altogether common in the wild places of the world had earned for him among his rough companions the soubriquet of the prince  however these things may have been it is certain that he had emigrated to natal under a cloud and equally certain that his relatives at home were content to take no further interest in his fortunes during the fifteen or sixteen years which he had spent in or about the colony hadden followed many trades and did no good at any of them a clever man of agreeable and prepossessing manner he always found it easy to form friendships and to secure a fresh start in life but by degrees the friends were seized with a vague distrust of him and after a period of more or less application he himself would close the opening that he had made by a sudden disappearance from the locality leaving behind him a doubtful reputation and some bad debts  before the beginning of this story of the most remarkable episodes in his life philip hadden was engaged for several years in transportridingthat is in carrying goods on ox waggons from durban or maritzburg to various points in the interior a difficulty such as had more than once confronted him in the course of his career led to his temporary abandonment of this means of earning a livelihood on arriving at the little frontier town of utrecht in the transvaal in charge of two waggon loads of mixed goods consigned to a storekeeper there it was discovered that out of six cases of brandy five were missing from his waggon hadden explained the matter by throwing the blame upon his kaffir boys but the storekeeper a roughtongued man openly called him a thief and refused to pay the freight on any of the load from words the two men came to blows knives were drawn and before anybody could interfere the storekeeper received a nasty wound in his side that night without waiting till the matter could be inquired into by the landdrost or magistrate hadden slipped away and trekked back into natal as quickly as his oxen would travel feeling that even here he was not safe he left one of his waggons at newcastle loaded up the other with kaffir goodssuch as blankets calico and hardwareand crossed into zululand where in those days no sheriffs officer would be likely to follow him  being well acquainted with the language and customs of the natives he did good trade with them and soon found himself possessed of some cash and a small herd of cattle which he received in exchange for his wares meanwhile news reached him that the man whom he had injured still vowed vengeance against him and was in communication with the authorities in natal these reasons making his return to civilisation undesirable for the moment and further business being impossible until he could receive a fresh supply of trade stuff hadden like a wise man turned his thoughts to pleasure sending his cattle and waggon over the border to be left in charge of a native headman with whom he was friendly he went on foot to ulundi to obtain permission from the king cetywayo to hunt game in his country somewhat to his surprise the indunas or headmen received him courteouslyfor haddens visit took place within a few months of the outbreak of the zulu war in 1878 when cetywayo was already showing unfriendliness to the english traders and others though why the king did so they knew not  on the occasion of his first and last interview with cetywayo hadden got a hint of the reason it happened thus on the second morning after his arrival at the royal kraal a messenger came to inform him that the elephant whose tread shook the earth had signified that it was his pleasure to see him accordingly he was led through the thousands of huts and across the great place to the little enclosure where cetywayo a royallooking zulu seated on a stool and wearing a kaross of leopard skins was holding an indaba or conference surrounded by his counsellors the induna who had conducted him to the august presence went down upon his hands and knees and uttering the royal salute of bayéte crawled forward to announce that the white man was waiting  let him wait said the king angrily and turning he continued the discussion with his counsellors  now as has been said hadden thoroughly understood zulu and when from time to time the king raised his voice some of the words he spoke reached his ear  what cetywayo said to a wizened and aged man who seemed to be pleading with him earnestly am i a dog that these white hyenas should hunt me thus is not the land mine and was it not my fathers before me are not the people mine to save or to slay i tell you that i will stamp out these little white men my impis shall eat them up i have said  again the withered aged man interposed evidently in the character of a peacemaker hadden could not hear his talk but he rose and pointed towards the sea while from his expressive gestures and sorrowful mien he seemed to be prophesying disaster should a certain course of action be followed  for a while the king listened to him then he sprang from his seat his eyes literally ablaze with rage  hearken he cried to the counsellor i have guessed it for long and now i am sure of it you are a traitor you are sompseus dog and the dog of the natal government and i will not keep another mans dog to bite me in my own house take him away        sir theophilus shepstones  a slight involuntary murmur rose from the ring of indunas but the old man never flinched not even when the soldiers who presently would murder him came and seized him roughly for a few seconds perhaps five he covered his face with the corner of the kaross he wore then he looked up and spoke to the king in a clear voice  o king he said i am a very old man as a youth i served under chaka the lion and i heard his dying prophecy of the coming of the white man then the white men came and i fought for dingaan at the battle of the blood river they slew dingaan and for many years i was the counsellor of panda your father i stood by you o king at the battle of the tugela when its grey waters were turned to red with the blood of umbulazi your brother and of the tens of thousands of his people afterwards i became your counsellor o king and i was with you when sompseu set the crown upon your head and you made promises to sompseupromises that you have not kept now you are weary of me and it is well for i am very old and doubtless my talk is foolish as it chances to the old yet i think that the prophecy of chaka your greatuncle will come true and that the white men will prevail against you and that through them you shall find your death i would that i might have stood in one more battle and fought for you o king since fight you will but the end which you choose is for me the best end sleep in peace o king and farewell bayéte        the royal salute of the zulus  for a space there was silence a silence of expectation while men waited to hear the tyrant reverse his judgment but it did not please him to be merciful or the needs of policy outweighed his pity  take him away he repeated then with a slow smile on his face and one word goodnight upon his lips supported by the arm of a soldier the old warrior and statesman shuffled forth to the place of death  hadden watched and listened in amazement not unmixed with fear if he treats his own servants like this what will happen to me he reflected we english must have fallen out of favour since i left natal i wonder whether he means to make war on us or what if so this isnt my place  just then the king who had been gazing moodily at the ground chanced to look up bring the stranger here he said  hadden heard him and coming forward offered cetywayo his hand in as cool and nonchalant a manner as he could command  somewhat to his surprise it was accepted at least white man said the king glancing at his visitors tall spare form and cleanly cut face you are no umfagozan low fellow you are of the blood of chiefs  yes king answered hadden with a little sigh i am of the blood of chiefs  what do you want in my country white man  very little king i have been trading here as i daresay you have heard and have sold all my goods now i ask your leave to hunt buffalo and other big game for a while before i return to natal  i cannot grant it answered cetywayo you are a spy sent by sompseu or by the queens induna in natal get you gone  indeed said hadden with a shrug of his shoulders then i hope that sompseu or the queens induna or both of them will pay me when i return to my own country meanwhile i will obey you because i must but i should first like to make you a present  what present asked the king i want no presents we are rich here white man  so be it king it was nothing worthy of your taking only a rifle  a rifle white man where is it  without i would have brought it but your servants told me that it is death to come armed before the elephant who shakes the earth  cetywayo frowned for the note of sarcasm did not escape his quick ear  let this white mans offering be brought i will consider the thing  instantly the induna who had accompanied hadden darted to the gateway running with his body bent so low that it seemed as though at every step he must fall upon his face presently he returned with the weapon in his hand and presented it to the king holding it so that the muzzle was pointed straight at the royal breast  i crave leave to say o elephant remarked hadden in a drawling voice that it might be well to command your servant to lift the mouth of that gun from your heart  why asked the king  only because it is loaded and at full cock o elephant who probably desires to continue to shake the earth  at these words the elephant uttered a sharp exclamation and rolled from his stool in a most unkingly manner whilst the terrified induna springing backwards contrived to touch the trigger of the rifle and discharge a bullet through the exact spot that a second before had been occupied by his monarchs head  let him be taken away shouted the incensed king from the ground but long before the words had passed his lips the induna with a cry that the gun was bewitched had cast it down and fled at full speed through the gate  he has already taken himself away suggested hadden while the audience tittered no king do not touch it rashly it is a repeating rifle look and lifting the winchester he fired the four remaining shots in quick succession into the air striking the top of a tree at which he aimed with every one of them  wow it is wonderful said the company in astonishment  has the thing finished asked the king  for the present it has answered hadden look at it  cetywayo took the repeater in his hand and examined it with caution swinging the muzzle horizontally in an exact line with the stomachs of some of his most eminent indunas who shrank to this side and that as the barrel was brought to bear on them  see what cowards they are white man said the king with indignation they fear lest there should be another bullet in this gun  yes answered hadden they are cowards indeed i believe that if they were seated on stools they would tumble off them just as it chanced to your majesty to do just now  do you understand the making of guns white man asked the king hastily while the indunas one and all turned their heads and contemplated the fence behind them  no king i cannot make guns but i can mend them  if i paid you well white man would you stop here at my kraal and mend guns for me asked cetywayo anxiously  it might depend on the pay answered hadden but for awhile i am tired of work and wish to rest if the king gives me the permission to hunt for which i asked and men to go with me then when i return perhaps we can bargain on the matter if not i will bid the king farewell and journey to natal  in order to make report of what he has seen and learned here muttered cetywayo  at this moment the talk was interrupted for the soldiers who had led away the old induna returned at speed and prostrated themselves before the king  is he dead he asked  he has travelled the kings bridge they answered grimly he died singing a song of praise of the king  good said cetywayo that stone shall hurt my feet no more go tell the tale of its casting away to sompseu and to the queens induna in natal he added with bitter emphasis  baba hear our father speak listen to the rumbling of the elephant said the indunas taking the point while one bolder than the rest added soon we will tell them another tale the white talking ones a red tale a tale of spears and the regiments shall sing it in their ears  at the words an enthusiasm caught hold of the listeners as the sudden flame catches hold of dry grass they sprang up for the most of them were seated on their haunches and stamping their feet upon the ground in unison repeated       indaba ibomwuindaba ye mikonto      lizo dunyiswa nge impi ndhlebeni yaho      a red tale a red tale a tale of spears      and the impis shall sing it in their ears  one of them indeed a great fiercefaced fellow drew near to hadden and shaking his fist before his eyesfortunately being in the royal presence he had no assegaishouted the sentences at him  the king saw that the fire he had lit was burning too fiercely  silence he thundered in the deep voice for which he was remarkable and instantly each man became as if he were turned to stone only the echoes still answered back and the impis shall sing it in their earsin their ears  i am growing certain that this is no place for me thought hadden if that scoundrel had been armed he might have temporarily forgotten himself hullo whos this  just then there appeared through the gate of the fence a splendid specimen of the zulu race the man who was about thirtyfive years of age was arrayed in a full war dress of a captain of the umcityu regiment from the circlet of otter skin on his brow rose his crest of plumes round his middle arms and knees hung the long fringes of black oxtails and in one hand he bore a little dancing shield also black in colour the other was empty since he might not appear before the king bearing arms in countenance the man was handsome and though just now they betrayed some anxiety his eyes were genial and honest and his mouth sensitive in height he must have measured six foot two inches yet he did not strike the observer as being tall perhaps because of his width of chest and the solidity of his limbs that were in curious contrast to the delicate and almost womanish hands and feet which so often mark the zulu of noble blood in short the man was what he seemed to be a savage gentleman of birth dignity and courage  in company with him was another man plainly dressed in a moocha and a blanket whose grizzled hair showed him to be over fifty years of age his face also was pleasant and even refined but the eyes were timorous and the mouth lacked character  who are these asked the king  the two men fell on their knees before him and bowed till their foreheads touched the groundthe while giving him his sibonga or titles of praise  speak he said impatiently  o king said the young warrior seating himself zulu fashion i am nahoon the son of zomba a captain of the umcityu and this is my uncle umgona the brother of one of my mothers my fathers youngest wife  cetywayo frowned what do you here away from your regiment nahoon  may it please the king i have leave of absence from the head captains and i come to ask a boon of the kings bounty  be swift then nahoon  it is this o king said the captain with some embarrassment a while ago the king was pleased to make a keshla of me because of certain service that i did out yonder and he touched the black ring which he wore in the hair of his head being now a ringed man and a captain i crave the right of a man at the hands of the kingthe right to marry  right speak more humbly son of zomba my soldiers and my cattle have no rights  nahoon bit his lip for he had made a serious mistake  pardon o king the matter stands thus my uncle umgona here has a fair daughter named nanea whom i desire to wife and who desires me to husband awaiting the kings leave i am betrothed to her and in earnest of it i have paid to umgona a lobola of fifteen head of cattle cows and calves together but umgona has a powerful neighbour an old chief named maputa the warden of the crocodile drift who doubtless is known to the king and this chief also seeks nanea in marriage and harries umgona threatening him with many evils if he will not give the girl to him but umgonas heart is white towards me and towards maputa it is black therefore together we come to crave this boon of the king  it is so he speaks the truth said umgona  cease answered cetywayo angrily is this a time that my soldiers should seek wives in marriage wives to turn their hearts to water know that but yesterday for this crime i commanded that twenty girls who had dared without my leave to marry men of the undi regiment should be strangled and their bodies laid upon the crossroads and with them the bodies of their fathers that all might know their sin and be warned thereby ay umgona it is well for you and for your daughter that you sought my word before she was given in marriage to this man now this is my award i refuse your prayer nahoon and since you umgona are troubled with one whom you would not take as soninlaw the old chief maputa i will free you from his importunity the girl says nahoon is fairgood i myself will be gracious to her and she shall be numbered among the wives of the royal house within thirty days from now in the week of the next new moon let her be delivered to the sigodhla the royal house of the women and with her those cattle the cows and the calves together that nahoon has given you of which i fine him because he has dared to think of marriage without the leave of the king    chapter ii  the bee prophesies  a daniel come to judgment indeed reflected hadden who had been watching this savage comedy with interest our lovesick friend has got more than he bargained for well that comes of appealing to cæsar and he turned to look at the two suppliants  the old man umgona merely started then began to pour out sentences of conventional thanks and praise to the king for his goodness and condescension cetywayo listened to his talk in silence and when he had done answered by reminding him tersely that if nanea did not appear at the date named both she and he her father would in due course certainly decorate a crossroad in their own immediate neighbourhood  the captain nahoon afforded a more curious study as the fatal words crossed the kings lips his face took an expression of absolute astonishment which was presently replaced by one of furythe just fury of a man who suddenly has suffered an unutterable wrong his whole frame quivered the veins stood out in knots on his neck and forehead and his fingers closed convulsively as though they were grasping the handle of a spear presently the rage passed awayfor as well might a man be wroth with fate as with a zulu despotto be succeeded by a look of the most hopeless misery the proud dark eyes grew dull the coppercoloured face sank in and turned ashen the mouth drooped and down one corner of it there trickled a little line of blood springing from the lip bitten through in the effort to keep silence lifting his hand in salute to the king the great man rose and staggered rather than walked towards the gate  as he reached it the voice of cetywayo commanded him to stop stay he said i have a service for you nahoon that shall drive out of your head these thoughts of wives and marriage you see this white man here he is my guest and would hunt buffalo and big game in the bush country i put him in your charge take men with you and see that he comes to no hurt so also that you bring him before me within a month or your life shall answer for it let him be here at my royal kraal in the first week of the new moonwhen nanea comesand then i will tell you whether or no i agree with you that she is fair go now my child and you white man go also those who are to accompany you shall be with you at the dawn farewell but remember we meet again at the new moon when we will settle what pay you shall receive as keeper of my guns do not fail me white man or i shall send after you and my messengers are sometimes rough  this means that i am a prisoner thought hadden but it will go hard if i cannot manage to give them the slip somehow i dont intend to stay in this country if war is declared to be pounded into mouti medicine or have my eyes put out or any little joke of that sort    ten days had passed and one evening hadden and his escort were encamped in a wild stretch of mountainous country lying between the blood and unvunyana rivers not more than eight miles from that place of the little hand which within a few weeks was to become famous throughout the world by its native name of isandhlwana for three days they had been tracking the spoor of a small herd of buffalo that still inhabited the district but as yet they had not come up with them the zulu hunters had suggested that they should follow the unvunyana down towards the sea where game was more plentiful but this neither hadden nor the captain nahoon had been anxious to do for reasons which each of them kept secret to himself haddens object was to work gradually down to the buffalo river across which he hoped to effect a retreat into natal that of nahoon was to linger in the neighbourhood of the kraal of umgona which was situated not very far from their present camping place in the vague hope that he might find an opportunity of speaking with or at least of seeing nanea the girl to whom he was affianced who within a few weeks must be taken from him and given over to the king  a more eerielooking spot than that where they were encamped hadden had never seen behind them lay a tract of landhalfswamp and halfbushin which the buffalo were supposed to be hiding beyond in lonely grandeur rose the mountain of isandhlwana while in front was an amphitheatre of the most gloomy forest ringed round in the distance by sheersided hills into this forest there ran a river which drained the swamp placidly enough upon the level but it was not always level for within three hundred yards of them it dashed suddenly over a precipice of no great height but very steep falling into a boiling rockbound pool that the light of the sun never seemed to reach  what is the name of that forest nahoon asked hadden  it is named emagudu the home of the dead the zulu replied absently for he was looking towards the kraal of nanea which was situated at an hours walk away over the ridge to the right  the home of the dead why  because the dead live there those whom we name the esemkofu the speechless ones and with them other spirits the amahlosi from whom the breath of life has passed away and who yet live on  indeed said hadden and have you ever seen these ghosts  am i mad that i should go to look for them white man only the dead enter that forest and it is on the borders of it that our people make offerings to the dead  followed by nahoon hadden walked to the edge of the cliff and looked over it to the left lay the deep and dreadfullooking pool while close to the bank of it placed upon a narrow strip of turf between the cliff and the commencement of the forest was a hut  who lives there asked hadden  the great isanusishe who is named inyanga or doctoress she who is named inyosi the bee because she gathers wisdom from the dead who grow in the forest  do you think that she could gather enough wisdom to tell me whether i am going to kill any buffalo nahoon  mayhap white man but he added with a little smile those who visit the bees hive may hear nothing or they may hear more than they wish for the words of that bee have a sting  good i will see if she can sting me  so be it said nahoon and turning he led the way along the cliff till he reached a native path which zigzagged down its face  by this path they climbed till they came to the sward at the foot of the descent and walked up it to the hut which was surrounded by a low fence of reeds enclosing a small courtyard paved with antheap earth beaten hard and polished in this courtyard sat the bee her stool being placed almost at the mouth of the round opening that served as a doorway to the hut at first all that hadden could see of her crouched as she was in the shadow was a huddled shape wrapped round with a greasy and tattered catskin kaross above the edge of which appeared two eyes fierce and quick as those of a leopard at her feet smouldered a little fire and ranged around it in a semicircle were a number of human skulls placed in pairs as though they were talking together whilst other bones to all appearance also human were festooned about the hut and the fence of the courtyard  i see that the old lady is set up with the usual properties thought hadden but he said nothing  nor did the witchdoctoress say anything she only fixed her beady eyes upon his face hadden returned the compliment staring at her with all his might till suddenly he became aware that he was vanquished in this curious duel his brain grew confused and to his fancy it seemed that the woman before him had shifted shape into the likeness of colossal and horrid spider sitting at the mouth of her trap and that these bones were the relics of her victims  why do you not speak white man she said at last in a slow clear voice well there is no need since i can read your thoughts you are thinking that i who am called the bee should be better named the spider have no fear i did not kill these men what would it profit me when the dead are so many i suck the souls of men not their bodies white man it is their living hearts i love to look on for therein i read much and thereby i grow wise now what would you of the bee white man the bee that labours in this garden of death andwhat brings you here son of zomba why are you not with the umcityu now that they doctor themselves for the great warthe last warthe war of the white and the blackor if you have no stomach for fighting why are you not at the side of nanea the tall nanea the fair  nahoon made no answer but hadden said  a small thing mother i would know if i shall prosper in my hunting  in your hunting white man what hunting the hunting of game of money or of women well one of them for ahunting you must ever be that is your nature to hunt and be hunted tell me now how goes the wound of that trader who tasted of your steel yonder in the town of the maboon boers no need to answer white man but what fee chief for the poor witchdoctoress whose skill you seek she added in a whining voice surely you would not that an old woman should work without a fee  i have none to offer you mother so i will be going said hadden who began to feel himself satisfied with this display of the bees powers of observation and thoughtreading  nay she answered with an unpleasant laugh would you ask a question and not wait for the answer i will take no fee from you at present white man you shall pay me later on when we meet again and once more she laughed let me look in your face let me look in your face she continued rising and standing before him  then of a sudden hadden felt something cold at the back of his neck and the next instant the bee had sprung from him holding between her thumb and finger a curl of dark hair which she had cut from his head the action was so instantaneous that he had neither time to avoid nor to resent it but stood still staring at her stupidly  that is all i need she cried for like my heart my magic is white stayson of zomba give me also of your hair for those who visit the bee must listen to her humming  nahoon obeyed cutting a little lock from his head with the sharp edge of his assegai though it was very evident that he did this not because he wished to do so but because he feared to refuse  then the bee slipped back her kaross and stood bending over the fire before them into which she threw herbs taken from a pouch that was bound about her middle she was still a finelyshaped woman and she wore none of the abominations which hadden had been accustomed to see upon the persons of witchdoctoresses about her neck however was a curious ornament a small live snake red and grey in hue which her visitors recognised as one of the most deadly to be found in that part of the country it is not unusual for bantu witchdoctors thus to decorate themselves with snakes though whether or not their fangs have first been extracted no one seems to know  presently the herbs began to smoulder and the smoke of them rose up in a thin straight stream that striking upon the face of the bee clung about her head enveloping it as though with a strange blue veil then of a sudden she stretched out her hands and let fall the two locks of hair upon the burning herbs where they writhed themselves to ashes like things alive next she opened her mouth and began to draw the fumes of the hair and herbs into her lungs in great gulps while the snake feeling the influence of the medicine hissed and uncoiling itself from about her neck crept upwards and took refuge among the black saccaboola feathers of her headdress  soon the vapours began to do their work she swayed to and fro muttering then sank back against the hut upon the straw of which her head rested now the bees face was turned upwards towards the light and it was ghastly to behold for it had become blue in colour and the open eyes were sunken like the eyes of one dead whilst above her forehead the red snake wavered and hissed reminding hadden of the uraeus crest on the brow of statues of egyptian kings for ten seconds or more she remained thus then she spoke in a hollow and unnatural voice  o black heart and body that is white and beautiful i look into your heart and it is black as blood and it shall be black with blood beautiful white body with black heart you shall find your game and hunt it and it shall lead you into the house of the homeless into the home of the dead and it shall be shaped as a bull it shall be shaped as a tiger it shall be shaped as a woman whom kings and waters cannot harm beautiful white body and black heart you shall be paid your wages money for money and blow for blow think of my word when the spotted cat purrs above your breast think of it when the battle roars about you think of it when you grasp your great reward and for the last time stand face to face with the ghost of the dead in the home of the dead  o white heart and black body i look into your heart and it is white as milk and the milk of innocence shall save it fool why do you strike that blow let him be who is loved of the tiger and whose love is as the love of a tiger ah what face is that in the battle follow it follow it o swift of foot but follow warily for the tongue that has lied will never plead for mercy and the hand that can betray is strong in war white heart what is death in death life lives and among the dead you shall find the life you lost for there awaits you she whom kings and waters cannot harm  as the bee spoke by degrees her voice sank lower and lower till it was almost inaudible then it ceased altogether and she seemed to pass from trance to sleep hadden who had been listening to her with an amused and cynical smile now laughed aloud  why do you laugh white man asked nahoon angrily  i laugh at my own folly in wasting time listening to the nonsense of that lying fraud  it is no nonsense white man  indeed then will you tell me what it means  i cannot tell you what it means yet but her words have to do with a woman and a leopard and with your fate and my fate  hadden shrugged his shoulders not thinking the matter worth further argument and at that moment the bee woke up shivering drew the red snake from her headdress and coiling it about her throat wrapped herself again in the greasy kaross  are you satisfied with my wisdom inkoos she asked of hadden  i am satisfied that you are one of the cleverest cheats in zululand mother he answered coolly now what is there to pay  the bee took no offence at this rude speech though for a second or two the look in her eyes grew strangely like that which they had seen in those of the snake when the fumes of the fire made it angry  if the white lord says i am a cheat it must be so she answered for he of all men should be able to discern a cheat i have said that i ask no feeyes give me a little tobacco from your pouch  hadden opened the bag of antelope hide and drawing some tobacco from it gave it to her in taking it she clasped his hand and examined the gold ring that was upon the third finger a ring fashioned like a snake with two little rubies set in the head to represent the eyes  i wear a snake about my neck and you wear one upon your hand inkoos i should like to have this ring to wear upon my hand so that the snake about my neck may be less lonely there  then i am afraid you will have to wait till i am dead said hadden  yes yes she answered in a pleased voice it is a good word i will wait till you are dead and then i will take the ring and none can say that i have stolen it for nahoon there will bear me witness that you gave me permission to do so  for the first time hadden started since there was something about the bees tone that jarred upon him had she addressed him in her professional manner he would have thought nothing of it but in her cupidity she had become natural and it was evident that she spoke from conviction believing her own words  she saw him start and instantly changed her note  let the white lord forgive the jest of a poor old witchdoctoress she said in a whining voice i have so much to do with death that his name leaps to my lips and she glanced first at the circle of skulls about her then towards the waterfall that fed the gloomy pool upon whose banks her hut was placed  look she said simply  following the line of her outstretched hand haddens eyes fell upon two withered mimosa trees which grew over the fall almost at right angles to its rocky edge these trees were joined together by a rude platform made of logs of wood lashed down with riems of hide upon this platform stood three figures notwithstanding the distance and the spray of the fall he could see that they were those of two men and a girl for their shapes stood out distinctly against the fiery red of the sunset sky one instant there were three the next there were twofor the girl had gone and something dark rushing down the face of the fall struck the surface of the pool with a heavy thud while a faint and piteous cry broke upon his ear  what is the meaning of that he asked horrified and amazed  nothing answered the bee with a laugh do you not know then that this is the place where faithless women or girls who have loved without the leave of the king are brought to meet their death and with them their accomplices oh they die here thus each day and i watch them die and keep the count of the number of them and drawing a tallystick from the thatch of the hut she took a knife and added a notch to the many that appeared upon it looking at nahoon the while with a halfquestioning halfwarning gaze  yes yes it is a place of death she muttered up yonder the quick die day by day and down thereand she pointed along the course of the river beyond the pool to where the forest began some two hundred yards from her hutthe ghosts of them have their home listen  as she spoke a sound reached their ears that seemed to swell from the dim skirts of the forests a peculiar and unholy sound which it is impossible to define more accurately than by saying that it seemed beastlike and almost inarticulate  listen repeated the bee they are merry yonder  who asked hadden the baboons  no inkoos the amatongothe ghosts that welcome her who has just become of their number  ghosts said hadden roughly for he was angry at his own tremors i should like to see those ghosts do you think that i have never heard a troop of monkeys in the bush before mother come nahoon let us be going while there is light to climb the cliff farewell  farewell inkoos and doubt not that your wish will be fulfilled go in peace inkoosto sleep in peace    chapter iii  the end of the hunt  the prayer of the bee notwithstanding philip hadden slept ill that night he felt in the best of health and his conscience was not troubling him more than usual but rest he could not whenever he closed his eyes his mind conjured up a picture of the grim witchdoctoress so strangely named the bee and the sound of her evilomened words as he had heard them that afternoon he was neither a superstitious nor a timid man and any supernatural beliefs that might linger in his mind were to say the least of it dormant but do what he might he could not shake off a certain eerie sensation of fear lest there should be some grains of truth in the prophesyings of this hag what if it were a fact that he was near his death and that the heart which beat so strongly in his breast must soon be still for everno he would not think of it this gloomy place and the dreadful sight which he saw that day had upset his nerves the domestic customs of these zulus were not pleasant and for his part he was determined to be clear of them so soon as he was able to escape the country  in fact if he could in any way manage it it was his intention to make a dash for the border on the following night to do this with a good prospect of success however it was necessary that he should kill a buffalo or some other head of game then as he knew well the hunters with him would feast upon meat until they could scarcely stir and that would be his opportunity nahoon however might not succumb to this temptation therefore he must trust to luck to be rid of him if it came to the worst he could put a bullet through him which he considered he would be justified in doing seeing that in reality the man was his jailor should this necessity arise he felt indeed that he could face it without undue compunction for in truth he disliked nahoon at times he even hated him their natures were antagonistic and he knew that the great zulu distrusted and looked down upon him and to be looked down upon by a savage nigger was more than his pride could stomach  at the first break of dawn hadden rose and roused his escort who were still stretched in sleep around the dying fire each man wrapped in his kaross or blanket nahoon stood up and shook himself looking gigantic in the shadows of the morning  what is your will umlungu white man that you are up before the sun  my will muntumpofu yellow man is to hunt buffalo answered hadden coolly it irritated him that this savage should give him no title of any sort  your pardon said the zulu reading his thoughts but i cannot call you inkoos because you are not my chief or any mans still if the title white man offends you we will give you a name  as you wish answered hadden briefly  accordingly they gave him a name inhlizinmgama by which he was known among them thereafter but hadden was not best pleased when he found that the meaning of those softsounding syllables was black heart that was how the inyanga had addressed himonly she used different words  an hour later and they were in the swampy bush country that lay behind the encampment searching for their game within a very little while nahoon held up his hand then pointed to the ground hadden looked there pressed deep in the marshy soil and to all appearance not ten minutes old was the spoor of a small herd of buffalo  i knew that we should find game today whispered nahoon because the bee said so  curse the bee answered hadden below his breath come on  for a quarter of an hour or more they followed the spoor through thick reeds till suddenly nahoon whistled very softly and touched haddens arm he looked up and there about two hundred yards away feeding on some higher ground among a patch if mimosa trees were the buffaloessix of theman old bull with a splendid head three cows a heifer and a calf about four months old neither the wind nor the nature of the veldt were favourable for them to stalk the game from their present position so they made a detour of half a mile and very carefully crept towards them up the wind slipping from trunk to trunk of the mimosas and when these failed them crawling on their stomachs under cover of the tall tambuti grass at last they were within forty yards and a further advance seemed impracticable for although he could not smell them it was evident from his movements that the old bull heard some unusual sound and was growing suspicious nearest to hadden who alone of the party had a rifle stood the heifer broadside ona beautiful shot remembering that she would make the best beef he lifted his martini and aiming at her immediately behind the shoulder gently squeezed the trigger the rifle exploded and the heifer fell dead shot through the heart strangely enough the other buffaloes did not at once run away on the contrary they seemed puzzled to account for the sudden noise and not being able to wind anything lifted their heads and stared round them  the pause gave hadden space to get in a fresh cartridge and to aim again this time at the old bull the bullet struck him somewhere in the neck or shoulder for he came to his knees but in another second was up and having caught sight of the cloud of smoke he charged straight at it because of this smoke or for some other reason hadden did not see him coming and in consequence would most certainly have been trampled or gored had not nahoon sprung forward at the imminent risk of his own life and dragged him down behind an antheap a moment more and the great beast had thundered by taking no further notice of them  forward said hadden and leaving most of the men to cut up the heifer and carry the best of her meat to camp they started on the blood spoor  for some hours they followed the bull till at last they lost the trail on a patch of stony ground thickly covered with bush and exhausted by the heat sat down to rest and to eat some biltong or sundried flesh which they had with them they finished their meal and were preparing to return to the camp when one of the four zulus who were with them went to drink at a little stream that ran at a distance of not more than ten paces away half a minute later they heard a hideous grunting noise and a splashing of water and saw the zulu fly into the air all the while that they were eating the wounded buffalo had been lying in wait for them under a thick bush on the banks of the streamlet knowingcunning brute that he wasthat sooner or later his turn would come with a shout of consternation they rushed forward to see the bull vanish over the rise before hadden could get a chance of firing at him and to find their companion dying for the great horn had pierced his lung  it is not a buffalo it is a devil the poor fellow gasped and expired  devil or not i mean to kill it exclaimed hadden so leaving the others to carry the body of their comrade to camp he started on accompanied by nahoon only now the ground was more open and the chase easier for they sighted their quarry frequently though they could not come near enough to fire presently they travelled down a steep cliff  do you know where we are asked nahoon pointing to a belt of forest opposite that is emagudu the home of the deadand look the bull heads thither  hadden glanced round him it was true yonder to the left were the fall the pool of doom and the hut of the bee  very well he answered then we must head for it too  nahoon halted surely you would not enter there he exclaimed  surely i will replied hadden but there is no need for you to do so if you are afraid  i am afraidof ghosts said the zulu but i will come  so they crossed the strip of turf and entered the haunted wood it was a gloomy place indeed the great widetopped trees grew thick there shutting out the sight of the sky moreover the air in it which no breeze stirred was heavy with the exhalations of rotting foliage there seemed to be no life here and no soundonly now and again a loathsome spotted snake would uncoil itself and glide away and now and again a heavy rotten bough fell with a crash  hadden was too intent upon the buffalo however to be much impressed by his surroundings he only remarked that the light would be bad for shooting and went on  they must have penetrated a mile or more into the forest when the sudden increase of blood upon the spoor told them that the bulls wound was proving fatal to him  run now said hadden cheerfully  nay hamba gachlego softly answered nahoon the devil is dying but he will try to play us another trick before he dies and he went on peering ahead of him cautiously  it is all right here anyway said hadden pointing to the spoor that ran straight forward printed deep in the marshy ground  nahoon did not answer but stared steadily at the trunks of two trees a few paces in front of them and to their right look he whispered  hadden did so and at length made out the outline of something brown that was crouched behind the trees  he is dead he exclaimed  no answered nahoon he has come back on his own path and is waiting for us he knows that we are following his spoor now if you stand there i think that you can shoot him through the back between the tree trunks  hadden knelt down and aiming very carefully at a point just below the bulls spine he fired there was an awful bellow and the next instant the brute was up and at them nahoon flung his broad spear which sank deep into its chest then they fled this way and that the buffalo stood still for a moment its fore legs straddled wide and its head down looking first after the one and then the other till of a sudden it uttered a low moaning sound and rolled over dead smashing nahoons assegai to fragments as it fell  there hes finished said hadden and i believe it was your assegai that killed him hullo whats that noise  nahoon listened in several quarters of the forest but from how far away it was impossible to tell there rose a curious sound as of people calling to each other in fear but in no articulate language nahoon shivered  it is the esemkofu he said the ghosts who have no tongue and who can only wail like infants let us be going this place is bad for mortals  and worse for buffaloes said hadden giving the dead bull a kick but i suppose that we must leave him here for your friends the esemkofu as we have got meat enough and cant carry his head  so they started back towards the open country as they threaded their way slowly through the tree trunks a new idea came into haddens head once out of this forest he was within an hours run of the zulu border and once over the zulu border he would feel a happier man than he did at that moment as has been said he had intended to attempt to escape in the darkness but the plan was risky all the zulus might not overeat themselves and go to sleep especially after the death of their comrade nahoon who watched him day and night certainly would not this was his opportunitythere remained the question of nahoon  well if it came to the worst nahoon must die it would be easyhe had a loaded rifle and now that his assegai was gone nahoon had only a kerry he did not wish to kill the man though it was clear to him seeing that his own safety was at stake that he would be amply justified in so doing why should he not put it to himand then be guided by circumstances  nahoon was walking across a little open space about ten spaces ahead of him where hadden could see him very well whilst he himself was under the shadow of a large tree with low horizontal branches running out from the trunk  nahoon he said  the zulu turned round and took a step towards him  no do not move i pray stand where you are or i shall be obliged to shoot you listen now do not be afraid for i shall not fire without warning i am your prisoner and you are charged to take me back to the king to be his servant but i believe that a war is going to break out between your people and mine and this being so you will understand that i do not wish to go to cetywayos kraal because i should either come to a violent death there or my own brothers will believe that i am a traitor and treat me accordingly the zulu border is not much more than an hours journey awaylet us say an hour and a halfs i mean to be across it before the moon is up now nahoon will you lose me in the forest and give me this hour and a halfs startor will you stop here with that ghost people of whom you talk do you understand no please do not move  i understand you answered the zulu in a perfectly composed voice and i think that was a good name which we gave you this morning though black heart there is some justice in your words and more wisdom your opportunity is good and one which a man named as you are should not let fall  i am glad to find that you take this view of the matter nahoon and now will you be so kind as to lose me and to promise not to look for me till the moon is up  what do you mean black heart  what i say come i have no time to spare  you are a strange man said the zulu reflectively you heard the kings order to me would you have me disobey the order of the king  certainly i would you have no reason to love cetywayo and it does not matter to you whether or no i return to his kraal to mend guns there if you think that he will be angry because i am missing you had better cross the border also we can go together  and leave my father and all my brethren to his vengeance black heart you do not understand how can you being so named i am a soldier and the kings word is the kings word i hoped to have died fighting but i am the bird in your noose come shoot or you will not reach the border before moonrise and he opened his arms and smiled  if it must be so let it be farewell nahoon at least you are a brave man but every one of us must cherish his own life answered hadden calmly  then with much deliberation he raised his rifle and covered the zulus breast  alreadywhilst his victim stood there still smiling although a twitching of his lips betrayed the natural terrors that no bravery can banishalready his finger was contracting on the trigger when of a sudden as instantly as though he had been struck by lightning hadden went down backwards and behold there stood upon him a great spotted beast that waved its long tail to and fro and glared down into his eyes  it was a leoparda tiger as they call it in africawhich crouched upon a bough of the tree above had been unable to resist the temptation of satisfying its savage appetite on the man below for a second or two there was silence broken only by the purring or rather the snoring sound made by the leopard in those seconds strangely enough there sprang up before haddens mental vision a picture of the inyanga called inyosi or the bee her deathlike head resting against the thatch of the hut and her deathlike lips muttering think of my word when the great cat purrs above your face  then the brute put out its strength the claws of one paw it drove deep into the muscles of his left thigh while with another it scratched at his breast tearing the clothes from it and furrowing the flesh beneath the sight of the white skin seemed to madden it and in its fierce desire for blood it drooped its square muzzle and buried its fangs in its victims shoulder next moment there was a sound of running feet and of a club falling heavily up reared the leopard with an angry snarl up till it stood as high as the attacking zulu at him it came striking out savagely and tearing the black man as it had torn the white again the kerry fell full on its jaws and down it went backwards before it could rise again or rather as it was in the act of rising the heavy knobstick struck it once more and with fearful force this time as it chanced full on the nape of the neck and paralysing the brute it writhed and bit and twisted throwing up the earth and leaves while blow after blow was rained upon it till at length with a convulsive struggle and a stifled roar it lay stillthe brains oozing from its shattered skull  hadden sat up the blood running from his wounds  you have saved my life nahoon he said faintly and i thank you  do not thank me black heart answered the zulu it was the kings word that i should keep you safely still this tiger has been hardly dealt with for certainly he has saved my life and lifting the martini he unloaded the rifle  at this juncture hadden swooned away    twentyfour hours had gone by when after what seemed to him to be but a little time of troubled and dreamful sleep through which he could hear voices without understanding what they said and feel himself borne he knew not whither hadden awoke to find himself lying upon a kaross in a large and beautifully clean kaffir hut with a bundle of furs for a pillow there was a bowl of milk at his side and tortured as he was by thirst he tried to stretch out his arm to lift it to his lips only to find to his astonishment that his hand fell back to his side like that of a dead man looking round the hut impatiently he found that there was nobody in it to assist him so he did the only thing which remained for him to dohe lay still he did not fall asleep but his eyes closed and a kind of gentle torpor crept over him half obscuring his recovered senses presently he heard a soft voice speaking it seemed far away but he could clearly distinguish the words  black heart still sleeps the voice said but there is colour in his face i think that he will wake soon and find his thoughts again  have no fear nanea he will surely wake his hurts are not dangerous answered another voice that of nahoon he fell heavily with the weight of the tiger on top of him and that is why his senses have been shaken for so long he went near to death but certainly he will not die  it would have been a pity if he had died answered the soft voice he is so beautiful never have i seen a white man who was so beautiful  i did not think him beautiful when he stood with his rifle pointed at my heart answered nahoon sulkily  well there is this to be said she replied he wished to escape from cetywayo and that is not to be wondered at and she sighed moreover he asked you to come with him and it might have been well if you had done so that is if you would have taken me with you  how could i have done it girl he asked angrily would you have me set at nothing the order of the king  the king she replied raising her voice what do you owe to this king you have served him faithfully and your reward is that within a few days he will take me from youme who should have been your wife and i musti must and she began to weep softly adding between her sobs if you loved me truly you would think more of me and of yourself and less of the black one and his orders oh let us fly nahoon let us fly to natal before this spear pierces me  weep not nanea he said why do you tear my heart in two between my duty and my love you know that i am a soldier and that i must walk the path whereon the king has set my feet soon i think i shall be dead for i seek death and then it will matter nothing  nothing to you nahoon who are at peace but to me yet you are right and i know it therefore forgive me who am no warrior but a woman who must also obeythe will of the king and she cast her arms about his neck sobbing her fill upon his breast    chapter iv  nanea  presently muttering something that the listener could not catch nahoon left nanea and crept out of the hut by its beehole entrance then hadden opened his eyes and looked round him the sun was sinking and a ray of its red light streaming through the little opening filled the place with a soft and crimson glow in the centre of the hutsupporting itstood a thornwood rooftree coloured black by the smoke of the fire and against this the rich light falling full upon her leaned the girl naneaa very picture of gentle despair  as is occasionally the case among zulu women she was beautifulso beautiful that the sight of her went straight to the white mans heart for a moment causing the breath to catch in his throat her dress was very simple on her shoulders hanging open in front lay a mantle of soft white stuff edged with blue beads about her middle was a buckskin moocha also embroidered with blue beads while round her forehead and left knee were strips of grey fur and on her right wrist a shining bangle of copper her naked bronzehued figure was tall and perfect in its proportions while her face had little in common with that of the ordinary native girl showing as it did strong traces of the ancestral arabian or semitic blood it was oval in shape with delicate aquiline features arched eyebrows a full mouth that drooped a little at the corners tiny ears behind which the wavy coalblack hair hung down to the shoulders and the very loveliest pair of dark and liquid eyes that it is possible to imagine  for a minute or more nanea stood thus her sweet face bathed in the sunbeam while hadden feasted his eyes upon its beauty then sighing heavily she turned and seeing that he was awake started drew her mantle over her breast and came or rather glided towards him  the chief is awake she said in her soft zulu accents does he need aught  yes lady he answered i need to drink but alas i am too weak  she knelt down beside him and supporting him with her left arm with her right held the gourd to his lips  how it came about hadden never knew but before that draught was finished a change passed over him whether it was the savage girls touch or her strange and fawnlike loveliness or the tender pity in her eyes matters notthe issue was the same she struck some cord in his turbulent uncurbed nature and of a sudden it was filled full with passion for hera passion which if not elevated at least was real he did not for a moment mistake the significance of the flood of feeling that surged through his veins hadden never shirked facts  by heaven he said to himself i have fallen in love with a black beauty at first sightmore in love than i have ever been before its awkward but there will be compensations so much the worse for nahoon or for cetywayo or for both of them after all i can always get rid of her if she becomes a nuisance  then in a fit of renewed weakness brought about by the turmoil of his blood he lay back upon the pillow of furs watching naneas face while with a native salve of pounded leaves she busied herself dressing the wounds that the leopard had made  it almost seemed as though something of what was passing in his mind communicated itself to that of the girl at least her hand shook a little at her task and getting done with it as quickly as she could she rose from her knees with a courteous it is finished inkoos and once more took up her position by the rooftree  i thank you lady he said your hand is kind  you must not call me lady inkoos she answered i am no chieftainess but only the daughter of a headman umgona  and named nanea he said nay do not be surprised i have heard of you well nanea perhaps you will soon become a chieftainessup at the kings kraal yonder  alas and alas she said covering her face with her hands  do not grieve nanea a hedge is never so tall and thick but that it cannot be climbed or crept through  she let fall her hands and looked at him eagerly but he did not pursue the subject  tell me how did i come here nanea  nahoon and his companions carried you inkoos  indeed i begin to be thankful to the leopard that struck me down well nahoon is a brave man and he has done me a great service i trust that i may be able to repay itto you nanea    this was the first meeting of nanea and hadden but although she did not seek them the necessities of his sickness and of the situation brought about many another never for a moment did the white man waver in his determination to get into his keeping the native girl who had captivated him and to attain his end he brought to bear all his powers and charm to detach her from nahoon and win her affections for himself he was no rough wooer however but proceeded warily weaving her about with a web of flattery and attention that must he thought produce the desired effect upon her mind without a doubt indeed it would have done sofor she was but a woman and an untutored onehad it not been for a simple fact which dominated her whole nature she loved nahoon and there was no room in her heart for any other man white or black to hadden she was courteous and kindly but no more nor did she appear to notice any of the subtle advances by which he attempted to win a foothold in her heart for a while this puzzled him but he remembered that the zulu women do not usually permit themselves to show feeling towards an undeclared suitor therefore it became necessary that he should speak out  his mind once made up he had not to wait long for an opportunity he was now quite recovered from his hurts and accustomed to walk in the neighbourhood of the kraal about two hundred yards from umgonas huts rose a spring and thither it was naneas habit to resort in the evening to bring back drinkingwater for the use of her fathers household the path between this spring and the kraal ran through a patch of bush where on a certain afternoon towards sundown hadden took his seat under a tree having first seen nanea go down to the little stream as was her custom a quarter of an hour later she reappeared carrying a large gourd upon her head she wore no garment now except her moocha for she had but one mantle and was afraid lest the water should splash it he watched her advancing along the path her hands resting on her hips her splendid naked figure outlined against the westering sun and wondered what excuse he could make to talk with her as it chanced fortune favoured him for when she was near him a snake glided across the path in front of the girls feet causing her to spring backwards in alarm and overset the gourd of water he came forward and picked it up  wait here he said laughing i will bring it to you full  nay inkoos she remonstrated that is a womans work  among my people he said the men love to work for the women and he started for the spring leaving her wondering  before he reached her again he regretted his gallantry for it was necessary to carry the handleless gourd upon his shoulder and the contents of it spilling over the edge soaked him of this however he said nothing to nanea  there is your water nanea shall i carry it for you to the kraal  nay inkoos i thank you but give it to me you are weary with its weight  stay awhile and i will accompany you ah nanea i am still weak and had it not been for you i think that i should be dead  it was nahoon who saved younot i inkoos  nahoon saved my body but you nanea you alone can save my heart  you talk darkly inkoos  then i must make my meaning clear nanea i love you  she opened her brown eyes wide  you a white lord love me a zulu girl how can that be  i do not know nanea but it is so and were you not blind you would have seen it i love you and i wish to take you to wife  nay inkoos it is impossible i am already betrothed  ay he answered betrothed to the king  no betrothed to nahoon  but it is the king who will take you within a week is it not so and would you not rather that i should take you than the king  it seems to be so inkoos and i would rather go with you than with the king but most of all i desire to marry nahoon it may be that i shall not be able to marry him but if that is so at least i will never become one of the kings women  how will you prevent it nanea  there are waters in which a maid may drown and trees upon which she can hang she answered with a quick setting of the mouth  that were a pity nanea you are too fair to die  fair or foul yet i die inkoos  no no come with mei will find a wayand be my wife and he put her arm about her waist and strove to draw her to him  without any violence of movement and with the most perfect dignity the girl disengaged herself from his embrace  you have honoured me and i thank you inkoos she said quietly but you do not understand i am the wife of nahooni belong to nahoon therefore i cannot look on any other man while nahoon lives it is not our custom inkoos for we are not as the white women but ignorant and simple and when we vow ourselves to a man we abide by that vow till death  indeed said hadden and so now you go to tell nahoon that i have offered to make you my wife  no inkoos why should i tell nahoon your secrets i have said nay to you not yea therefore he has no right to know and she stooped to lift the gourd of water  hadden considered the situation rapidly for his repulse only made him the more determined to succeed of a sudden under the emergency he conceived a scheme or rather its rough outline it was not a nice scheme and some men might have shrunk from it but as he had no intention of suffering himself to be defeated by a zulu girl he decidedwith regret it is truethat having failed to attain his ends by means which he considered fair he must resort to others of more doubtful character  nanea he said you are a good and honest woman and i respect you as i have told you i love you also but if you refuse to listen to me there is nothing more to be said and after all perhaps it would be better that you should marry one of your own people but nanea you will never marry him for the king will take you and if he does not give you to some other man either you will become one of his sisters or to be free of him as you say you will die now hear me for it is because i love you and wish your welfare that i speak thus why do you not escape into natal taking nahoon with you for there as you know you may live in peace out of reach of the arm of cetywayo  that is my desire inkoos but nahoon will not consent he says that there is to be war between us and you white men and he will not break the command of the king and desert from his army  then he cannot love you much nahoon and at least you have to think of yourself whisper into the ear of your father and fly together for be sure that nahoon will soon follow you ay and i myself with fly with you for i too believe that there must be war and then a white man in this country will be as a lamb among the eagles  if nahoon will come i will go inkoos but i cannot fly without nahoon it is better i should stay here and kill myself  surely then being so fair and loving him so well you can teach him to forget his folly and to escape with you in four days time we must start for the kings kraal and if you win over nahoon it will be easy for us to turn our faces southwards and across the river that lies between the land of the amazulu and natal for the sake of all of us but most of all for your own sake try to do this nanea whom i have loved and whom i now would save see him and plead with him as you know how but as yet do not tell him that i dream of flight for then i should be watched  in truth i will inkoos she answered earnestly and oh i thank you for your goodness fear not that i will betray youfirst would i die farewell  farewell nanea and taking her hand he raised it to his lips    late that night just as hadden was beginning to prepare himself for sleep he heard a gentle tapping at the board which closed the entrance to his hut  enter he said unfastening the door and presently by the light of the little lantern that he had with him he saw nanea creep into the hut followed by the great form of nahoon  inkoos she said in a whisper when the door was closed again i have pleaded with nahoon and he has consented to fly moreover my father will come also  is it so nahoon asked hadden  it is so answered the zulu looking down shamefacedly to save this girl from the king and because the love of her eats out my heart i have bartered away my honour but i tell you nanea and you white man as i told umgona just now that i think no good will come of this flight and if we are caught or betrayed we shall be killed every one of us  caught we can scarcely be broke in nanea anxiously for who could betray us except the inkoos here  which he is not likely to do said hadden quietly seeing that he desires to escape with you and that his life is also at stake  that is so black heart said nahoon otherwise i tell you that i should not have trusted you  hadden took no notice of this outspoken saying but until very late that night they sat there together making their plans    on the following morning hadden was awakened by sounds of violent altercation going out of his hut he found that the disputants were umgona and a fat and evillooking kaffir chief who had arrived at the kraal on a pony this chief he soon discovered was named maputa being none other than the man who had sought nanea in marriage and brought about nahoons and umgonas unfortunate appeal to the king at present he was engaged in abusing umgona furiously charging him with having stolen certain of his oxen and bewitched his cows so that they would not give milk the alleged theft it was comparatively easy to disprove but the wizardry remained a matter of argument  you are a dog and a son of a dog shouted maputa shaking his fat fist in the face of the trembling but indignant umgona you promised me your daughter in marriage then having vowed her to that umfagozanthat low lout of a soldier nahoon the son of zombayou went the two of you and poisoned the kings ear against me bringing me into trouble with the king and now you have bewitched my cattle well wait i will be even with you wizard wait till you wake up in the cold morning to find your fence red with fire and the slayers standing outside your gates to eat up you and yours with spears  at this juncture nahoon who till now had been listening in silence intervened with effect  good he said we will wait but not in your company chief maputa hamba go and seizing the fat old ruffian by the scruff of his neck he flung him backwards with such violence that he rolled over and over down the little slope  hadden laughed and passed on towards the stream where he proposed to bathe just as he reached it he caught sight of maputa riding along the footpath his headring covered with mud his lips purple and his black face livid with rage  there goes an angry man he said to himself now how would it be and he looked upwards like one seeking an inspiration it seemed to come perhaps the devil finding it open whispered in his ear at any ratein a few seconds his plan was formed and he was walking through the bush to meet maputa  go in peace chief he said they seem to have treated you roughly up yonder having no power to interfere i came away for i could not bear the sight it is indeed shameful that an old and venerable man of rank should be struck into the dirt and beaten by a soldier drunk with beer  shameful white man gasped maputa your words are true indeed but wait a while i maputa will roll that stone over i will throw that bull upon its back when next the harvest ripens this i promise that neither nahoon nor umgona nor any of his kraal shall be left to gather it  and how will you manage that maputa  i do not know but i will find a way oh i tell you a way shall be found  hadden patted the ponys neck meditatively then leaning forward he looked the chief in the eyes and said  what will you give me maputa if i show you that way a sure and certain one whereby you may be avenged to the death upon nahoon whose violence i also have seen and upon umgona whose witchcraft brought sore sickness upon me  what reward do you seek white man asked maputa eagerly  a little thing chief a thing of no account only the girl nanea to whom as it chances i have taken a fancy  i wanted her for myself white man but he who sits at ulundi has laid his hand upon her  that is nothing chief i can arrange with him who sits at ulundi it is with you who are great here that i wish to come to terms listen if you grant my desire not only will i fulfil yours upon your foes but when the girl is delivered into my hands i will give you this rifle and a hundred rounds of cartridges  maputa looked at the sporting martini and his eyes glistened  it is good he said it is very good often have i wished for such a gun that will enable me to shoot game and to talk with my enemies from far away promise it to me white man and you shall take the girl if i can give her to you  you swear it maputa  i swear it by the head of chaka and the spirits of my fathers  good at dawn on the fourth day from now it is the purpose of umgona his daughter nanea and nahoon to cross the river into natal by the drift that is called crocodile drift taking their cattle with them and flying from the king i also shall be of their company for they know that i have learned their secret and would murder me if i tried to leave them now you who are chief of the border and guardian of that drift must hide at night with some men among the rocks in the shallows of the drift and await our coming first nanea will cross driving the cows and calves for so it is arranged and i shall help her then will follow umgona and nahoon with the oxen and heifers on these two you must fall killing them and capturing the cattle and afterwards i will give you the rifle  what if the king should ask for the girl white man  then you shall answer that in the uncertain light you did not recognise her and so she slipped away from you moreover that at first you feared to seize the girl lest her cries should alarm the men and they should escape you  good but how can i be sure that you will give me the gun once you are across the river  thus before i enter the ford i will lay the rifle and cartridges upon a stone by the bank telling nanea that i shall return to fetch them when i have driven over the cattle  it is well white man i will not fail you  so the plot was made and after some further conversation upon points of detail the two conspirators shook hands and parted  that ought to come off all right reflected hadden to himself as he plunged and floated in the waters of the stream but somehow i dont quite trust our friend maputa it would have been better if i could have relied upon myself to get rid of nahoon and his respected unclea couple of shots would do it in the water but then that would be murder and murder is unpleasant whereas the other thing is only the delivery to justice of two base deserters a laudable action in a military country also personal interference upon my part might turn the girl against me while after umgona and nahoon have been wiped out by maputa she must accept my escort of course there is a risk but in every walk of life the most cautious have to take risks at times  as it chanced philip hadden was correct in his suspicions of his coadjutor maputa even before that worthy chief reached his own kraal he had come to the conclusion that the white mans plan though attractive in some ways was too dangerous since it was certain that if the girl nanea escaped the king would be indignant moreover the men he took with him to do the killing in the drift would suspect something and talk on the other hand he would earn much credit with his majesty by revealing the plot saying that he had learned it from the lips of the white hunter whom umgona and nahoon had forced to participate in it and of whose coveted rifle he must trust to chance to possess himself    an hour later two discreet messengers were bounding across the plains bearing words from the chief maputa the warden of the border to the great black elephant at ulundi    chapter v  the doom pool  fortune showed itself strangely favourable to the plans of nahoon and nanea one of the zulu captains perplexities was as to how he should lull the suspicions and evade the vigilance of his own companions who together with himself had been detailed by the king to assist hadden in his hunting and to guard against his escape as it chanced however on the day after the incident of the visit of maputa a messenger arrived from no less a person than the great military induna tvingwayo ka marolo who afterwards commanded the zulu army at isandhlwana ordering these men to return to their regiment the umcityu corps which was to be placed upon full war footing accordingly nahoon sent them saying that he himself would follow with black heart in the course of a few days as at present the white man was not sufficiently recovered from his hurts to allow of his travelling fast and far so the soldiers went doubting nothing  then umgona gave it out that in obedience to the command of the king he was about to start for ulundi taking with him his daughter nanea to be delivered over into the sigodhla and also those fifteen head of cattle that had been lobolad by nahoon in consideration of his forthcoming marriage whereof he had been fined by cetywayo under pretence that they required a change of veldt the rest of his cattle he sent away in charge of a basuto herd who knew nothing of their plans telling him to keep them by the crocodile drift as there the grass was good and sweet  all preparations being completed on the third day the party started heading straight for ulundi after they had travelled some miles however they left the road and turning sharp to the right passed unobserved of any through a great stretch of uninhabited bush their path now lay not far from the pool of doom which indeed was close to umgonas kraal and the forest that was called home of the dead but out of sight of these it was their plan to travel by night reaching the broken country near the crocodile drift on the following morning here they proposed to lie hid that day and through the night then having first collected the cattle which had preceded them to cross the river at the break of dawn and escape into natal at least this was the plan of his companions but as we know hadden had another programme whereon after one last appearance two of the party would play no part  during that long afternoons journey umgona who knew every inch of the country walked ahead driving the fifteen cattle and carrying in his hand a long travelling stick of black and white umzimbeet wood for in truth the old man was in a hurry to reach his journeys end next came nahoon armed with a broad assegai but naked except for his moocha and necklet of baboons teeth and with him nanea in her white beadbordered mantle hadden who brought up the rear noticed that the girl seemed to be under the spell of an imminent apprehension for from time to time she clasped her lovers arm and looking up into his face addressed him with vehemence almost with passion  curiously enough the sight touched hadden and once or twice he was shaken by so sharp a pang of remorse at the thought of his share in this tragedy that he cast about in his mind seeking a means to unravel the web of death which he himself had woven but ever that evil voice was whispering at his ear it reminded him that he the white inkoos had been refused by this dusky beauty and that if he found a way to save him within some few hours she would be the wife of the savage gentleman at her side the man who had named him black heart and who despised him the man whom he had meant to murder and who immediately repaid his treachery by rescuing him from the jaws of the leopard at the risk of his own life moreover it was a law of haddens existence never to deny himself of anything that he desired if it lay within his power to take ita law which had led him always deeper into sin in other respects indeed it had not carried him far for in the past he had not desired much and he had won little but this particular flower was to his hand and he would pluck it if nahoon stood between him and the flower so much the worse for nahoon and if it should wither in his grasp so much the worse for the flower it could always be thrown away thus it came about that not for the first time in his life philip hadden discarded the somewhat spasmodic prickings of conscience and listened to that evil whispering at his ear  about halfpast five oclock in the afternoon the four refugees passed the stream that a mile or so down fell over the little precipice into the doom pool and entering a patch of thorn trees on the further side walked straight into the midst of twoandtwenty soldiers who were beguiling the tedium of expectancy by the taking of snuff and the smoking of dakka or native hemp with these soldiers seated on his pony for he was too fat to walk waited the chief maputa  observing that their expected guests had arrived the men knocked out the dakka pipe replaced the snuff boxes in the slits made in the lobes of their ears and secured the four of them  what is the meaning of this o kings soldiers asked umgona in a quavering voice we journey to the kraal of ucetywayo why do you molest us  indeed wherefore then are your faces set towards the south does the black one live in the south well you will journey to another kraal presently answered the joviallooking captain of the party with a callous laugh  i do not understand stammered umgona  then i will explain while you rest said the captain the chief maputa yonder sent word to the black one at ulundi that he had learned of your intended flight to natal from the lips of this white man who had warned him of it the black one was angry and despatched us to catch you and make an end of you that is all come on now quietly and let us finish the matter as the doom pool is near your deaths will be easy  nahoon heard the words and sprang straight at the throat of hadden but he did not reach it for the soldiers pulled him down nanea heard them also and turning looked the traitor in the eyes she said nothing she only looked but he could never forget that look the white man for his part was filled with a fiery indignation against maputa  you wicked villain he gasped whereat the chief smiled in a sickly fashion and turned away  then they were marched along the banks of the stream till they reached the waterfall that fell into the pool of doom  hadden was a brave man after his fashion but his heart quailed as he gazed into that abyss  are you going to throw me in there he asked of the zulu captain in a thick voice  you white man replied the soldier unconcernedly no our orders are to take you to the king but what he will do with you i do not know there is to be war between your people and ours so perhaps he means to pound you into medicine for the use of the witchdoctors or to peg you over an antheap as a warning to other white men  hadden received this information in silence but its effect upon his brain was bracing for instantly he began to search out some means of escape  by now the party had halted near the two thorn trees that hung over the waters of the pool  who dives first asked the captain of the chief maputa  the old wizard he replied nodding at umgona then his daughter after him and last of all this fellow and he struck nahoon in the face with his open hand  come on wizard said the captain grasping umgona by the arm and let us see how you can swim  at the words of doom umgona seemed to recover his selfcommand after the fashion of his race  no need to lead me soldier he said shaking himself loose who am old and ready to die then he kissed his daughter at his side wrung nahoon by the hand and turning from hadden with a gesture of contempt walked out upon the platform that joined the two thorn trunks here he stood for a moment looking at the setting sun then suddenly and without a sound he hurled himself into the abyss below and vanished  that was a brave one said the captain with admiration can you spring too girl or must we throw you  i can walk my fathers path nanea answered faintly but first i crave leave to say one word it is true that we were escaping from the king and therefore by the law we must die but it was black heart here who made the plot and he who has betrayed us would you know why he has betrayed us because he sought my favour and i refused him and this is the vengeance that he takesa white mans vengeance  wow broke in the chief maputa this pretty one speaks truth for the white man would have made a bargain with me under which umgona the wizard and nahoon the soldier were to be killed at the crocodile drift and he himself suffered to escape with the girl i spoke him softly and said yes and then like a loyal man i reported to the king  you hear sighed nanea nahoon fare you well though presently perhaps we shall be together again it was i who tempted you from your duty for my sake you forgot your honour and i am repaid farewell my husband it is better to die with you than to enter the house of the kings women and nanea stepped on to the platform  here holding to a bough of one of the thorn trees she turned and addressed hadden saying  black heart you seem to have won the day but me at least you lose andthe sun is not yet set after sunset comes the night black heart and in that night i pray that you may wander eternally and be given to drink of my blood and the blood of umgona my father and the blood of nahoon my husband who saved your life and whom you have murdered perchance black heart we may yet meet yonderin the house of the dead  then uttering a low cry nanea clasped her hands and sprang upwards and outwards from the platform the watchers bent their heads forward to look they saw her rush headlong down the face of the fall to strike the water fifty feet below a few seconds and for the last time they caught sight of her white garment glimmering on the surface of the gloomy pool then the shadows and mistwreaths hid it and she was gone  now husband cried the cheerful voice of the captain yonder is your marriage bed so be swift to follow a bride who is so ready to lead the way wow but you are good people to kill never have i had to do with any who gave less trouble you and he stopped for mental agony had done its work and suddenly nahoon went mad before his eyes  with a roar like that of a lion the great man cast off those who held him and seizing one of them round the waist and thigh he put out all his terrible strength lifting him as though he had been an infant he hurled him over the edge of the cliff to find his death on the rocks of the pool of doom then crying  black heart your turn black heart the traitor he rushed at hadden his eyes rolling and foam flying from his lips as he passed striking the chief maputa from his horse with a backward blow of his hand ill would it have gone with the white man if nahoon had caught him but he could not come at him for the soldiers sprang upon him and notwithstanding his fearful struggles they pulled him to the ground as at certain festivals the zulu regiments with their naked hands pull down a bull in the presence of the king  cast him over before he can work more mischief said a voice but the captain cried out nay nay he is sacred the fire from heaven has fallen on his brain and we may not harm him else evil would overtake us all bind him hand and foot and bear him tenderly to where he can be cared for surely i thought that these evildoers were giving us too little trouble and thus it has proved  so they set themselves to make fast nahoons hands and wrists using as much gentleness as they might for among the zulus a lunatic is accounted holy it was no easy task and it took time  hadden glanced around him and saw his opportunity on the ground close beside him lay his rifle where one of the soldiers had placed it and about a dozen yards away maputas pony was grazing with a swift movement he seized the martini and five seconds later he was on the back of the pony heading for the crocodile drift at a gallop so quickly indeed did he execute this masterly retreat that occupied as they all were in binding nahoon for half a minute or more none of the soldiers noticed what had happened then maputa chanced to see and waddled after him to the top of the rise screaming  the white thief he has stolen my horse and the gun too the gun that he promised to give me  hadden who by this time was a hundred yards away heard him clearly and a rage filled his heart this man had made an open murderer of him more he had been the means of robbing him of the girl for whose sake he had dipped his hands in these iniquities he glanced over his shoulder maputa was still running and alone yes there was time at any rate he would risk it  pulling up the pony with a jerk he leapt from its back slipping his arm through the rein with an almost simultaneous movement as it chanced and as he had hoped would be the case the animal was a trained shooting horse and stood still hadden planted his feet firmly on the ground and drawing a deep breath he cocked the rifle and covered the advancing chief now maputa saw his purpose and with a yell of terror turned to fly hadden waited a second to get the sight fair on his broad back then just as the soldiers appeared above the rise he pressed the trigger he was a noted shot and in this instance his skill did not fail him for before he heard the bullet tell maputa flung his arms wide and plunged to the ground dead  three seconds more and with a savage curse hadden had remounted the pony and was riding for his life towards the river which a while later he crossed in safety    chapter vi  the ghost of the dead  when nanea leapt from the dizzy platform that overhung the pool of doom a strange fortune befell her close in to the precipice were many jagged rocks and on these the waters of the fall fell and thundered bounding from them in spouts of spray into the troubled depths of the foss beyond it was on these stones that the life was dashed out from the bodies of the wretched victims who were hurled from above but nanea it will be remembered had not waited to be treated thus and as it chanced the strong spring with which she had leapt to death carried her clear of the rocks by a very little she missed the edge of them and striking the deep water head first like some practised diver she sank down and down till she thought that she would never rise again yet she did rise at the end of the pool in the mouth of the rapid along which she sped swiftly carried down by the rush of the water fortunately there were no rocks here and since she was a skilful swimmer she escaped the danger of being thrown against the banks  for a long distance she was borne thus till at length she saw that she was in a forest for trees cut off the light from the water and their drooping branches swept its surface one of these nanea caught with her hand and by the help of it she dragged herself from the river of death whence none had escaped before now she stood upon the bank gasping but quite unharmed there was not a scratch on her body even her white garment was still fast about her neck  but though she had suffered no hurt in her terrible voyage so exhausted was nanea that she could scarcely stand here the gloom was that of night and shivering with cold she looked helplessly to find some refuge close to the waters edge grew an enormous yellowwood tree and to this she staggeredthinking to climb it and seek shelter in its boughs where as she hoped she would be safe from wild beasts again fortune befriended her for at a distance of a few feet from the ground there was a great hole in the tree which she discovered was hollow into this hole she crept taking her chance of its being the home of snakes or other evil creatures to find that the interior was wide and warm it was dry also for at the bottom of the cavity lay a foot or more of rotten tinder and moss brought there by rats or birds upon this tinder she lay down and covering herself with the moss and leaves soon sank into sleep or stupor  how long nanea slept she did not know but at length she was awakened by a sound as of guttural human voices talking in a language that she could not understand rising to her knees she peered out of the hole in the tree it was night but the stars shone brilliantly and their light fell upon an open circle of ground close by the edge of the river in this circle there burned a great fire and at a little distance from the fire were gathered eight or ten horriblelooking beings who appeared to be rejoicing over something that lay upon the ground they were small in stature men and women together but no children and all of them were nearly naked their hair was long and thin growing down almost to the eyes their jaws and teeth protruded and the girth of their black bodies was out of all proportion to their height in their hands they held sticks with sharp stones lashed on to them or rude hatchetlike knives of the same material  now naneas heart shrank within her and she nearly fainted with fear for she knew that she was in the haunted forest and without a doubt these were the esemkofu the evil ghosts that dwelt therein yes that was what they were and yet she could not take her eyes off themthe sight of them held her with a horrible fascination but if they were ghosts why did they sing and dance like men why did they wave those sharp stones aloft and quarrel and strike each other and why did they make a fire as men do when they wish to cook food more what was it that they rejoiced over that long dark thing which lay so quiet upon the ground it did not look like a head of game and it could scarcely be a crocodile yet clearly it was food of some sort for they were sharpening the stone knives in order to cut it up  while she wondered thus one of the dreadfullooking little creatures advanced to the fire and taking from it a burning bough held it over the thing that lay upon the ground to give light to a companion who was about to do something to it with the stone knife next instant nanea drew back her head from the hole a stifled shriek upon her lips she saw what it was nowit was the body of a man yes and these were no ghosts they were cannibals of whom when she was little her mother had told her tales to keep her from wandering away from home  but who was the man they were about to eat it could not be one of themselves for his stature was much greater oh now she knew it must be nahoon who had been killed up yonder and whose dead body the waters had brought down to the haunted forest as they had brought her alive yes it must be nahoon and she would be forced to see her husband devoured before her eyes the thought of it overwhelmed her that he should die by order of the king was natural but that he should be buried thus yet what could she do to prevent it well if it cost her her life it should be prevented at the worst they could only kill and eat her also and now that nahoon and her father were gone being untroubled by any religious or spiritual hopes and fears she was not greatly concerned to keep her own breath in her  slipping through the hole in the tree nanea walked quietly towards the cannibalsnot knowing in the least what she should do when she reached them as she arrived in line with the fire this lack of programme came home to her mind forcibly and she paused to reflect just then one of the cannibals looked up to see a tall and stately figure wrapped in a white garment which as the flamelight flickered on it seemed now to advance from the dense background of shadow and now to recede into it the poor savage wretch was holding a stone knife in his teeth when he beheld her but it did not remain there long for opening his great jaws he uttered the most terrified and piercing yell that nanea had ever heard then the others saw her also and presently the forest was ringing with shrieks of fear for a few seconds the outcasts stood and gazed then they were gone this way and that bursting their path through the undergrowth like startled jackals the esemkofu of zulu tradition had been routed in their own haunted home by what they took to be a spirit  poor esemkofu they were but miserable and starving bushmen who driven into that place of ill omen many years ago had adopted this means the only one open to them to keep the life in their wretched bodies here at least they were unmolested and as there was little other food to be found amid that wilderness of trees they took what the river brought them when executions were few in the pool of doom times were hard for them indeedfor then they were driven to eat each other that is why there were no children  as their inarticulate outcry died away in the distance nanea ran forward to look at the body that lay on the ground and staggered back with a sigh of relief it was not nahoon but she recognised the face for that of one of the party of executioners how did he come here had nahoon killed him had nahoon escaped she could not tell and at the best it was improbable but still the sight of this dead soldier lit her heart with a faint ray of hope for how did he come to be dead if nahoon had no hand in his death she could not bear to leave him lying so near her hidingplace however therefore with no small toil she rolled the corpse back into the water which carried it swiftly away then she returned to the tree having first replenished the fire and awaited the light  at last it cameso much of it as ever penetrated this darksome denand nanea becoming aware that she was hungry descended from the tree to search for food all day long she searched finding nothing till towards sunset she remembered that on the outskirts of the forest there was a flat rock where it was the custom of those who had been in any way afflicted or who considered themselves or their belongings to be bewitched to place propitiatory offerings of food wherewith the esemkofu and amalhosi were supposed to satisfy their spiritual cravings urged by the pinch of starvation to this spot nanea journeyed rapidly and found to her joy that some neighbouring kraal had evidently been in recent trouble for the rock of offering was laden with cobs of corn gourds of milk porridge and even meat helping herself to as much as she could carry she returned to her lair where she drank of the milk and cooked meat and mealies at the fire then she crept back into the tree and slept  for nearly two months nanea lived thus in the forest since she could not venture out of itfearing lest she should be seized and for a second time taste of the judgment of the king in the forest at least she was safe for none dared enter there nor did the esemkofu give her further trouble once or twice she saw them but on each occasion they fled from her presenceseeking some distant retreat where they hid themselves or perished nor did food fail her for finding that it was taken the pious givers brought it in plenty to the rock of offering  but oh the life was dreadful and the gloom and loneliness coupled with her sorrows at times drove her almost to insanity still she lived on though often she desired to die for if her father was dead the corpse she had found was not the corpse of nahoon and in her heart there still shone that spark of home yet what she hoped for she could not tell    when philip hadden reached civilised regions he found that war was about to be declared between the queen and cetywayo king of the amazulu also that in the prevailing excitement his little adventure with the utrecht storekeeper had been overlooked or forgotten he was the owner of two good buckwaggons with spans of salted oxen and at that time vehicles were much in request to carry military stores for the columns which were to advance into zululand indeed the transport authorities were glad to pay £90 a month for the hire of each waggon and to guarantee the owners against all loss of cattle although he was not desirous of returning to zululand this bait proved too much for hadden who accordingly leased out his waggons to the commissariat together with his own services as conductor and interpreter  he was attached to no 3 column of the invading force which it may be remembered was under the immediate command of lord chelmsford and on the 20th of january 1879 he marched with it by the road that runs from rorkes drift to the indeni forest and encamped that night beneath the shadow of the steep and desolate mountain known as isandhlwana  that day also a great army of king cetywayos numbering twenty thousand men and more moved down from the upindo hill and camped upon the stony plain that lies a mile and a half to the east of isandhlwana no fires were lit and it lay there in utter silence for the warriors were sleeping on their spears  with that impi was the umcityu regiment three thousand five hundred strong at the first break of dawn the induna in command of the umcityu looked up from beneath the shelter of the black shield with which he had covered his body and through the thick mist he saw a great man standing before him clothed only in a moocha a gaunt wildeyed man who held a rough club in his hand when he was spoken to the man made no answer he only leaned upon his club looking from left to right along the dense array of innumerable shields  who is this silwana wild creature asked the induna of his captains wondering  the captains stared at the wanderer and one of them replied this is nahoonkazomba it is the son of zomba who not long ago held rank in this regiment of the umcityu his betrothed nanea daughter of umgona was killed together with her father by order of the black one and nahoon went mad with grief at the sight of it for the fire of heaven entered his brain and mad he has wandered ever since  what would you here nahoonkazomba asked the induna  then nahoon spoke slowly my regiment goes down to war against the white men give me a shield and a spear o captain of the king that i may fight with my regiment for i seek a face in the battle  so they gave him a shield and a spear for they dared not turn away one whose brain was alight with the fire of heaven    when the sun was high that day bullets began to fall among the ranks of the umcityu then the blackshielded blackplumed umcityu arose company by company and after them arose the whole vast zulu army breast and horns together and swept down in silence upon the doomed british camp a moving sheen of spears the bullets pattered on the shields the shells tore long lines through their array but they never halted or wavered forward on either side shot out the horns of armed men clasping the camp in an embrace of steel then as these began to close out burst the war cry of the zulus and with the roar of a torrent and the rush of a storm with a sound like the humming of a billion bees wave after wave the deep breast of the impi rolled down upon the white men with it went the blackshielded umcityu and with them went nahoon the son of zomba a bullet struck him in the side glancing from his ribs he did not heed a white man fell from his horse before him he did not stab for he sought but one face in the battle  he soughtand at last he found there among the waggons where the spears were busiest there standing by his horse and firing rapidly was black heart he who had given nanea his betrothed to death three soldiers stood between them one of them nahoon stabbed and two he brushed aside then he rushed straight at hadden  but the white man saw him come and even through the mask of his madness he knew nahoon again and terror took hold of him throwing away his empty rifle for his ammunition was spent he leaped upon his horse and drove his spurs into its flanks away it went among the carnage springing over the dead and bursting through the lines of shields and after it came nahoon running long and low with head stretched forward and trailing spear running as a hound runs when the buck is at view  haddens first plan was to head for rorkes drift but a glance to the left showed him that the masses of the undi barred that way so he fled straight on leaving his path to fortune in five minutes he was over a ridge and there was nothing of the battle to be seen in ten all sounds of it had died away for few guns were fired in the dread race to fugitives drift and the assegai makes no noise in some strange fashion even at this moment the contrast between the dreadful scene of blood and turmoil that he had left and the peaceful face of nature over which he was passing came home to his brain vividly here birds sang and cattle grazed here the sun shone undimmed by the smoke of cannon only high up in the blue and silent air long streams of vultures could be seen winging their way to the plain of isandhlwana  the ground was very rough and haddens horse began to tire he looked over his shoulderthere some two hundred yards behind came the zulu grim as death unswerving as fate he examined the pistol in his belt there was but one undischarged cartridge left all the rest had been fired and the pouch was empty well one bullet should be enough for one savage the question was should he stop and use it now no he might miss or fail to kill the man he was on horseback and his foe on foot surely he could tire him out  a while passed and they dashed through a little stream it seemed familiar to hadden yes that was the pool where he used to bathe when he was the guest of umgona the father of nanea and there on the knoll to his right were the huts or rather the remains of them for they had been burnt with fire what chance had brought him to this place he wondered then again he looked behind him at nahoon who seemed to read his thoughts for he shook his spear and pointed to the ruined kraal  on he went at speed for here the land was level and to his joy he lost sight of his pursuer but presently there came a mile of rocky ground and when it was past glancing back he saw that nahoon was once more in his old place his horses strength was almost spent but hadden spurred it forward blindly whither he knew not now he was travelling along a strip of turf and ahead of him he heard the music of a river while to his left rose a high bank presently the turf bent inwards and there not twenty yards away from him was a kaffir hut standing on the brink of a river he looked at it yes it was the hut of that accursed inyanga the bee and standing by the fence of it was none other than the bee herself at the sight of her the exhausted horse swerved violently stumbled and came to the ground where it lay panting hadden was thrown from the saddle but sprang to his feet unhurt  ah black heart is it you what news of the battle black heart cried the bee in a mocking voice  help me mother i am pursued he gasped  what of it black heart it is but by one tired man stand then and face him for now black heart and white heart are together again you will not then away to the forest and seek shelter among the dead who await you there tell me tell me was it the face of nanea that i saw beneath the waters a while ago good bear my greetings to her when you two meet in the house of the dead  hadden looked at the stream it was in flood he could not swim it so followed by the evil laugh of the prophetess he sped towards the forest after him came nahoon his tongue hanging from his jaws like the tongue of a wolf  now he was in the shadow of the forest but still he sped on following the course of the river till at length his breath failed and he halted on the further side of a little glade beyond which a great tree grew nahoon was more than a spears throw behind him therefore he had time to draw his pistol and make ready  halt nahoon he cried as once before he had cried i would speak with you  the zulu heard his voice and obeyed  listen said hadden we have run a long race and fought a long fight you and i and we are still alive both of us very soon if you come on one of us must be dead and it will be you nahoon for i am armed and as you know i can shoot straight what do you say  nahoon made no answer but stood still at the edge of the glade his wild and glowering eyes fixed on the white mans face and his breath coming in short gasps  will you let me go if i let you go hadden asked once more i know why you hate me but the past cannot be undone nor can the dead be brought to earth again  still nahoon made no answer and his silence seemed more fateful and more crushing than any speech no spoken accusation would have been so terrible in haddens ear he made no answer but lifting his assegai he stalked grimly toward his foe  when he was within five paces hadden covered him and fired nahoon sprang aside but the bullet struck him somewhere for his right arm dropped and the stabbing spear that he held was jerked from it harmlessly over the white mans head but still making no sound the zulu came on and gripped him by the throat with his left hand for a space they struggled terribly swaying to and fro but hadden was unhurt and fought with the fury of despair while nahoon had been twice wounded and there remained to him but one sound arm wherewith to strike presently forced to earth by the white mans iron strength the soldier was down nor could he rise again  now we will make an end muttered hadden savagely and he
