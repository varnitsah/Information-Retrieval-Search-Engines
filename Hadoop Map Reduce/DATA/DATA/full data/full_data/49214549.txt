               391     the  crown of wild olive  three lectures on  work traffic and war     preface   twenty years ago there was no lovelier piece of lowland scenery in south england nor any more pathetic in the world by its expression of sweet human character and life than that immediately bordering on the sources of the wandle and including the lower moors of addington and the villages of beddington and carshalton with all their pools and streams no clearer or diviner waters ever sang with constant lips of the hand which giveth rain from heaven no pastures ever lightened in spring time with more passionate blossoming no sweeter homes ever hallowed the heart of the passerby with their pride of peaceful gladnessfainhiddenyet fullconfessed the place remains or until a few months ago remained nearly unchanged in its larger features but with deliberate mind i say that i have never seen anything so ghastly in its inner tragic meaningnot in pisan maremmanot by campagna tombnot by the sandisles of the torcellan shoreas the slow stealing of aspects of reckless indolent animal neglect over the delicate sweetness of that english scene nor is any blasphemy or impietyany frantic saying or godless thoughtmore appalling to me using the best power of judgment i have to discern its sense and scope than the insolent defilings of those springs by the human herds that drink of them just where the welling of stainless water trembling and pure like a body of light enters the pool of carshalton cutting itself a radiant channel down to the gravel through warp of feathery weeds all waving which it traverses with its deep threads of clearness like the chalcedony in mossagate starred here and there with white grenouillette just in the very rush and murmur of the first spreading currents the human wretches of the place cast their street and house foulness heaps of dust and slime and broken shreds of old metal and rags of putrid clothes they having neither energy to cart it away nor decency enough to dig it into the ground thus shed into the stream to diffuse what venom of it will float and melt far away in all places where god meant those waters to bring joy and health and in a little pool behind some houses farther in the village where another spring rises the shattered stones of the well and of the little fretted channel which was long ago built and traced for it by gentler hands lie scattered each from each under a ragged bank of mortar and scoria and bricklayers refuse on one side which the clean water nevertheless chastises to purity but it cannot conquer the dead earth beyond and there circled and coiled under festering scum the stagnant edge of the pool effaces itself into a slope of black slime the accumulation of indolent years halfadozen men with one days work could cleanse those pools and trim the flowers about their banks and make every breath of summer air above them rich with cool balm and every glittering wave medicinal as if it ran troubled of angels from the porch of bethesda but that days work is never given nor will be nor will any joy be possible to heart of man for evermore about those wells of english waters  when i last left them i walked up slowly through the back streets of croydon from the old church to the hospital and just on the left before coming up to the crossing of the high street there was a new publichouse built and the front of it was built in so wise manner that a recess of two feet was left below its front windows between them and the streetpavementa recess too narrow for any possible use for even if it had been occupied by a seat as in old time it might have been everybody walking along the street would have fallen over the legs of the reposing wayfarers but by way of making this two feet depth of freehold land more expressive of the dignity of an establishment for the sale of spirituous liquors it was fenced from the pavement by an imposing iron railing having four or five spearheads to the yard of it and six feet high containing as much iron and ironwork indeed as could well be put into the space and by this stately arrangement the little piece of dead ground within between wall and street became a protective receptacle of refuse cigar ends and oyster shells and the like such as an openhanded english streetpopulace habitually scatters from its presence and was thus left unsweepable by any ordinary methods now the iron bars which uselessly or in great degree worse than uselessly enclosed this bit of ground and made it pestilent represented a quantity of work which would have cleansed the carshalton pools three times overof work partly cramped and deadly in the mine partly fierce1 and exhaustive at the furnace partly foolish and sedentary of illtaught students making bad designs work from the beginning to the last fruits of it and in all the branches of it venomous deathful and miserable now how did it come to pass that this work was done instead of the other that the strength and life of the english operative were spent in defiling ground instead of redeeming it and in producing an entirely in that place valueless piece of metal which can neither be eaten nor breathed instead of medicinal fresh air and pure water  there is but one reason for it and at present a conclusive onethat the capitalist can charge percentage on the work in the one case and cannot in the other if having certain funds for supporting labour at my disposal i pay men merely to keep my ground in order my money is in that function spent once for all but if i pay them to dig iron out of my ground and work it and sell it i can charge rent for the ground and percentage both on the manufacture and the sale and make my capital profitable in these three byeways the greater part of the profitable investment of capital in the present day is in operations of this kind in which the public is persuaded to buy something of no use to it on production or sale of which the capitalist may charge percentage the said public remaining all the while under the persuasion that the percentages thus obtained are real national gains whereas they are merely filchings out of partially light pockets to swell heavy ones  thus the croydon publican buys the iron railing to make himself more conspicuous to drunkards the publichousekeeper on the other side of the way presently buys another railing to outrail him with both are as to their relative attractiveness to customers of taste just where they were before but they have lost the price of the railings which they must either themselves finally lose or make their aforesaid customers of taste pay by raising the price of their beer or adulterating it either the publicans or their customers are thus poorer by precisely what the capitalist has gained and the value of the work itself meantime has been lost to the nation the iron bars in that form and place being wholly useless it is this mode of taxation of the poor by the rich which is referred to in the text page 31 in comparing the modern acquisitive power of capital with that of the lance and sword the only difference being that the levy of black mail in old times was by force and is now by cozening the old rider and reiver frankly quartered himself on the publican for the night the modern one merely makes his lance into an iron spike and persuades his host to buy it one comes as an open robber the other as a cheating pedlar but the result to the injured persons pocket is absolutely the same of course many useful industries mingle with and disguise the useless ones and in the habits of energy aroused by the struggle there is a certain direct good it is far better to spend four thousand pounds in making a good gun and then to blow it to pieces than to pass life in idleness only do not let it be called political economy there is also a confused notion in the minds of many persons that the gathering of the property of the poor into the hands of the rich does no ultimate harm since in whosesoever hands it may be it must be spent at last and thus they think return to the poor again this fallacy has been again and again exposed but grant the plea true and the same apology may of course be made for black mail or any other form of robbery it might be though practically it never is as advantageous for the nation that the robber should have the spending of the money he extorts as that the person robbed should have spent it but this is no excuse for the theft if i were to put a turnpike on the road where it passes my own gate and endeavour to exact a shilling from every passenger the public would soon do away with my gate without listening to any plea on my part that it was as advantageous to them in the end that i should spend their shillings as that they themselves should but if instead of outfacing them with a turnpike i can only persuade them to come in and buy stones or old iron or any other useless thing out of my ground i may rob them to the same extent and be moreover thanked as a public benefactor and promoter of commercial prosperity and this main question for the poor of englandfor the poor of all countriesis wholly omitted in every common treatise on the subject of wealth even by the labourers themselves the operation of capital is regarded only in its effect on their immediate interests never in the far more terrific power of its appointment of the kind and the object of labour it matters little ultimately how much a labourer is paid for making anything but it matters fearfully what the thing is which he is compelled to make if his labour is so ordered as to produce food and fresh air and fresh water no matter that his wages are lowthe food and fresh air and water will be at last there and he will at last get them but if he is paid to destroy food and fresh air or to produce iron bars instead of themthe food and air will finally not be there and he will not get them to his great and final inconvenience so that conclusively in political as in household economy the great question is not so much what money you have in your pocket as what you will buy with it and do with it  i have been long accustomed as all men engaged in work of investigation must be to hear my statements laughed at for years before they are examined or believed and i am generally content to wait the publics time but it has not been without displeased surprise that i have found myself totally unable as yet by any repetition or illustration to force this plain thought into my readers headsthat the wealth of nations as of men consists in substance not in ciphers and that the real good of all work and of all commerce depends on the final worth of the thing you make or get by it this is a practical enough statement one would think but the english public has been so possessed by its modern school of economists with the notion that business is always good whether it be busy in mischief or in benefit and that buying and selling are always salutary whatever the intrinsic worth of what you buy or sellthat it seems impossible to gain so much as a patient hearing for any inquiry respecting the substantial result of our eager modern labours i have never felt more checked by the sense of this impossibility than in arranging the heads of the following three lectures which though delivered at considerable intervals of time and in different places were not prepared without reference to each other their connection would however have been made far more distinct if i had not been prevented by what i feel to be another great difficulty in addressing english audiences from enforcing with any decision the common and to me the most important part of their subjects i chiefly desired as i have just said to question my hearersoperatives merchants and soldiers as to the ultimate meaning of the business they had in hand and to know from them what they expected or intended their manufacture to come to their selling to come to and their killing to come to that appeared the first point needing determination before i could speak to them with any real utility or effect you craftsmensalesmenswordsmendo but tell me clearly what you want then if i can say anything to help you i will and if not i will account to you as i best may for my inability but in order to put this question into any terms one had first of all to face the difficulty just spoken ofto me for the present insuperablethe difficulty of knowing whether to address ones audience as believing or not believing in any other world than this for if you address any average modern english company as believing in an eternal life and endeavour to draw any conclusions from this assumed belief as to their present business they will forthwith tell you that what you say is very beautiful but it is not practical if on the contrary you frankly address them as unbelievers in eternal life and try to draw any consequences from that unbeliefthey immediately hold you for an accursed person and shake off the dust from their feet at you and the more i thought over what i had got to say the less i found i could say it without some reference to this intangible or intractable part of the subject it made all the difference in asserting any principle of war whether one assumed that a discharge of artillery would merely knead down a certain quantity of red clay into a level line as in a brick field or whether out of every separately christiannamed portion of the ruinous heap there went out into the smoke and deadfallen air of battle some astonished condition of soul unwillingly released it made all the difference in speaking of the possible range of commerce whether one assumed that all bargains related only to visible propertyor whether property for the present invisible but nevertheless real was elsewhere purchasable on other terms it made all the difference in addressing a body of men subject to considerable hardship and having to find some way out of itwhether one could confidentially say to them my friendsyou have only to die and all will be right or whether one had any secret misgiving that such advice was more blessed to him that gave than to him that took it and therefore the deliberate reader will find throughout these lectures a hesitation in driving points home and a pausing short of conclusions which he will feel i would fain have come to hesitation which arises wholly from this uncertainty of my hearers temper for i do not now speak nor have i ever spoken since the time of my first forward youth in any proselyting temper as desiring to persuade any one of what in such matters i thought myself but whomsoever i venture to address i take for the time his creed as i find it and endeavour to push it into such vital fruit as it seems capable of thus it is a creed with a great part of the existing english people that they are in possession of a book which tells them straight from the lips of god all they ought to do and need to know i have read that book with as much care as most of them for some forty years and am thankful that on those who trust it i can press its pleadings my endeavour has been uniformly to make them trust it more deeply than they do trust it not in their own favourite verses only but in the sum of all trust it not as a fetish or talisman which they are to be saved by daily repetitions of but as a captains order to be heard and obeyed at their peril i was always encouraged by supposing my hearers to hold such belief to these if to any i once had hope of addressing with acceptance words which insisted on the guilt of pride and the futility of avarice from these if from any i once expected ratification of a political economy which asserted that the life was more than the meat and the body than raiment and these it once seemed to me i might ask without accusation or fanaticism not merely in doctrine of the lips but in the bestowal of their hearts treasure to separate themselves from the crowd of whom it is written after all these things do the gentiles seek  it cannot however be assumed with any semblance of reason that a general audience is now wholly or even in majority composed of these religious persons a large portion must always consist of men who admit no such creed or who at least are inaccessible to appeals founded on it and as with the socalled christian i desired to plead for honest declaration and fulfilment of his belief in lifewith the socalled infidel i desired to plead for an honest declaration and fulfilment of his belief in death the dilemma is inevitable men must either hereafter live or hereafter die fate may be bravely met and conduct wisely ordered on either expectation but never in hesitation between ungrasped hope and unconfronted fear we usually believe in immortality so far as to avoid preparation for death and in mortality so far as to avoid preparation for anything after death whereas a wise man will at least hold himself prepared for one or other of two events of which one or other is inevitable and will have all things in order for his sleep or in readiness for his awakening  nor have we any right to call it an ignoble judgment if he determine to put them in order as for sleep a brave belief in life is indeed an enviable state of mind but as far as i can discern an unusual one i know few christians so convinced of the splendour of the rooms in their fathers house as to be happier when their friends are called to those mansions than they would have been if the queen had sent for them to live at court nor has the churchs most ardent desire to depart and be with christ ever cured it of the singular habit of putting on mourning for every person summoned to such departure on the contrary a brave belief in death has been assuredly held by many not ignoble persons and it is a sign of the last depravity in the church itself when it assumes that such a belief is inconsistent with either purity of character or energy of hand the shortness of life is not to any rational person a conclusive reason for wasting the space of it which may be granted him nor does the anticipation of death tomorrow suggest to any one but a drunkard the expediency of drunkenness today to teach that there is no device in the grave may indeed make the deviceless person more contented in his dulness but it will make the deviser only more earnest in devising nor is human conduct likely in every case to be purer under the conviction that all its evil may in a moment be pardoned and all its wrongdoing in a moment redeemed and that the sigh of repentance which purges the guilt of the past will waft the soul into a felicity which forgets its painthan it may be under the sterner and to many not unwise minds more probable apprehension that what a man soweth that shall he also reapor others reapwhen he the living seed of pestilence walketh no more in darkness but lies down therein  but to men whose feebleness of sight or bitterness of soul or the offence given by the conduct of those who claim higher hope may have rendered this painful creed the only possible one there is an appeal to be made more secure in its ground than any which can be addressed to happier persons i would fain if i might offencelessly have spoken to them as if none others heard and have said thus hear me you dying men who will soon be deaf for ever for these others at your right hand and your left who look forward to a state of infinite existence in which all their errors will be overruled and all their faults forgiven for these who stained and blackened in the battle smoke of mortality have but to dip themselves for an instant in the font of death and to rise renewed of plumage as a dove that is covered with silver and her feathers like gold for these indeed it may be permissible to waste their numbered moments through faith in a future of innumerable hours to these in their weakness it may be conceded that they should tamper with sin which can only bring forth fruit of righteousness and profit by the iniquity which one day will be remembered no more in them it may be no sign of hardness of heart to neglect the poor over whom they know their master is watching and to leave those to perish temporarily who cannot perish eternally but for you there is no such hope and therefore no such excuse this fate which you ordain for the wretched you believe to be all their inheritance you may crush them before the moth and they will never rise to rebuke youtheir breath which fails for lack of food once expiring will never be recalled to whisper against you a word of accusingthey and you as you think shall lie down together in the dust and the worms cover youand for them there shall be no consolation and on you no vengeanceonly the question murmured above your grave who shall repay him what he hath done is it therefore easier for you in your heart to inflict the sorrow for which there is no remedy will you take wantonly this little all of his life from your poor brother and make his brief hours long to him with pain will you be readier to the injustice which can never be redressed and niggardly of mercy which you can bestow but once and which refusing you refuse for ever i think better of you even of the most selfish than that you would do this well understood and for yourselves it seems to me the question becomes not less grave in these curt limits if your life were but a fever fitthe madness of a night whose follies were all to be forgotten in the dawn it might matter little how you fretted away the sickly hourswhat toys you snatched at or let fallwhat visions you followed wistfully with the deceived eyes of sleepless phrenzy is the earth only an hospital play if you care to play on the floor of the hospital dens knit its straw into what crowns please you gather the dust of it for treasure and die rich in that clutching at the black motes in the air with your dying handsand yet it may be well with you but if this life be no dream and the world no hospital if all the peace and power and joy you can ever win must be won now and all fruit of victory gathered here or neverwill you still throughout the puny totality of your life weary yourselves in the fire for vanity if there is no rest which remaineth for you is there none you might presently take was this grass of the earth made green for your shroud only not for your bed and can you never lie down upon it but only under it the heathen to whose creed you have returned thought not so they knew that life brought its contest but they expected from it also the crown of all contest no proud one no jewelled circlet flaming through heaven above the height of the unmerited throne only some few leaves of wild olive cool to the tired brow through a few years of peace it should have been of gold they thought but jupiter was poor this was the best the god could give them seeking a greater than this they had known it a mockery not in war not in wealth not in tyranny was there any happiness to be found for themonly in kindly peace fruitful and free the wreath was to be of wild olive mark youthe tree that grows carelessly tufting the rocks with no vivid bloom no verdure of branch only with soft snow of blossom and scarcely fulfilled fruit mixed with grey leaf and thornset stem no fastening of diadem for you but with such sharp embroidery but this such as it is you may win while yet you live type of grey honour and sweet rest2 freeheartedness and graciousness and undisturbed trust and requited love and the sight of the peace of others and the ministry to their painthese and the blue sky above you and the sweet waters and flowers of the earth beneath and mysteries and presences innumerable of living thingsthese may yet be here your riches untormenting and divine serviceable for the life that now is nor it may be without promise of that which is to come  footnotes  1 a fearful occurrence took place a few days since near wolverhampton thomas snape aged nineteen was on duty as the keeper of a blast furnace at deepfield assisted by john gardner aged eighteen and joseph swift aged thirtyseven the furnace contained four tons of molten iron and an equal amount of cinders and ought to have been run out at 730 pm but snape and his mates engaged in talking and drinking neglected their duty and in the meantime the iron rose in the furnace until it reached a pipe wherein water was contained just as the men had stripped and were proceeding to tap the furnace the water in the pipe converted into steam burst down its front and let loose on them the molten metal which instantaneously consumed gardner snape terribly burnt and mad with pain leaped into the canal and then ran home and fell dead on the threshold swift survived to reach the hospital where he died too  in further illustration of this matter i beg the reader to look at the article on the decay of the english race in the pallmall gazette of april 17 of this year and at the articles on the report of the thames commission in any journals of the same date  2 greek melitoessa aethl√¥n g eneken     the crown of wild olive     lecture i  work  delivered before the working mens institute at camberwell   my friendsi have not come among you tonight to endeavour to give you an entertaining lecture but to tell you a few plain facts and ask you some plain but necessary questions i have seen and known too much of the struggle for life among our labouring population to feel at ease even under any circumstances in inviting them to dwell on the trivialities of my own studies but much more as i meet tonight for the first time the members of a working institute established in the district in which i have passed the greater part of my life i am desirous that we should at once understand each other on graver matters i would fain tell you with what feelings and with what hope i regard this institution as one of many such now happily established throughout england as well as in other countriesinstitutions which are preparing the way for a great change in all the circumstances of industrial life but of which the success must wholly depend upon our clearly understanding the circumstances and necessary limits of this change no teacher can truly promote the cause of education until he knows the conditions of the life for which that education is to prepare his pupil and the fact that he is called upon to address you nominally as a working class must compel him if he is in any wise earnest or thoughtful to inquire in the outset on what you yourselves suppose this class distinction has been founded in the past and must be founded in the future the manner of the amusement and the matter of the teaching which any of us can offer you must depend wholly on our first understanding from you whether you think the distinction heretofore drawn between working men and others is truly or falsely founded do you accept it as it stands do you wish it to be modified or do you think the object of education is to efface it and make us forget it for ever  let me make myself more distinctly understood we call thisyou and ia working mens institute and our college in london a working mens college now how do you consider that these several institutes differ or ought to differ from idle mens institutes and idle mens colleges or by what other word than idle shall i distinguish those whom the happiest and wisest of working men do not object to call the upper classes are there really upper classesare there lower how much should they always be elevated how much always depressed and gentlemen and ladiesi pray those of you who are here to forgive me the offence there may be in what i am going to say it is not i who wish to say it bitter voices say it voices of battle and of famine through all the world which must be heard some day whoever keeps silence neither is it to you specially that i say it i am sure that most now present know their duties of kindness and fulfil them better perhaps than i do mine but i speak to you as representing your whole class which errs i know chiefly by thoughtlessness but not therefore the less terribly wilful error is limited by the will but what limit is there to that of which we are unconscious  bear with me therefore while i turn to these workmen and ask them also as representing a great multitude what they think the upper classes are and ought to be in relation to them answer you workmen who are here as you would among yourselves frankly and tell me how you would have me call those classes am i to call themwould you think me right in calling themthe idle classes i think you would feel somewhat uneasy and as if i were not treating my subject honestly or speaking from my heart if i went on under the supposition that all rich people were idle you would be both unjust and unwise if you allowed me to say thatnot less unjust than the rich people who say that all the poor are idle and will never work if they can help it or more than they can help  for indeed the fact is that there are idle poor and idle rich and there are busy poor and busy rich many a beggar is as lazy as if he had ten thousand a year and many a man of large fortune is busier than his errandboy and never would think of stopping in the street to play marbles so that in a large view the distinction between workers and idlers as between knaves and honest men runs through the very heart and innermost economies of men of all ranks and in all positions there is a working classstrong and happyamong both rich and poor there is an idle classweak wicked and miserableamong both rich and poor and the worst of the misunderstandings arising between the two orders come of the unlucky fact that the wise of one class habitually contemplate the foolish of the other if the busy rich people watched and rebuked the idle rich people all would be right and if the busy poor people watched and rebuked the idle poor people all would be right but each class has a tendency to look for the faults of the other a hardworking man of property is particularly offended by an idle beggar and an orderly but poor workman is naturally intolerant of the licentious luxury of the rich and what is severe judgment in the minds of the just men of either class becomes fierce enmity in the unjustbut among the unjust only none but the dissolute among the poor look upon the rich as their natural enemies or desire to pillage their houses and divide their property none but the dissolute among the rich speak in opprobrious terms of the vices and follies of the poor  there is then no class distinction between idle and industrious people and i am going tonight to speak only of the industrious the idle people we will put out of our thoughts at oncethey are mere nuisanceswhat ought to be done with them well talk of at another time but there are class distinctions among the industrious themselves tremendous distinctions which rise and fall to every degree in the infinite thermometer of human pain and of human powerdistinctions of high and low of lost and won to the whole reach of mans soul and body  these separations we will study and the laws of them among energetic men only who whether they work or whether they play put their strength into the work and their strength into the game being in the full sense of the word industrious one way or anotherwith a purpose or without and these distinctions are mainly four  i between those who work and those who play  ii between those who produce the means of life and those who consume them  iii between those who work with the head and those who work with the hand  iv between those who work wisely and who work foolishly  for easier memory let us say we are going to oppose in our examination      i   work to play     ii  production to consumption     iii head to hand and     iv  sense to nonsense  i first then of the distinction between the classes who work and the classes who play of course we must agree upon a definition of these termswork and playbefore going farther now roughly not with vain subtlety of definition but for plain use of the words play is an exertion of body or mind made to please ourselves and with no determined end and work is a thing done because it ought to be done and with a determined end you play as you call it at cricket for instance that is as hard work as anything else but it amuses you and it has no result but the amusement if it were done as an ordered form of exercise for healths sake it would become work directly so in like manner whatever we do to please ourselves and only for the sake of the pleasure not for an ultimate object is play the pleasing thing not the useful thing play may be useful in a secondary sense nothing is indeed more useful or necessary but the use of it depends on its being spontaneous  let us then enquire together what sort of games the playing class in england spend their lives in playing at  the first of all english games is making money that is an allabsorbing game and we knock each other down oftener in playing at that than at football or any other roughest sport and it is absolutely without purpose no one who engages heartily in that game ever knows why ask a great moneymaker what he wants to do with his moneyhe never knows he doesnt make it to do anything with it he gets it only that he may get it what will you make of what you have got you ask well ill get more he says just as at cricket you get more runs theres no use in the runs but to get more of them than other people is the game and theres no use in the money but to have more of it than other people is the game so all that great foul city of london thererattling growling smoking stinkinga ghastly heap of fermenting brickwork pouring out poison at every poreyou fancy it is a city of work not a street of it it is a great city of play very nasty play and very hard play but still play it is only lords cricket ground without the turfa huge billiard table without the cloth and with pockets as deep as the bottomless pit but mainly a billiard table after all  well the first great english game is this playing at counters it differs from the rest in that it appears always to be producing money while every other game is expensive but it does not always produce money theres a great difference between winning money and making it a great difference between getting it out of another mans pocket into ours or filling both collecting money is by no means the same thing as making it the taxgatherers house is not the mint and much of the apparent gain so called in commerce is only a form of taxation on carriage or exchange  our next great english game however hunting and shooting is costly altogether and how much we are fined for it annually in land horses gamekeepers and game laws and all else that accompanies that beautiful and special english game i will not endeavour to count now but note only that except for exercise this is not merely a useless game but a deadly one to all connected with it for through horseracing you get every form of what the higher classes everywhere call play in distinction from all other plays that isgambling by no means a beneficial or recreative game and through gamepreserving you get also some curious laying out of ground that beautiful arrangement of dwellinghouse for man and beast by which we have grouse and blackcockso many brace to the acre and men and womenso many brace to the garret i often wonder what the angelic builders and surveyorsthe angelic builders who build the many mansions up above there and the angelic surveyors who measured that foursquare city with their measuring reedsi wonder what they think or are supposed to think of the laying out of ground by this nation which has set itself as it seems literally to accomplish word for word or rather fact for word in the persons of those poor whom its master left to represent him what that master said of himselfthat foxes and birds had homes but he none  then next to the gentlemens game of hunting we must put the ladies game of dressing it is not the cheapest of games i saw a brooch at a jewellers in bond street a fortnight ago not an inch wide and without any singular jewel in it yet worth 3000l and i wish i could tell you what this play costs altogether in england france and russia annually but it is a pretty game and on certain terms i like it nay i dont see it played quite as much as i would fain have it you ladies like to lead the fashionby all means lead itlead it thoroughly lead it far enough dress yourselves nicely and dress everybody else nicely lead the fashions for the poor first make them look well and you yourselves will look in ways of which you have now no conception all the better the fashions you have set for some time among your peasantry are not pretty ones their doublets are too irregularly slashed and the wind blows too frankly through them  then there are other games wild enough as i could show you if i had time  theres playing at literature and playing at artvery different both from working at literature or working at art but ive no time to speak of these i pass to the greatest of allthe play of plays the great gentlemens game which ladies like them best to play atthe game of war it is entrancingly pleasant to the imagination the facts of it not always so pleasant we dress for it however more finely than for any other sport and go out to it not merely in scarlet as to hunt but in scarlet and gold and all manner of fine colours of course we could fight better in grey and without feathers but all nations have agreed that it is good to be well dressed at this play then the bats and balls are very costly our english and french bats with the balls and wickets even those which we dont make any use of costing i suppose now about fifteen millions of money annually to each nation all of which you know is paid for by hard labourers work in the furrow and furnace a costly gamenot to speak of its consequences i will say at present nothing of these the mere immediate cost of all these plays is what i want you to consider they all cost deadly work somewhere as many of us know too well the jewelcutter whose sight fails over the diamonds the weaver whose arm fails over the web the ironforger whose breath fails before the furnacethey know what work isthey who have all the work and none of the play except a kind they have named for themselves down in the black north country where play means being laid up by sickness it is a pretty example for philologists of varying dialect this change in the sense of the word play as used in the black country of birmingham and the red and black country of baden baden yes gentlemen and gentlewomen of england who think one moment unamused a misery not made for feeble man this is what you have brought the word play to mean in the heart of merry england you may have your fluting and piping but there are sad children sitting in the marketplace who indeed cannot say to you we have piped unto you and ye have not danced but eternally shall say to you we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented  this then is the first distinction between the upper and lower classes and this is one which is by no means necessary which indeed must in process of good time be by all honest mens consent abolished men will be taught that an existence of play sustained by the blood of other creatures is a good existence for gnats and sucking fish but not for men that neither days nor lives can be made holy by doing nothing in them that the best prayer at the beginning of a day is that we may not lose its moments and the best grace before meat the consciousness that we have justly earned our dinner and when we have this much of plain christianity preached to us again and enough respect for what we regard as inspiration as not to think that son go work today in my vineyard means fool go play today in my vineyard we shall all be workers in one way or another and this much at least of the distinction between upper and lower forgotten  ii i pass then to our second distinction between the rich and poor between dives and lazarusdistinction which exists more sternly i suppose in this day than ever in the world pagan or christian till now i will put it sharply before you to begin with merely by reading two paragraphs which i cut from two papers that lay on my breakfast table on the same morning the 25th of november 1864 the piece about the rich russian at paris is commonplace enough and stupid besides for fifteen francs12s 6dis nothing for a rich man to give for a couple of peaches out of season still the two paragraphs printed on the same day are worth putting side by side  such a man is now here he is a russian and with your permission we will call him count teufelskine in dress he is sublime art is considered in that toilet the harmony of colour respected the chiar oscuro evident in wellselected contrast in manners he is dignifiednay perhaps apathetic nothing disturbs the placid serenity of that calm exterior one day our friend breakfasted chez bignon when the bill came he read two peaches 15f he paid peaches scarce i presume was his sole remark no sir replied the waiter but teufelskines are telegraph november 25 1864  yesterday morning at eight oclock a woman passing a dung heap in the stone yard near the recentlyerected almshouses in shadwell gap high street shadwell called the attention of a thames policeconstable to a man in a sitting position on the dung heap and said she was afraid he was dead her fears proved to be true the wretched creature appeared to have been dead several hours he had perished of cold and wet and the rain had been beating down on him all night the deceased was a bonepicker he was in the lowest stage of poverty poorly clad and halfstarved the police had frequently driven him away from the stone yard between sunset and sunrise and told him to go home he selected a most desolate spot for his wretched death a penny and some bones were found in his pockets the deceased was between fifty and sixty years of age inspector roberts of the k division has given directions for inquiries to be made at the lodginghouses respecting the deceased to ascertain his identity if possiblemorning post november 25 1864  you have the separation thus in brief compass and i want you to take notice of the a penny and some bones were found in his pockets and to compare it with this third statement from the telegraph of january 16th of this year  again the dietary scale for adult and juvenile paupers was drawn up by the most conspicuous political economists in england it is low in quantity but it is sufficient to support nature yet within ten years of the passing of the poor law act we heard of the paupers in the andover union gnawing the scraps of putrid flesh and sucking the marrow from the bones of horses which they were employed to crush  you see my reason for thinking that our lazarus of christianity has some advantage over the jewish one jewish lazarus expected or at least prayed to be fed with crumbs from the rich mans table but our lazarus is fed with crumbs from the dogs table  now this distinction between rich and poor rests on two bases within its proper limits on a basis which is lawful and everlastingly necessary beyond them on a basis unlawful and everlastingly corrupting the framework of society the lawful basis of wealth is that a man who works should be paid the fair value of his work and that if he does not choose to spend it today he should have free leave to keep it and spend it tomorrow thus an industrious man working daily and laying by daily attains at last the possession of an accumulated sum of wealth to which he has absolute right the idle person who will not work and the wasteful person who lays nothing by at the end of the same time will be doubly poorpoor in possession and dissolute in moral habit and he will then naturally covet the money which the other has saved and if he is then allowed to attack the other and rob him of his wellearned wealth there is no more any motive for saving or any reward for good conduct and all society is thereupon dissolved or exists only in systems of rapine therefore the first necessity of social life is the clearness of national conscience in enforcing the lawthat he should keep who has justly earned  that law i say is the proper basis of distinction between rich and poor but there is also a false basis of distinction namely the power held over those who earn wealth by those who levy or exact it there will be always a number of men who would fain set themselves to the accumulation of wealth as the sole object of their lives necessarily that class of men is an uneducated class inferior in intellect and more or less cowardly it is physically impossible for a welleducated intellectual or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts as physically impossible as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them all healthy people like their dinners but their dinner is not the main object of their lives so all healthily minded people like making moneyought to like it and to enjoy the sensation of winning it but the main object of their life is not money it is something better than money a good soldier for instance mainly wishes to do his fighting well he is glad of his payvery properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without itstill his main notion of life is to win battles not to be paid for winning them so of clergymen they like pewrents and baptismal fees of course but yet if they are brave and well educated the pewrent is not the sole object of their lives and the baptismal fee is not the sole purpose of the baptism the clergymans object is essentially to baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching so of doctors they like fees no doubtought to like them yet if they are brave and well educated the entire object of their lives is not fees they on the whole desire to cure the sick andif they are good doctors and the choice were fairly put to themwould rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it and so with all other brave and rightly trained men their work is first their fee secondvery important always but still second but in every nation as i said there are a vast class who are illeducated cowardly and more or less stupid and with these people just as certainly the fee is first and the work second as with brave people the work is first and the fee second and this is no small distinction it is the whole distinction in a man distinction between life and death in him between heaven and hell for him you cannot serve two mastersyou must serve one or other if your work is first with you and your fee second work is your master and the lord of work who is god but if your fee is first with you and your work second fee is your master and the lord of fee who is the devil and not only the devil but the lowest of devilsthe least erected fiend that fell so there you have it in brief terms work firstyou are gods servants fee firstyou are the fiends and it makes a difference now and ever believe me whether you serve him who has on his vesture and thigh written king of kings and whose service is perfect freedom or him on whose vesture and thigh the name is written slave of slaves and whose service is perfect slavery  however in every nation there are and must always be a certain number of these fiends servants who have it principally for the object of their lives to make money they are always as i said more or less stupid and cannot conceive of anything else so nice as money stupidity is always the basis of the judas bargain we do great injustice to iscariot in thinking him wicked above all common wickedness he was only a common moneylover and like all moneylovers didnt understand christcouldnt make out the worth of him or meaning of him he didnt want him to be killed he was horrorstruck when he found that christ would be killed threw his money away instantly and hanged himself how many of our present moneyseekers think you would have the grace to hang themselves whoever was killed but judas was a common selfish muddleheaded pilfering fellow his hand always in the bag of the poor not caring for them he didnt understand christyet believed in him much more than most of us do had seen him do miracles thought he was quite strong enough to shift for himself and he judas might as well make his own little byeperquisites out of the affair christ would come out of it well enough and he have his thirty pieces now that is the moneyseekers idea all over the world he doesnt hate christ but cant understand himdoesnt care for himsees no good in that benevolent business makes his own little job out of it at all events come what will and thus out of every mass of men you have a certain number of bagmenyour feefirst men whose main object is to make money and they do make itmake it in all sorts of unfair ways chiefly by the weight and force of money itself or what is called the power of capital that is to say the power which money once obtained has over the labour of the poor so that the capitalist can take all its produce to himself except the labourers food that is the modern judass way of carrying the bag and bearing what is put therein  nay but it is asked how is that an unfair advantage has not the man who has worked for the money a right to use it as he best can no in this respect money is now exactly what mountain promontories over public roads were in old times the barons fought for them fairlythe strongest and cunningest got them then fortified them and made everyone who passed below pay toll well capital now is exactly what crags were then men fight fairly we will at least grant so much though it is more than we ought for their money but once having got it the fortified millionaire can make everybody who passes below pay toll to his million and build another tower of his money castle and i can tell you the poor vagrants by the roadside suffer now quite as much from the bagbaron as ever they did from the cragbaron bags and crags have just the same result on rags i have not time however tonight to show you in how many ways the power of capital is unjust but this one great principle i have to assertyou will find it quite indisputably truethat whenever money is the principal object of life with either man or nation it is both got ill and spent ill and does harm both in the getting and spending but when it is not the principal object it and all other things will be well got and well spent and here is the test with every man of whether money is the principal object with him or not if in midlife he could pause and say now i have enough to live upon ill live upon it and having well earned it i will also well spend it and go out of the world poor as i came into it then money is not principal with him but if having enough to live upon in the manner befitting his character and rank he still wants to make more and to die rich then money is the principal object with him and it becomes a curse to himself and generally to those who spend it after him for you know it must be spent some day the only question is whether the man who makes it shall spend it or some one else and generally it is better for the maker to spend it for he will know best its value and use this is the true law of life and if a man does not choose thus to spend his money he must either hoard it or lend it and the worst thing he can generally do is to lend it for borrowers are nearly always illspenders and it is with lent money that all evil is mainly done and all unjust war protracted  for observe what the real fact is respecting loans to foreign military governments and how strange it is if your little boy came to you to ask for money to spend in squibs and crackers you would think twice before you gave it him and you would have some idea that it was wasted when you saw it fly off in fireworks even though he did no mischief with it but the russian children and austrian children come to you borrowing money not to spend in innocent squibs but in cartridges and bayonets to attack you in india with and to keep down all noble life in italy with and to murder polish women and children with and that you will give at once because they pay you interest for it now in order to pay you that interest they must tax every working peasant in their dominions and on that work you live you therefore at once rob the austrian peasant assassinate or banish the polish peasant and you live on the produce of the theft and the bribe for the assassination that is the broad factthat is the practical meaning of your foreign loans and of most large interest of money and then you quarrel with bishop colenso forsooth as if he denied the bible and you believed it though wretches as you are every deliberate act of your lives is a new defiance of its primary orders and as if for most of the rich men of england at this moment it were not indeed to be desired as the best thing at least for them that the bible should not be true since against them these words are written in it the rust of your gold and silver shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire   iii i pass now to our third condition of separation between the men who work with the hand and those who work with the head  and here we have at last an inevitable distinction there must be work done by the arms or none of us could live there must be work done by the brains or the life we get would not be worth having and the same men cannot do both there is rough work to be done and rough men must do it there is gentle work to be done and gentlemen must do it and it is physically impossible that one class should do or divide the work of the other and it is of no use to try to conceal this sorrowful fact by fine words and to talk to the workman about the honourableness of manual labour and the dignity of humanity that is a grand old proverb of sancho panzas fine words butter no parsnips and i can tell you that all over england just now you workmen are buying a great deal too much butter at that dairy rough work honourable or not takes the life out of us and the man who has been heaving clay out of a ditch all day or driving an express train against the north wind all night or holding a colliers helm in a gale on a leeshore or whirling white hot iron at a furnace mouth that man is not the same at the end of his day or night as one who has been sitting in a quiet room with everything comfortable about him reading books or classing butterflies or painting pictures if it is any comfort to you to be told that the rough work is the more honourable of the two i should be sorry to take that much of consolation from you and in some sense i need not the rough work is at all events real honest and generally though not always useful while the fine work is a great deal of it foolish and false as well as fine and therefore dishonourable but when both kinds are equally well and worthily done the heads is the noble work and the hands the ignoble and of all hand work whatsoever necessary for the maintenance of life those old words in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread indicate that the inherent nature of it is one of calamity and that the ground cursed for our sake casts also some shadow of degradation into our contest with its thorn and its thistle so that all nations have held their days honourable or holy and constituted them holydays or holidays by making them days of rest and the promise which among all our distant hopes seems to cast the chief brightness over death is that blessing of the dead who die in the lord that they rest from their labours and their works do follow them  and thus the perpetual question and contest must arise who is to do this rough work and how is the worker of it to be comforted redeemed and rewarded and what kind of play should he have and what rest in this world sometimes as well as in the next well my good working friends these questions will take a little time to answer yet they must be answered all good men are occupied with them and all honest thinkers theres grand head work doing about them but much must be discovered and much attempted in vain before anything decisive can be told you only note these few particulars which are already sure  as to the distribution of the hard work none of us or very few of us do either hard or soft work because we think we ought but because we have chanced to fall into the way of it and cannot help ourselves now nobody does anything well that they cannot help doing work is only done well when it is done with a will and no man has a thoroughly sound will unless he knows he is doing what he should and is in his place and depend upon it all work must be done at last not in a disorderly scrambling doggish way but in an ordered soldierly human waya lawful way men are enlisted for the labour that killsthe labour of war they are counted trained fed dressed and praised for that let them be enlisted also for the labour that feeds let them be counted trained fed dressed praised for that teach the plough exercise as carefully as you do the sword exercise and let the officers of troops of life be held as much gentlemen as the officers of troops of death and all is done but neither this nor any other right thing can be accomplishedyou cant even see your way to itunless first of all both servant and master are resolved that come what will of it they will do each other justice people are perpetually squabbling about what will be best to do or easiest to do or adviseablest to do or profitablest to do but they never so far as i hear them talk ever ask what it is just to do and it is the law of heaven that you shall not be able to judge what is wise or easy unless you are first resolved to judge what is just and to do it that is the one thing constantly reiterated by our masterthe order of all others that is given oftenestdo justice and judgment thats your bible order thats the service of god not praying nor psalmsinging you are told indeed to sing psalms when you are merry and to pray when you need anything and by the perversion of the evil spirit we get to think that praying and psalmsinging are service if a child finds itself in want of anything it runs in and asks its father for itdoes it call that doing its father a service if it begs for a toy or a piece of cakedoes it call that serving its father that with god is prayer and he likes to hear it he likes you to ask him for cake when you want it but he doesnt call that serving him begging is not serving god likes mere beggars as little as you dohe likes honest servants not beggars so when a child loves its father very much and is very happy it may sing little songs about him but it doesnt call that serving its father neither is singing songs about god serving god it is enjoying ourselves if its anything most probably it is nothing but if its anything it is serving ourselves not god and yet we are impudent enough to call our beggings and chauntings divine service we say divine service will be performed thats our wordthe form of it gone through at eleven oclock alasunless we perform divine service in every willing act of our life we never perform it at all the one divine workthe one ordered sacrificeis to do justice and it is the last we are ever inclined to do anything rather than that as much charity as you choose but no justice nay you will say charity is greater than justice yes it is greater it is the summit of justiceit is the temple of which justice is the foundation but you cant have the top without the bottom you cannot build upon charity you must build upon justice for this main reason that you have not at first charity to build with it is the last reward of good work do justice to your brother you can do that whether you love him or not and you will come to love him but do injustice to him because you dont love him and you will come to hate him it is all very fine to think you can build upon charity to begin with but you will find all you have got to begin with begins at home and is essentially love of yourself you welltodo people for instance who are here tonight will go to divine service next sunday all nice and tidy and your little children will have their tight little sunday boots on and lovely little sunday feathers in their hats and youll think complacently and piously how lovely they look so they do and you love them heartily and you like sticking feathers in their hats thats all right that is charity but it is charity beginning at home then you will come to the poor little crossingsweeper got up alsoit in its sunday dressthe dirtiest rags it hasthat it may beg the better we shall give it a penny and think how good we are thats charity going abroad but what does justice say walking and watching near us christian justice has been strangely mute and seemingly blind and if not blind decrepit this many a day she keeps her accounts still howeverquite steadilydoing them at nights carefully with her bandage off and through acutest spectacles the only modern scientific invention she cares about you must put your ear down ever so close to her lips to hear her speak and then you will start at what she first whispers for it will certainly be why shouldnt that little crossingsweeper have a feather on its head as well as your own child then you may ask justice in an amazed manner how she can possibly be so foolish as to think children could sweep crossings with feathers on their heads then you stoop again and justice saysstill in her dull stupid waythen why dont you every other sunday leave your child to sweep the crossing and take the little sweeper to church in a hat and feather mercy on us you think what will she say next and you answer of course that you dont because every body ought to remain content in the position in which providence has placed them ah my friends thats the gist of the whole question did providence put them in that position or did you you knock a man into a ditch and then you tell him to remain content in the position in which providence has placed him thats modern christianity you saywe did not knock him into the ditch how do you know what you have done or are doing thats just what we have all got to know and what we shall never know until the question with us every morning is not how to do the gainful thing but how to do the just thing nor until we are at least so far on the way to being christian as to have understood that maxim of the poor halfway mahometan one hour in the execution of justice is worth seventy years of prayer  supposing then we have it determined with appropriate justice who is to do the hand work the next questions must be how the handworkers are to be paid and how they are to be refreshed and what play they are to have now the possible quantity of play depends on the possible quantity of pay and the quantity of pay is not a matter for consideration to handworkers only but to all workers generally good useful work whether of the hand or head is either illpaid or not paid at all i dont say it should be so but it always is so people as a rule only pay for being amused or being cheated not for being served five thousand a year to your talker and a shilling a day to your fighter digger and thinker is the rule none of the best head work in art literature or science is ever paid for how much do you think homer got for his iliad or dante for his paradise only bitter bread and salt and going up and down other peoples stairs in science the man who discovered the telescope and first saw heaven was paid with a dungeon the man who invented the microscope and first saw earth died of starvation driven from his home it is indeed very clear that god means all thoroughly good work and talk to be done for nothing baruch the scribe did not get a penny a line for writing jeremiahs second roll for him i fancy and st stephen did not get bishops pay for that long sermon of his to the pharisees nothing but stones for indeed that is the worldfathers proper payment so surely as any of the worlds children work for the worlds good honestly with head and heart and come to it saying give us a little bread just to keep the life in us the worldfather answers them no my children not bread a stone if you like or as many as you need to keep you quiet but the handworkers are not so ill off as all this comes to the worst that can happen to you is to break stones not be broken by them and for you there will come a time for better payment some day assuredly more pence will be paid to peter the fisherman and fewer to peter the pope we shall pay people not quite so much for talking in parliament and doing nothing as for holding their tongues out of it and doing something we shall pay our ploughman a little more and our lawyer a little less and so on but at least we may even now take care that whatever work is done shall be fully paid for and the man who does it paid for it not somebody else and that it shall be done in an orderly soldierly wellguided wholesome way under good captains and lieutenants of labour and that it shall have its appointed times of rest and enough of them and that in those times the play shall be wholesome play not in theatrical gardens with tin flowers and gas sunshine and girls dancing because of their misery but in true gardens with real flowers and real sunshine and children dancing because of their gladness so that truly the streets shall be full the streets mind you not the gutters of children playing in the midst thereof we may take care that workingmen shall have at least as good books to read as anybody else when theyve time to read them and as comfortable firesides to sit at as anybody else when theyve time to sit at them this i think can be managed for you my working friends in the good time  iv i must go on however to our last head concerning ourselves all as workers what is wise work and what is foolish work what the difference between sense and nonsense in daily occupation  well wise work is briefly work with god foolish work is work against god and work done with god which he will help may be briefly described as putting in orderthat is enforcing gods law of order spiritual and material over men and things the first thing you have to do essentially the real good work is with respect to men to enforce justice and with respect to things to enforce tidiness and fruitfulness and against these two great human deeds justice and order there are perpetually two great demons contendingthe devil of iniquity or inequity and the devil of disorder or of death for death is only consummation of disorder you have to fight these two fiends daily so far as you dont fight against the fiend of iniquity you work for him you work iniquity and the judgment upon you for all your lord lords will be depart from me ye that work iniquity and so far as you do not resist the fiend of disorder you work disorder and you yourself do the work of death which is sin and has for its wages death himself  observe then all wise work is mainly threefold in character it is honest useful and cheerful   i it is honest i hardly know anything more strange than that you recognise honesty in play and you do not in work in your lightest games you have always some one to see what you call fairplay in boxing you must hit fair in racing start fair your english watchword is fairplay your english hatred foulplay did it ever strike you that you wanted another watchword also fairwork and another hatred also foulwork your prizefighter has some honour in him yet and so have the men in the ring round him they will judge him to lose the match by foul hitting but your prizemerchant gains his match by foul selling and no one cries out against that you drive a gambler out of the gamblingroom who loads dice but you leave a tradesman in flourishing business who loads scales for observe all dishonest dealing is loading scales what does it matter whether i get short weight adulterate substance or dishonest fabric the fault in the fabric is incomparably the worst of the two give me short measure of food and i only lose by you but give me adulterate food and i die by you here then is your chief duty you workmen and tradesmento be true to yourselves and to us who would help you we can do nothing for you nor you for yourselves without honesty get that you get all without that your suffrages your reforms your freetrade measures your institutions of science are all in vain it is useless to put your heads together if you cant put your hearts together shoulder to shoulder right hand to right hand among yourselves and no wrong hand to anybody else and youll win the world yet   ii then secondly wise work is useful no man minds or ought to mind its being hard if only it comes to something but when it is hard and comes to nothing when all our bees business turns to spiders and for honeycomb we have only resultant cobweb blown away by the next breezethat is the cruel thing for the worker yet do we ever ask ourselves personally or even nationally whether our work is coming to anything or not we dont care to keep what has been nobly done still less do we care to do nobly what others would keep and least of all to make the work itself useful instead of deadly to the doer so as to use his life indeed but not to waste it of all wastes the greatest waste that you can commit is the waste of labour if you went down in the morning into your dairy and you found that your youngest child had got down before you and that he and the cat were at play together and that he had poured out all the cream on the floor for the cat to lap up you would scold the child and be sorry the milk was wasted but if instead of wooden bowls with milk in them there are golden bowls with human life in them and instead of the cat to play withthe devil to play with and you yourself the player and instead of leaving that golden bowl to be broken by god at the fountain you break it in the dust yourself and pour the human blood out on the ground for the fiend to lick upthat is no waste what you perhaps think to waste the labour of men is not to kill them is it not i should like to know how you could kill them more utterlykill them with second deaths seventh deaths hundredfold deaths it is the slightest way of killing to stop a mans breath nay the hunger and the cold and the little whistling bulletsour lovemessengers between nation and nationhave brought pleasant messages from us to many a man before now orders of sweet release and leave at last to go where he will be most welcome and most happy at the worst you do but shorten his life you do not corrupt his life but if you put him to base labour if you bind his thoughts if you blind his eyes if you blunt his hopes if you steal his joys if you stunt his body and blast his soul and at last leave him not so much as to reap the poor fruit of his degradation but gather that for yourself and dismiss him to the grave when you have done with him having so far as in you lay made the walls of that grave everlasting though indeed i fancy the goodly bricks of some of our family vaults will hold closer in the resurrection day than the sod over the labourers head this you think is no waste and no sin   iii then lastly wise work is cheerful as a childs work is and now i want you to take one thought home with you and let it stay with you  everybody in this room has been taught to pray daily thy kingdom come now if we hear a man swear in the streets we think it very wrong and say he takes gods name in vain but theres a twenty times worse way of taking his name in vain than that it is to ask god for what we dont want he doesnt like that sort of prayer if you dont want a thing dont ask for it such asking is the worst mockery of your king you can mock him with the soldiers striking him on the head with the reed was nothing to that if you do not wish for his kingdom dont pray for it but if you do you must do more than pray for it you must work for it and to work for it you must know what it is we have all prayed for it many a day without thinking observe it is a kingdom that is to come to us we are not to go to it also it is not to be a kingdom of the dead but of the living also it is not to come all at once but quietly nobody knows how the kingdom of god cometh not with observation also it is not to come outside of us but in the hearts of us the kingdom of god is within you and being within us it is not a thing to be seen but to be felt and though it brings all substance of good with it it does not consist in that the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost joy that is to say in the holy healthful and helpful spirit now if we want to work for this kingdom and to bring it and enter into it theres just one condition to be first accepted you must enter it as children or not at all whosoever will not receive it as a little child shall not enter therein and again suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of heaven  of such observe not of children themselves but of such as children i believe most mothers who read that text think that all heaven is to be full of babies but thats not so there will be children there but the hoary head is the crown length of days and long life and peace that is the blessing not to die in babyhood children die but for their parents sins god means them to live but he cant let them always then they have their earlier place in heaven and the little child of david vainly prayed forthe little child of jeroboam killed by its mothers step on its own thresholdthey will be there but weary old david and weary old barzillai having learned childrens lessons at last will be there too and the one question for us all young or old is have we learned our childs lesson it is the character of children we want and must gain at our peril let us see briefly in what it consists  the first character of right childhood is that it is modest a wellbred child does not think it can teach its parents or that it knows everything it may think its father and mother know everythingperhaps that all grownup people know everything very certainly it is sure that it does not and it is always asking questions and wanting to know more well that is the first character of a good and wise man at his work to know that he knows very littleto perceive that there are many above him wiser than he and to be always asking questions wanting to learn not to teach no one ever teaches well who wants to teach or governs well who wants to govern it is an old saying platos but i know not if his first and as wise as old  then the second character of right childhood is to be faithful perceiving that its father knows best what is good for it and having found always when it has tried its own way against his that he was right and it was wrong a noble child trusts him at last wholly gives him its hand and will walk blindfold with him if he bids it and that is the true character of all good men also as obedient workers or soldiers under captains they must trust their captainsthey are bound for their lives to choose none but those whom they can trust then they are not always to be thinking that what seems strange to them or wrong in what they are desired to do is strange or wrong they know their captain where he leads they must follow what he bids they must do and without this trust and faith without this captainship and soldiership no great deed no great salvation is possible to man among all the nations it is only when this faith is attained by them that they become great the jew the greek and the mahometan agree at least in testifying to this it was a deed of this absolute trust which made abraham the father of the faithful it was the declaration of the power of god as captain over all men and the acceptance of a leader appointed by him as commander of the faithful which laid the foundation of whatever national power yet exists in the east and the deed of the greeks which has become the type of unselfish and noble soldiership to all lands and to all times was commemorated on the tomb of those who gave their lives to do it in the most pathetic so far as i know or can feel of all human utterances oh stranger go and tell our people that we are lying here having obeyed their words  then the third character of right childhood is to be loving and generous give a little love to a child and you get a great deal back it loves everything near it when it is a right kind of childwould hurt nothing would give the best it has away always if you need itdoes not lay plans for getting everything in the house for itself and delights in helping people you cannot please it so much as by giving it a chance of being useful in ever so little a way  and because of all these characters lastly it is cheerful putting its trust in its father it is careful for nothingbeing full of love to every creature it is happy always whether in its play or in its duty well thats the great workers character also taking no thought for the morrow taking thought only for the duty of the day trusting somebody else to take care of tomorrow knowing indeed what labour is but not what sorrow is and always ready for playbeautiful playfor lovely human play is like the play of the sun theres a worker for you he steady to his time is set as a strong man to run his course but also he rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course see how he plays in the morning with the mists below and the clouds above with a ray here and a flash there and a shower of jewels everywhere thats the suns play and great human play is like hisall variousall full of light and life and tender as the dew of the morning  so then you have the childs character in these four thingshumility faith charity and cheerfulness thats what you have got to be converted to except ye be converted and become as little childrenyou hear much of conversion nowadays but people always seem to think they have got to be made wretched by conversionto be converted to long faces no friends you have got to be converted to short ones you have to repent into childhood to repent into delight and delightsomeness you cant go into a conventicle but youll hear plenty of talk of backsliding backsliding indeed i can tell you on the ways most of us go the faster we slide back the better slide back into the cradle if going on is into the graveback i tell you backout of your long faces and into your long clothes it is among children only and as children only that you will find medicine for your healing and true wisdom for your teaching there is poison in the counsels of the men of this world the words they speak are all bitterness the poison of asps is under their lips but the sucking child shall play by the hole of the asp there is death in the looks of men their eyes are privily set against the poor they are as the uncharmable serpent the cockatrice which slew by seeing but the weaned child shall lay his hand on the cockatrice den there is death in the steps of men their feet are swift to shed blood they have compassed us in our steps like the lion that is greedy of his prey and the young lion lurking in secret places but in that kingdom the wolf shall lie down with the lamb and the fatling with the lion and a little child shall lead them there is death in the thoughts of men the world is one wide riddle to them darker and darker as it draws to a close but the secret of it is known to the child and the lord of heaven and earth is most to be thanked in that he has hidden these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes yes and there is deathinfinitude of death in the principalities and powers of men as far as the east is from the west so far our sins arenot set from us but multiplied around us the sun himself think you he now rejoices to run his course when he plunges westward to the horizon so widely red not with clouds but blood and it will be red more widely yet whatever drought of the early and latter rain may be there will be none of that red rain you fortify yourselves you arm yourselves against it in vain the enemy and avenger will be upon you also unless you learn that it is not out of the mouths of the knitted gun or the smoothed rifle but out of the mouths of babes and sucklings that the strength is ordained which shall still the enemy and avenger     lecture ii  traffic  delivered in the town hall bradford   my good yorkshire friends you asked me down here among your hills that i might talk to you about this exchange you are going to build but earnestly and seriously asking you to pardon me i am going to do nothing of the kind i cannot talk or at least can say very little about this same exchange i must talk of quite other things though not willinglyi could not deserve your pardon if when you invited me to speak on one subject i wilfully spoke on another but i cannot speak to purpose of anything about which i do not care and most simply and sorrowfully i have to tell you in the outset that i do not care about this exchange of yours  if however when you sent me your invitation i had answered i wont come i dont care about the exchange of bradford you would have been justly offended with me not knowing the reasons of so blunt a carelessness so i have come down hoping that you will patiently let me tell you why on this and many other such occasions i now remain silent when formerly i should have caught at the opportunity of speaking to a gracious audience  in a word then i do not care about this exchangebecause you dont and because you know perfectly well i cannot make you look at the essential circumstances of the case which you as business men know perfectly well though perhaps you think i forget them you are going to spend 30000l which to you collectively is nothing the buying a new coat is as to the cost of it a much more important matter of consideration to me than building a new exchange is to you but you think you may as well have the right thing for your money you know there are a great many odd styles of architecture about you dont want to do anything ridiculous you hear of me among others as a respectable architectural manmilliner and you send for me that i may tell you the leading fashion and what is in our shops for the moment the newest and sweetest thing in pinnacles  now pardon me for telling you frankly you cannot have good architecture merely by asking peoples advice on occasion all good architecture is the expression of national life and character and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste or desire for beauty and i want you to think a little of the deep significance of this word taste for no statement of mine has been more earnestly or oftener controverted than that good taste is essentially a moral quality no say many of my antagonists taste is one thing morality is another tell us what is pretty we shall be glad to know that but preach no sermons to us  permit me therefore to fortify this old dogma of mine somewhat taste is not only a part and an index of moralityit is the only morality the first and last and closest trial question to any living creature is what do you like tell me what you like and ill tell you what you are go out into the street and ask the first man or woman you meet what their taste is and if they answer candidly you know them body and soul you my friend in the rags with the unsteady gait what do you like a pipe and a quartern of gin i know you you good woman with the quick step and tidy bonnet what do you like a swept hearth and a clean teatable and my husband opposite me and a baby at my breast good i know you also you little girl with the golden hair and the soft eyes what do you like my canary and a run among the wood hyacinths you little boy with the dirty hands and the low forehead what do you like a shy at the sparrows and a game at pitchfarthing good we know them all now what more need we ask  nay perhaps you answer we need rather to ask what these people and children do than what they like if they do right it is no matter that they like what is wrong and if they do wrong it is no matter that they like what is right doing is the great thing and it does not matter that the man likes drinking so that he does not drink nor that the little girl likes to be kind to her canary if she will not learn her lessons nor that the little boy likes throwing stones at the sparrows if he goes to the sunday school indeed for a short time and in a provisional sense this is true for if resolutely people do what is right in time they come to like doing it but they only are in a right moral state when they have come to like doing it and as long as they dont like it they are still in a vicious state the man is not in health of body who is always thirsting for the bottle in the cupboard though he bravely bears his thirst but the man who heartily enjoys water in the morning and wine in the evening each in its proper quantity and time and the entire object of true education is to make people not merely do the right things but enjoy the right thingsnot merely industrious but to love industrynot merely learned but to love knowledgenot merely pure but to love puritynot merely just but to hunger and thirst after justice  but you may answer or think is the liking for outside ornamentsfor pictures or statues or furniture or architecturea moral quality yes most surely if a rightly set liking taste for any pictures or statues is not a moral quality but taste for good ones is only here again we have to define the word good i dont mean by good cleveror learnedor difficult in the doing take a picture by teniers of sots quarrelling over their dice it is an entirely clever picture so clever that nothing in its kind has ever been done equal to it but it is also an entirely base and evil picture it is an expression of delight in the prolonged contemplation of a vile thing and delight in that is an unmannered or immoral quality it is bad taste in the profoundest senseit is the taste of the devils on the other hand a picture of titians or a greek statue or a greek coin or a turner landscape expresses delight in the perpetual contemplation of a good and perfect thing that is an entirely moral qualityit is the taste of the angels and all delight in art and all love of it resolve themselves into simple love of that which deserves love that deserving is the quality which we call lovelinesswe ought to have an opposite word hateliness to be said of the things which deserve to be hated and it is not an indifferent nor optional thing whether we love this or that but it is just the vital function of all our being what we like determines what we are and is the sign of what we are and to teach taste is inevitably to form character as i was thinking over this in walking up fleet street the other day my eye caught the title of a book standing open in a booksellers window it wason the necessity of the diffusion of taste among all classes ah i thought to myself my classifying friend when you have diffused your taste where will your classes be the man who likes what you like belongs to the same class with you i think inevitably so you may put him to other work if you choose but by the condition you have brought him into he will dislike the other work as much as you would yourself you get hold of a scavenger or a costermonger who enjoyed the newgate calendar for literature and pop goes the weasel for music you think you can make him like dante and beethoven i wish you joy of your lessons but if you do you have made a gentleman of himhe wont like to go back to his costermongering  and so completely and unexceptionally is this so that if i had time tonight i could show you that a nation cannot be affected by any vice or weakness without expressing it legibly and for ever either in bad art or by want of art and that there is no national virtue small or great which is not manifestly expressed in all the art which circumstances enable the people possessing that virtue to produce take for instance your great english virtue of enduring and patient courage you have at present in england only one art of any consequencethat is ironworking you know thoroughly well how to cast and hammer iron now do you think in those masses of lava which you build volcanic cones to melt and which you forge at the mouths of the infernos you have created do you think on those iron plates your courage and endurance are not written for evernot merely with an iron pen but on iron parchment and take also your great english viceeuropean vicevice of all the worldvice of all other worlds that roll or shine in heaven bearing with them yet the atmosphere of hellthe vice of jealousy which brings competition into your commerce treachery into your councils and dishonour into your warsthat vice which has rendered for you and for your next neighbouring nation the daily occupations of existence no longer possible but with the mail upon your breasts and the sword loose in its sheath so that at last you have realised for all the multitudes of the two great peoples who lead the socalled civilisation of the earthyou have realised for them all i say in person and in policy what was once true only of the rough border riders of your cheviot hills                    they carved at the meal                    with gloves of steel     and they drank the red wine through the helmet barrd  do you think that this national shame and dastardliness of heart are not written as legibly on every rivet of your iron armour as the strength of the right hands that forged it friends i know not whether this thing be the more ludicrous or the more melancholy it is quite unspeakably both suppose instead of being now sent for by you i had been sent for by some private gentleman living in a suburban house with his garden separated only by a fruitwall from his next door neighbours and he had called me to consult with him on the furnishing of his drawing room i begin looking about me and find the walls rather bare i think such and such a paper might be desirableperhaps a little fresco here and there on the ceilinga damask curtain or so at the windows ah says my employer damask curtains indeed thats all very fine but you know i cant afford that kind of thing just now yet the world credits you with a splendid income ah yes says my friend but do you know at present i am obliged to spend it nearly all in steeltraps steeltraps for whom why for that fellow on the other side the wall you know were very good friends capital friends but we are obliged to keep our traps set on both sides of the wall we could not possibly keep on friendly terms without them and our spring guns the worst of it is we are both clever fellows enough and theres never a day passes that we dont find out a new trap or a new gunbarrel or something we spend about fifteen millions a year each in our traps take it all together and i dont see how were to do with less a highly comic state of life for two private gentlemen but for two nations it seems to me not wholly comic bedlam would be comic perhaps if there were only one madman in it and your christmas pantomime is comic when there is only one clown in it but when the whole world turns clown and paints itself red with its own hearts blood instead of vermilion it is something else than comic i think  mind i know a great deal of this is play and willingly allow for that you dont know what to do with yourselves for a sensation foxhunting and cricketing will not carry you through the whole of this unendurably long mortal life you liked popguns when you were schoolboys and rifles and armstrongs are only the same things better made but then the worst of it is that what was play to you when boys was not play to the sparrows and what is play to you now is not play to the small birds of state neither and for the black eagles you are somewhat shy of taking shots at them if i mistake not  i must get back to the matter in hand however believe me without farther instance i could show you in all time that every nations vice or virtue was written in its art the soldiership of early greece the sensuality of late italy the visionary religion of tuscany the splendid human energy and beauty of venice i have no time to do this tonight i have done it elsewhere before now but i proceed to apply the principle to ourselves in a more searching manner  i notice that among all the new buildings that cover your once wild hills churches and schools are mixed in due that is to say in large proportion with your mills and mansions and i notice also that the churches and schools are almost always gothic and the mansions and mills are never gothic will you allow me to ask precisely the meaning of this for remember it is peculiarly a modern phenomenon when gothic was invented houses were gothic as well as churches and when the italian style superseded the gothic churches were italian as well as houses if there is a gothic spire to the cathedral of antwerp there is a gothic belfry to the h√¥tel de ville at brussels if inigo jones builds an italian whitehall sir christopher wren builds an italian st pauls but now you live under one school of architecture and worship under another what do you mean by doing this am i to understand that you are thinking of changing your architecture back to gothic and that you treat your churches experimentally because it does not matter what mistakes you make in a church or am i to understand that you consider gothic a preeminently sacred and beautiful mode of building which you think like the fine frankincense should be mixed for the tabernacle only and reserved for your religious services for if this be the feeling though it may seem at first as if it were graceful and reverent you will find that at the root of the matter it signifies neither more nor less than that you have separated your religion from your life  for consider what a wide significance this fact has and remember that it is not you only but all the people of england who are behaving thus just now  you have all got into the habit of calling the church the house of god i have seen over the doors of many churches the legend actually carved this is the house of god and this is the gate of heaven now note where that legend comes from and of what place it was first spoken a boy leaves his fathers house to go on a long journey on foot to visit his uncle he has to cross a wild hilldesert just as if one of your own boys had to cross the wolds of westmoreland to visit an uncle at carlisle the second or third day your boy finds himself somewhere between hawes and brough in the midst of the moors at sunset it is stony ground and boggy he cannot go one foot farther that night down he lies to sleep on wharnside where best he may gathering a few of the stones together to put under his headso wild the place is he cannot get anything but stones and there lying under the broad night he has a dream and he sees a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reaches to heaven and the angels of god are ascending and descending upon it and when he wakes out of his sleep he says how dreadful is this place surely this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven this place observe not this church not this city not this stone even which he puts up for a memorialthe piece of flint on which his head has lain but this place this windy slope of wharnside this moorland hollow torrentbitten snowblighted this any place where god lets down the ladder and how are you to know where that will be or how are you to determine where it may be but by being ready for it always do you know where the lightning is to fall next you do know that partly you can guide the lightning but you cannot guide the going forth of the spirit which is that lightning when it shines from the east to the west  but the perpetual and insolent warping of that strong verse to serve a merely ecclesiastical purpose is only one of the thousand instances in which we sink back into gross judaism we call our churches temples now you know or ought to know they are not temples they have never had never can have anything whatever to do with temples they are synagoguesgathering placeswhere you gather yourselves together as an assembly and by not calling them so you again miss the force of another mighty textthou when thou prayest shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the churches we should translate it that they may be seen of men but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy fatherwhich is not in chancel nor in aisle but in secret  now you feel as i say this to youi know you feelas if i were trying to take away the honour of your churches not so i am trying to prove to you the honour of your houses and your hills i am trying to show younot that the church is not sacredbut that the whole earth is i would have you feel what careless what constant what infectious sin there is in all modes of thought whereby in calling your churches only holy you call your hearths and homes profane and have separated yourselves from the heathen by casting all your household gods to the ground instead of recognising in the place of their many and feeble lares the presence of your one and mighty lord and lar   but what has all this to do with our exchange you ask me impatiently my dear friends it has just everything to do with it on these inner and great questions depend all the outer and little ones and if you have asked me down here to speak to you because you had before been interested in anything i have written you must know that all i have yet said about architecture was to show this the book i called the seven lamps was to show that certain right states of temper and moral feeling were the magic powers by which all good architecture without exception had been produced the stones of venice had from beginning to end no other aim than to show that the gothic architecture of venice had arisen out of and indicated in all its features a state of pure national faith and of domestic virtue and that its renaissance architecture had arisen out of and in all its features indicated a state of concealed national infidelity and of domestic corruption and now you ask me what style is best to build in and how can i answer knowing the meaning of the two styles but by another questiondo you mean to build as christians or as infidels and still moredo you mean to build as honest christians or as honest infidels as thoroughly and confessedly either one or the other you dont like to be asked such rude questions i cannot help it they are of much more importance than this exchange business and if they can be at once answered the exchange business settles itself in a moment but before i press them farther i must ask leave to explain one point clearly in all my past work my endeavour has been to show that good architecture is essentially religiousthe production of a faithful and virtuous not of an infidel and corrupted people but in the course of doing this i have had also to show that good architecture is not ecclesiastical people are so apt to look upon religion as the business of the clergy not their own that the moment they hear of anything depending on religion they think it must also have depended on the priesthood and i have had to take what place was to be occupied between these two errors and fight both often with seeming contradiction good architecture is the work of good and believing men therefore you say at least some people say good architecture must essentially have been the work of the clergy not of the laity noa thousand times no good architecture has always been the work of the commonalty not of the clergy what you say those glorious cathedralsthe pride of europedid their builders not form gothic architecture no they corrupted gothic architecture gothic was formed in the barons castle and the burghers street it was formed by the thoughts and hands and powers of free citizens and soldier kings by the monk it was used as an instrument for the aid of his superstition when that superstition became a beautiful madness and the best hearts of europe vainly dreamed and pined in the cloister and vainly raged and perished in the crusadethrough that fury of perverted faith and wasted war the gothic rose also to its loveliest most fantastic and finally most foolish dreams and in those dreams was lost  i hope now that there is no risk of your misunderstanding me when i come to the gist of what i want to say tonightwhen i repeat that every great national architecture has been the result and exponent of a great national religion you cant have bits of it here bits thereyou must have it everywhere or nowhere it is not the monopoly of a clerical companyit is not the exponent of a theological dogmait is not the hieroglyphic writing of an initiated priesthood it is the manly language of a people inspired by resolute and common purpose and rendering resolute and common fidelity to the legible laws of an undoubted god  now there have as yet been three distinct schools of european architecture i say european because asiatic and african architectures belong so entirely to other races and climates that there is no question of them here only in passing i will simply assure you that whatever is good or great in egypt and syria and india is just good or great for the same reasons as the buildings on our side of the bosphorus we europeans then have had three great religions the greek which was the worship of the god of wisdom and power the medi√¶val which was the worship of the god of judgment and consolation the renaissance which was the worship of the god of pride and beauty these three we have hadthey are pastand now at last we english have got a fourth religion and a god of our own about which i want to ask you but i must explain these three old ones first  i repeat first the greeks essentially worshipped the god of wisdom so that whatever contended against their religionto the jews a stumbling blockwas to the greeksfoolishness  the first greek idea of deity was that expressed in the word of which we keep the remnant in our words diurnal and divinethe god of day jupiter the revealer athena is his daughter but especially daughter of the intellect springing armed from the head we are only with the help of recent investigation beginning to penetrate the depth of meaning couched under the athenaic symbols but i may note rapidly that her √¶gis the mantle with the serpent fringes in which she often in the best statues is represented as folding up her left hand for better guard and the gorgon on her shield are both representative mainly of the chilling horror and sadness turning men to stone as it were of the outmost and superficial spheres of knowledgethat knowledge which separates in bitterness hardness and sorrow the heart of the fullgrown man from the heart of the child for out of imperfect knowledge spring terror dissension danger and disdain but from perfect knowledge given by the fullrevealed athena strength and peace in sign of which she is crowned with the olive spray and bears the resistless spear  this then was the greek conception of purest deity and every habit of life and every form of his art developed themselves from the seeking this bright serene resistless wisdom and setting himself as a man to do things evermore rightly and strongly3 not with any ardent affection or ultimate hope but with a resolute and continent energy of will as knowing that for failure there was no consolation and for sin there was no remission and the greek architecture rose unerring bright clearly defined and selfcontained  next followed in europe the great christian faith which was essentially the religion of comfort its great doctrine is the remission of sins for which cause it happens too often in certain phases of christianity that sin and sickness themselves are partly glorified as if the more you had to be healed of the more divine was the healing the practical result of this doctrine in art is a continual contemplation of sin and disease and of imaginary states of purification from them thus we have an architecture conceived in a mingled sentiment of melancholy and aspiration partly severe partly luxuriant which will bend itself to every one of our needs and every one of our fancies and be strong or weak with us as we are strong or weak ourselves it is of all architecture the basest when base people build itof all the noblest when built by the noble  and now note that both these religionsgreek and medi√¶valperished by falsehood in their own main purpose the greek religion of wisdom perished in a false philosophyoppositions of science falsely so called the medi√¶val religion of consolation perished in false comfort in remission of sins given lyingly it was the selling of absolution that ended the medi√¶val faith and i can tell you more it is the selling of absolution which to the end of time will mark false christianity pure christianity gives her remission of sins only by ending them but false christianity gets her remission of sins by compounding for them and there are many ways of compounding for them we english have beautiful little quiet ways of buying absolution whether in low church or high far more cunning than any of tetzels trading  then thirdly there followed the religion of pleasure in which all europe gave itself to luxury ending in death first bals masqu√©s in every saloon and then guillotines in every square and all these three worships issue in vast temple building your greek worshipped wisdom and built you the parthenonthe virgins temple the medi√¶val worshipped consolation and built you virgin temples alsobut to our lady of salvation then the revivalist worshipped beauty of a sort and built you versailles and the vatican now lastly will you tell me what we worship and what we build  you know we are speaking always of the real active continual national worship that by which men act while they live not that which they talk of when they die now we have indeed a nominal religion to which we pay tithes of property and sevenths of time but we have also a practical and earnest religion to which we devote ninetenths of our property and sixsevenths of our time and we dispute a great deal about the nominal religion but we are all unanimous about this practical one of which i think you will admit that the ruling goddess may be best generally described as the goddess of gettingon or britannia of the market the athenians had an athena agoraia or minerva of the market but she was a subordinate type of their goddess while our britannia agoraia is the principal type of ours and all your great architectural works are of course built to her it is long since you built a great cathedral and how you would laugh at me if i proposed building a cathedral on the top of one of these hills of yours taking it for an acropolis but your railroad mounds prolonged masses of acropolis your railroad stations vaster than the parthenon and innumerable your chimneys how much more mighty and costly than cathedral spires your harbourpiers your warehouses your exchangesall these are built to your great goddess of gettingon and she has formed and will continue to form your architecture as long as you worship her and it is quite vain to ask me to tell you how to build to her you know far better than i  there might indeed on some theories be a conceivably good architecture for exchangesthat is to say if there were any heroism in the fact or deed of exchange which might be typically carved on the outside of your building for you know all beautiful architecture must be adorned with sculpture or painting and for sculpture or painting you must have a subject and hitherto it has been a received opinion among the nations of the world that the only right subjects for either were heroisms of some sort even on his pots and his flagons the greek put a hercules slaying lions or an apollo slaying serpents or bacchus slaying melancholy giants and earthborn despondencies on his temples the greek put contests of great warriors in founding states or of gods with evil spirits on his houses and temples alike the christian put carvings of angels conquering devils or of heromartyrs exchanging this world for another subject inappropriate i think to our manner of exchange here and the master of christians not only left his followers without any orders as to the sculpture of affairs of exchange on the outside of buildings but gave some strong evidence of his dislike of affairs of exchange within them and yet there might surely be a heroism in such affairs and all commerce become a kind of selling of doves not impious the wonder has always been great to me that heroism has never been supposed to be in anywise consistent with the practice of supplying people with food or clothes but rather with that of quartering oneself upon them for food and stripping them of their clothes spoiling of armour is an heroic deed in all ages but the selling of clothes old or new has never taken any colour of magnanimity yet one does not see why feeding the hungry and clothing the naked should ever become base businesses even when engaged in on a large scale if one could contrive to attach the notion of conquest to them anyhow so that supposing there were anywhere an obstinate race who refused to be comforted one might take some pride in giving them compulsory comfort and as it were occupying a country with ones gifts instead of ones armies if one could only consider it as much a victory to get a barren field sown as to get an eared field stripped and contend who should build villages instead of who should carry them are not all forms of heroism conceivable in doing these serviceable deeds you doubt who is strongest it might be ascertained by push of spade as well as push of sword who is wisest there are witty things to be thought of in planning other business than campaigns who is bravest there are always the elements to fight with stronger than men and nearly as merciless the only absolutely and unapproachably heroic element in the soldiers work seems to bethat he is paid little for itand regularly while you traffickers and exchangers and others occupied in presumably benevolent business like to be paid much for itand by chance i never can make out how it is that a knighterrant does not expect to be paid for his trouble but a pedlarerrant always doesthat people are willing to take hard knocks for nothing but never to sell ribands cheapthat they are ready to go on fervent crusades to recover the tomb of a buried god never on any travels to fulfil the orders of a living godthat they will go anywhere barefoot to preach their faith but must be well bribed to practise it and are perfectly ready to give the gospel gratis but never the loaves and fishes if you chose to take the matter up on any such soldierly principle to do your commerce and your feeding of nations for fixed salaries and to be as particular about giving people the best food and the best cloth as soldiers are about giving them the best gunpowder i could carve something for you on your exchange worth looking at but i can only at present suggest decorating its frieze with pendant purses and making its pillars broad at the base for the sticking of bills and in the innermost chambers of it there might be a statue of britannia of the market who may have perhaps advisably a partridge for her crest typical at once of her courage in fighting for noble ideas and of her interest in game and round its neck the inscription in golden letters perdix fovit qu√¶ non peperit4 then for her spear she might have a weavers beam and on her shield instead of her cross the milanese boar semifleeced with the town of gennesaret proper in the field and the legend in the best market and her corslet of leather folded over her heart in the shape of a purse with thirty slits in it for a piece of money to go in at on each day of the month and i doubt not but that people would come to see your exchange and its goddess with applause  nevertheless i want to point out to you certain strange characters in this goddess of yours she differs from the great greek and medi√¶val deities essentially in two thingsfirst as to the continuance of her presumed power secondly as to the extent of it  1st as to the continuance  the greek goddess of wisdom gave continual increase of wisdom as the christian spirit of comfort or comforter continual increase of comfort there was no question with these of any limit or cessation of function but with your agora goddess that is just the most important question getting onbut where to gathering togetherbut how much do you mean to gather alwaysnever to spend if so i wish you joy of your goddess for i am just as well off as you without the trouble of worshipping her at all but if you do not spend somebody else willsomebody else must and it is because of this among many other such errors that i have fearlessly declared your socalled science of political economy to be no science because namely it has omitted the study of exactly the most important branch of the businessthe study of spending for spend you must and as much as you make ultimately you gather cornwill you bury england under a heap of grain or will you when you have gathered finally eat you gather goldwill you make your houseroofs of it or pave your streets with it that is still one way of spending it but if you keep it that you may get more ill give you more ill give you all the gold you wantall you can imagineif you can tell me what youll do with it you shall have thousands of gold piecesthousands of thousandsmillionsmountains of gold where will you keep them will you put an olympus of silver upon a golden pelionmake ossa like a wart do you think the rain and dew would then come down to you in the streams from such mountains more blessedly than they will down the mountains which god has made for you of moss and whinstone but it is not gold that you want to gather what is it greenbacks no not those neither what is it thenis it ciphers after a capital i cannot you practise writing ciphers and write as many as you want write ciphers for an hour every morning in a big book and say every evening i am worth all those noughts more than i was yesterday wont that do well what in the name of plutus is it you want not gold not greenbacks not ciphers after a capital i you will have to answer after all no we want somehow or other moneys worth well what is that let your goddess of gettingon discover it and let her learn to stay therein   ii but there is yet another question to be asked respecting this goddess of gettingon the first was of the continuance of her power the second is of its extent  pallas and the madonna were supposed to be all the worlds pallas and all the worlds madonna they could teach all men and they could comfort all men but look strictly into the nature of the power of your goddess of gettingon and you will find she is the goddessnot of everybodys getting onbut only of somebodys getting on this is a vital or rather deathful distinction examine it in your own ideal of the state of national life which this goddess is to evoke and maintain i asked you what it was when i was last here5you have never told me now shall i try to tell you  your ideal of human life then is i think that it should be passed in a pleasant undulating world with iron and coal everywhere underneath it on each pleasant bank of this world is to be a beautiful mansion with two wings and stables and coachhouses a moderately sized park a large garden and hot houses and pleasant carriage drives through the shrubberies in this mansion are to live the favoured votaries of the goddess the english gentleman with his gracious wife and his beautiful family always able to have the boudoir and the jewels for the wife and the beautiful ball dresses for the daughters and hunters for the sons and a shooting in the highlands for himself at the bottom of the bank is to be the mill not less than a quarter of a mile long with a steam engine at each end and two in the middle and a chimney three hundred feet high in this mill are to be in constant employment from eight hundred to a thousand workers who never drink never strike always go to church on sunday and always express themselves in respectful language  is not that broadly and in the main features the kind of thing you propose to yourselves it is very pretty indeed seen from above not at all so pretty seen from below for observe while to one family this deity is indeed the goddess of getting on to a thousand families she is the goddess of not getting on nay you say they have all their chance yes so has every one in a lottery but there must always be the same number of blanks ah but in a lottery it is not skill and intelligence which take the lead but blind chance what then do you think the old practice that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can is less iniquitous when the power has become power of brains instead of fist and that though we may not take advantage of a childs or a womans weakness we may of a mans foolishness nay but finally work must be done and some one must be at the top some one at the bottom granted my friends work must always be and captains of work must always be and if you in the least remember the tone of any of my writings you must know that they are thought unfit for this age because they are always insisting on need of government and speaking with scorn of liberty but i beg you to observe that there is a wide difference between being captains or governors of work and taking the profits of it it does not follow because you are general of an army that you are to take all the treasure or land it wins if it fight for treasure or land neither because you are king of a nation that you are to consume all the profits of the nations work real kings on the contrary are known invariably by their doing quite the reverse of thisby their taking the least possible quantity of the nations work for themselves there is no test of real kinghood so infallible as that does the crowned creature live simply bravely unostentatiously probably he is a king does he cover his body with jewels and his table with delicates in all probability he is not a king it is possible he may be as solomon was but that is when the nation shares his splendour with him solomon made gold not only to be in his own palace as stones but to be in jerusalem as stones but even so for the most part these splendid kinghoods expire in ruin and only the true kinghoods live which are of royal labourers governing loyal labourers who both leading rough lives establish the true dynasties conclusively you will find that because you are king of a nation it does not follow that you are to gather for yourself all the wealth of that nation neither because you are king of a small part of the nation and lord over the means of its maintenanceover field or mill or mine are you to take all the produce of that piece of the foundation of national existence for yourself  you will tell me i need not preach against these things for i cannot mend them no good friends i cannot but you can and you will or something else can and will do you think these phenomena are to stay always in their present power or aspect all history shows on the contrary that to be the exact thing they never can do change must come but it is ours to determine whether change of growth or change of death shall the parthenon be in ruins on its rock and bolton priory in its meadow but these mills of yours be the consummation of the buildings of the earth and their wheels be as the wheels of eternity think you that men may come and men may go butmillsgo on forever not so out of these better or worse shall come and it is for you to choose which  i know that none of this wrong is done with deliberate purpose i know on the contrary that you wish your workmen well that you do much for them and that you desire to do more for them if you saw your way to it safely i know that many of you have done and are every day doing whatever you feel to be in your power and that even all this wrong and misery are brought about by a warped sense of duty each of you striving to do his best without noticing that this best is essentially and centrally the best for himself not for others and all this has come of the spreading of that thrice accursed thrice impious doctrine of the modern economist that to do the best for yourself is finally to do the best for others friends our great master said not so and most absolutely we shall find this world is not made so indeed to do the best for others is finally to do the best for ourselves but it will not do to have our eyes fixed on that issue the pagans had got beyond that hear what a pagan says of this matter hear what were perhaps the last written words of platoif not the last actually written for this we cannot know yet assuredly in fact and power his parting wordsin which endeavouring to give full crowning and harmonious close to all his thoughts and to speak the sum of them by the imagined sentence of the great spirit his strength and his heart fail him and the words cease broken off for ever it is the close of the dialogue called critias in which he describes partly from real tradition partly in ideal dream the early state of athens and the genesis and order and religion of the fabled isle of atlantis in which genesis he conceives the same first perfection and final degeneracy of man which in our own scriptural tradition is expressed by saying that the sons of god intermarried with the daughters of men for he supposes the earliest race to have been indeed the children of god and to have corrupted themselves until their spot was not the spot of his children and this he says was the end that indeed through many generations so long as the gods nature in them yet was full they were submissive to the sacred laws and carried themselves lovingly to all that had kindred with them in divineness for their uttermost spirit was faithful and true and in every wise great so that in all meekness of wisdom they dealt with each other and took all the chances of life and despising all things except virtue they cared little what happened day by day and bore lightly the burden of gold and of possessions for they saw that if only their common love and virtue increased all these things would be increased together with them but to set their esteem and ardent pursuit upon material possession would be to lose that first and their virtue and affection together with it and by such reasoning and what of the divine nature remained in them they gained all this greatness of which we have already told but when the gods part of them faded and became extinct being mixed again and again and effaced by the prevalent mortality and the human nature at last exceeded they then became unable to endure the courses of fortune and fell into shapelessness of life and baseness in the sight of him who could see having lost everything that was fairest of their honour while to the blind hearts which could not discern the true life tending to happiness it seemed that they were then chiefly noble and happy being filled with all iniquity of inordinate possession and power whereupon the god of gods whose kinghood is in laws beholding a once just nation thus cast into misery and desiring to lay such punishment upon them as might make them repent into restraining gathered together all the gods into his dwellingplace which from heavens centre overlooks whatever has part in creation and having assembled them he said  the rest is silence so ended are the last words of the chief wisdom of the heathen spoken of this idol of riches this idol of yours this golden image high by measureless cubits set up where your green fields of england are furnaceburnt into the likeness of the plain of dura this idol forbidden to us first of all idols by our own master and faith forbidden to us also by every human lip that has ever in any age or people been accounted of as able to speak according to the purposes of god continue to make that forbidden deity your principal one and soon no more art no more science no more pleasure will be possible catastrophe will come or worse than catastrophe slow mouldering and withering into hades but if you can fix some conception of a true human state of life to be striven forlife for all men as for yourselvesif you can determine some honest and simple order of existence following those trodden ways of wisdom which are pleasantness and seeking her quiet and withdrawn paths which are peacethen and so sanctifying wealth into commonwealth all your art your literature your daily labours your domestic affection and citizens duty will join and increase into one magnificent harmony you will know then how to build well enough you will build with stone well but with flesh better temples not made with hands but riveted of hearts and that kind of marble crimsonveined is indeed eternal  footnotes  3 it is an error to suppose that the greek worship or seeking was chiefly of beauty it was essentially of rightness and strength founded on forethought the principal character of greek art is not beauty but design and the dorian apolloworship and athenian virginworship are both expressions of adoration of divine wisdom and purity next to these great deities rank in power over the national mind dionysus and ceres the givers of human strength and life then for heroic example hercules there is no venusworship among the greek in the great times and the muses are essentially teachers of truth and of its harmonies  4 jerem xvii

5 two paths p 98     lecture iii  war  delivered at the royal military academy woolwich   young soldiers i do not doubt but that many of you came unwillingly tonight and many in merely contemptuous curiosity to hear what a writer on painting could possibly say or would venture to say respecting your great art of war you may well think within yourselves that a painter might perhaps without immodesty lecture younger painters upon painting but not young lawyers upon law nor young physicians upon medicineleast of all it may seem to you young warriors upon war and indeed when i was asked to address you i declined at first and declined long for i felt that you would not be interested in my special business and would certainly think there was small need for me to come to teach you yours nay i knew that there ought to be no such need for the great veteran soldiers of england are now men every way so thoughtful so noble and so good that no other teaching than their knightly example and their few words of grave and tried counsel should be either necessary for you or even without assurance of due modesty in the offerer endured by you  but being asked not once nor twice i have not ventured persistently to refuse and i will try in very few words to lay before you some reason why you should accept my excuse and hear me patiently you may imagine that your work is wholly foreign to and separate from mine so far from that all the pure and noble arts of peace are founded on war no great art ever yet rose on earth but among a nation of soldiers there is no art among a shepherd people if it remains at peace there is no art among an agricultural people if it remains at peace commerce is barely consistent with fine art but cannot produce it manufacture not only is unable to produce it but invariably destroys whatever seeds of it exist there is no great art possible to a nation but that which is based on battle  now though i hope you love fighting for its own sake you must i imagine be surprised at my assertion that there is any such good fruit of fighting you supposed probably that your office was to defend the works of peace but certainly not to found them nay the common course of war you may have thought was only to destroy them and truly i who tell you this of the use of war should have been the last of men to tell you so had i trusted my own experience only hear why i have given a considerable part of my life to the investigation of venetian painting and the result of that enquiry was my fixing upon one man as the greatest of all venetians and therefore as i believed of all painters whatsoever i formed this faith whether right or wrong matters at present nothing in the supremacy of the painter tintoret under a roof covered with his pictures and of those pictures three of the noblest were then in the form of shreds of ragged canvas mixed up with the laths of the roof rent through by three austrian shells now it is not every lecturer who could tell you that he had seen three of his favourite pictures torn to rags by bombshells and after such a sight it is not every lecturer who would tell you that nevertheless war was the foundation of all great art  yet the conclusion is inevitable from any careful comparison of the states of great historic races at different periods merely to show you what i mean i will sketch for you very briefly the broad steps of the advance of the best art of the world the first dawn of it is in egypt and the power of it is founded on the perpetual contemplation of death and of future judgment by the mind of a nation of which the ruling caste were priests and the second soldiers the greatest works produced by them are sculptures of their kings going out to battle or receiving the homage of conquered armies and you must remember also as one of the great keys to the splendour of the egyptian nation that the priests were not occupied in theology only their theology was the basis of practical government and law so that they were not so much priests as religious judges the office of samuel among the jews being as nearly as possible correspondent to theirs  all the rudiments of art then and much more than the rudiments of all science are laid first by this great warriornation which held in contempt all mechanical trades and in absolute hatred the peaceful life of shepherds from egypt art passes directly into greece where all poetry and all painting are nothing else than the description praise or dramatic representation of war or of the exercises which prepare for it in their connection with offices of religion all greek institutions had first respect to war and their conception of it as one necessary office of all human and divine life is expressed simply by the images of their guiding gods apollo is the god of all wisdom of the intellect he bears the arrow and the bow before he bears the lyre again athena is the goddess of all wisdom in conduct it is by the helmet and the shield oftener than by the shuttle that she is distinguished from other deities  there were however two great differences in principle between the greek and the egyptian theories of policy in greece there was no soldier caste every citizen was necessarily a soldier and again while the greeks rightly despised mechanical arts as much as the egyptians they did not make the fatal mistake of despising agricultural and pastoral life but perfectly honoured both these two conditions of truer thought raise them quite into the highest rank of wise manhood that has yet been reached for all our great arts and nearly all our great thoughts have been borrowed or derived from them take away from us what they have given and i hardly can imagine how low the modern european would stand  now you are to remember in passing to the next phase of history that though you must have war to produce artyou must also have much more than war namely an artinstinct or genius in the people and that though all the talent for painting in the world wont make painters of you unless you have a gift for fighting as well you may have the gift for fighting and none for painting now in the next great dynasty of soldiers the artinstinct is wholly wanting i have not yet investigated the roman character enough to tell you the causes of this but i believe paradoxical as it may seem to you that however truly the roman might say of himself that he was born of mars and suckled by the wolf he was nevertheless at heart more of a farmer than a soldier the exercises of war were with him practical not poetical his poetry was in domestic life only and the object of battle pacis imponere morem and the arts are extinguished in his hands and do not rise again until with gothic chivalry there comes back into the mind of europe a passionate delight in war itself for the sake of war and then with the romantic knighthood which can imagine no other noble employmentunder the fighting kings of france england and spain and under the fighting dukeships and citizenships of italy art is born again and rises to her height in the great valleys of lombardy and tuscany through which there flows not a single stream from all their alps or apennines that did not once run dark red from battle and it reaches its culminating glory in the city which gave to history the most intense type of soldiership yet seen among menthe city whose armies were led in their assault by their king led through it to victory by their king and so led though that king of theirs was blind and in the extremity of his age  and from this time forward as peace is established or extended in europe the arts decline they reach an unparalleled pitch of costliness but lose their life enlist themselves at last on the side of luxury and various corruption and among wholly tranquil nations wither utterly away remaining only in partial practice among races who like the french and us have still the minds though we cannot all live the lives of soldiers  it may be so i can suppose that a philanthropist might exclaim perish then the arts if they can flourish only at such a cost what worth is there in toys of canvas and stone if compared to the joy and peace of artless domestic life and the answer istruly in themselves none but as expressions of the highest state of the human spirit their worth is infinite as results they may be worthless but as signs they are above price for it is an assured truth that whenever the faculties of men are at their fulness they must express themselves by art and to say that a state is without such expression is to say that it is sunk from its proper level of manly nature so that when i tell you that war is the foundation of all the arts i mean also that it is the foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of men  it was very strange to me to discover this and very dreadfulbut i saw it to be quite an undeniable fact the common notion that peace and the virtues of civil life flourished together i found to be wholly untenable peace and the vices of civil life only flourish together we talk of peace and learning and of peace and plenty and of peace and civilisation but i found that those were not the words which the muse of history coupled together that on her lips the words werepeace and sensuality peace and selfishness peace and corruption peace and death i found in brief that all great nations learned their truth of word and strength of thought in war that they were nourished in war and wasted by peace taught by war and deceived by peace trained by war and betrayed by peacein a word that they were born in war and expired in peace  yet now note carefully in the second place it is not all war of which this can be saidnor all dragons teeth which sown will start up into men it is not the ravage of a barbarian wolfflock as under genseric or suwarrow nor the habitual restlessness and rapine of mountaineers as on the old borders of scotland nor the occasional struggle of a strong peaceful nation for its life as in the wars of the swiss with austria nor the contest of merely ambitious nations for extent of power as in the wars of france under napoleon or the just terminated war in america none of these forms of war build anything but tombs but the creative or foundational war is that in which the natural restlessness and love of contest among men are disciplined by consent into modes of beautifulthough it may be fatalplay in which the natural ambition and love of power of men are disciplined into the aggressive conquest of surrounding evil and in which the natural instincts of selfdefence are sanctified by the nobleness of the institutions and purity of the households which they are appointed to defend to such war as this all men are born in such war as this any man may happily die and forth from such war as this have arisen throughout the extent of past ages all the highest sanctities and virtues of humanity  i shall therefore divide the war of which i would speak to you into three heads war for exercise or play war for dominion and war for defence   i and first of war for exercise or play i speak of it primarily in this light because through all past history manly war has been more an exercise than anything else among the classes who cause and proclaim it it is not a game to the conscript or the pressed sailor but neither of these are the causers of it to the governor who determines that war shall be and to the youths who voluntarily adopt it as their profession it has always been a grand pastime and chiefly pursued because they had nothing else to do and this is true without any exception no king whose mind was fully occupied with the development of the inner resources of his kingdom or with any other sufficing subject of thought ever entered into war but on compulsion no youth who was earnestly busy with any peaceful subject of study or set on any serviceable course of action ever voluntarily became a soldier occupy him early and wisely in agriculture or business in science or in literature and he will never think of war otherwise than as a calamity but leave him idle and the more brave and active and capable he is by nature the more he will thirst for some appointed field for action and find in the passion and peril of battle the only satisfying fulfilment of his unoccupied being and from the earliest incipient civilisation until now the population of the earth divides itself when you look at it widely into two races one of workers and the other of playersone tilling the ground manufacturing building and otherwise providing for the necessities of lifethe other part proudly idle and continually therefore needing recreation in which they use the productive and laborious orders partly as their cattle and partly as their puppets or pieces in the game of death  now remember whatever virtue or goodliness there may be in this game of war rightly played there is none when you thus play it with a multitude of small human pawns  if you the gentlemen of this or any other kingdom choose to make your pastime of contest do so and welcome but set not up these unhappy peasantpieces upon the green fielded board if the wager is to be of death lay it on your own heads not theirs a goodly struggle in the olympic dust though it be the dust of the grave the gods will look upon and be with you in but they will not be with you if you sit on the sides of the amphitheatre whose steps are the mountains of earth whose arena its valleys to urge your peasant millions into gladiatorial war you also you tender and delicate women for whom and by whose command all true battle has been and must ever be you would perhaps shrink now though you need not from the thought of sitting as queens above set lists where the jousting game might be mortal how much more then ought you to shrink from the thought of sitting above a theatre pit in which even a few condemned slaves were slaying each other only for your delight and do you not shrink from the fact of sitting above a theatre pit wherenot condemned slavesbut the best and bravest of the poor sons of your people slay each othernot man to manas the coupled gladiators but race to race in duel of generations you would tell me perhaps that you do not sit to see this and it is indeed true that the women of europethose who have no heartinterests of their own at peril in the contestdraw the curtains of their boxes and muffle the openings so that from the pit of the circus of slaughter there may reach them only at intervals a halfheard cry and a murmur as of the winds sighing when myriads of souls expire they shut out the deathcries and are happy and talk wittily among themselves that is the utter literal fact of what our ladies do in their pleasant lives  nay you might answer speaking for themwe do not let these wars come to pass for our play nor by our carelessness we cannot help them how can any final quarrel of nations be settled otherwise than by war i cannot now delay to tell you how political quarrels might be otherwise settled but grant that they cannot grant that no law of reason can be understood by nations no law of justice submitted to by them and that while questions of a few acres and of petty cash can be determined by truth and equity the questions which are to issue in the perishing or saving of kingdoms can be determined only by the truth of the sword and the equity of the rifle grant this and even then judge if it will always be necessary for you to put your quarrel into the hearts of your poor and sign your treaties with peasants blood you would be ashamed to do this in your own private position and power why should you not be ashamed also to do it in public place and power if you quarrel with your neighbour and the quarrel be indeterminable by law and mortal you and he do not send your footmen to battersea fields to fight it out nor do you set fire to his tenants cottages nor spoil their goods you fight out your quarrel yourselves and at your own danger if at all and you do not think it materially affects the arbitrement that one of you has a larger household than the other so that if the servants or tenants were brought into the field with their masters the issue of the contest could not be doubtful you either refuse the private duel or you practise it under laws of honour not of physical force that so it may be in a manner justly concluded now the just or unjust conclusion of the private feud is of little moment while the just or unjust conclusion of the public feud is of eternal moment and yet in this public quarrel you take your servants sons from their arms to fight for it and your servants food from their lips to support it and the black seals on the parchment of your treaties of peace are the deserted hearth and the fruitless field there is a ghastly ludicrousness in this as there is mostly in these wide and universal crimes hear the statement of the very fact of it in the most literal words of the greatest of our english thinkers       what speaking in quite unofficial language is the      netpurport and upshot of war to my own knowledge for      example there dwell and toil in the british village of      dumdrudge usually some five hundred souls from these by      certain natural enemies of the french there are      successively selected during the french war say thirty      ablebodied men dumdrudge at her own expense has suckled      and nursed them she has not without difficulty and sorrow      fed them up to manhood and even trained them to crafts so      that one can weave another build another hammer and the      weakest can stand under thirty stone avoirdupois      nevertheless amid much weeping and swearing they are      selected all dressed in red and shipped away at the      public charges some two thousand miles or say only to the      south of spain and fed there till wanted       and now to that same spot in the south of spain are thirty      similar french artisans from a french dumdrudge in like      manner wending till at length after infinite effort the      two parties come into actual juxtaposition and thirty      stands fronting thirty each with a gun in his hand       straightway the word fire is given and they blow the      souls out of one another and in place of sixty brisk useful      craftsmen the world has sixty dead carcases which it must      bury and anon shed tears for had these men any quarrel      busy as the devil is not the smallest they lived far      enough apart were the entirest strangers nay in so wide a      universe there was even unconsciously by commerce some      mutual helpfulness between them how then simpleton their      governors had fallen out and instead of shooting one      another had the cunning to make these poor blockheads      shoot sartor resartus  positively then gentlemen the game of battle must not and shall not ultimately be played this way but should it be played any way should it if not by your servants be practised by yourselves i think yes both history and human instinct seem alike to say yes all healthy men like fighting and like the sense of danger all brave women like to hear of their fighting and of their facing danger this is a fixed instinct in the fine race of them and i cannot help fancying that fair fight is the best play for them and that a tournament was a better game than a steeplechase the time may perhaps come in france as well as here for universal hurdleraces and cricketing but i do not think universal crickets will bring out the best qualities of the nobles of either country i use in such question the test which i have adopted of the connection of war with other arts and i reflect how as a sculptor i should feel if i were asked to design a monument for a dead knight in westminster abbey with a carving of a bat at one end and a ball at the other it may be the remains in me only of savage gothic prejudice but i had rather carve it with a shield at one end and a sword at the other and this observe with no reference whatever to any story of duty done or cause defended assume the knight merely to have ridden out occasionally to fight his neighbour for exercise assume him even a soldier of fortune and to have gained his bread and filled his purse at the swords point still i feel as if it were somehow grander and worthier in him to have made his bread by sword play than any other play had rather he had made it by thrusting than by battingmuch more than by betting much rather that he should ride war horses than back race horses andi say it sternly and deliberatelymuch rather would i have him slay his neighbour than cheat him  but remember so far as this may be true the game of war is only that in which the full personal power of the human creature is brought out in management of its weapons and this for three reasons  first the great justification of this game is that it truly when well played determines who is the best manwho is the highest bred the most selfdenying the most fearless the coolest of nerve the swiftest of eye and hand you cannot test these qualities wholly unless there is a clear possibility of the struggles ending in death it is only in the fronting of that condition that the full trial of the man soul and body comes out you may go to your game of wickets or of hurdles or of cards and any knavery that is in you may stay unchallenged all the while but if the play may be ended at any moment by a lancethrust a man will probably make up his accounts a little before he enters it whatever is rotten and evil in him will weaken his hand more in holding a sword hilt than in balancing a billiard cue and on the whole the habit of living lightly hearted in daily presence of death always has had and must have a tendency both to the making and testing of honest men but for the final testing observe you must make the issue of battle strictly dependent on fineness of frame and firmness of hand you must not make it the question which of the combatants has the longest gun or which has got behind the biggest tree or which has the wind in his face or which has gunpowder made by the best chemist or iron smelted with the best coal or the angriest mob at his back decide your battle whether of nations or individuals on those termsand you have only multiplied confusion and added slaughter to iniquity but decide your battle by pure trial which has the strongest arm and steadiest heartand you have gone far to decide a great many matters besides and to decide them rightly  and the other reasons for this mode of decision of cause are the diminution both of the material destructiveness or cost and of the physical distress of war for you must not think that in speaking to you in this as you may imagine fantastic praise of battle i have overlooked the conditions weighing against me i pray all of you who have not read to read with the most earnest attention mr helpss two essays on war and government in the first volume of the last series of friends in council everything that can be urged against war is there simply exhaustively and most graphically stated and all there urged is true but the two great counts of evil alleged against war by that most thoughtful writer hold only against modern war if you have to take away masses of men from all industrial employmentto feed them by the labour of othersto move them and provide them with destructive machines varied daily in national rivalship of inventive cost if you have to ravage the country which you attackto destroy for a score of future years its roads its woods its cities and its harboursand if finally having brought masses of men counted by hundreds of thousands face to face you tear those masses to pieces with jagged shot and leave the fragments of living creatures countlessly beyond all help of surgery to starve and parch through days of torture down into clots of claywhat book of accounts shall record the cost of your workwhat book of judgment sentence the guilt of it  that i say is modern warscientific warchemical and mechanic war worse even than the savages poisoned arrow and yet you will tell me perhaps that any other war than this is impossible now it may be so the progress of science cannot perhaps be otherwise registered than by new facilities of destruction and the brotherly love of our enlarging christianity be only proved by multiplication of murder yet hear for a moment what war was in pagan and ignorant dayswhat war might yet be if we could extinguish our science in darkness and join the heathens practice to the christians theory i read you this from a book which probably most of you know well and all ought to knowmullers doriansbut i have put the points i wish you to remember in closer connection than in his text  the chief characteristic of the warriors of sparta was great composure and subdued strength the violence greek lyssa of aristodemus and isadas being considered as deserving rather of blame than praise and these qualities in general distinguished the greeks from the northern barbarians whose boldness always consisted in noise and tumult for the same reason the spartans sacrificed to the muses before an action these goddesses being expected to produce regularity and order in battle as they sacrificed on the same occasion in crete to the god of love as the confirmer of mutual esteem and shame every man put on a crown when the band of fluteplayers gave the signal for attack all the shields of the line glittered with their high polish and mingled their splendour with the dark red of the purple mantles which were meant both to adorn the combatant and to conceal the blood of the wounded to fall well and decorously being an incentive the more to the most heroic valour the conduct of the spartans in battle denotes a high and noble disposition which rejected all the extremes of brutal rage the pursuit of the enemy ceased when the victory was completed and after the signal for retreat had been given all hostilities ceased the spoiling of arms at least during the battle was also interdicted and the consecration of the spoils of slain enemies to the gods as in general all rejoicings for victory were considered as illomened  such was the war of the greatest soldiers who prayed to heathen gods what christian war is preached by christian ministers let any one tell you who saw the sacred crowning and heard the sacred fluteplaying and was inspired and sanctified by the divinelymeasured and musical language of any north american regiment preparing for its charge and what is the relative cost of life in pagan and christian wars let this one fact tell youthe spartans won the decisive battle of corinth with the loss of eight men the victors at indecisive gettysburg confess to the loss of 30000   ii i pass now to our second order of war the commonest among men that undertaken in desire of dominion and let me ask you to think for a few moments what the real meaning of this desire of dominion isfirst in the minds of kingsthen in that of nations  now mind you this firstthat i speak either about kings or masses of men with a fixed conviction that human nature is a noble and beautiful thing not a foul nor a base thing all the sin of men i esteem as their disease not their nature as a folly which may be prevented not a necessity which must be accepted and my wonder even when things are at their worst is always at the height which this human nature can attain thinking it high i find it always a higher thing than i thought it while those who think it low find it and will find it always lower than they thought it the fact being that it is infinite and capable of infinite height and infinite fall but the nature of itand here is the faith which i would have you hold with methe nature of it is in the nobleness not in the catastrophe  take the faith in its utmost terms when the captain of the london shook hands with his mate saying god speed you i will go down with my passengers that i believe to be human nature he does not do it from any religious motivefrom any hope of reward or any fear of punishment he does it because he is a man but when a mother living among the fair fields of merry england gives her twoyearold child to be suffocated under a mattress in her inner room while the said mother waits and talks outside that i believe to be not human nature you have the two extremes there shortly and you men and mothers who are here face to face with me tonight i call upon you to say which of these is human and which inhumanwhich natural and which unnatural choose your creed at once i beseech youchoose it with unshaken choicechoose it forever will you take for foundation of act and hope the faith that this man was such as god made him or that this woman was such as god made her which of them has failed from their naturefrom their present possible actual naturenot their nature of long ago but their nature of now which has betrayed itfalsified it did the guardian who died in his trust die inhumanly and as a fool and did the murderess of her child fulfil the law of her being choose i say infinitude of choices hang upon this you have had false prophets among youfor centuries you have had themsolemnly warned against them though you were false prophets who have told you that all men are nothing but fiends or wolves half beast half devil believe that and indeed you may sink to that but refuse that and have faith that god made you upright though you have sought out many inventions so you will strive daily to become more what your maker meant and means you to be and daily gives you also the power to beand you will cling more and more to the nobleness and virtue that is in you saying my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go  i have put this to you as a choice as if you might hold either of these creeds you liked best but there is in reality no choice for you the facts being quite easily ascertainable you have no business to think about this matter or to choose in it the broad fact is that a human creature of the highest race and most perfect as a human thing is invariably both kind and true and that as you lower the race you get cruelty and falseness as you get deformity and this so steadily and assuredly that the two great words which in their first use meant only perfection of race have come by consequence of the invariable connection of virtue with the fine human nature both to signify benevolence of disposition the word generous and the word gentle both in their origin meant only of pure race but because charity and tenderness are inseparable from this purity of blood the words which once stood only for pride now stand as synonyms for virtue  now this being the true power of our inherent humanity and seeing that all the aim of education should be to develop thisand seeing also what magnificent self sacrifice the higher classes of men are capable of for any cause that they understand or feelit is wholly inconceivable to me how welleducated princes who ought to be of all gentlemen the gentlest and of all nobles the most generous and whose title of royalty means only their function of doing every man righthow these i say throughout history should so rarely pronounce themselves on the side of the poor and of justice but continually maintain themselves and their own interests by oppression of the poor and by wresting of justice and how this should be accepted as so natural that the word loyalty which means faithfulness to law is used as if it were only the duty of a people to be loyal to their king and not the duty of a king to be infinitely more loyal to his people how comes it to pass that a captain will die with his passengers and lean over the gunwale to give the parting boat its course but that a king will not usually die with much less for his passengersthinks it rather incumbent on his passengers in any number to die for him think i beseech you of the wonder of this the sea captain not captain by divine right but only by companys appointmentnot a man of royal descent but only a plebeian who can steernot with the eyes of the world upon him but with feeble chance depending on one poor boat of his name being ever heard above the wash of the fatal wavesnot with the cause of a nation resting on his act but helpless to save so much as a child from among the lost crowd with whom he resolves to be lostyet goes down quietly to his grave rather than break his faith to these few emigrants but your captain by divine rightyour captain with the hues of a hundred shields of kings upon his breastyour captain whose every deed brave or base will be illuminated or branded for ever before unescapable eyes of menyour captain whose every thought and act are beneficent or fatal from sunrising to setting blessing as the sunshine or shadowing as the nightthis captain as you find him in history for the most part thinks only how he may tax his passengers and sit at most ease in his state cabin  for observe if there had been indeed in the hearts of the rulers of great multitudes of men any such conception of work for the good of those under their command as there is in the good and thoughtful masters of any small company of men not only wars for the sake of mere increase of power could never take place but our idea of power itself would be entirely altered do you suppose that to think and act even for a million of men to hear their complaints watch their weaknesses restrain their vices make laws for them lead them day by day to purer life is not enough for one mans work if any of us were absolute lord only of a district of a hundred miles square and were resolved on doing our utmost for it making it feed as large a number of people as possible making every clod productive and every rock defensive and every human being happy should we not have enough on our hands think you but if the ruler has any other aim than this if careless of the result of his interference he desire only the authority to interfere and regardless of what is illdone or welldone cares only that it shall be done at his biddingif he would rather do two hundred miles space of mischief than one hundred miles space of good of course he will try to add to his territory and to add inimitably but does he add to his power do you call it power in a child if he is allowed to play with the wheels and bands of some vast engine pleased with their murmur and whirl till his unwise touch wandering where it ought not scatters beam and wheel into ruin yet what machine is so vast so incognisable as the working of the mind of a nation what childs touch so wanton as the word of a selfish king and yet how long have we allowed the historian to speak of the extent of the calamity a man causes as a just ground for his pride and to extol him as the greatest prince who is only the centre of the widest error follow out this thought by yourselves and you will find that all power properly so called is wise and benevolent there may be capacity in a drifting fireship to destroy a fleet there may be venom enough in a dead body to infect a nationbut which of you the most ambitious would desire a drifting kinghood robed in consuming fire or a poisondipped sceptre whose touch was mortal there is no true potency remember but that of help nor true ambition but ambition to save  and then observe farther this true power the power of saving depends neither on multitude of men nor on extent of territory we are continually assuming that nations become strong according to their numbers they indeed become so if those numbers can be made of one mind but how are you sure you can stay them in one mind and keep them from having north and south minds grant them unanimous how know you they will be unanimous in right if they are unanimous in wrong the more they are essentially the weaker they are or suppose that they can neither be of one mind nor of two minds but can only be of no mind suppose they are a more helpless mob tottering into precipitant catastrophe like a waggon load of stones when the wheel comes off dangerous enough for their neighbours certainly but not powerful  neither does strength depend on extent of territory any more than upon number of population take up your maps when you go home this eveningput the cluster of british isles beside the mass of south america and then consider whether any race of men need care how much ground they stand upon the strength is in the men and in their unity and virtue not in their standing room a little group of wise hearts is better than a wilderness full of fools and only that nation gains true territory which gains itself  and now for the brief practical outcome of all this remember no government is ultimately strong but in proportion to its kindness and justice and that a nation does not strengthen by merely multiplying and diffusing itself we have not strengthened as yet by multiplying into america nay even when it has not to encounter the separating conditions of emigration a nation need not boast itself of multiplying on its own ground if it multiplies only as flies or locusts do with the god of flies for its god it multiplies its strength only by increasing as one great family in perfect fellowship and brotherhood and lastly it does not strengthen itself by seizing dominion over races whom it cannot benefit austria is not strengthened but weakened by her grasp of lombardy and whatever apparent increase of majesty and of wealth may have accrued to us from the possession of india whether these prove to us ultimately power or weakness depends wholly on the degree in which our influence on the native race shall be benevolent and exalting but as it is at their own peril that any race extends their dominion in mere desire of power so it is at their own still greater peril that they refuse to undertake aggressive war according to their force whenever they are assured that their authority would be helpful and protective nor need you listen to any sophistical objection of the impossibility of knowing when a peoples help is needed or when not make your national conscience clean and your national eyes will soon be clear no man who is truly ready to take part in a noble quarrel will ever stand long in doubt by whom or in what cause his aid is needed i hold it my duty to make no political statement of any special bearing in this presence but i tell you broadly and boldly that within these last ten years we english have as a knightly nation lost our spurs we have fought where we should not have fought for gain and we have been passive where we should not have been passive for fear i tell you that the principle of nonintervention as now preached among us is as selfish and cruel as the worst frenzy of conquest and differs from it only by being not only malignant but dastardly  i know however that my opinions on this subject differ too widely from those ordinarily held to be any farther intruded upon you and therefore i pass lastly to examine the conditions of the third kind of noble warwar waged simply for defence of the country in which we were born and for the maintenance and execution of her laws by whomsoever threatened or defied it is to this duty that i suppose most men entering the army consider themselves in reality to be bound and i want you now to reflect what the laws of mere defence are and what the soldiers duty as now understood or supposed to be understood you have solemnly devoted yourselves to be english soldiers for the guardianship of england i want you to feel what this vow of yours indeed means or is gradually coming to mean you take it upon you first while you are sentimental schoolboys you go into your military convent or barracks just as a girl goes into her convent while she is a sentimental schoolgirl neither of you then know what you are about though both the good soldiers and good nuns make the best of it afterwards you dont understand perhaps why i call you sentimental schoolboys when you go into the army because on the whole it is love of adventure of excitement of fine dress and of the pride of fame all which are sentimental motives which chiefly make a boy like going into the guards better than into a countinghouse you fancy perhaps that there is a severe sense of duty mixed with these peacocky motives and in the best of you there is but do not think that it is principal if you cared to do your duty to your country in a prosaic and unsentimental way depend upon it there is now truer duty to be done in raising harvests than in burning them more in building houses than in shelling themmore in winning money by your own work wherewith to help men than in taxing other peoples work for money wherewith to slay men more duty finally in honest and unselfish living than in honest and unselfish dying though that seems to your boys eyes the bravest so far then as for your own honour and the honour of your families you choose brave death in a red coat before brave life in a black one you are sentimental and now see what this passionate vow of yours comes to for a little while you ride and you hunt tigers or savages you shoot and are shot you are happy and proud always and honoured and wept if you die and you are satisfied with your life and with the end of it believing on the whole that good rather than harm of it comes to others and much pleasure to you but as the sense of duty enters into your forming minds the vow takes another aspect you find that you have put yourselves into the hand of your country as a weapon you have vowed to strike when she bids you and to stay scabbarded when she bids you all that you need answer for is that you fail not in her grasp and there is goodness in this and greatness if you can trust the hand and heart of the britomart who has braced you to her side and are assured that when she leaves you sheathed in darkness there is no need for your flash to the sun but remember good and noble as this state may be it is a state of slavery there are different kinds of slaves and different masters some slaves are scourged to their work by whips others are scourged to it by restlessness or ambition it does not matter what the whip is it is none the less a whip because you have cut thongs for it out of your own souls the fact so far of slavery is in being driven to your work without thought at anothers bidding again some slaves are bought with money and others with praise it matters not what the purchasemoney is the distinguishing sign of slavery is to have a price and be bought for it again it matters not what kind of work you are set on some slaves are set to forced diggings others to forced marches some dig furrows others fieldworks and others graves some press the juice of reeds and some the juice of vines and some the blood of men the fact of the captivity is the same whatever work we are set upon though the fruits of the toil may be different but remember in thus vowing ourselves to be the slaves of any master it ought to be some subject of forethought with us what work he is likely to put us upon you may think that the whole duty of a soldier is to be passive that it is the country you have left behind who is to command and you have only to obey but are you sure that you have left all your country behind or that the part of it you have so left is indeed the best part of it supposeand remember it is quite conceivablethat you yourselves are indeed the best part of england that you who have become the slaves ought to have been the masters and that those who are the masters ought to have been the slaves if it is a noble and wholehearted england whose bidding you are bound to do it is well but if you are yourselves the best of her heart and the england you have left be but a halfhearted england how say you of your obedience you were too proud to become shopkeepers are you satisfied then to become the servants of shopkeepers you were too proud to become merchants or farmers yourselves will you have merchants or farmers then for your field marshals you had no gifts of special grace for exeter hall will you have some gifted person thereat for your commanderinchief to judge of your work and reward it you imagine yourselves to be the army of england how if you should find yourselves at last only the police of her manufacturing towns and the beadles of her little bethels  it is not so yet nor will be so i trust for ever but what i want you to see and to be assured of is that the ideal of soldiership is not mere passive obedience and bravery that so far from this no country is in a healthy state which has separated even in a small degree her civil from her military power all states of the world however great fall at once when they use mercenary armies and although it is a less instant form of error because involving no national taint of cowardice it is yet an error no less ultimately fatalit is the error especially of modern times of which we cannot yet know all the calamitous consequencesto take away the best blood and strength of the nation all the soulsubstance of it that is brave and careless of reward and scornful of pain and faithful in trust and to cast that into steel and make a mere sword of it taking away its voice and will but to keep the worst part of the nationwhatever is cowardly avaricious sensual and faithlessand to give to this the voice to this the authority to this the chief privilege where there is least capacity of thought the fulfilment of your vow for the defence of england will by no means consist in carrying out such a system you are not true soldiers if you only mean to stand at a shop door to protect shopboys who are cheating inside a soldiers vow to his country is that he will die for the guardianship of her domestic virtue of her righteous laws and of her anyway challenged or endangered honour a state without virtue without laws and without honour he is bound not to defend nay bound to redress by his own right hand that which he sees to be base in her so sternly is this the law of nature and life that a nation once utterly corrupt can only be redeemed by a military despotismnever by talking nor by its free effort and the health of any state consists simply in this that in it those who are wisest shall also be strongest its rulers should be also its soldiers or rather by force of intellect more than of sword its soldiers its rulers whatever the hold which the aristocracy of england has on the heart of england in that they are still always in front of her battles this hold will not be enough unless they are also in front of her thoughts and truly her thoughts need good captains leading now if ever do you know what by this beautiful division of labour her brave men fighting and her cowards thinking she has come at last to think here is a bit of paper in my hand6 a good one too and an honest one quite representative of the best common public thought of england at this moment and it is holding forth in one of its leaders upon our social welfareupon our vivid lifeupon the political supremacy of great britain and what do you think all these are owing to to what our english sires have done for us and taught us age after age no not to that to our honesty of heart or coolness of head or steadiness of will no not to these to our thinkers or our statesmen or our poets or our captains or our martyrs or the patient labour of our poor no not to these or at least not to these in any chief measure nay says the journal more than any agency it is the cheapness and abundance of our coal which have made us what we are if it be so then ashes to ashes be our epitaph and the sooner the better i tell you gentlemen of england if ever you would have your country breathe the pure breath of heaven again and receive again a soul into her body instead of rotting into a carcase blown up in the belly with carbonic acid and great that way you must think and feel for your england as well as fight for her you must teach her that all the true greatness she ever had or ever can have she won while her fields were green and her faces ruddythat greatness is still possible for englishmen even though the ground be not hollow under their feet nor the sky black over their headsand that when the day comes for their country to lay her honours in the dust her crest will not rise from it more loftily because it is dust of coal gentlemen i tell you solemnly that the day is coming when the soldiers of england must be her tutors and the captains of her army captains also of her mind  and now remember you soldier youths who are thus in all ways the hope of your country or must be if she have any hope remember that your fitness for all future trust depends upon what you are now no good soldier in his old age was ever careless or indolent in his youth many a giddy and thoughtless boy has become a good bishop or a good lawyer or a good merchant but no such an one ever became a good general i challenge you in all history to find a record of a good soldier who was not grave and earnest in his youth and in general i have no patience with people who talk about the thoughtlessness of youth indulgently i had infinitely rather hear of thoughtless old age and the indulgence due to that when a man has done his work and nothing can any way be materially altered in his fate let him forget his toil and jest with his fate if he will but what excuse can you find for wilfulness of thought at the very time when every crisis of future fortune hangs on your decisions a youth thoughtless when all the happiness of his home for ever depends on the chances or the passions of an hour a youth thoughtless when the career of all his days depends on the opportunity of a moment a youth thoughtless when his every act is a foundationstone of future conduct and every imagination a fountain of life or death be thoughtless in any after years rather than nowthough indeed there is only one place where a man may be nobly thoughtlesshis deathbed no thinking should ever be left to be done there  having then resolved that you will not waste recklessly but earnestly use these early days of yours remember that all the duties of her children to england may be summed in two wordsindustry and honour i say first industry for it is in this that soldier youth are especially tempted to fail yet surely there is no reason because your life may possibly or probably be shorter than other mens that you should therefore waste more recklessly the portion of it that is granted you neither do the duties of your profession which require you to keep your bodies strong in any wise involve the keeping of your minds weak so far from that the experience the hardship and the activity of a soldiers life render his powers of thought more accurate than those of other men and while for others all knowledge is often little more than a means of amusement there is no form of science which a soldier may not at some time or other find bearing on business of life and death a young mathematician may be excused for langour in studying curves to be described only with a pencil but not in tracing those which are to be described with a rocket your knowledge of a wholesome herb may involve the feeding of an army and acquaintance with an obscure point of geography the success of a campaign never waste an instants time therefore the sin of idleness is a thousandfold greater in you than in other youths for the fates of those who will one day be under your command hang upon your knowledge lost moments now will be lost lives then and every instant which you carelessly take for play you buy with blood but there is one way of wasting time of all the vilest because it wastes not time only but the interest and energy of your minds of all the ungentlemanly habits into which you can fall the vilest is betting or interesting yourselves in the issues of betting it unites nearly every condition of folly and vice you concentrate your interest upon a matter of chance instead of upon a subject of true knowledge and you back opinions which you have no grounds for forming merely because they are your own all the insolence of egotism is in this and so far as the love of excitement is complicated with the hope of winning money you turn yourselves into the basest sort of tradesmenthose who live by speculation were there no other ground for industry this would be a sufficient one that it protected you from the temptation to so scandalous a vice work faithfully and you will put yourselves in possession of a glorious and enlarging happiness not such as can be won by the speed of a horse or marred by the obliquity of a ball  first then by industry you must fulfil your vow to your country but all industry and earnestness will be useless unless they are consecrated by your resolution to be in all things men of honour not honour in the common sense only but in the highest rest on the force of the two main words in the great verse integer vit√¶ scelerisque purus you have vowed your life to england give it her whollya bright stainless perfect lifea knightly life because you have to fight with machines instead of lances there may be a necessity for more ghastly danger but there is none for less worthiness of character than in olden time you may be true knights yet though perhaps not equites you may have to call yourselves cannonry instead of chivalry but that is no reason why you should not call yourselves true men so the first thing you have to see to in becoming soldiers is that you make yourselves wholly true courage is a mere matter of course among any ordinarily wellborn youths but neither truth nor gentleness is matter of course you must bind them like shields about your necks you must write them on the tables of your hearts though it be not exacted of you yet exact it of yourselves this vow of stainless truth your hearts are if you leave them unstirred as tombs in which a god lies buried vow yourselves crusaders to redeem that sacred sepulchre and remember before all thingsfor no other memory will be so protective of youthat the highest law of this knightly truth is that under which it is vowed to women whomsoever else you deceive whomsoever you injure whomsoever you leave unaided you must not deceive nor injure nor leave unaided according to your power any woman of whatever rank believe me every virtue of the higher phases of manly character begins in thisin truth and modesty before the face of all maidens in truth and pity or truth and reverence to all womanhood  and now let me turn for a moment to youwives and maidens who are the souls of soldiers to youmothers who have devoted your children to the great hierarchy of war let me ask you to consider what part you have to take for the aid of those who love you for if you fail in your part they cannot fulfil theirs such absolute helpmates you are that mo man can stand without that help nor labour in his own strength  i know your hearts and that the truth of them never fails when an hour of trial comes which you recognise for such but you know not when the hour of trial first finds you nor when it verily finds you you imagine that you are only called upon to wait and to suffer to surrender and to mourn you know that you must not weaken the hearts of your husbands and lovers even by the one fear of which those hearts are capablethe fear of parting from you or of causing you grief through weary years of separation through fearful expectancies of unknown fate through the tenfold bitterness of the sorrow which might so easily have been joy and the tenfold yearning for glorious life struck down in its primethrough all these agonies you fail not and never will fail but your trial is not in these to be heroic in danger is littleyou are englishwomen to be heroic in change and sway of fortune is littlefor do you not love to be patient through the great chasm and pause of loss is littlefor do you not still love in heaven but to be heroic in happiness to bear yourselves gravely and righteously in the dazzling of the sunshine of morning not to forget the god in whom you trust when he gives you most not to fail those who trust you when they seem to need you least this is the difficult fortitude it is not in the pining of absence not in the peril of battle not in the wasting of sickness that your prayer should be most passionate or your guardianship most tender pray mothers and maidens for your young soldiers in the bloom of their pride pray for them while the only dangers round them are in their own wayward wills watch you and pray when they have to face not death but temptation but it is this fortitude also for which there is the crowning reward believe me the whole course and character of your lovers lives is in your hands what you would have them be they shall be if you not only desire to have them so but deserve to have them so for they are but mirrors in which you will see yourselves imaged if you are frivolous they will be so also if you have no understanding of the scope of their duty they also will forget it they will listenthey can listento no other interpretation of it than that uttered from your lips bid them be bravethey will be brave for you bid them be cowards and how noble soever they bethey will quail for you bid them be wise and they will be wise for you mock at their counsel they will be fools for you such and so absolute is your rule over them you fancy perhaps as you have been told so often that a wifes rule should only be over her husbands house not over his mind ah no the true rule is just the reverse of that a true wife in her husbands house is his servant it is in his heart that she is queen whatever of the best he can conceive it is her part to be whatever of highest he can hope it is hers to promise all that is dark in him she must purge into purity all that is failing in him she must strengthen into truth from her through all the worlds clamour he must win his praise in her through all the worlds warfare he must find his peace  and now but one word more you may wonder perhaps that i have spoken all this night in praise of war yet truly if it might be i for one would fain join in the cadence of hammerstrokes that should beat swords into ploughshares and that this cannot be is not the fault of us men it is your fault wholly yours only by your command or by your permission can any contest take place among us and the real final reason for all the poverty misery and rage of battle throughout europe is simply that you women however good however religious however selfsacrificing for those whom you love are too selfish and too thoughtless to take pains for any creature out of your own immediate circles you fancy that you are sorry for the pain of others now i just tell you this that if the usual course of war instead of unroofing peasants houses and ravaging peasants fields merely broke the china upon your own drawingroom tables no war in civilised countries would last a week i tell you more that at whatever moment you chose to put a period to war you could do it with less trouble than you take any day to go out to dinner you know or at least you might know if you would think that every battle you hear of has made many widows and orphans we have none of us heart enough truly to mourn with these but at least we might put on the outer symbols of mourning with them let but every christian lady who has conscience toward god vow that she will mourn at least outwardly for his killed creatures your praying is useless and your churchgoing mere mockery of god if you have not plain obedience in you enough for this let every lady in the upper classes of civilised europe simply vow that while any cruel war proceeds she will wear blacka mutes blackwith no jewel no ornament no excuse for or evasion into prettinessi tell you again no war would last a week  and lastly you women of england are all now shrieking with one voiceyou and your clergymen togetherbecause you hear of your bibles being attacked if you choose to obey your bibles you will never care who attacks them it is just because you never fulfil a single downright precept of the book that you are so careful for its credit and just because you dont care to obey its whole words that you are so particular about the letters of them the bible tells you to dress plainlyand you are mad for finery the bible tells you to have pity on the poorand you crush them under your carriagewheels the bible tells you to do judgment and justiceand you do not know nor care to know so much as what the bible word justice means do but learn so much of gods truth as that comes to know what he means when he tells you to be just and teach your sons that their bravery is but a fools boast and their deeds but a firebrands tossing unless they are indeed just men and perfect in the fear of godand you will soon have no more war unless it be indeed such as is willed by him of whom though prince of peace it is also written in righteousness he doth judge and make war  footnotes  6 i do not care to refer to the journal quoted because the article was unworthy of its general tone though in order to enable the audience to verify the quoted sentence i left the number containing it on the table when i delivered this lecture but a saying of baron liebigs quoted at the head of a leader on the same subject in the daily telegraph of january 11 1866 summarily digests and presents the maximum folly of modern thought in this respect civilization says the baron is the economy of power and english power is coal not altogether so my chemical friend civilization is the making of civil persons which is a kind of distillation of which alembics are incapable and does not at all imply the turning of a small company of gentlemen into a large company of ironmongers and english power what little of it may be left is by no means coal but indeed of that which when the whole world turns to coal then chiefly lives     munera pulveris  six essays  on the elements of  political economy     preface   the following pages contain i believe the first accurate analysis of the laws of political economy which has been published in england many treatises within their scope correct have appeared in contradiction of the views popularly received but no exhaustive examination of the subject was possible to any person unacquainted with the value of the products of the highest industries commonly called the fine arts and no one acquainted with the nature of those industries has so far as i know attempted or even approached the task  so that to the date 1863 when these essays were published not only the chief conditions of the production of wealth had remained unstated but the nature of wealth itself had never been defined every one has a notion sufficiently correct for common purposes of what is meant by wealth wrote mr mill in the outset of his treatise and contentedly proceeded as if a chemist should proceed to investigate the laws of chemistry without endeavouring to ascertain the nature of fire or water because every one had a notion of them sufficiently correct for common purposes  but even that apparently indisputable statement was untrue there is not one person in ten thousand who has a notion sufficiently correct even for the commonest purposes of what is meant by wealth still less of what wealth everlastingly is whether we mean it or not which it is the business of every student of economy to ascertain we indeed know either by experience or in imagination what it is to be able to provide ourselves with luxurious food and handsome clothes and if mr mill had thought that wealth consisted only in these or in the means of obtaining these it would have been easy for him to have so defined it with perfect scientific accuracy but he knew better he knew that some kinds of wealth consisted in the possession or power of obtaining other things than these but having in the studies of his life no clue to the principles of essential value he was compelled to take public opinion as the ground of his science and the public of course willingly accepted the notion of a science founded on their opinions  i had on the contrary a singular advantage not only in the greater extent of the field of investigation opened to me by my daily pursuits but in the severity of some lessons i accidentally received in the course of them  when in the winter of 1851 i was collecting materials for my work on venetian architecture three of the pictures of tintoret on the roof of the school of st roch were hanging down in ragged fragments mixed with lath and plaster round the apertures made by the fall of three austrian heavy shot the city of venice was not it appeared rich enough to repair the damage that winter and buckets were set on the floor of the upper room of the school to catch the rain which not only fell directly through the shot holes but found its way owing to the generally pervious state of the roof through many of the canvases of tintorets in other parts of the ceiling  it was a lesson to me as i have just said no less direct than severe for i knew already at that time though i have not ventured to assert until recently at oxford that the pictures of tintoret in venice were accurately the most precious articles of wealth in europe being the best existing productions of human industry now at the time that three of them were thus fluttering in moist rags from the roof they had adorned the shops of the rue rivoli at paris were in obedience to a steadilyincreasing public demand beginning to show a steadilyincreasing supply of elaboratelyfinished and coloured lithographs representing the modern dances of delight among which the cancan has since taken a distinguished place  the labour employed on the stone of one of these lithographs is very much more than tintoret was in the habit of giving to a picture of average size considering labour as the origin of value therefore the stone so highly wrought would be of greater value than the picture and since also it is capable of producing a large number of immediately saleable or exchangeable impressions for which the demand is constant the city of paris naturally supposed itself and on all hitherto believed or stated principles of political economy was infinitely richer in the possession of a large number of these lithographic stones not to speak of countless oil pictures and marble carvings of similar character than venice in the possession of those rags of mildewed canvas flaunting in the south wind and its salt rain and accordingly paris provided without thought of the expense lofty arcades of shops and rich recesses of innumerable private apartments for the protection of these better treasures of hers from the weather  yet all the while paris was not the richer for these possessions intrinsically the delightful lithographs were not wealth but polar contraries of wealth she was by the exact quantity of labour she had given to produce these sunk below instead of above absolute poverty they not only were false richesthey were true debt which had to be paid at lastand the present aspect of the rue rivoli shows in what manner  and the faded stains of the venetian ceiling all the while were absolute and inestimable wealth useless to their possessors as forgotten treasure in a buried city they had in them nevertheless the intrinsic and eternal nature of wealth and venice still possessing the ruins of them was a rich city only the venetians had not a notion sufficiently correct even for the very common purpose of inducing them to put slates on a roof of what was meant by wealth  the vulgar economist would reply that his science had nothing to do with the qualities of pictures but with their exchangevalue only and that his business was exclusively to consider whether the remains of tintoret were worth as many tenandsixpences as the impressions which might be taken from the lithographic stones  but he would not venture without reserve to make such an answer if the example be taken in horses instead of pictures the most dull economist would perceive and admit that a gentleman who had a fine stud of horses was absolutely richer than one who had only illbred and brokenwinded ones he would instinctively feel though his pseudoscience had never taught him that the price paid for the animals in either case did not alter the fact of their worth that the good horse though it might have been bought by chance for a few guineas was not therefore less valuable nor the owner of the galled jade any the richer because he had given a hundred for it  so that the economist in saying that his science takes no account of the qualities of pictures merely signifies that he cannot conceive of any quality of essential badness or goodness existing in pictures and that he is incapable of investigating the laws of wealth in such articles which is the fact but being incapable of defining intrinsic value in pictures it follows that he must be equally helpless to define the nature of intrinsic value in painted glass or in painted pottery or in patterned stuffs or in any other national produce requiring true human ingenuity nay though capable of conceiving the idea of intrinsic value with respect to beasts of burden no economist has endeavoured to state the general principles of national economy even with regard to the horse or the ass and in fine the modern political economists have been without exception incapable of apprehending the nature of intrinsic value at all  and the first specialty of the following treatise consists in its giving at the outset and maintaining as the foundation of all subsequent reasoning a definition of intrinsic value and intrinsic contraryofvalue the negative power having been left by former writers entirely out of account and the positive power left entirely undefined  but secondly the modern economist ignoring intrinsic value and accepting the popular estimate of things as the only ground of his science has imagined himself to have ascertained the constant laws regulating the relation of this popular demand to its supply or at least to have proved that demand and supply were connected by heavenly balance over which human foresight had no power i chanced by singular coincidence lately to see this theory of the law of demand and supply brought to as sharp practical issue in another great siege as i had seen the theories of intrinsic value brought in the siege of venice  i had the honour of being on the committee under the presidentship of the lord mayor of london for the victualling of paris after her surrender it became at one period of our sittings a question of vital importance at what moment the law of demand and supply would come into operation and what the operation of it would exactly be the demand on this occasion being very urgent indeed that of several millions of people within a few hours of utter starvation for any kind of food whatsoever nevertheless it was admitted in the course of debate to be probable that the divine principle of demand and supply might find itself at the eleventh hour and some minutes over in want of carts and horses and we ventured so far to interfere with the divine principle as to provide carts and horses with haste which proved happily in time for the need but not a moment in advance of it it was farther recognized by the committee that the divine principle of demand and supply would commence its operations by charging the poor of paris twelvepence for a pennys worth of whatever they wanted and would end its operations by offering them twelvepence worth for a penny of whatever they didnt want whereupon it was concluded by the committee that the tiny knot on this special occasion was scarcely dignus vindice by the divine principle of demand and supply and that we would venture for once in a profane manner to provide for the poor of paris what they wanted when they wanted it which to the value of the sums entrusted to us it will be remembered we succeeded in doing  but the fact is that the socalled law which was felt to be false in this case of extreme exigence is alike false in cases of less exigence it is false always and everywhere nay to such an extent is its existence imaginary that the vulgar economists are not even agreed in their account of it for some of them mean by it only that prices are regulated by the relation between demand and supply which is partly true and others mean that the relation itself is one with the process of which it is unwise to interfere a statement which is not only as in the above instance untrue but accurately the reverse of the truth for all wise economy political or domestic consists in the resolved maintenance of a given relation between supply and demand other than the instinctive or directly natural one  similarly vulgar political economy asserts for a law that wages are determined by competition  now i pay my servants exactly what wages i think necessary to make them comfortable the sum is not determined at all by competition but sometimes by my notions of their comfort and deserving and sometimes by theirs if i were to become penniless tomorrow several of them would certainly still serve me for nothing  in both the real and supposed cases the socalled law of vulgar political economy is absolutely set at defiance but i cannot set the law of gravitation at defiance nor determine that in my house i will not allow ice to melt when the temperature is above thirtytwo degrees a true law outside of my house will remain a true one inside of it it is not therefore a law of nature that wages are determined by competition still less is it a law of state or we should not now be disputing about it publicly to the loss of many millions of pounds to the country the fact which vulgar economists have been weak enough to imagine a law is only that for the last twenty years a number of very senseless persons have attempted to determine wages in that manner and have in a measure succeeded in occasionally doing so  both in definition of the elements of wealth and in statement of the laws which govern its distribution modern political economy has been thus absolutely incompetent or absolutely false and the following treatise is not as it has been asserted with dull pertinacity an endeavour to put sentiment in the place of science but it contains the exposure of what insolently pretended to be a science and the definition hitherto unassailedand i do not fear to assert unassailableof the material elements with which political economy has to deal and the moral principles in which it consists being not itself a science but a system of conduct founded on the sciences and impossible except under certain conditions of moral culture which is only to say that industry frugality and discretion the three foundations of economy are moral qualities and cannot be attained without moral discipline a flat truism the reader may think thus stated yet a truism which is denied both vociferously and in all endeavour by the entire populace of europe who are at present hopeful of obtaining wealth by tricks of trade without industry who possessing wealth have lost in the use of it even the conceptionhow much more the habitof frugality and who in the choice of the elements of wealth cannot so much as losesince they have never hitherto at any time possessedthe faculty of discretion  now if the teachers of the pseudoscience of economy had ventured to state distinctly even the poor conclusions they had reached on the subjects respecting which it is most dangerous for a populace to be indiscreet they would have soon found by the use made of them which were true and which false  but on main and vital questions no political economist has hitherto ventured to state one guiding principle i will instance three subjects of universal importance national dress national rent national debt  now if we are to look in any quarter for a systematic and exhaustive statement of the principles of a given science it must certainly be from its professor at cambridge  take the last edition of professor fawcetts manual of political economy and forming first clearly in your mind these three following questions see if you can find an answer to them  i does expenditure of capital on the production of luxurious dress and furniture tend to make a nation rich or poor  ii does the payment by the nation of a tax on its land or on the produce of it to a certain number of private persons to be expended by them as they please tend to make the nation rich or poor  iii does the payment by the nation for an indefinite period of interest on money borrowed from private persons tend to make the nation rich or poor  these three questions are all of them perfectly simple and primarily vital determine these and you have at once a basis for national conduct in all important particulars leave them undetermined and there is no limit to the distress which may be brought upon the people by the cunning of its knaves and the folly of its multitudes  i will take the three in their order   i dress the general impression on the public mind at this day is that the luxury of the rich in dress and furniture is a benefit to the poor probably not even the blindest of our political economists would venture to assert this in so many words but where do they assert the contrary during the entire period of the reign of the late emperor it was assumed in france as the first principle of fiscal government that a large portion of the funds received as rent from the provincial labourer should be expended in the manufacture of ladies dresses in paris where is the political economist in france or england who ventured to assert the conclusions of his science as adverse to this system as early as the year 1857 i had done my best to show the nature of the error and to give warning of its danger7 but not one of the men who had the foolish ears of the people intent on their words dared to follow me in speaking what would have been an offence to the powers of trade and the powers of trade in paris had their full way for fourteen years morewith this result todayas told us in precise and curt terms by the minister of public instruction8       we have replaced glory by gold work by speculation faith      and honour by scepticism to absolve or glorify immorality      to make much of loose women to gratify our eyes with      luxury our ears with the tales of orgies to aid in the      manoeuvres of public robbers or to applaud them to laugh      at morality and only believe in success to love nothing      but pleasure adore nothing but force to replace work with      a fecundity of fancies to speak without thinking to prefer      noise to glory to erect sneering into a system and lying      into an institutionis this the spectacle that we have      seenis this the society that we have been  of course other causes besides the desire of luxury in furniture and dress have been at work to produce such consequences but the most active cause of all has been the passion for these passion unrebuked by the clergy and for the most part provoked by economists as advantageous to commerce nor need we think that such results have been arrived at in france only we are ourselves following rapidly on the same road france in her old wars with us never was so fatally our enemy as she has been in the fellowship of fashion and the freedom of trade nor to my mind is any fact recorded of assyrian or roman luxury more ominous or ghastly than one which came to my knowledge a few weeks ago in england a respectable and welltodo father and mother in a quiet north country town being turned into the streets in their old age at the suit of their only daughters milliner   ii rent the following account of the real nature of rent is given quite accurately by professor fawcett at page 112 of the last edition of his political economy       every country has probably been subjugated and grants of      vanquished territory were the ordinary rewards which the      conquering chief bestowed upon his more distinguished      followers lands obtained by force had to be defended by      force and before law had asserted her supremacy and      property was made secure no baron was able to retain his      possessions unless those who lived on his estates were      prepared to defend them9 as property became secure      and landlords felt that the power of the state would protect      them in all the rights of property every vestige of these      feudal tenures was abolished and the relation between      landlord and tenant has thus become purely commercial a      landlord offers his land to any one who is willing to take      it he is anxious to receive the highest rent he can obtain      what are the principles which regulate the rent which may      thus be paid  these principles the professor goes on contentedly to investigate never appearing to contemplate for an instant the possibility of the first principle in the whole businessthe maintenance by force of the possession of land obtained by force being ever called in question by any human mind it is nevertheless the nearest task of our day to discover how far original theft may be justly encountered by reactionary theft or whether reactionary theft be indeed theft at all and farther what excluding either original or corrective theft are the just conditions of the possession of land   iii debt long since when a mere boy i used to sit silently listening to the conversation of the london merchants who all of them good and sound men of business were wont occasionally to meet round my fathers diningtable nothing used to surprise me more than the conviction openly expressed by some of the soundest and most cautious of them that if there were no national debt they would not know what to do with their money or where to place it safely at the 399th page of his manual you will find professor fawcett giving exactly the same statement       in our own country this certainty against risk of loss is      provided by the public funds  and again as on the question of rent the professor proceeds without appearing for an instant to be troubled by any misgiving that there may be an essential difference between the effects on national prosperity of a government paying interest on money which it spent in fire works fifty years ago and of a government paying interest on money to be employed today on productive labour  that difference which the reader will find stated and examined at length in ¬ß¬ß 127129 of this volume it is the business of economists before approaching any other question relating to government fully to explain and the paragraphs to which i refer contain i believe the only definite statement of it hitherto made  the practical result of the absence of any such statement is that capitalists when they do not know what to do with their money persuade the peasants in various countries that the said peasants want guns to shoot each other with the peasants accordingly borrow guns out of the manufacture of which the capitalists get a percentage and men of science much amusement and credit then the peasants shoot a certain number of each other until they get tired and burn each others homes down in various places then they put the guns back into towers arsenals c in ornamental patterns and the victorious party put also some ragged flags in churches and then the capitalists tax both annually ever afterwards to pay interest on the loan of the guns and gunpowder and that is what capitalists call knowing what to do with their money and what commercial men in general call practical as opposed to sentimental political economy  eleven years ago in the summer of 1860 perceiving then fully as carlyle had done long before what distress was about to come on the said populace of europe through these errors of their teachers i began to do the best i might to combat them in the series of papers for the cornhill magazine since published under the title of unto this last the editor of the magazine was my friend and ventured the insertion of the three first essays but the outcry against them became then too strong for any editor to endure and he wrote to me with great discomfort to himself and many apologies to me that the magazine must only admit one economical essay more  i made with his permission the last one longer than the rest and gave it blunt conclusion as well as i couldand so the book now stands but as i had taken not a little pains with the essays and knew that they contained better work than most of my former writings and more important truths than all of them put together this violent reprobation of them by the cornhill public set me still more gravely thinking and after turning the matter hither and thither in my mind for two years more i resolved to make it the central work of my life to write an exhaustive treatise on political economy it would not have been begun at that time however had not the editor of frasers magazine written to me saying that he believed there was something in my theories and would risk the admission of what i chose to write on this dangerous subject whereupon cautiously and at intervals during the winter of 186263 i sent him and he ventured to print the preface of the intended work divided into four chapters then though the editor had not wholly lost courage the publisher indignantly interfered and the readers of fraser as those of the cornhill were protected for that time from farther disturbance on my part subsequently loss of health family distress and various untoward chances prevented my proceeding with the body of the bookseven years have passed ineffectually and i am now fain to reprint the preface by itself under the title which i intended for the whole  not discontentedly being at this time of life resigned to the sense of failure and also because the preface is complete in itself as a body of definitions which i now require for reference in the course of my letters to workmen by which also in time i trust less formally to accomplish the chief purpose of munera pulveris practically summed in the two paragraphs 27 and 28 namely to examine the moral results and possible rectifications of the laws of distribution of wealth which have prevailed hitherto without debate among men laws which ordinary economists assume to be inviolable and which ordinary socialists imagine to be on the eve of total abrogation but they are both alike deceived the laws which at present regulate the possession of wealth are unjust because the motives which provoke to its attainment are impure but no socialism can effect their abrogation unless it can abrogate also covetousness and pride which it is by no means yet in the way of doing nor can the change be in any case to the extent that has been imagined extremes of luxury may be forbidden and agony of penury relieved but nature intends and the utmost efforts of socialism will not hinder the fulfilment of her intention that a provident person shall always be richer than a spendthrift and an ingenious one more comfortable than a fool but indeed the adjustment of the possession of the products of industry depends more on their nature than their quantity and on wise determination therefore of the aims of industry  a nation which desires true wealth desires it moderately and can therefore distribute it with kindness and possess it with pleasure but one which desires false wealth desires it immoderately and can neither dispense it with justice nor enjoy it in peace  therefore needing constantly in my present work to refer to the definitions of true and false wealth given in the following essays i republish them with careful revisal they were written abroad partly at milan partly during a winter residence on the southeastern slope of the mont sal√©ve near geneva and sent to london in as legible ms as i could write but i never revised the press sheets and have been obliged accordingly now to amend the text here and there or correct it in unimportant particulars wherever any modification has involved change in the sense it is enclosed in square brackets and what few explanatory comments i have felt it necessary to add have been indicated in the same manner no explanatory comments i regret to perceive will suffice to remedy the mischief of my affected concentration of language into the habit of which i fell by thinking too long over particular passages in many and many a solitary walk towards the mountains of bonneville or annecy but i never intended the book for anything else than a dictionary of reference and that for earnest readers who will i have good hope if they find what they want in it forgive the affectedly curt expressions  the essays as originally published were as i have just stated four in number i have now more conveniently divided the whole into six chapters and as i purpose throughout this edition of my works numbered the paragraphs  i inscribed the first volume of this series to the friend who aided me in chief sorrow let me inscribe the second to the friend and guide who has urged me to all chief labour thomas carlyle                                       i would that some better means were in my power of showing reverence to the man who alone of all our masters of literature has written without thought of himself what he knew it to be needful for the people of his time to hear if the will to hear were in them whom therefore as the time draws near when his task must be ended republican and freethoughted england assaults with impatient reproach and out of the abyss of her cowardice in policy and dishonour in trade sets the hacks of her literature to speak evil grateful to her ears of the solitary teacher who has asked her to be brave for the help of man and just for the love of god      denmark hill     25th november 1871  footnotes

definitions   1 as domestic economy regulates the acts and habits of a household political economy regulates those of a society or state with reference to the means of its maintenance  political economy is neither an art nor a science but a system of conduct and legislature founded on the sciences directing the arts and impossible except under certain conditions of moral culture  2 the study which lately in england has been called political economy is in reality nothing more than the investigation of some accidental phenomena of modern commercial operations nor has it been true in its investigation even of these it has no connection whatever with political economy as understood and treated of by the great thinkers of past ages and as long as its unscholarly and undefined statements are allowed to pass under the same name every word written on the subject by those thinkersand chiefly the words of plato xenophon cicero and baconmust be nearly useless to mankind the reader must not therefore be surprised at the care and insistance with which i have retained the literal and earliest sense of all important terms used in these papers for a word is usually well made at the time it is first wanted its youngest meaning has in it the full strength of its youth subsequent senses are commonly warped or weakened and as all careful thinkers are sure to have used their words accurately the first condition in order to be able to avail our selves of their sayings at all is firm definition of terms  3 by the maintenance of a state is to be understood the support of its population in healthy and happy life and the increase of their numbers so far as that increase is consistent with their happiness it is not the object of political economy to increase the numbers of a nation at the cost of common health or comfort nor to increase indefinitely the comfort of individuals by sacrifice of surrounding lives or possibilities of life  4 the assumption which lies at the root of nearly all erroneous reasoning on political economynamely that its object is to accumulate money or exchangeable propertymay be shown in a few words to be without foundation for no economist would admit national economy to be legitimate which proposed to itself only the building of a pyramid of gold he would declare the gold to be wasted were it to remain in the monumental form and would say it ought to be employed but to what end either it must be used only to gain more gold and build a larger pyramid or for some purpose other than the gaining of gold and this other purpose however at first apprehended will be found to resolve itself finally into the service of manthat is to say the extension defence or comfort of his life the golden pyramid may perhaps be providently built perhaps improvidently but the wisdom or folly of the accumulation can only be determined by our having first clearly stated the aim of all economy namely the extension of life  if the accumulation of money or of exchangeable property were a certain means of extending existence it would be useless in discussing economical questions to fix our attention upon the more distant objectlifeinstead of the immediate onemoney but it is not so money may sometimes be accumulated at the cost of life or by limitations of it that is to say either by hastening the deaths of men or preventing their births it is therefore necessary to keep clearly in view the ultimate object of economy and to determine the expediency of minor operations with reference to that ulterior end  5 it has been just stated that the object of political economy is the continuance not only of life but of healthy and happy life but all true happiness is both a consequence and cause of life it is a sign of its vigor and source of its continuance all true suffering is in like manner a consequence and cause of death i shall therefore in future use the word life singly but let it be understood to include in its signification the happiness and power of the entire human nature body and soul  6 that human nature as its creator made it and maintains it wherever his laws are observed is entirely harmonious no physical error can be more profound no moral error more dangerous than that involved in the monkish doctrine of the opposition of body to soul no soul can be perfect in an imperfect body no body perfect without perfect soul every right action and true thought sets the seal of its beauty on person and face every wrong action and foul thought its seal of distortion and the various aspects of humanity might be read as plainly as a printed history were it not that the impressions are so complex that it must always in some cases and in the present state of our knowledge in all cases be impossible to decipher them completely nevertheless the face of a consistently just and of a consistently unjust person may always be rightly distinguished at a glance and if the qualities are continued by descent through a generation or two there arises a complete distinction of race both moral and physical qualities are communicated by descent far more than they can be developed by education though both may be destroyed by want of education and there is as yet no ascertained limit to the nobleness of person and mind which the human creature may attain by persevering observance of the laws of god respecting its birth and training  7 we must therefore yet farther define the aim of political economy to be the multiplication of human life at the highest standard it might at first seem questionable whether we should endeavour to maintain a small number of persons of the highest type of beauty and intelligence or a larger number of an inferior class but i shall be able to show in the sequel that the way to maintain the largest number is first to aim at the highest standard determine the noblest type of man and aim simply at maintaining the largest possible number of persons of that class and it will be found that the largest possible number of every healthy subordinate class must necessarily be produced also  8 the perfect type of manhood as just stated involves the perfections whatever we may hereafter determine these to be of his body affections and intelligence the material things therefore which it is the object of political economy to produce and use or accumulate for use are things which serve either to sustain and comfort the body or exercise rightly the affections and form the intelligence10 whatever truly serves either of these purposes is useful to man wholesome healthful helpful or holy by seeking such things man prolongs and increases his life upon the earth  on the other hand whatever does not serve either of these purposesmuch more whatever counteracts themis in like manner useless to man unwholesome unhelpful or unholy and by seeking such things man shortens and diminishes his life upon the earth  9 and neither with respect to things useful or useless can mans estimate of them alter their nature certain substances being good for his food and others noxious to him what he thinks or wishes respecting them can neither change nor prevent their power if he

not to have laboured for until on his summer threshingfloor stands his heap of corn little or much not according to his labour but to his discretion no commercial arrangements no painting of surfaces nor alloying of substances will avail him a pennyweight nature asks of him calmly and inevitably what have you found or formedthe right thing or the wrong by the right thing you shall live by the wrong you shall die  10 to thoughtless persons it seems otherwise the world looks to them as if they could cozen it out of some ways and means of life but they cannot cozen it they can only cozen their neighbours the world is not to be cheated of a grain not so much as a breath of its air can be drawn surreptitiously for every piece of wise work done so much life is granted for every piece of foolish work nothing for every piece of wicked work so much death is allotted this is as sure as the courses of day and night but when the means of life are once produced men by their various struggles and industries of accumulation or exchange may variously gather waste restrain or distribute them necessitating in proportion to the waste or restraint accurately so much more death the rate and range of additional death are measured by the rate and range of waste and are inevitablethe only question determined mostly by fraud in peace and force in war is who is to die and how  11 such being the everlasting law of human existence the essential work of the political economist is to determine what are in reality useful or lifegiving things and by what degrees and kinds of labour they are attainable and distributable this investigation divides itself under three great headsthe studies namely of the phenomena first of wealth secondly of money and thirdly of riches  these terms are often used as synonymous but they signify entirely different things wealth consists of things in themselves valuable money of documentary claims to the possession of such things and riches is a relative term expressing the magnitude of the possessions of one person or society as compared with those of other persons or societies  the study of wealth is a province of natural scienceit deals with the essential properties of things  the study of money is a province of commercial scienceit deals with conditions of engagement and exchange  the study of riches is a province of moral scienceit deals with the due relations of men to each other in regard of material possessions and with the just laws of their association for purposes of labour  i shall in this first chapter shortly sketch out the range of subjects which will come before us as we follow these three branches of inquiry  12 and first of wealth which it has been said consists of things essentially valuable we now therefore need a definition of value  value signifies the strength or availing of anything towards the sustaining of life and is always twofold that is to say primarily intrinsic and secondarily effectual  the reader must by anticipation be warned against confusing value with cost or with price value is the lifegiving power of anything cost the quantity of labour required to produce it price the quantity of labour which its possessor will take in exchange for it11 cost and price are commercial conditions to be studied under the head of money  13 intrinsic value is the absolute power of anything to support life a sheaf of wheat of given quality and weight has in it a measurable power of sustaining the substance of the body a cubic foot of pure air a fixed power of sustaining its warmth and a cluster of flowers of given beauty a fixed power of enlivening or animating the senses and heart  it does not in the least affect the intrinsic value of the wheat the air or the flowers that men refuse or despise them used or not their own power is in them and that particular power is in nothing else  14 but in order that this value of theirs may become effectual a certain state is necessary in the recipient of it the digesting breathing and perceiving functions must be perfect in the human creature before the food air or flowers can become of their full value to it the production of effectual value therefore always involves two needs first the production of a thing essentially useful then the production of the capacity to use it where the intrinsic value and acceptant capacity come together there is effectual value or wealth where there is either no intrinsic value or no acceptant capacity there is no effectual value that is to say no wealth a horse is no wealth to us if we cannot ride nor a picture if we cannot see nor can any noble thing be wealth except to a noble person as the aptness of the user increases the effectual value of the thing used increases and in its entirety can coexist only with perfect skill of use and fitness of nature  15 valuable material things may be conveniently referred to five heads  i land with its associated air water and organisms  ii houses furniture and instruments  iii stored or prepared food medicine and articles of bodily luxury including clothing  iv books  v works of art  the conditions of value in these things are briefly as follows  16 i land its value is twofold first as producing food and mechanical power secondly as an object of sight and thought producing intellectual power  its value as a means of producing food and mechanical power varies with its form as mountain or plain with its substance in soil or mineral contents and with its climate all these conditions of intrinsic value must be known and complied with by the men who have to deal with it in order to give effectual value but at any given time and place the intrinsic value is fixed such and such a piece of land with its associated lakes and seas rightly treated in surface and substance can produce precisely so much food and power and no more  the second element of value in land being its beauty united with such conditions of space and form as are necessary for exercise and for fullness of animal life land of the highest value in these respects will be that lying in temperate climates and boldly varied in form removed from unhealthy or dangerous influences as of miasm or volcano and capable of sustaining a rich fauna and flora such land carefully tended by the hand of man so far as to remove from it unsightlinesses and evidences of decay guarded from violence and inhabited under mans affectionate protection by every kind of living creature that can occupy it in peace is the most precious property that human beings can possess  17 ii buildings furniture and instruments  the value of buildings consists first in permanent strength with convenience of form of size and of position so as to render employment peaceful social intercourse easy temperature and air healthy the advisable or possible magnitude of cities and mode of their distribution in squares streets courts c the relative value of sites of land and the modes of structure which are healthiest and most permanent have to be studied under this head  the value of buildings consists secondly in historical association and architectural beauty of which we have to examine the influence on manners and life  the value of instruments consists first in their power of shortening labour or otherwise accomplishing what human strength unaided could not the kinds of work which are severally best accomplished by hand or by machinethe effect of machinery in gathering and multiplying population and its influence on the minds and bodies of such population together with the conceivable uses of machinery on a colossal scale in accomplishing mighty and useful works hitherto unthought of such as the deepening of large river channelschanging the surface of mountainous districtsirrigating tracts of desert in the torrid zonebreaking up and thus rendering capable of quicker fusion edges of ice in the northern and southern arctic seas c so rendering parts of the earth habitable which hitherto have been lifeless are to be studied under this head  the value of instruments is secondarily in their aid to abstract sciences the degree in which the multiplication of such instruments should be encouraged so as to make them if large easy of access to numbers as costly telescopes or so cheap as that they might in a serviceable form become a common part of the furniture of households is to be considered under this head12  18 iii food medicine and articles of luxury under this head we shall have to examine the possible methods of obtaining pure food in such security and equality of supply as to avoid both waste and famine then the economy of medicine and just range of sanitary law finally the economy of luxury partly an √¶sthetic and partly an ethical question  19 iv books the value of these consists  first in their power of preserving and communicating the knowledge of facts  secondly in their power of exciting vital or noble emotion and intellectual action they have also their corresponding negative powers of disguising and effacing the memory of facts and killing the noble emotions or exciting base ones under these two heads we have to consider the economical and educational value positive and negative of literaturethe means of producing and educating good authors and the means and advisability of rendering good books generally accessible and directing the readers choice to them  20 v works of art the value of these is of the same nature as that of books but the laws of their production and possible modes of distribution are very different and require separate examination   21 iimoney under this head we shall have to examine the laws of currency and exchange of which i will note here the first principles   money has been inaccurately spoken of as merely a means of exchange but it is far more than this it is a documentary expression of legal claim it is not wealth but a documentary claim to wealth being the sign of the relative quantities of it or of the labour producing it to which at a given time persons or societies are entitled  if all the money in the world notes and gold were destroyed in an instant it would leave the world neither richer nor poorer than it was but it would leave the individual inhabitants of it in different relations  money is therefore correspondent in its nature to the titledeed of an estate though the deed be burned the estate still exists but the right to it has become disputable  22 the real worth of money remains unchanged as long as the proportion of the quantity of existing money to the quantity of existing wealth or available labour remains unchanged  if the wealth increases but not the money the worth of the money increases if the money increases but not the wealth the worth of the money diminishes  23 money therefore cannot be arbitrarily multiplied any more than titledeeds can so long as the existing wealth or available labour is not fully represented by the currency the currency may be increased without diminution of the assigned worth of its pieces but when the existing wealth or available labour is once fully represented every piece of money thrown into circulation diminishes the worth of every other existing piece in the proportion it bears to the number of them provided the new piece be received with equal credit if not the depreciation of worth takes place according to the degree of its credit  24 when however new money composed of some substance of supposed intrinsic value as of gold is brought into the market or when new notes are issued which are supposed to be deserving of credit the desire to obtain the money will under certain circumstances stimulate industry an additional quantity of wealth is immediately produced and if this be in proportion to the new claims advanced the value of the existing currency is undepreciated if the stimulus given be so great as to produce more goods than are proportioned to the additional coinage the worth of the existing currency will be raised  arbitrary control and issues of currency affect the production of wealth by acting on the hopes and fears of men and are under certain circumstances wise but the issue of additional currency to meet the exigencies of immediate expense is merely one of the disguised forms of borrowing or taxing it is however in the present low state of economical knowledge often possible for governments to venture on an issue of currency when they could not venture on an additional loan or tax because the real operation of such issue is not understood by the people and the pressure of it is irregularly distributed and with an unperceived gradation  25 the use of substances of intrinsic value as the materials of a currency is a barbarisma remnant of the conditions of barter which alone render commerce possible among savage nations it is however still necessary partly as a mechanical check on arbitrary issues partly as a means of exchanges with foreign nations in proportion to the extension of civilization and increase of trustworthiness in governments it will cease so long as it exists the phenomena of the cost and price of the articles used for currency are mingled with those proper to currency itself in an almost inextricable manner and the market worth of bullion is affected by multitudinous accidental circumstances which have been traced with more or less success by writers on commercial operations but with these variations the true political economist has no more to do than an engineer fortifying a harbour of refuge against atlantic tide has to concern himself with the cries or quarrels of children who dig pools with their fingers for its streams among the sand  26 iiiriches according to the various industry capacity good fortune and desires of men they obtain greater or smaller share of and claim upon the wealth of the world  the inequalities between these shares always in some degree just and necessary may be either restrained by law or circumstance within certain limits or may increase indefinitely  where no moral or legal restraint is put upon the exercise of the will and intellect of the stronger shrewder or more covetous men these differences become ultimately enormous but as soon as they become so distinct in their extremes as that on one side there shall be manifest redundance of possession and on the other manifest pressure of needthe terms riches and poverty are used to express the opposite states being contrary only as the terms warmth and cold are contraries of which neither implies an actual degree but only a relation to other degrees of temperature  27 respecting riches the economist has to inquire first into the advisable modes of their collection secondly into the advisable modes of their administration  respecting the collection of national riches he has to inquire first whether he is justified in calling the nation rich if the quantity of wealth it possesses relatively to the wealth of other nations be large irrespectively of the manner of its distribution or does the mode of distribution in any wise affect the nature of the riches thus if the king alone be richsuppose croesus or mausolusare the lydians or carians therefore a rich nation or if a few slavemasters are rich and the nation is otherwise composed of slaves is it to be called a rich nation for if not and the ideas of a certain mode of distribution or operation in the riches and of a certain degree of freedom in the people enter into our idea of riches as attributed to a people we shall have to define the degree of fluency or circulative character which is essential to the nature of common wealth and the degree of independence of action required in its possessors questions which look as if they would take time in answering13  28 and farther since the inequality which is the condition of riches may be established in two opposite modesnamely by increase of possession on the one side and by decrease of it on the otherwe have to inquire with respect to any given state of riches precisely in what manner the correlative poverty was produced that is to say whether by being surpassed only or being depressed also and if by being depressed what are the advantages or the contrary conceivable in the depression for instance it being one of the commonest advantages of being rich to entertain a number of servants we have to inquire on the one side what economical process produced the riches of the master and on the other what economical process produced the poverty of the persons who serve him and what advantages each on his own side derives from the result  29 these being the main questions touching the collection of riches the next or last part of the inquiry is into their administration  their possession involves three great economical powers which require separate examination namely the powers of selection direction and provision  the power of selection relates to things of which the supply is limited as the supply of best things is always when it becomes matter of question to whom such things are to belong the richest person has necessarily the first choice unless some arbitrary mode of distribution be otherwise determined upon the business of the economist is to show how this choice may be a wise one  the power of direction arises out of the necessary relation of rich men to poor which ultimately in one way or another involves the direction of or authority over the labour of the poor and this nearly as much over their mental as their bodily labour the business of the economist is to show how this direction may be a just one  the power of provision is dependent upon the redundance of wealth which may of course by active persons be made available in preparation for future work or future profit in which function riches have generally received the name of capital that is to say of head or sourcematerial the business of the economist is to show how this provision may be a distant one  30 the examination of these three functions of riches will embrace every final problem of political economyand above or before all this curious and vital problemwhether since the wholesome action of riches in these three functions will depend it appears on the wisdom justice and farsightedness of the holders and it is by no means to be assumed that persons primarily rich must therefore be just and wiseit may not be ultimately possible so or somewhat so to arrange matters as that persons primarily just and wise should therefore be rich  such being the general plan of the inquiry before us i shall not limit myself to any consecutive following of it having hardly any good hope of being able to complete so laborious a work as it must prove to me but from time to time as i have leisure shall endeavour to carry forward this part or that as may be immediately possible indicating always with accuracy the place which the particular essay will or should take in the completed system  footnotes  10 see appendix i  11 observe these definitionsthey are of much importanceand connect with them the sentences in italics on this and the next page  12 i cannot now recast these sentences pedantic in their generalization and intended more for index than statement but i must guard the reader from thinking that i ever wish for cheapness by bad quality a poor boy need not always learn mathematics but if you set him to do so have the farther kindness to give him good compasses not cheap ones whose points bend like lead  13 i regret the ironical manner in which this passage one of great importance in the matter of it was written the gist of it is that the first of all inquiries respecting the wealth of any nation is not how much it has but whether it is in a form that can be used and in the possession of persons who can use it     chapter ii  storekeeping   31 the first chapter having consisted of little more than definition of terms i purpose in this to expand and illustrate the given definitions  the view which has here been taken of the nature of wealth namely that it consists in an intrinsic value developed by a vital power is directly opposed to two nearly universal conceptions of wealth in the assertion that value is primarily intrinsic it opposes the idea that anything which is an object of desire to numbers and is limited in quantity so as to have rated worth in exchange may be called or virtually become wealth and in the assertion that value is secondarily dependent upon power in the possessor it opposes the idea that the worth of things depends on the demand for them instead of on the use of them before going farther we will make these two positions clearer  32 i first all wealth is intrinsic and is not constituted by the judgment of men this is easily seen in the case of things affecting the body we know that no force of fantasy will make stones nourishing or poison innocent but it is less apparent in things affecting the mind we are easilyperhaps willinglymisled by the appearance of beneficial results obtained by industries addressed wholly to the gratification of fanciful desire and apt to suppose that whatever is widely coveted dearly bought and pleasurable in possession must be included in our definition of wealth it is the more difficult to quit ourselves of this error because many things which are true wealth in moderate use become false wealth in immoderate and many things are mixed of good and evilas mostly books and works of artout of which one person will get the good and another the evil so that it seems as if there were no fixed good or evil in the things themselves but only in the view taken and use made of them  but that is not so the evil and good are fixed in essence and in proportion and in things in which evil depends upon excess the point of excess though indefinable is fixed and the power of the thing is on the hither side for good and on the farther side for evil and in all cases this power is inherent not dependent on opinion or choice our thoughts of things neither make nor mar their eternal force norwhich is the most serious point for future considerationcan they prevent the effect of it within certain limits upon ourselves  33 therefore the object of any special analysis of wealth will be not so much to enumerate what is serviceable as to distinguish what is destructive and to show that it is inevitably destructive that to receive pleasure from an evil thing is not to escape from or alter the evil of it but to be altered by it that is to suffer from it to the utmost having our own nature in that degree made evil also and it may be shown farther that through whatever length of time or subtleties of connexion the harm is accomplished being also less or more according to the fineness and worth of the humanity on which it is wrought still nothing but harm ever comes of a bad thing  34 so that in sum the term wealth is never to be attached to the accidental object of a morbid desire but only to the constant object of a legitimate one14 by the fury of ignorance and fitfulness of caprice large interests may be continually attached to things unserviceable or hurtful if their nature could be altered by our passions the science of political economy would remain what it has been hitherto among us the weighing of clouds and the portioning out of shadows but of ignorance there is no science and of caprice no law their disturbing forces interfere with the operations of faithful economy but have nothing in common with them she the calm arbiter of national destiny regards only essential power for good in all that she accumulates and alike disdains the wanderings15 of imagination and the thirsts of disease  35 ii secondly the assertion that wealth is not only intrinsic but dependent in order to become effectual on a given degree of vital power in its possessor is opposed to another popular view of wealthnamely that though it may always be constituted by caprice it is when so constituted a substantial thing of which given quantities may be counted as existing here or there and exchangeable at rated prices  in this view there are three errors the first and chief is the overlooking the fact that all exchangeableness of commodity or effective demand for it depends on the sum of capacity for its use existing here or elsewhere the book we cannot read or picture we take no delight in may indeed be called part of our wealth in so far as we have power of exchanging either for something we like better but our power of effecting such exchange and yet more of effecting it to advantage depends absolutely on the number of accessible persons who can understand the book or enjoy the painting and who will dispute the possession of them thus the actual worth of either even to us depends no more on their essential goodness than on the capacity existing somewhere for the perception of it and it is vain in any completed system of production to think of obtaining one without the other so that though the true political economist knows that coexistence of capacity for use with temporary possession cannot be always secured the final fact on which he bases all action and administration is that in the whole nation or group of nations he has to deal with for every atom of intrinsic value produced he must with exactest chemistry produce its twin atom of acceptant digestion or understanding capacity or in the degree of his failure he has no wealth natures challenge to us is in earnest as the assyrians mock i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them baviecas paces are brave if the cid backs him but woe to us if we take the dust of capacity wearing the armour of it for capacity itself for so all procession however goodly in the show of it is to the tomb  36 the second error in this popular view of wealth is that in giving the name of wealth to things which we cannot use we in reality confuse wealth with money the land we have no skill to cultivate the book which is sealed to us or dress which is superfluous may indeed be exchangeable but as such are nothing more than a cumbrous form of banknote of doubtful or slow convertibility as long as we retain possession of them we merely keep our banknotes in the shape of gravel or clay of bookleaves or of embroidered tissue circumstances may perhaps render such forms the safest or a certain complacency may attach to the exhibition of them into both these advantages we shall inquire afterwards i wish the reader only to observe here that exchangeable property which we cannot use is to us personally merely one of the forms of money not of wealth  37 the third error in the popular view is the confusion of guardianship with possession the real state of men of property being too commonly that of curators not possessors of wealth  a mans power over his property is at the widest range of it fivefold it is power of use for himself administration to others ostentation destruction or bequest and possession is in use only which for each man is sternly limited so that such things and so much of them as he can use are indeed well for him or wealth and more of them or any other things are ill for him or illth16 plunged to the lips in orinoco he shall drink to his thirst measure more at his peril with a thousand oxen on his lands he shall eat to his hunger measure more at his peril he cannot live in two houses at once a few bales of silk or wool will suffice for the fabric of all the clothes he can ever wear and a few books will probably hold all the furniture good for his brain beyond these in the best of us but narrow capacities we have but the power of administering or maladministering wealth that is to say distributing lending or increasing itof exhibiting it as in magnificence of retinue or furnitureof destroying or finally of bequeathing it and with multitudes of rich men administration degenerates into curatorship they merely hold their property in charge as trustees for the benefit of some person or persons to whom it is to be delivered upon their death and the position explained in clear terms would hardly seem a covetable one what would be the probable feelings of a youth on his entrance into life to whom the career hoped for him was proposed in terms such as these you must work unremittingly and with your utmost intelligence during all your available years you will thus accumulate wealth to a large amount but you must touch none of it beyond what is needful for your support whatever sums you gain beyond those required for your decent and moderate maintenance and whatever beautiful things you may obtain possession of shall be properly taken care of by servants for whose maintenance you will be charged and whom you will have the trouble of superintending and on your deathbed you shall have the power of determining to whom the accumulated property shall belong or to what purposes be applied  38 the labour of life under such conditions would probably be neither zealous nor cheerful yet the only difference between this position and that of the ordinary capitalist is the power which the latter supposes himself to possess and which is attributed to him by others of spending his money at any moment this pleasure taken in the imagination of power to part with that with which we have no intention of parting is one of the most curious though commonest forms of the eidolon or phantasm of wealth but the political economist has nothing to do with this idealism and looks only to the practical issue of itnamely that the holder of wealth in such temper may be regarded simply as a mechanical means of collection or as a moneychest with a slit in it not only receptant but suctional set in the public thoroughfarechest of which only death has the key and evil chance the distribution of the contents in his function of lender which however is one of administration not use as far as he is himself concerned the capitalist takes indeed a more interesting aspect but even in that function his relations with the state are apt to degenerate into a mechanism for the convenient contraction of debta function the more mischievous because a nation invariably appeases its conscience with respect to an unjustifiable expense by meeting it with borrowed funds expresses its repentance of a foolish piece of business by letting its tradesmen wait for their money and always leaves its descendants to pay for the work which will be of the least advantage to them17  39 quit of these three sources of misconception the reader will have little farther difficulty in apprehending the real nature of effectual value he may however at first not without surprise perceive the consequences involved in his acceptance of the definition for if the actual existence of wealth be dependent on the power of its possessor it follows that the sum of wealth held by the nation instead of being constant or calculable varies hourly nay momentarily with the number and character of its holders and that in changing hands it changes in quantity and farther since the worth of the currency is proportioned to the sum of material wealth which it represents if the sum of the wealth changes the worth of the currency changes and thus both the sum of the property and power of the currency of the state vary momentarily as the character and number of the holders and not only so but different rates and kinds of variation are caused by the character of the holders of different kinds of wealth the transitions of value caused by the character of the holders of land differ in mode from those caused by character in holders of works of art and these again from those caused by character in holders of machinery or other working capital but we cannot examine these special phenomena of any kind of wealth until we have a clear idea of the way in which true currency expresses them and of the resulting modes in which the cost and price of any article are related to its value to obtain this we must approach the subject in its first elements  40 let us suppose a national store of wealth composed of material things either useful or believed to be so taken charge of by the government18 and that every workman having produced any article involving labour in its production and for which he has no immediate use brings it to add to this store receiving from the government in exchange an order either for the return of the thing itself or of its equivalent in other things such as he may choose out of the store at any time when he needs them the question of equivalence itself how much wine a man is to receive in return for so much corn or how much coal in return for so much iron is a quite separate one which we will examine presently for the time let it be assumed that this equivalence has been determined and that the government order in exchange for a fixed weight of any article called suppose a is either for the return of that weight of the article itself or of another fixed weight of the article b or another of the article c and so on  now supposing that the labourer speedily and continually presents these general orders or in common language spends the money he has neither changed the circumstances of the nation nor his own except in so far as he may have produced useful and consumed useless articles or vice vers√¢ but if he does not use or uses in part only the orders he receives and lays aside some portion of them and thus every day bringing his contribution to the national store lays by some percentage of the orders received in exchange for it he increases the national wealth daily by as much as he does not use of the received order and to the same amount accumulates a monetary claim on the government it is of course always in his power as it is his legal right to bring forward this accumulation of claim and at once to consume destroy or distribute the sum of his wealth supposing he never does so but dies leaving his claim to others he has enriched the state during his life by the quantity of wealth over which that claim extends or has in other words rendered so much additional life possible in the state of which additional life he bequeaths the immediate possibility to those whom he invests with his claim supposing him to cancel the claim he would distribute this possibility of life among the nation at large  41 we hitherto consider the government itself as simply a conservative power taking charge of the wealth entrusted to it  but a government may be more or less than a conservative power it may be either an improving or destructive one  if it be an improving power using all the wealth entrusted to it to the best advantage the nation is enriched in root and branch at once and the government is enabled for every order presented to return a quantity of wealth greater than the order was written for according to the fructification obtained in the interim this ability may be either concealed in which case the currency does not completely represent the wealth of the country or it may be manifested by the continual payment of the excess of value on each order in which case there is irrespectively observe of collateral results afterwards to be examined a perpetual rise in the worth of the currency that is to say a fall in the price of all articles represented by it  42 but if the government be destructive or a consuming power it becomes unable to return the value received on the presentation of the order  this inability may either be concealed by meeting demands to the full until it issue in bankruptcy or in some form of national debtor it may be concealed during oscillatory movements between destructiveness and productiveness which result on the whole in stabilityor it may be manifested by the consistent return of less than value received on each presented order in which case there is a consistent fall in the worth of the currency or rise in the price of the things represented by it  43 now if for this conception of a central government we substitute that of a body of persons occupied in industrial pursuits of whom each adds in his private capacity to the common store we at once obtain an approximation to the actual condition of a civilized mercantile community from which approximation we might easily proceed into still completer analysis i purpose however to arrive at every result by the gradual expansion of the simpler conception but i wish the reader to observe in the meantime that both the social conditions thus supposed and i will by anticipation say also all possible social conditions agree in two great points namely in the primal importance of the supposed national store or stock and in its destructibility or improveability by the holders of it  44 i observe that in both conditions that of central governmentholding and diffused privateholding the quantity of stock is of the same national moment in the one case indeed its amount may be known by examination of the persons to whom it is confided in the other it cannot be known but by exposing the private affairs of every individual but known or unknown its significance is the same under each condition the riches of the nation consist in the abundance and their wealth depends on the nature of this store  45 ii in the second place both conditions and all other possible ones agree in the destructibility or improveability of the store by its holders whether in private hands or under government charge the national store may be daily consumed or daily enlarged by its possessors and while the currency remains apparently unaltered the property it represents may diminish or increase  46 the first question then which we have to put under our simple conception of central government namely what store has it is one of equal importance whatever may be the constitution of the state while the second questionnamely who are the holders of the store involves the discussion of the constitution of the state itself  the first inquiry resolves itself into three heads  1 what is the nature of the store  2 what is its quantity in relation to the population  3 what is its quantity in relation to the currency  the second inquiry into two  1 who are the holders of the store and in what proportions  2 who are the claimants of the store that is to say the holders of the currency and in what proportions  we will examine the range of the first three questions in the present paper of the two following in the sequel  47 i question first what is the nature of the store has the nation hitherto worked for and gathered the right thing or the wrong on that issue rest the possibilities of its life  for example let us imagine a society of no great extent occupied in procuring and laying up store of corn wine wool silk and other such preservable materials of food and clothing and that it has a currency representing them imagine farther that on days of festivity the society discovering itself to derive satisfaction from pyrotechnics gradually turns its attention more and more to the manufacture of gunpowder so that an increasing number of labourers giving what time they can spare to this branch of industry bring increasing quantities of combustibles into the store and use the general orders received in exchange to obtain such wine wool or corn as they may have need of the currency remains the same and represents precisely the same amount of material in the store and of labour spent in producing it but the corn and wine gradually vanish and in their place as gradually appear sulphur and saltpetre till at last the labourers who have consumed corn and supplied nitre presenting on a festal morning some of their currency to obtain materials for the feast discover that no amount of currency will command anything festive except fire the supply of rockets is unlimited but that of food limited in a quite final manner and the whole currency in the hands of the society represents an infinite power of detonation but none of existence  48 this statement caricatured as it may seem is only exaggerated in assuming the persistence of the folly to extremity unchecked as in reality it would be by the gradual rise in price of food but it falls short of the actual facts of human life in expression of the depth and intensity of the folly itself for a great part the reader would not believe how great until he saw the statistics in detail of the most earnest and ingenious industry of the world is spent in producing munitions of war gathering that is to say the materials not of festive but of consuming fire filling its stores with all power of the instruments of pain and all affluence of the ministries of death it was no true trionfo della morte19 which men have seen and feared sometimes scarcely feared so long wherein he brought them rest from their labours we see and share another and higher form of his triumph now taskmaster instead of releaser he rules the dust of the arena no less than of the tomb and content once in the grave whither man went to make his works to cease and his devices to vanishnow in the busy city and on the serviceable sea makes his work to increase and his devices to multiply  49 to this doubled loss or negative power of labour spent in producing means of destruction we have to add in our estimate of the consequences of human folly whatever more insidious waste of toil there is in production of unnecessary luxury such and such an occupation it is said supports so many labourers because so many obtain wages in following it but it is never considered that unless there be a supporting power in the product of the occupation the wages given to one man are merely withdrawn from another we cannot say of any trade that it maintains such and such a number of persons unless we know how and where the money now spent in the purchase of its produce would have been spent if that produce had not been manufactured the purchasing funds truly support a number of people in making this but probably leave unsupported an equal number who are making or could have made that the manufacturers of small watches thrive at genevait is wellbut where would the money spent on small watches have gone had there been no small watches to buy  50 if the so frequently uttered aphorism of mercantile economylabour is limited by capital were true this question would be a definite one but it is untrue and that widely out of a given quantity of funds for wages more or less labour is to be had according to the quantity of will with which we can inspire the workman and the true limit of labour is only in the limit of this moral stimulus of the will and of the bodily power in an ultimate but entirely unpractical sense labour is limited by capital as it is by matterthat is to say where there is no material there can be no workbut in the practical sense labour is limited only by the great original capital of head heart and hand even in the most artificial relations of commerce labour is to capital as fire to fuel out of so much fuel you can have only so much fire but out of so much fuel you shall have so much firenot in proportion to the mass of combustible but to the force of wind that fans and water that quenches and the appliance of both and labour is furthered as conflagration is not so much by added fuel as by admitted air20  51 for which reasons i had to insert in ¬ß 49 the qualifying probably for it can never be said positively that the purchasemoney or wages fund of any trade is withdrawn from some other trade the object itself may be the stimulus of the production of the money which buys it that is to say the work by which the purchaser obtained the means of buying it would not have been done by him unless he had wanted that particular thing and the production of any article not intrinsically nor in the process of manufacture injurious is useful if the desire of it causes productive labour in other directions  52 in the national store therefore the presence of things intrinsically valueless does not imply an entirely correlative absence of things valuable we cannot be certain that all the labour spent on vanity has been diverted from reality and that for every bad thing produced a precious thing has been lost in great measure the vain things represent the results of roused indolence they have been carved as toys in extra time and if they had not been made nothing else would have been made even to munitions of war this principle applies they partly represent the work of men who if they had not made spears would never have made pruning hooks and who are incapable of any activities but those of contest  53 thus then finally the nature of the store has to be considered under two main lights the one that of its immediate and actual utility the other that of the past national character which it signifies by its production and future character which it must develop by its use and the issue of this investigation will be to show us that  economy does not depend merely on principles of demand and supply but primarily on what is demanded and what is supplied which i will beg of you to observe and take to heart                                       54 ii question secondwhat is the quantity of the store in relation to the population  it follows from what has been already stated that the accurate form in which this question has to be put iswhat quantity of each article composing the store exists in proportion to the real need for it by the population but we shall for the time assume in order to keep all our terms at the simplest that the store is wholly composed of useful articles and accurately proportioned to the several needs for them  now it cannot be assumed because the store is large in proportion to the number of the people that the people must be in comfort nor because it is small that they must be in distress an active and economical race always produces more than it requires and lives if it is permitted to do so in competence on the produce of its daily labour the quantity of its store great or small is therefore in many respects indifferent to it and cannot be inferred from its aspect similarly an inactive and wasteful population which cannot live by its daily labour but is dependent partly or wholly on consumption of its store may be by various difficulties hereafter to be examined in realizing or getting at such store retained in a state of abject distress though its possessions may be immense but the results always involved in the magnitude of store are the commercial power of the nation its security and its mental character its commercial power in that according to the quantity of its store may be the extent of its dealings its security in that according to the quantity of its store are its means of sudden exertion or sustained endurance and its character in that certain conditions of civilization cannot be attained without permanent and continually accumulating store of great intrinsic value and of peculiar nature21  55 now seeing that these three advantages arise from largeness of store in proportion to population the question arises immediately given the storeis the nation enriched by diminution of its numbers are a successful national speculation and a pestilence economically the same thing  this is in part a sophistical question such as it would be to ask whether a man was richer when struck by disease which must limit his life within a predicable period than he was when in health he is enabled to enlarge his current expenses and has for all purposes a larger sum at his immediate disposal for given the fortune the shorter the life the larger the annuity yet no man considers himself richer because he is condemned by his physician  56 the logical reply is that since wealth is by definition only the means of life a nation cannot be enriched by its own mortality or in shorter words the life is more than the meat and existence itself more wealth than the means of existence whence of two nations who have equal store the more numerous is to be considered the richer provided the type of the inhabitant be as high for though the relative bulk of their store be less its relative efficiency or the amount of effectual wealth must be greater but if the type of the population be deteriorated by increase of its numbers we have evidence of poverty in its worst influence and then to determine whether the nation in its total may still be justifiably esteemed rich we must set or weigh the number of the poor against that of the rich  to effect which piece of scalework it is of course necessary to determine first who are poor and who are rich nor this only but also how poor and how rich they are which will prove a curious thermometrical investigation for we shall have to do for gold and for silver what we have done for quicksilverdetermine namely their freezingpoint their zero their temperate and feverheat points finally their vaporescent point at which riches sometimes explosively as lately in america make to themselves wingsand correspondently the number of degrees below zero at which poverty ceasing to brace with any wholesome cold burns to the bone22  57 for the performance of these operations in the strictest sense scientific we will first look to the existing socalled science of political economy we will ask it to define for us the comparatively and superlatively rich and the comparatively and superlatively poor and on its own termsif any terms it can pronounceexamine in our prosperous england how many rich and how many poor people there are and whether the quantity and intensity of the poverty is indeed so overbalanced by the quantity and intensity of wealth that we may permit ourselves a luxurious blindness to it and call ourselves complacently a rich country and if we find no clear definition in the existing science we will endeavour for ourselves to fix the true degrees of the scale and to apply them23                                       58 question third what is the quantity of the store in relation to the currency  we have seen that the real worth of the currency so far as dependent on its relation to the magnitude of the store may vary within certain limits without affecting its worth in exchange the diminution or increase of the represented wealth may be unperceived and the currency may be taken either for more or less than it is truly worth usually it is taken for much more and its power in exchange or creditpower is thus increased up to a given strain upon its relation to existing wealth this creditpower is of chief importance in the thoughts because most sharply present to the experience of a mercantile community but the conditions of its stability24 and all other relations of the currency to the material store are entirely simple in principle if not in action far other than simple are the relations of the currency to the available labour which it also represents for this relation is involved not only with that of the magnitude of the store to the number but with that of the magnitude of the store to the mind of the population its proportion to their number and the resulting worth of currency are calculable but its proportion to their will for labour is not the worth of the piece of money which claims a given quantity of the store is in exchange less or greater according to the facility of obtaining the same quantity of the same thing without having recourse to the store in other words it depends on the immediate cost and price of the thing we must now therefore complete the definition of these terms  59 all cost and price are counted in labour we must know first therefore what is to be counted as labour  i have already defined labour to be the contest of the life of man with an opposite literally it is the quantity of lapse loss or failure of human life caused by any effort it is usually confused with effort itself or the application of power opera but there is much effort which is merely a mode of recreation or of pleasure the most beautiful actions of the human body and the highest results of the human intelligence are conditions or achievements of quite unlaboriousnay of recreativeeffort but labour is the suffering in effort it is the negative quantity or quantity of defeat which has to be counted against every feat and of defect which has to be counted against every fact or deed of men in brief it is that quantity of our toil which we die in  we might therefore √† priori conjecture as we shall ultimately find that it cannot be bought nor sold everything else is bought and sold for labour but labour itself cannot be bought nor sold for anything being priceless25 the idea that it is a commodity to be bought or sold is the alpha and omega of politicoeconomic fallacy  60 this being the nature of labour the cost of anything is the quantity of labour necessary to obtain itthe quantity for which or at which it stands constant it is literally the constancy of the thingyou shall win itmove itcome at it for no less than this  cost is measured and measurable using the accurate latin terms only in labour not in opera26 it does not matter how much work a thing needs to produce it it matters only how much distress generally the more the power it requires the less the distress so that the noblest works of man cost less than the meanest  true labour or spending of life is either of the body in fatigue or pain of the temper or heart as in perseverance of search for thingspatience in waiting for themfortitude or degradation in suffering for them and the like or of the intellect all these kinds of labour are supposed to be included in the general term and the quantity of labour is then expressed by the time it lasts so that a unit of labour is an hours work or a days work as we may determine27  61 cost like value is both intrinsic and effectual intrinsic cost is that of getting the thing in the right way effectual cost is that of getting the thing in the way we set about it but intrinsic cost cannot be made a subject of analytical investigation being only partially discoverable and that by long experience effectual cost is all that the political economist can deal with that is to say the cost of the thing under existing circumstances and by known processes  cost being dependent much on application of method varies with the quantity of the thing wanted and with the number of persons who work for it it is easy to get a little of some things but difficult to get much it is impossible to get some things with few hands but easy to get them with many  62 the cost and value of things however difficult to determine accurately are thus both dependent on ascertainable physical circumstances28  but their price is dependent on the human will  such and such a thing is demonstrably good for so much and it may demonstrably be had for so much  but it remains questionable and in all manner of ways questionable whether i choose to give so much29  this choice is always a relative one it is a choice to give a price for this rather than for thata resolution to have the thing if getting it does not involve the loss of a better thing price depends therefore not only on the cost of the commodity itself but on its relation to the cost of every other attainable thing  farther the power of choice is also a relative one it depends not merely on our own estimate of the thing but on everybody elses estimate therefore on the number and force of the will of the concurrent buyers and on the existing quantity of the thing in proportion to that number and force  hence the price of anything depends on four variables  1 its cost  2 its attainable quantity at that cost  3 the number and power of the persons who want it  4 the estimate they have formed of its desirableness  its value only affects its price so far as it is contemplated in this estimate perhaps therefore not at all  63 now in order to show the manner in which price is expressed in terms of a currency we must assume these four quantities to be known and the estimate of desirableness commonly called the demand to be certain we will take the number of persons at the lowest let a and b be two labourers who demand that is to say have resolved to labour for two articles a and b their demand for these articles if the reader likes better he may say their need is to be conceived as absolute their existence depending on the getting these two things suppose for instance that they are bread and fuel in a cold country and let a represent the least quantity of bread and b the least quantity of fuel which will support a mans life for a day let a be producible by an hours labour but b only by two hours labour  then the cost of a is one hour and of b two cost by our definition being expressible in terms of time if therefore each man worked both for his corn and fuel each would have to work three hours a day but they divide the labour for its greater ease30 then if a works three hours he produces 3 a which is one a more than both the men want and if b works three hours he produces only 112 b or half of b less than both want but if a work three hours and b six a has 3 a and b has 3 b a maintenance in the right proportion for both for a day and half so that each might take half a days rest but as b has worked double time the whole of this days rest belongs in equity to him therefore the just exchange should be a giving two a for one b has one a and one bmaintenance for a day b giving one b for two a has two a and two b maintenance for two days  but b cannot rest on the second day or a would be left without the article which b produces nor is there any means of making the exchange just unless a third labourer is called in then one workman a produces a and two b and c produce ba working three hours has three ab three hours 112 bc three hours 112 b b and c each give half of b for a and all have their equal daily maintenance for equal daily work  to carry the example a single step farther let three articles a b and c be needed  let a need one hours work b two and c four then the days work must be seven hours and one man in a days work can make 7 a or 312 b or 134 c  therefore one a works for a producing 7 a two bs work for b producing 7 b four cs work for c producing 7 c  a has six a to spare and gives two a for one b and four a for one c each b has 212 b to spare and gives 12 b for one a and two b for one c  each c has 34 of c to spare and gives 12 c for one b and 14 of c for one a  and all have their days maintenance  generally therefore it follows that if the demand is constant31 the relative prices of things are as their costs or as the quantities of labour involved in production  64 then in order to express their prices in terms of a currency we have only to put the currency into the form of orders for a certain quantity of any given article with us it is in the form of orders for gold and all quantities of other articles are priced by the relation they bear to the article which the currency claims  but the worth of the currency itself is not in the slightest degree founded more on the worth of the article which it either claims or consists in as gold than on the worth of every other article for which the gold is exchangeable it is just as accurate to say so many pounds are worth an acre of land as an acre of land is worth so many pounds the worth of gold of land of houses and of food and of all other things depends at any moment on the existing quantities and relative demands for all and each and a change in the worth of or demand for any one involves an instantaneously correspondent change in the worth of and demand for all the resta change as inevitable and as accurately balanced though often in its process as untraceable as the change in volume of the outflowing river from some vast lake caused by change in the volume of the inflowing streams though no eye can trace nor instrument detect motion either on its surface or in the depth  65 thus then the real working power or worth of the currency is founded on the entire sum of the relative estimates formed by the population of its possessions a change in this estimate in any direction and therefore every change in the national character instantly alters the value of money in its second great function of commanding labour but we must always carefully and sternly distinguish between this worth of currency dependent on the conceived or appreciated value of what it represents and the worth of it dependent on the existence of what it represents a currency is true or false in proportion to the security with which it gives claim to the possession of land house horse or picture but a currency is strong or weak32 worth much or worth little in proportion to the degree of estimate in which the nation holds the house horse or picture which is claimed thus the power of the english currency has been till of late largely based on the national estimate of horses and of wine so that a man might always give any price to furnish choicely his stable or his cellar and receive public approval therefor but if he gave the same sum to furnish his library he was called mad or a bibliomaniac and although he might lose his fortune by his horses and his health or life by his cellar and rarely lost either by his books he was yet never called a hippomaniac nor an oinomaniac but only bibliomaniac because the current worth of money was understood to be legitimately founded on cattle and wine but not on literature the prices lately given at sales for pictures and mss indicate some tendency to change in the national character in this respect so that the worth of the currency may even come in time to rest in an acknowledged manner somewhat on the state and keeping of the bedford missal as well as on the health of caractacus or blink bonny and old pictures be considered property no less than old port they might have been so before now but that it is more difficult to choose the one than the other  66 now observe all these sources of variation in the power of the currency exist wholly irrespective of the influences of vice indolence and improvidence we have hitherto supposed throughout the analysis every professing labourer to labour honestly heartily and in harmony with his fellows we have now to bring farther into the calculation the effects of relative industry honour and forethought and thus to follow out the bearings of our second inquiry who are the holders of the store and currency and in what proportions  this however we must reserve for our next papernoticing here only that however distinct the several branches of the subject are radically they are so interwoven in their issues that we cannot rightly treat any one till we have taken cognizance of all thus the need of the currency in proportion to number of population is materially influenced by the probable number of the holders in proportion to the nonholders and this again by the number of holders of goods or wealth in proportion to the nonholders of goods for as by definition the currency is a claim to goods which are not possessed its quantity indicates the number of claimants in proportion to the number of holders and the force and complexity of claim for if the claims be not complex currency as a means of exchange may be very small in quantity a sells some corn to b receiving a promise from b to pay in cattle which a then hands over to c to get some wine c in due time claims the cattle from b and b takes back his promise these exchanges have or might have been all effected with a single coin or promise and the proportion of the currency to the store would in such circumstances indicate only the circulating vitality of itthat is to say the quantity and convenient divisibility of that part of the store which the habits of the nation keep in circulation if a cattle breeder is content to live with his household chiefly on meat and milk and does not want rich furniture or jewels or booksif a wine and corn grower maintains himself and his men chiefly on grapes and breadif the wives and daughters of families weave and spin the clothing of the household and the nation as a whole remains content with the produce of its own soil and the work of its own hands it has little occasion for circulating media it pledges and promises little and seldom exchanges only so far as exchange is necessary for life the store belongs to the people in whose hands it is found and money is little needed either as an expression of right or practical means of division and exchange  67 but in proportion as the habits of the nation become complex and fantastic and they may be both without therefore being civilized its circulating medium must increase in proportion to its store if every one wants a little of everythingif food must be of many kinds and dress of many fashionsif multitudes live by work which ministering to fancy has its pay measured by fancy so that large prices will be given by one person for what is valueless to anotherif there are great inequalities of knowledge causing great inequalities of estimateand finally and worst of all if the currency itself from its largeness and the power which the possession of it implies becomes the sole object of desire with large numbers of the nation so that the holding of it is disputed among them as the main object of lifein each and all of these cases the currency necessarily enlarges in proportion to the store and as a means of exchange and division as a bond of right and as an object of passion has a more and more important and malignant power over the nations dealings character and life  against which power when as a bond of right it becomes too conspicuous and too burdensome the popular voice is apt to be raised in a violent and irrational manner leading to revolution instead of remedy whereas all possibility of economy depends on the clear assertion and maintenance of this bond of right however burdensome the first necessity of all economical government is to secure the unquestioned and unquestionable working of the great law of propertythat a man who works for a thing shall be allowed to get it keep it and consume it in peace and that he who does not eat his cake today shall be seen without grudging to have his cake tomorrow this i say is the first point to be secured by social law without this no political advance nay no political existence is in any sort possible whatever evil luxury iniquity may seem to result from it this is nevertheless the first of all equities and to the enforcement of this by law and by policetruncheon the nation must always primarily set its mindthat the cupboard door may have a firm lock to it and no mans dinner be carried off by the mob on its way home from the bakers which thus fearlessly asserting we shall endeavour in next paper to consider how far it may be practicable for the mob itself also in due breadth of dish to have dinners to carry home  footnotes  14 remember carefully this statement that wealth consists only in the things which the nature of humanity has rendered in all ages and must render in all ages to come that is what i meant by constant the objects of legitimate desire and see appendix ii  15 the wanderings observe not the right goings of imagination she is very far from despising these  16 see appendix iii  17 i would beg the readers very close attention to these 37th and 38th paragraphs it would be well if a dogged conviction could be enforced on nations as on individuals that with few exceptions what they cannot at present pay for they should not at present have  18 see appendix iv  19 i little thought what trionfo della morte would be for this very cause and in literal fulfilment of the closing words of the 47th paragraph over the fields and houses of europe and over its fairest citywithin seven years from the day i wrote it  20 the meaning of which is that you may spend a great deal of money and get very little work for it and that little bad but having good air or spirit to put life into it with very little money you may get a great deal of work and all good which observe is an arithmetical not at all a poetical or visionary circumstance  21 more especially works of great art  22 the meaning of that in plain english is that we must find out how far poverty and riches are good or bad for people and what is the difference between being miserably poorso as perhaps to be driven to crime or to pass life in sufferingand being blessedly poor in the sense meant in the sermon on the mount for i suppose the people who believe that sermon do not think if they ever honestly ask themselves what they do think either that luke vi 24 is a merely poetical exclamation or that the beatitude of poverty has yet been attained in st martins lane and other back streets of london  23 large planseight years are gone and nothing done yet but i keep my purpose of making one day this balance or want of balance visible in those so seldom used scales of justice  24 these are nearly all briefly represented by the image used for the force of money by dante of mast and sail      quali dal vento le gonfiate vele     caggiono avvolte poi che lalber fiacca     tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele  the image may be followed out like all of dantes into as close detail as the reader chooses thus the stress of the sail must be proportioned to the strength of the mast and it is only in unforeseen danger that a skilful seaman ever carries all the canvas his spars will bear states of mercantile languor are like the flap of the sail in a calm of mercantile precaution like taking in reefs and mercantile ruin is instant on the breaking of the mast  i mean by creditpower the general impression on the national mind that a sovereign or any other coin is worth so much bread and cheeseso much wineso much horse and carriageor so much fine art it may be really worth when tried less or more than is thought the thought of it is the creditpower  25 the object of political economy is not to buy nor to sell labour but to spare it every attempt to buy or sell it is in the outcome ineffectual so far as successful it is not sale but betrayal and the purchasemoney is a part of that thirty pieces which bought first the greatest of labours and afterwards the burialfield of the stranger for this purchasemoney being in its very smallness or vileness the exactly measured opposite of the vilis annona amicorum makes all men strangers to each other  26 ciceros distinction sordidi qu√¶stus quorum oper√¶ non quorum artes emuntur admirable in principle is inaccurate in expression because cicero did not practically know how much operative dexterity is necessary in all the higher arts but the cost of this dexterity is incalculable be it great or small the cost of the mere perfectness of touch in a hammerstroke of donatellos or a penciltouch of correggios is inestimable by any ordinary arithmetic  old notes these more embarrassing i now perceive than elucidatory but right and worth retaining  27 only observe as some labour is more destructive of life than other labour the hour or day of the more destructive toil is supposed to include proportionate rest though men do not or cannot usually take such rest except in death  28 there is therefore observe no such thing as cheapness in the common use of that term without some error or injustice a thing is said to be cheap not because it is common but because it is supposed to be sold under its worth everything has its proper and true worth at any given time in relation to everything else and at that worth should be bought and sold if sold under it it is cheap to the buyer by exactly so much as the seller loses and no more putrid meat at twopence a pound is not cheaper than wholesome meat at sevenpence a pound it is probably much dearer but if by watching your opportunity you can get the wholesome meat for sixpence a pound it is cheaper to you by a penny which you have gained and the seller has lost the present rage for cheapness is either therefore simply and literally a rage for badness of all commodities or it is an attempt to find persons whose necessities will force them to let you have more than you should for your money it is quite easy to produce such persons and in large numbers for the more distress there is in a nation the more cheapness of this sort you can obtain and your boasted cheapness is thus merely a measure of the extent of your national distress  there is indeed a condition of apparent cheapness which we have some right to be triumphant in namely the real reduction in cost of articles by right application of labour but in this case the article is only cheap with reference to its former price the socalled cheapness is only our expression for the sensation of contrast between its former and existing prices so soon as the new methods of producing the article are established it ceases to be esteemed either cheap or dear at the new price as at the old one and is felt to be cheap only when accident enables it to be purchased beneath this new value and it is no advantage to produce the article more easily except as it enables you to multiply your population cheapness of this kind is merely the discovery that more men can be maintained on the same ground and the question how many you will maintain in proportion to your additional means remains exactly in the same terms that it did before  a form of immediate cheapness results however in many cases without distress from the labour of a population where food is redundant or where the labour by which the food is produced leaves much idle time on their hands which may be applied to the production of cheap articles  all such phenomena indicate to the political economist places where the labour is unbalanced in the first case the just balance is to be effected by taking labourers from the spot where pressure exists and sending them to that where food is redundant in the second the cheapness is a local accident advantageous to the local purchaser disadvantageous to the local producer it is one of the first duties of commerce to extend the market and thus give the local producer his full advantage  cheapness caused by natural accidents of harvest weather c is always counterbalanced in due time by natural scarcity similarly caused it is the part of wise government and healthy commerce so to provide in times and places of plenty for times and places of dearth as that there shall never be waste nor famine  cheapness caused by gluts of the market is merely a disease of clumsy and wanton commerce  29 price has been already defined p 9 to be the quantity of labour which the possessor of a thing is willing to take for it it is best to consider the price to be that fixed by the possessor because the possessor has absolute power of refusing sale while the purchaser has no absolute power of compelling it but the effectual or market price is that at which their estimates coincide  30 this greater ease ought to be allowed for by a diminution in the times of the divided work but as the proportion of times would remain the same i do not introduce this unnecessary complexity into the calculation  31 compare unto this last p 115 et seq  32 that is to say the love of money is founded first on the intenseness of desire for given things a youth will rob the till nowadays for pantomime tickets and cigars the strength of the currency being irresistible to him in consequence of his desire for those luxuries     chapter iii  coinkeeping   68 it will be seen by reference to the last chapter that our present task is to examine the relation of holders of store to holders of currency and of both to those who hold neither in order to do this we must determine on which side we are to place substances such as gold commonly known as bases of currency by aid of previous definitions the reader will now be able to understand closer statements than have yet been possible  69 the currency of any country consists of every document acknowledging debt which is transferable in the country33  this transferableness depends upon its intelligibility and credit its intelligibility depends chiefly on the difficulty of forging anything like itits credit much on national character but ultimately always on the existence of substantial means of meeting its demand34  as the degrees of transferableness are variable some documents passing only in certain places and others passing if at all for less than their inscribed value both the mass and so to speak fluidity of the currency are variable true or perfect currency flows freely like a pure stream it becomes sluggish or stagnant in proportion to the quantity of less transferable matter which mixes with it adding to its bulk but diminishing its purity articles of commercial value on which bills are drawn increase the currency indefinitely and substances of intrinsic value if stamped or signed without restriction so as to become acknowledgments of debt increase it indefinitely also every bit of gold found in australia so long as it remains uncoined is an article offered for sale like any other but as soon as it is coined into pounds it diminishes the value of every pound we have now in our pockets  70 legally authorized or national currency in its perfect condition is a form of public acknowledgment of debt so regulated and divided that any person presenting a commodity of tried worth in the public market shall if he please receive in exchange for it a document giving him claim to the return of its equivalent 1 in any place 2 at any time and 3 in any kind  when currency is quite healthy and vital the persons entrusted with its management are always able to give on demand either  a the assigning document for the assigned quantity of goods or  b the assigned quantity of goods for the assigning document  if they cannot give document for goods the national exchange is at fault  if they cannot give goods for document the national credit is at fault  the nature and power of the document are therefore to be examined under the three relations it bears to place time and kind  71 1 it gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth in any place its use in this function is to save carriage so that parting with a bushel of corn in london we may receive an order for a bushel of corn at the antipodes or elsewhere to be perfect in this use the substance of currency must be to the maximum portable credible and intelligible its nonacceptance or discredit results always from some form of ignorance or dishonour so far as such interruptions rise out of differences in denomination there is no ground for their continuance among civilized nations it may be convenient in one country to use chiefly copper for coinage in another silver and in another goldreckoning accordingly in centimes francs or zecchins but that a franc should be different in weight and value from a shilling and a zwanziger vary from both is wanton loss of commercial power  72 2 it gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth at any time in this second use currency is the exponent of accumulation it renders the layingup of store at the command of individuals unlimitedly possiblewhereas but for its intervention all gathering would be confined within certain limits by the bulk of property or by its decay or the difficulty of its guardianship i will pull down my barns and build greater cannot be a daily saying and all material investment is enlargement of care the national currency transfers the guardianship of the store to many and preserves to the original producer the right of reentering on its possession at any future period  73 3 it gives claim practical though not legal to the return of equivalent wealth in any kind it is a transferable right not merely to this or that but to anything and its power in this function is proportioned to the range of choice if you give a child an apple or a toy you give him a determinate pleasure but if you give him a penny an indeterminate one proportioned to the range of selection offered by the shops in the village the power of the worlds currency is similarly in proportion to the openness of the worlds fair and commonly enhanced by the brilliancy of external aspect rather than solidity of its wares  74 we have said that the currency consists of orders for equivalent goods if equivalent their quality must be guaranteed the kinds of goods chosen for specific claim must therefore be capable of test while also that a store may be kept in hand to meet the call of the currency smallness of bulk with great relative value is desirable and indestructibility over at least a certain period essential  such indestructibility and facility of being tested are united in gold its intrinsic value is great and its imaginary value greater so that partly through indolence partly through necessity and want of organization most nations have agreed to take gold for the only basis of their currencieswith this grave disadvantage that its portability enabling the metal to become an active part of the medium of exchange the stream of the currency itself becomes opaque with goldhalf currency and half commodity in unison of functions which partly neutralize partly enhance each others force  75 they partly neutralize since in so far as the gold is commodity it is bad currency because liable to sale and in so far as it is currency it is bad commodity because its exchange value interferes with its practical use especially its employment in the higher branches of the arts becomes unsafe on account of its liability to be melted down for exchange  again they partly enhance since in so far as the gold has acknowledged intrinsic value it is good currency because everywhere acceptable and in so far as it has legal exchangeable value its worth as a commodity is increased we want no gold in the form of dust or crystal but we seek for it coined because in that form it will pay baker and butcher and this worth in exchange not only absorbs a large quantity in that use35 but greatly increases the effect on the imagination of the quantity used in the arts thus in brief the force of the functions is increased but their precision blunted by their unison  76 these inconveniences however attach to gold as a basis of currency on account of its portability and preciousness but a far greater inconvenience attaches to it as the only legal basis of currency imagine gold to be only attainable in masses weighing several pounds each and its value like that of malachite or marble proportioned to its largeness of bulkit could not then get itself confused with the currency in daily use but it might still remain as its basis and this second inconvenience would still affect it namely that its significance as an expression of debt varies as that of every other article would with the popular estimate of its desirableness and with the quantity offered in the market my power of obtaining other goods for gold depends always on the strength of public passion for gold and on the limitation of its quantity so that when either of two things happenthat the world esteems gold less or finds it more easilymy right of claim is in that degree effaced and it has been even gravely maintained that a discovery of a mountain of gold would cancel the national debt in other words that men may be paid for what costs much in what costs nothing now it is true that there is little chance of sudden convulsion in this respect the world will not so rapidly increase in wisdom as to despise gold on a sudden and perhaps may for a little time desire it more eagerly the more easily it is obtained nevertheless the right of debt ought not to rest on a basis of imagination nor should the frame of a national currency vibrate with every misers panic and every merchants imprudence  77 there are two methods of avoiding this insecurity which would have been fallen upon long ago if instead of calculating the conditions of the supply of gold men had only considered how the world might live and manage its affairs without gold at all36 one is to base the currency on substances of truer intrinsic value the other to base it on several substances instead of one if i can only claim gold the discovery of a golden mountain starves me but if i can claim bread the discovery of a continent of cornfields need not trouble me if however i wish to exchange my bread for other things a good harvest will for the time limit my power in this respect but if i can claim either bread iron or silk at pleasure the standard of value has three feet instead of one and will be proportionately firm thus ultimately the steadiness of currency depends upon the breadth of its base but the difficulty of organization increasing with this breadth the discovery of the condition at once safest and most convenient37 can only be by long analysis which must for the present be deferred gold or silver38 may always be retained in limited use as a luxury of coinage and questionless standard of one weight and alloy among all nations varying only in the die the purity of coinage when metallic is closely indicative of the honesty of the system of revenue and even of the general dignity of the state39  78 whatever the article or articles may be which the national currency promises to pay a premium on that article indicates bankruptcy of the government in that proportion the division of its assets being restrained only by the remaining confidence of the holders of notes in the return of prosperity to the firm currencies of forced acceptance or of unlimited issue are merely various modes of disguising taxation and delaying its pressure until it is too late to interfere with the cause of pressure to do away with the possibility of such disguise would have been among the first results of a true economical science had any such existed but there have been too many motives for the concealment so long as it could by any artifices be maintained to permit hitherto even the founding of such a science  79 and indeed it is only through evil conduct wilfully persisted in that there is any embarrassment either in the theory or working of currency no exchequer is ever embarrassed nor is any financial question difficult of solution when people keep their practice honest and their heads cool but when governments lose all office of pilotage protection or scrutiny and live only in magnificence of authorized larceny and polished mendacity or when the people choosing speculation the s usually redundant in the spelling instead of toil visit no dishonesty with chastisement that each may with impunity take his dishonest turnthere are no tricks of financial terminology that will save them all signature and mintage do but magnify the ruin they retard and even the riches that remain stagnant or current change only from the slime of avernus to the sand of phlegethonquicksand at the embouchureland fluently recommended by recent auctioneers as eligible for building leases  80 finally then the power of true currency is fourfold  1 credit power its worth in exchange dependent on public opinion of the stability and honesty of the issuer  2 real worth supposing the gold or whatever else the currency expressly promises to be required from the issuer for all his notes and that the call cannot be met in full then the actual worth of the document would be and its actual worth at any moment is therefore to be defined as what the division of the assets of the issuer would produce for it  3 the exchange power of its base granting that we can get five pounds in gold for our note it remains a question how much of other things we can get for five pounds in gold the more of other things exist and the less gold the greater this power  4 the power over labour exercised by the given quantity of the base or of the things to be got for it the question in this case is how much work and question of questions whose work is to be had for the food which five pounds will buy this depends on the number of the population on their gifts and on their dispositions with which down to their slightest humours and up to their strongest impulses the power of the currency varies  81 such being the main conditions of national currency we proceed to examine those of the total currency under the broad definition transferable acknowledgment of debt40 among the many forms of which there are in effect only two distinctly opposed namely the acknowledgments of debts which will be paid and of debts which will not documents whether in whole or part of bad debt being to those of good debt as bad money to bullion we put for the present these forms of imposture aside as in analysing a metal we should wash it clear of dross and then range in their exact quantities the true currency of the country on one side and the store or property of the country on the other we place gold and all such substances on the side of documents as far as they operate by signatureon the side of store as far as they operate by value then the currency represents the quantity of debt in the country and the store the quantity of its possession the ownership of all the property is divided between the holders of currency and holders of store and whatever the claiming value of the currency is at any moment that value is to be deducted from the riches of the storeholders  82 farther as true currency represents by definition debts which will be paid it represents either the debtors wealth or his ability and willingness that is to say either wealth existing in his hands transferred to him by the creditor or wealth which as he is at some time surely to return it he is either increasing or if diminishing has the will and strength to reproduce a sound currency therefore as by its increase it represents enlarging debt represents also enlarging means but in this curious way that a certain quantity of it marks the deficiency of the wealth of the country from what it would have been if that currency had not existed41 in this respect it is like the detritus of a mountain assume that it lies at a fixed angle and the more the detritus the larger must be the mountain but it would have been larger still had there been none  83 farther though as above stated every man possessing money has usually also some property beyond what is necessary for his immediate wants and men possessing property usually also hold currency beyond what is necessary for their immediate exchanges it mainly determines the class to which they belong whether in their eyes the money is an adjunct of the property or the property of the money in the first case the holders pleasure is in his possessions and in his money subordinately as the means of bettering or adding to them in the second his pleasure is in his money and in his possessions only as representing it in the first case the money is as an atmosphere surrounding the wealth rising from it and raining back upon it but in the second it is as a deluge with the wealth floating and for the most part perishing in it42 the shortest distinction between the men is that the one wishes always to buy and the other to sell  84 such being the great relations of the classes their several characters are of the highest importance to the nation for on the character of the storeholders chiefly depend the preservation display and serviceableness of its wealth on that of the currencyholders its distribution on that of both its reproduction  we shall therefore ultimately find it to be of incomparably greater importance to the nation in whose hands the thing is put than how much of it is got and that the character of the holders may be conjectured by the quality of the store for such and such a man always asks for such and such a thing nor only asks for it but if it can be bettered betters it so that possession and possessor reciprocally act on each other through the entire sum of national possession the base nation asking for base things sinks daily to deeper vileness of nature and weakness in use while the noble nation asking for noble things rises daily into diviner eminence in both the tendency to degradation being surely marked by greek ataxia that is to say expanding the greek thought by carelessness as to the hands in which things are put consequent dispute for the acquisition of them disorderliness in the accumulation of them inaccuracy in the estimate of them and bluntness in conception as to the entire nature of possession  85 the currencyholders always increase in number and influence in proportion to the bluntness of nature and clumsiness of the storeholders for the less use people can make of things the more they want of them and the sooner weary of them and want to change them for something else and all frequency of change increases the quantity and power of currency the large currencyholder himself is essentially a person who never has been able to make up his mind as to what he will have and proceeds therefore in vague collection and aggregation with more and more infuriate passion urged by complacency in progress vacancy in idea and pride of conquest  while however there is this obscurity in the nature of possession of currency there is a charm in the seclusion of it which is to some people very enticing in the enjoyment of real property others must partly share the groom has some enjoyment of the stud and the gardener of the garden but the money is or seems shut up it is wholly enviable no one else can have part in any complacencies arising from it  the power of arithmetical comparison is also a great thing to unimaginative people they know always they are so much better than they were in money so much better than others in money but wit cannot be so compared nor character my neighbour cannot be convinced that i am wiser than he is but he can that i am worth so much more and the universality of the conviction is no less flattering than its clearness only a few can understandnone measureand few will willingly adore superiorities in other things but everybody can understand money everybody can count it and most will worship it  86 now these various temptations to accumulation would be politically harmless if what was vainly accumulated had any fair chance of being wisely spent for as accumulation cannot go on for ever but must some day end in its reverseif this reverse were indeed a beneficial distribution and use as irrigation from reservoir the fever of gathering though perilous to the gatherer might be serviceable to the community but it constantly happens so constantly that it may be stated as a political law having few exceptions that what is unreasonably gathered is also unreasonably spent by the persons into whose hands it finally falls very frequently it is spent in war or else in a stupefying luxury twice hurtful both in being indulged by the rich and witnessed by the poor so that the mal tener and mal dare are as correlative as complementary colours and the circulation of wealth which ought to be soft steady strong farsweeping and full of warmth like the gulf stream being narrowed into an eddy and concentrated at a point changes into the alternate suction and surrender of charybdis which is indeed i doubt not the true meaning of that marvellous fable infinite as bacon said of it in matter of meditation43  87 it is a strange habit of wise humanity to speak in enigmas only so that the highest truths and usefullest laws must be hunted for through whole picturegalleries of dreams which to the vulgar seem dreams only thus homer the greek tragedians plato dante chaucer shakspeare and goethe have hidden all that is chiefly serviceable in their work and in all the various literature they absorbed and reembodied under types which have rendered it quite useless to the multitude what is worse the two primal declarers of moral discovery homer and plato are partly at issue for platos logical power quenched his imagination and he became incapable of understanding the purely imaginative element either in poetry or painting he therefore somewhat overrates the pure discipline of passionate art in song and music and misses that of meditative art there is however a deeper reason for his distrust of homer his love of justice and reverently religious nature made him dread as death every form of fallacy but chiefly fallacy respecting the world to come his own myths being only symbolic exponents of a rational hope we shall perhaps now every day discover more clearly how right plato was in this and feel ourselves more and more wonderstruck that men such as homer and dante and in an inferior sphere milton not to speak of the great sculptors and painters of every age have permitted themselves though full of all nobleness and wisdom to coin idle imaginations of the mysteries of eternity and guide the faiths of the families of the earth by the courses of their own vague and visionary arts while the indisputable truths of human life and duty respecting which they all have but one voice lie hidden behind these veils of phantasy unsought and often unsuspected i will gather carefully out of dante and homer what in this kind bears on our subject in its due place the first broad intention of their symbols may be sketched at once  88 the rewards of a worthy use of riches subordinate to other ends are shown by dante in the fifth and sixth orbs of paradise for the punishment of their unworthy use three places are assigned one for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are lost hell canto 7 one for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are capable of purification purgatory canto 19 and one for the usurers of whom none can be redeemed hell canto 17 the first group the largest in all hell gente piu che altrove troppa compare virgils qu√¶ maxima turba meet in contrary currents as the waves of charybdis casting weights at each other from opposite sides this weariness of contention is the chief element of their torture so marked by the beautiful lines beginning or puoi figliuol c but the usurers who made their money inactively sit on the sand equally without rest however di qua di la soccorrien c for it is not avarice but contention for riches leading to this double misuse of them which in dantes light is the unredeemable sin the place of its punishment is guarded by plutus the great enemy and la fi√®ra crudele a spirit quite different from the greek plutus who though old and blind is not cruel and is curable so as to become farsighted greek ou typhlos all oxy blep√¥nplatos epithets in first book of the laws still more does this dantesque type differ from the resplendent plutus of goethe in the second part of faust who is the personified power of wealth for good or evilnot the passion for wealth and again from the plutus of spenser who is the passion of mere aggregation dantes plutus is specially and definitely the spirit of contention and competition or evil commerce because as i showed before this kind of commerce makes all men strangers his speech is therefore unintelligible and no single soul of all those ruined by him has recognizable features  on the other hand the redeemable sins of avarice and prodigality are in dantes sight those which are without deliberate or calculated operation the lust or lavishness of riches can be purged so long as there has been no servile consistency of dispute and competition for them the sin is spoken of as that of degradation by the love of earth it is purified by deeper humiliationthe souls crawl on their bellies their chant is my soul cleaveth unto the dust but the spirits thus condemned are all recognizable and even the worst examples of the thirst for gold which they are compelled to tell the histories of during the night are of men swept by the passion of avarice into violent crime but not sold to its steady work  89 the precept given to each of these spirits for its deliverance isturn thine eyes to the lucre lure which the eternal king rolls with the mighty wheels otherwise the wheels of the greater fortune of which the constellation is ascending when dantes dream begins compare george herbert                    lift up thy head     take stars for money stars not to be told     by any art yet to be purchased  and platos notable sentence in the third book of the politytell them they have divine gold and silver in their souls for ever that they need no money stamped of menneither may they otherwise than impiously mingle the gathering of the divine with the mortal treasure for through that which the law of the multitude has coined endless crimes have been done and suffered but in theirs is neither pollution nor sorrow  90 at the entrance of this place of punishment an evil spirit is seen by dante quite other than the gran nemico the great enemy is obeyed knowingly and willingly but this spiritfeminineand called a sirenis the deceitfulness of riches greek apat√™ ploutou of the gospels winning obedience by guile this is the idol of riches made doubly phantasmal by dantes seeing her in a dream she is lovely to look upon and enchants by her sweet singing but her womb is loathsome now dante does not call her one of the sirens carelessly any more than he speaks of charybdis carelessly and though he had got at the meaning of the homeric fable only through virgils obscure tradition of it the clue he has given us is quite enough bacons interpretation the sirens or pleasures which has become universal since his time is opposed alike to platos meaning and homers the sirens are not pleasures but desires in the odyssey they are the phantoms of vain desire but in platos vision of destiny phantoms of divine desire singing each a different note on the circles of the distaff of necessity but forming one harmony to which the three great fates put words dante however adopted the homeric conception of them which was that they were demons of the imagination not carnal desire of the eyes not lust of the flesh therefore said to be daughters of the muses yet not of the muses heavenly or historical but of the muse of pleasure and they are at first winged because even vain hope excites and helps when first formed but afterwards contending for the possession of the imagination with the muses themselves they are deprived of their wings  91 and thus we are to distinguish the siren power from the power of circe who is no daughter of the muses but of the strong elements sun and sea her power is that of frank and full vital pleasure which if governed and watched nourishes men but unwatched and having no moly bitterness or delay mixed with it turns men into beasts but does not slay themleaves them on the contrary power of revival she is herself indeed an enchantresspure animal life transformingor degradingbut always wonderful she puts the stores on board the ship invisibly and is gone again like a ghost even the wild beasts rejoice and are softened around her cave the transforming poisons she gives to men are mixed with no rich feast but with pure and right nourishmentpramnian wine cheese and flour that is wine milk and corn the three great sustainers of lifeit is their own fault if these make swine of them see appendix v and swine are chosen merely as the type of consumption as platos greek hy√¥n polis in the second book of the polity and perhaps chosen by homer with a deeper knowledge of the likeness in variety of nourishment and internal form of body  et quel est sil vous plait cet audacieux animal qui se permet d√™tre b√¢ti au dedans comme une jolie petite fille  h√©las ch√®re enfant jai honte de le nommer et il ne faudra

que les choses fussent arrang√©es ainsi seulement le cochon qui ne pense qu√† manger a lestomac bien plus vaste que nous et cest toujours une consolationhistoire dune bouch√©e de pain lettre ix  92 but the deadly sirens are in all things opposed to the circean power they promise pleasure but never give it they nourish in no wise but slay by slow death and whereas they corrupt the heart and the head instead of merely betraying the senses there is no recovery from their power they do not tear nor scratch like scylla but the men who have listened to them are poisoned and waste away note that the sirens field is covered not merely with the bones but with the skins of those who have been consumed there they address themselves in the part of the song which homer gives not to the passions of ulysses but to his vanity and the only man who ever came within hearing of them and escaped untempted was orpheus who silenced the vain imaginations by singing the praises of the gods  93 it is then one of these sirens whom dante takes as the phantasm or deceitfulness of riches but note further that she says it was her song that deceived ulysses look back to dantes account of ulysses death and we find it was not the love of money but pride of knowledge that betrayed him whence we get the clue to dantes complete meaning that the souls whose love of wealth is pardonable have been first deceived into pursuit of it by a dream of its higher uses or by ambition his siren is therefore the philotim√© of spenser daughter of mammon      whom all that folk with such contention     do flock about my deare my daughter is     honour and dignitie from her alone     derived are  by comparing spensers entire account of this philotim√© with dantes of the wealthsiren we shall get at the full meaning of both poets but that of homer lies hidden much more deeply for his sirens are indefinite and they are desires of any evil thing power of wealth is not specially indicated by him until escaping the harmonious danger of imagination ulysses has to choose between two practical ways of life indicated by the two rocks of scylla and charybdis the monsters that haunt them are quite distinct from the rocks themselves which having many other subordinate significations are in the main labour and idleness or getting and spending each with its attendant monster or betraying demon the rock of gaining has its summit in the clouds invisible and not to be climbed that of spending is low but marked by the cursed figtree which has leaves but no fruit we know the type elsewhere and there is a curious lateral allusion to it by dante when jacopo di sant andrea who had ruined himself by profusion and committed suicide scatters the leaves of the bush of lotto degli agli endeavouring to hide himself among them we shall hereafter examine the type completely here i will only give an approximate rendering of homers words which have been obscured more by translation than even by tradition  94 they are overhanging rocks the great waves of blue water break round them and the blessed gods call them the wanderers  by one of them no winged thing can passnot even the wild doves that bring ambrosia to their father jovebut the smooth rock seizes its sacrifice of them not even ambrosia to be had without labour the word is peculiaras a part of anything is offered for sacrifice especially used of heaveoffering it reaches the wide heaven with its top and a dark blue cloud rests on it and never passes neither does the clear sky hold it in summer nor in harvest nor can any man climb itnot if he had twenty feet and hands for it is smooth as though it were hewn  and in the midst of it is a cave which is turned the way of hell and therein dwells scylla whining for prey her cry indeed is no louder than that of a newlyborn whelp but she herself is an awful thingnor can any creature see her face and be glad no though it were a god that rose against her for she has twelve feet all forefeet and six necks and terrible heads on them and each has three rows of teeth full of black death  but the opposite rock is lower than this though but a bowshot distant and upon it there is a great figtree full of leaves and under it the terrible charybdis sucks down the black water thrice in the day she sucks it down and thrice casts it up again be not thou there when she sucks down for neptune himself could not save thee  thus far went my rambling note in frasers magazine the editor sent me a compliment on itof which i was very proud what the publisher thought of it i am not informed only i know that eventually he stopped the papers i think a great deal of it myself now and have put it all in large print accordingly and should like to write more but will on the contrary selfdenyingly and in gratitude to any reader who has got through so much end my chapter  footnotes  33 remember this definition it is of great importance as opposed to the imperfect ones usually given when first these essays were published i remember one of their reviewers asking contemptuously is halfacrown a document it never having before occurred to him that a document might be stamped as well as written and stamped on silver as well as on parchment  34 i do not mean the demand of the holder of a fivepound note for five pounds but the demand of the holder of a pound for a pounds worth of something good  35 read and think over the following note very carefully the waste of labour in obtaining the gold though it cannot be estimated by help of any existing data may be understood in its bearing on entire economy by supposing it limited to transactions between two persons if two farmers in australia have been exchanging corn and cattle with each other for years keeping their accounts of reciprocal debt in any simple way the sum of the possessions of either would not be diminished though the part of it which was lent or borrowed were only reckoned by marks on a stone or notches on a tree and the one counted himself accordingly so many scratches or so many notches better than the other but it would soon be seriously diminished if discovering gold in their fields each resolved only to accept golden counters for a reckoning and accordingly whenever he wanted a sack of corn or a cow was obliged to go and wash sand for a week before he could get the means of giving a receipt for them  36 it is difficult to estimate the curious futility of discussions such as that which lately occupied a section of the british association on the absorption of gold while no one can produce even the simplest of the data necessary for the inquiry to take the first occurring onewhat means have we of ascertaining the weight of gold employed this year in the toilettes of the women of europe not to speak of asia and supposing it known what means of conjecturing the weight by which next year their fancies and the changes of style among their jewellers will diminish or increase it  37 see in popes epistle to lord bathurst his sketch of the difficulties and uses of a currency literally pecuniaryconsisting of herds of cattle      his grace will gameto whites a bull be led c  38 perhaps both perhaps silver only it may be found expedient ultimately to leave gold free for use in the arts as a means of reckoning the standard might be and in some cases has already been entirely idealsee mills political economy book iii chap vii at beginning  39 the purity of the drachma and zecchin were not without significance of the state of intellect art and policy both in athens and venicea fact first impressed upon me ten years ago when in taking daguerreotypes at venice i found no purchaseable gold pure enough to gild them with except that of the old venetian zecchin  40 under which term observe we include all documents of debt which being honest might be transferable though they practically are not transferred while we exclude all documents which are in reality worthless though in fact transferred temporarily as bad money is the document of honest debt not transferred is merely to paper currency as gold withdrawn from circulation is to that of bullion much confusion has crept into the reasoning on this subject from the idea that the withdrawal from circulation is a definable state whereas it is a graduated state and indefinable the sovereign in my pocket is withdrawn from circulation as long as i choose to keep it there it is no otherwise withdrawn if i bury it nor even if i choose to make it and others into a golden cup and drink out of them since a rise in the price of the wine or of other things may at any time cause me to melt the cup and throw it back into currency and the bullion operates on the prices of the things in the market as directly though not as forcibly while it is in the form of a cup as it does in the form of a sovereign no calculation can be founded on my humour in either case if i like to handle rouleaus and therefore keep a quantity of gold to play with in the form of jointed basaltic columns it is all one in its effect on the market as if i kept it in the form of twisted filigree or steadily amicus lamn√¶ beat the narrow gold pieces into broad ones and dined off them the probability is greater that i break the rouleau than that i melt the plate but the increased probability is not calculable thus documents are only withdrawn from the currency when cancelled and bullion when it is so effectually lost as that the probability of finding it is no greater than of finding new gold in the mine  41 for example suppose an active peasant having got his ground into good order and built himself a comfortable house finding time still on his hands sees one of his neighbours little able to work and illlodged and offers to build him also a house and to put his land in order on condition of receiving for a given period rent for the building and tithe of the fruits the offer is accepted and a document given promissory of rent and tithe this note is money it can only be good money if the man who has incurred the debt so far recovers his strength as to be able to take advantage of the help he has received and meet the demand of the note if he lets his house fall to ruin and his field to waste his promissory note will soon be valueless but the existence of the note at all is a consequence of his not having worked so stoutly as the other let him gain as much as to be able to pay back the entire debt the note is cancelled and we have two rich storeholders and no currency  42 you need not trouble yourself to make out the sentence in parenthesis unless you like but do not think it is mere metaphor it states a fact which i could not have stated so shortly but by metaphor  43 what follows to the end of the chapter was a note only in the first printing but for after service it is of more value than any other part of the book so i have put it into the main text     chapter iv  commerce   95 as the currency conveys right of choice out of many things in exchange for one so commerce is the agency by which the power of choice is obtained so that countries producing only timber can obtain for their timber silk and gold or naturally producing only jewels and frankincense can obtain for them cattle and corn in this function commerce is of more importance to a country in proportion to the limitations of its products and the restlessness of its fancygenerally of greater importance towards northern latitudes  96 commerce is necessary however not only to exchange local products but local skill labour requiring the agency of fire can only be given abundantly in cold countries labour requiring suppleness of body and sensitiveness of touch only in warm ones labour involving accurate vivacity of thought only in temperate ones while peculiar imaginative actions are produced by extremes of heat and cold and of light and darkness the production of great art is limited to climates warm enough to admit of repose in the open air and cool enough to render such repose delightful minor variations in modes of skill distinguish every locality the labour which at any place is easiest is in that place cheapest and it becomes often desirable that products raised in one country should be wrought in another hence have arisen discussions on international values which will be one day remembered as highly curious exercises of the human mind for it will be discovered in due course of tide and time that international value is regulated just as interprovincial or interparishional value is coals and hops are exchanged between northumberland and kent on absolutely the same principles as iron and wine between lancashire and spain the greater breadth of an arm of the sea increases the cost but does not modify the principle of exchange and a bargain written in two languages will have no other economical results than a bargain written in one the distances of nations are measured not by seas but by ignorances and their divisions determined not by dialects but by enmities44  97 of course a system of international values may always be constructed if we assume a relation of moral law to physical geography as for instance that it is right to cheat or rob across a river though not across a road or across a sea though not across a river cagain a system of such values may be constructed by assuming similar relations of taxation to physical geography as for instance that an article should be taxed in crossing a river but not in crossing a road or in being carried fifty miles but not in being carried five c such positions are indeed not easily maintained when once put in logical form but one law of international value is maintainable in any form namely that the farther your neighbour lives from you and the less he understands you the more you are bound to be true in your dealings with him because your power over him is greater in proportion to his ignorance and his remedy more difficult in proportion to his distance45  98 i have just said the breadth of sea increases the cost of exchange now note that exchange or commerce in itself is always costly the sum of the value of the goods being diminished by the cost of their conveyance and by the maintenance of the persons employed in it so that it is only when there is advantage to both producers in getting the one thing for the other greater than the loss in conveyance that the exchange is expedient and it can only be justly conducted when the porters kept by the producers commonly called merchants expect mere pay and not profit46 for in just commerce there are but three partiesthe two persons or societies exchanging and the agent or agents of exchange the value of the things to be exchanged is known by both the exchangers and each receives equal value neither gaining nor losing for whatever one gains the other loses the intermediate agent is paid a known percentage by both partly for labour in conveyance partly for care knowledge and risk every attempt at concealment of the amount of the pay indicates either effort on the part of the agent to obtain unjust profit or effort on the part of the exchangers to refuse him just pay but for the most part it is the first namely the effort on the part of the merchant to obtain larger profit socalled by buying cheap and selling dear some part indeed of this larger gain is deserved and might be openly demanded because it is the reward of the merchants knowledge and foresight of probable necessity but the greater part of such gain is unjust and unjust in this most fatal way that it depends first on keeping the exchangers ignorant of the exchange value of the articles and secondly on taking advantage of the buyers need and the sellers poverty it is therefore one of the essential and quite the most fatal forms of usury for usury means merely taking an exorbitant47 sum for the use of anything and it is no matter whether the exorbitance is on loan or exchange on rent or on pricethe essence of the usury being that it is obtained by advantage of opportunity or necessity and not as due reward for labour all the great thinkers therefore have held it to be unnatural and impious in so far as it feeds on the distress of others or their folly48 nevertheless attempts to repress it by law must for ever be ineffective though plato bacon and the first napoleonall three of them men who knew somewhat more of humanity than the british merchant usually doestried their hands at it and have left some probably good moderative forms of law which we will examine in their place but the only final check upon it must be radical purifying of the national character for being as bacon calls it concessum propter duritiem cordis it is to be done away with by touching the heart only not however without medicinal lawas in the case of the other permission propter duritiem but in this more than in anything though much in all and though in this he would not himself allow of their application for his own laws against usury are sharp enough platos words in the fourth book of the polity are true that neither drugs nor charms nor burnings will touch a deeplying political sore any more than a deep bodily one but only right and utter change of constitution and that they do but lose their labour who think that by any tricks of law they can get the better of these mischiefs of commerce and see not that they hew at a hydra  99 and indeed this hydra seems so unslayable and sin sticks so fast between the joinings of the stones of buying and selling that to trade in things or literally crossgive them has warped itself by the instinct of nations into their worst word for fraud for because in trade there cannot but be trust and it seems also that there cannot but also be injury in answer to it what is merely fraud between enemies becomes treachery among friends and trader traditor and traitor are but the same word for which simplicity of language there is more reason than at first appears for as in true commerce there is no profit so in true commerce there is no sale the idea of sale is that of an interchange between enemies respectively endeavouring to get the better one of another but commerce is an exchange between friends and there is no desire but that it should be just any more than there would be between members of the same family49 the moment there is a bargain over the pottage the family relation is dissolvedtypically the days of mourning for my father are at hand whereupon follows the resolve then will i slay my brother  100 this inhumanity of mercenary commerce is the more notable because it is a fulfilment of the law that the corruption of the best is the worst for as taking the body natural for symbol of the body politic the governing and forming powers may be likened to the brain and the labouring to the limbs the mercantile presiding over circulation and communication of things in changed utilities is symbolized by the heart and if that hardens all is lost and this is the ultimate lesson which the leader of english intellect meant for us a lesson indeed not all his own but part of the old wisdom of humanity in the tale of the merchant of venice in which the true and incorrupt merchantkind and free beyond every other shakspearian conception of menis opposed to the corrupted merchant or usurer the lesson being deepened by the expression of the strange hatred which the corrupted merchant bears to the pure one mixed with intense scorn  this is the fool that lent out money gratis look to him jailer as to lunatic no less than criminal the enmity observe having its symbolism literally carried out by being aimed straight at the heart and finally foiled by a literal appeal to the great moral law that flesh and blood cannot be weighed enforced by portia50 portion the type of divine fortune found not in gold nor in silver but in lead that is to say in endurance and patience not in splendour and finally taught by her lips also declaring instead of the law and quality of merces the greater law and quality of mercy which is not strained but drops as the rain blessing him that gives and him that takes and observe that this mercy is not the mean misericordia but the mighty gratia answered by gratitude observe shylocks leaning on the to him detestable word gratis and compare the relations of grace to equity given in the second chapter of the second book of the memorabilia that is to say it is the gracious or loving instead of the strained or competing manner of doing things answered not only with merces or pay but with merci or thanks and this is indeed the meaning of the great benediction grace mercy and peace for there can be no peace without grace not even by help of rifled cannon nor even without triplicity of graciousness for the greeks who began but with one grace had to open their scheme into three before they had done  101 with the usual tendency of long repeated thought to take the surface for the deep we have conceived these goddesses as if they only gave loveliness to gesture whereas their true function is to give graciousness to deed the other loveliness arising naturally out of that in which function charis becomes charitas51 and has a name and praise even greater than that of faith or truth for these may be maintained sullenly and proudly but charis is in her countenance always gladdening aglaia and in her service instant and humble and the true wife of vulcan or labour and it is not until her sincerity of function is lost and her mere beauty contemplated instead of her patience that she is born again of the foam flake and becomes aphrodite and it is then only that she becomes capable of joining herself to war and to the enmities of men instead of to labour and their services therefore the fable of mars and venus is chosen by homer picturing himself as demodocus to sing at the games in the court of alcinous ph√¶acia is the homeric island of atlantis an image of noble and wise government concealed how slightly merely by the change of a short vowel for a long one in the name of its queen yet misunderstood by all later writers even by horace in his pinguis ph√¶axque that fable expresses the perpetual error of men in thinking that grace and dignity can only be reached by the soldier and never by the artisan so that commerce and the useful arts have had the honour and beauty taken away and only the fraud and pain left to them with the lucre which is indeed one great reason of the continual blundering about the offices of government with respect to commerce the higher classes are ashamed to employ themselves in it and though ready enough to fight for or occasionally against the peopleto preach to themor judge them will not break bread for them the refined upper servant who has willingly looked after the burnishing of the armoury and ordering of the library not liking to set foot in the larder  102 farther still as charis becomes charitas on the one side she becomesbetter stillchara joy on the other or rather this is her very mothers milk and the beauty of her childhood for god brings no enduring love nor any other good out of pain nor out of contention but out of joy and harmony and in this sense human and divine music and gladness and the measures of both come into her name and cher becomes fullvowelled cheer and cheerful and chara opens into choir and choral52  103 and lastly as grace passes into freedom of action charis becomes eleutheria or liberality a form of liberty quite curiously and intensely different from the thing usually understood by liberty in modern language indeed much more like what some people would call slavery for a greek always understood primarily by liberty deliverance from the law of his own passions or from what the christian writers call bondage of corruption and this a complete liberty not being merely safe from the siren but also unbound from the mast and not having to resist the passion but making it fawn upon and follow himthis may be again partly the meaning of the fawning beasts about the circean cave so again george herbert      correct thy passions spite     then may the beasts draw thee to happy light  and it is only in such generosity that any man becomes capable of so governing others as to take true part in any system of national economy nor is there any other eternal distinction between the upper and lower classes than this form of liberty eleutheria or benignity in the one and its opposite of slavery douleia or malignity in the other the separation of these two orders of men and the firm government of the lower by the higher being the first conditions of possible wealth and economy in any statethe gods giving it no greater gift than the power to discern its true freemen and malignum spernere vulgus  104 while i have traced the finer and higher laws of this matter for those whom they concern i have also to note the material lawvulgarly expressed in the proverb honesty is the best policy that proverb is indeed wholly inapplicable to matters of private interest it is not true that honesty as far as material gain is concerned profits individuals a clever and cruel knave will in a mixed society always be richer than an honest person can be but honesty is the best policy if policy mean practice of state for fraud gains nothing in a state it only enables the knaves in it to live at the expense of honest people while there is for every act of fraud however small a loss of wealth to the community whatever the fraudulent person gains some other person loses as fraud produces nothing and there is besides the loss of the time and thought spent in accomplishing the fraud and of the strength otherwise obtainable by mutual help not to speak of the fevers of anxiety and jealousy in the blood which are a heavy physical loss as i will show in due time practically when the nation is deeply corrupt cheat answers to cheat every one is in turn imposed upon and there is to the body politic the dead loss of the ingenuity together with the incalculable mischief of the injury to each defrauded person producing collateral effect unexpectedly my neighbour sells me bad meat i sell him in return flawed iron we neither of us get one atom of pecuniary advantage on the whole transaction but we both suffer unexpected inconvenience my men get scurvy and his cattletruck runs off the rails  105 the examination of this form of charis must therefore lead us into the discussion of the principles of government in general and especially of that of the poor by the rich discovering how the graciousness joined with the greatness or love with

understand it thus congregations meet weekly to invoke the influence of a spirit of life and truth yet if any part of that character were intelligibly expressed to them by the formulas of the service they would be offended suppose for instance in the closing benediction the clergyman were to give vital significance to the vague word holy and were to say the fellowship of the helpful and honest ghost be with you and remain with you always what would be the horror of many first at the irreverence of so intelligible an expression and secondly at the discomfortable occurrence of the suspicion that while throughout the commercial dealings of the week they had denied the propriety of help and possibility of honesty the person whose company they had been now asking to be blessed with could

mischief to any one who attempts to use him without knowing how so also our brother if we attempt to use him without knowing how may be a mischief to us     chapter v  government   106 it remains for us as i stated in the close of the last chapter to examine first the principles of government in general and then those of the government of the poor by the rich  the government of a state consists in its customs laws and councils and their enforcements   i customs  as one person primarily differs from another by fineness of nature and secondarily by fineness of training so also a polite nation differs from a savage one first by the refinement of its nature and secondly by the delicacy of its customs  in the completeness of custom which is the nations selfgovernment there are three stagesfirst fineness in method of doing or of beingcalled the manner or moral of acts secondly firmness in holding such method after adoption so that it shall become a habit in the character i e a constant having or behaving and lastly ethical power in performance and endurance which is the skill following on habit and the ease reached by frequency of right doing  the sensibility of the nation is indicated by the fineness of its customs its courage continence and selfrespect by its persistence in them  by sensibility i mean its natural perception of beauty fitness and rightness or of what is lovely decent and just faculties dependent much on race and the primal signs of fine breeding in man but cultivable also by education and necessarily perishing without it true education has indeed no other function than the development of these faculties and of the relative will it has been the great error of modern intelligence to mistake science for education you do not educate a man by telling him what he knew not but by making him what he was not  and making him what he will remain for ever for no wash of weeds will bring back the faded purple and in that dyeing there are two processesfirst the cleansing and wringingout which is the baptism with water and then the infusing of the blue and scarlet colours gentleness and justice which is the baptism with fire  10754 the customs and manners of a sensitive and highlytrained race are always vital that is to say they are orderly manifestations of intense life like the habitual action of the fingers of a musician the customs and manners of a vile and rude race on the contrary are conditions of decay they are not properly speaking habits but incrustations not restraints or forms of life but gangrenes noisome and the beginnings of death  and generally so far as custom attaches itself to indolence instead of action and to prejudice instead of perception it takes this deadly character so that thus      custom hangs upon us with a weight     heavy as frost and deep almost as life  but that weight if it become impetus living instead of dead weight is just what gives value to custom when it works with life instead of against it  108 the high ethical training of a nation implies perfect grace pitifulness and peace it is irreconcilably inconsistent with filthy or mechanical employmentswith the desire of moneyand with mental states of anxiety jealousy or indifference to pain the present insensibility of the upper classes of europe to the surrounding aspects of suffering uncleanness and crime binds them not only into one responsibility with the sin but into one dishonour with the foulness which rot at their thresholds the crimes daily recorded in the policecourts of london and paris and much more those which are unrecorded are a disgrace to the whole body politic55 they are as in the body natural stains of disease on a face of delicate skin making the delicacy itself frightful similarly the filth and poverty permitted or ignored in the midst of us are as dishonourable to the whole social body as in the body natural it is to wash the face but leave the hands and feet foul christs way is the only true one begin at the feet the face will take care of itself  109 yet since necessarily in the frame of a nation nothing but the head can be of gold and the feet for the work they have to do must be part of iron part of clayfoul or mechanical work is always reduced by a noble race to the minimum in quantity and even then performed and endured not without sense of degradation as a fine temper is wounded by the sight of the lower offices of the body the highest conditions of human society reached hitherto have cast such work to slaves but supposing slavery of a politically defined kind to be done away with mechanical and foul employment must in all highly organized states take the aspect either of punishment or probation all criminals should at once be set to the most dangerous and painful forms of it especially to work in mines and at furnaces56 so as to relieve the innocent population as far as possible of merely rough not mechanical manual labour especially agricultural a large portion should be done by the upper classesbodily health and sufficient contrast and repose for the mental functions being unattainable without it what necessarily inferior labour remains to be done as especially in manufactures should and always will when the relations of society are reverent and harmonious fall to the lot of those who for the time are fit for nothing better for as whatever the perfectness of the educational system there must remain infinite differences between the natures and capacities of men and these differing natures are generally rangeable under the two qualities of lordly or tending towards rule construction and harmony and servile or tending towards misrule destruction and discord and since the lordly part is only in a state of profitableness while ruling and the servile only in a state of redeemableness while serving the whole health of the state depends on the manifest separation of these two elements of its mind for if the servile part be not separated and rendered visible in service it mixes with and corrupts the entire body of the state and if the lordly part be not distinguished and set to rule it is crushed and lost being turned to no account so that the rarest qualities of the nation are all given to it in vain57   ii laws  110 these are the definitions and bonds of custom or of what the nation desires should become custom  law is either archic58 of direction meristic of division or critic of judgment  archic law is that of appointment and precept it defines what is and is not to be done  meristic law is that of balance and distribution it defines what is and is not to be possessed  critic law is that of discernment and award it defines what is and is not to be suffered   111 a archic law if we choose to unite the laws of precept and distribution under the head of statutes all law is simply either of statute or judgment that is first the establishment of ordinance and secondly the assignment of the reward or penalty due to its observance or violation  to some extent these two forms of law must be associated and with every ordinance the penalty of disobedience to it be also determined but since the degrees and guilt of disobedience vary the determination of due reward and punishment must be modified by discernment of special fact which is peculiarly the office of the judge as distinguished from that of the lawgiver and lawsustainer or king not but that the two offices are always theoretically and in early stages or limited numbers of society are often practically united in the same person or persons  112 also it is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinction between these two kinds of law because the possible range of law is wider in proportion to their separation there are many points of conduct respecting which the nation may wisely express its will by a written precept or resolve yet not enforce it by penalty59 and the expedient degree of penalty is always quite a separate consideration from the expedience of the statute for the statute may often be better enforced by mercy than severity and is also easier in the bearing and less likely to be abrogated farther laws of precept have reference especially to youth and concern themselves with training but laws of judgment to manhood and concern themselves with remedy and reward there is a highly curious feeling in the english mind against educational law we think no mans liberty should be interfered with till he has done irrevocable wrong whereas it is then just too late for the only gracious and kingly interference which is to hinder him from doing it make your educational laws strict and your criminal ones may be gentle but leave youth its liberty and you will have to dig dungeons for age and it is good for a man that he wear the yoke in his youth for the reins may then be of silken thread and with sweet chime of silver bells at the bridle but for the captivity of age you must forge the iron fetter and cast the passing bell  113 since no law can be in a final or true sense established but by right all unjust laws involving the ultimate necessity of their own abrogation the lawgiving can only become a lawsustaining power in so far as it is royal or right doingin so far that is as it rules not misrules and orders not disorders the things submitted to it throned on this rock of justice the kingly power becomes established and establishing greek theios or divine and therefore it is literally true that no ruler can err so long as he is a ruler or greek arch√¥n oudeis amartanei tote hotan arch√¥n √™ perverted by careless thought which has cost the world somewhat intothe king can do no wrong  114 b meristic law60 or that of the tenure of property first determines what every individual possesses by right and secures it to him and what he possesses by wrong and deprives him of it but it has a far higher provisory function it determines what every man should possess and puts it within his reach on due conditions and what he should not possess and puts this out of his reach conclusively  115 every article of human wealth has certain conditions attached to its merited possession when these are unobserved possession becomes rapine and the object of meristic law is not only to secure to every man his rightful share the share that is which he has worked for produced or received by gift from a rightful owner but to enforce the due conditions of possession as far as law may conveniently reach for instance that land shall not be wantonly allowed to run to waste that streams shall not be poisoned by the persons through whose properties they pass nor air be rendered unwholesome beyond given limits laws of this kind exist already in rudimentary degree but need large development the just laws respecting the possession of works of art have not hitherto been so much as conceived and the daily loss of national wealth and of its use in this respect is quite incalculable and these laws need revision quite as much respecting property in national as in private hands for instance the public are under a vague impression that because they have paid for the contents of the british museum every one has an equal right to see and to handle them but the public have similarly paid for the contents of woolwich arsenal yet do not expect free access to it or handling of its contents the british museum is neither a free circulating library nor a free school it is a place for the safe preservation and exhibition on due occasion of unique books unique objects of natural history and unique works of art its books can no more be used by everybody than its coins can be handled or its statues cast there ought to be free libraries in every quarter of london with large and complete readingrooms attached so also free educational museums should be open in every quarter of london all day long until late at night well lighted well catalogued and rich in contents both of art and natural history but neither the british museum nor national gallery is a school they are treasuries and both should be severely restricted in access and in use unless some order of this kind is made and that soon for the mss department of the museum its superintendents have sorrowfully told me this and repeatedly the best mss in the collection will be destroyed irretrievably by the careless and continual handling to which they are now subjected  finally in certain conditions of a nations progress laws limiting accumulation of any kind of property may be found expedient  116 c critic law determines questions of injury and assigns due rewards and punishments to conduct  two curious economical questions arise laterally with respect to this branch of law namely the cost of crime and the cost of judgment the cost of crime is endured by nations ignorantly that expense being nowhere stated in their budgets the cost of judgment patiently provided only it can be had pure for the money because the science or perhaps we ought rather to say the art of law is felt to found a noble profession and discipline so that civilized nations are usually glad that a number of persons should be supported by exercise in oratory and analysis but it has not yet been calculated what the practical value might have been in other directions of the intelligence now occupied in deciding through courses of years what might have been decided as justly had the date of judgment been fixed in as many hours imagine one half of the funds which any great nation devotes to dispute by law applied to the determination of physical questions in medicine agriculture and theoretic science and calculate the probable results within the next ten years  i say nothing yet of the more deadly more lamentable loss involved in the use of purchased instead of personal justicegreek epakt√¥ par all√¥naporia oikei√¥n  117 in order to true analysis of critic law we must understand the real meaning of the word injury  we commonly understand by it any kind of harm done by one man to another but we do not define the idea of harm sometimes we limit it to the harm which the sufferer is conscious of whereas much the worst injuries are those he is unconscious of and at other times we limit the idea to violence or restraint whereas much the worse forms of injury are to be accomplished by indolence and the withdrawal of restraint  118 injury is then simply the refusal or violation of any mans right or claim upon his fellows which claim much talked of in modern times under the term right is mainly resolvable into two branches a mans claim not to be hindered from doing what he should and his claim to be hindered from doing what he should not these two forms of hindrance being intensified by reward help and fortune or fors on one side and by punishment impediment and even final arrest or mors on the other  119 now in order to a mans obtaining these two rights it is clearly needful that the worth of him should be approximately known as well as the want of worth which has unhappily been usually the principal subject of study for critic law careful hitherto only to mark degrees of demerit instead of meritassigning indeed to the deficiencies not always alas even to these just estimate fine or penalty but to the efficiencies on the other side which are by much the more interesting as well as the only profitable part of its subject assigning neither estimate nor aid  120 now it is in this higher and perfect function of critic law enabling instead of disabling that it becomes truly kingly instead of draconic what providence gave the great wrathful legislator his name that is it becomes the law of man and of life instead of the law of the worm and of deathboth of these laws being set in changeless poise one against another and the enforcement of both being the eternal function of the lawgiver and true claim of every living soul such claim being indeed strong to be mercifully hindered and even if need be abolished when longer existence means only deeper destruction but stronger still to be mercifully helped and recreated when longer existence and new creation mean nobler life so that reward and punishment will be found to resolve themselves mainly61 into help and hindrance and these again will issue naturally from time recognition of deserving and the just reverence and just wrath which follow instinctively on such recognition  121 i say follow but in reality they are part of the recognition reverence is as instinctive as angerboth of them instant on true vision it is sight and understanding that we have to teach and these are reverence make a man perceive worth and in its reflection he sees his own relative unworth and worships thereupon inevitably not with stiff courtesy but rejoicingly passionately and best of all restfully for the inner capacity of awe and love is infinite in man and only in finding these can we find peace and the common insolences and petulances of the people and their talk of equality are not irreverence in them in the least but mere blindness stupefaction and fog in the brains62 the first sign of any cleansing away of which is that they gain some power of discerning and some patience in submitting to their true counsellors and governors in the mode of such discernment consists the real constitution of the state more than in the titles or offices of the discerned person for it is no matter save in degree of mischief to what office a man is appointed if he cannot fulfil it  122 iii government by council  this is the determination by living authority of the national conduct to be observed under existing circumstances and the modification or enlargement abrogation or enforcement of the code of national law according to present needs or purposes this government is necessarily always by council for though the authority of it may be vested in one person that person cannot form any opinion on a matter of public interest but by voluntarily or involuntarily submitting himself to the influence of others  this government is always twofoldvisible and invisible  the visible government is that which nominally carries on the national business determines its foreign relations raises taxes levies soldiers orders war or peace and otherwise becomes the arbiter of the national fortune the invisible government is that exercised by all energetic and intelligent men each in his sphere regulating the inner will and secret ways of the people essentially forming its character and preparing its fate  visible governments are the toys of some nations the diseases of others the harness of some the burdens of more the necessity of all sometimes their career is quite distinct from that of the people and to write it as the national history is as if one should number the accidents which befall a mans weapons and wardrobe and call the list his biography nevertheless a truly noble and wise nation necessarily has a noble and wise visible government for its wisdom issues in that conclusively  123 visible governments are in their agencies capable of three pure forms and of no more than three  they are either monarchies where the authority is vested in one person oligarchies when it is vested in a minority or democracies when vested in a majority  but these three forms are not only in practice variously limited and combined but capable of infinite difference in character and use receiving specific names according to their variations which names being nowise agreed upon nor consistently used either in thought or writing no man can at present tell in speaking of any kind of government whether he is understood nor in hearing whether he understands thus we usually call a just government by one person a monarchy and an unjust or cruel one a tyranny this might be reasonable if it had reference to the divinity of true government but to limit the term oligarchy to government by a few rich people and to call government by a few wise or noble people aristocracy is evidently absurd unless it were proved that rich people never could be wise or noble people rich and farther absurd because there are other distinctions in character as well as riches or wisdom greater purity of race or strength of purpose for instance which may give the power of government to the few so that if we had to give names to every group or kind of minority we should have verbiage enough but there is only one right nameoligarchy  124 so also the terms republic and democracy63 are confused especially in modern use and both of them are liable to every sort of misconception a republic means properly a polity in which the state with its all is at every mans service and every man with his all at the states servicepeople are apt to lose sight of the last condition but its government may nevertheless be oligarchic consular or decemviral for instance or monarchic dictatorial but a democracy means a state in which the government rests directly with the majority of the citizens and both these conditions have been judged only by such accidents and aspects of them as each of us has had experience of and sometimes both have been confused with anarchy as it is the fashion at present to talk of the failure of republican institutions in america when there has never yet been in america any such thing as an institution but only defiance of institution neither any such thing as a respublica but only a multitudinous resprivata every man for himself it is not republicanism which fails now in america it is your model science of political economy brought to its perfect practice there you may see competition and the law of demand and supply especially in paper in beautiful and unhindered operation64 lust of wealth and trust in it vulgar faith in magnitude and multitude instead of nobleness besides that faith natural to backwoodsmenlucum ligna65perpetual selfcontemplation issuing in passionate vanity total ignorance of the finer and higher arts and of all that they teach and bestow and the discontent of energetic minds unoccupied frantic with hope of uncomprehended change and progress they know not whither66these are the things that have failed in america and yet not altogether failedit is not collapse but collision the greatest railroad accident on record with fire caught from the furnace and catilines quenching non aqu√¢ sed ruin√¢67 but i see not in any of our talk of them justice enough done to their erratic strength of purpose nor any estimate taken of the strength of endurance of domestic sorrow in what their women and children suppose a righteous cause and out of that endurance and suffering its own fruit will be born with time not abolition of slavery however see ¬ß 130 and carlyles prophecy of them june 1850 as it has now come true in the first clause will in the last  america too will find that caucuses divisionalists stumporatory and speeches to buncombe will not carry men to the immortal gods that the washington congress and constitutional battle of kilkenny cats is there as here naught for such objects quite incompetent for such and in fine that said sublime constitutional arrangement will require to be with terrible throes and travail such as few expect yet remodelled abridged extended suppressed torn asunder put together againnot without heroic labour and effort quite other than that of the stumporator and the revival preacher one day  12568 understand then once for all that no form of government provided it be a government at all is as such to be either condemned or praised or contested for in anywise but by fools but all forms of government are good just so far as they attain this one vital necessity of policythat the wise and kind few or many shall govern the unwise and unkind and they are evil so far as they miss of this or reverse it not does the form in any case signify one whit but its firmness and adaptation to the need for if there be many foolish persons in a state and few wise then it is good that the few govern and if there be many wise and few foolish then it is good that the many govern and if many be wise yet one wiser then it is good that one should govern and so on thus we may have the ants republic and the realm of bees both good in their kind one for groping and the other for building and nobler still for flyingthe ducal monarchy69 of those      intelligent of seasons that set forth     the aery caravan high over seas  126 nor need we want examples among the inferior creatures of dissoluteness as well as resoluteness in government i once saw democracy finely illustrated by the beetles of north switzerland who by universal suffrage and elytric acclamation one may twilight carried it that they would fly over the lake of zug and flew short to the great disfigurement of the lake of zuggreek kantharon lim√™nover some leagues square and to the close of the cockchafer democracy for that year then for tyranny the old fable of the frogs and the stork finely touches one form of it but truth will image it more closely than fable for tyranny is not complete when it is only over the idle but when it is over the laborious and the blind this description of pelicans and climbing perch which i find quoted in one of our popular natural histories out of sir emerson tennants ceylon comes as near as may be to the true image of the thing  heavy rains came on and as we stood on the high ground we observed a pelican on the margin of the shallow pool gorging himself our people went towards him and raised a cry of fish fish we hurried down and found numbers of fish struggling upward through the grass in the rills formed by the trickling of the rain there was scarcely water to cover them but nevertheless they made rapid progress up the bank on which our followers collected about two baskets of them they were forcing their way up the knoll and had they not been interrupted first by the pelican and afterwards by ourselves they would in a few minutes have gained the highest point and descended on the other side into a pool which formed another portion of the tank in going this distance however they must have used muscular exertion enough to have taken them half a mile on level ground for at these places all the cattle and wild animals of the neighbourhood had latterly come to drink so that the surface was everywhere indented with footmarks in addition to the cracks in the surrounding baked mud into which the fish tumbled in their progress in those holes which were deep and the sides perpendicular they remained to die and were carried off by kites and crows70  127 but whether governments be bad or good one general disadvantage seems to attach to them in modern timesthat they are all costly71 this however is not essentially the fault of the governments if nations choose to play at war they will always find their governments willing to lead the game and soon coming under that term of aristophanes greek kap√™loi aspid√¥n shieldsellers and when greek p√™m epi p√™mati72 the shields take the form of iron ships with apparatus for defence against liquid fireas i see by latest accounts they are now arranging the decks in english dockyardsthey become costly biers enough for the grey convoy of chief mourner waves wreathed with funereal foam to bear back the dead upon the massy shoulders of those corpsebearers being intended for quite other work and to bear the living and food for the living if we would let them  128 nor have we the least right to complain of our governments being expensive so long as we set the government to do precisely the work which brings no return if our present doctrines of political economy be just let us trust them to the utmost take that war business out of the governments hands and test therein the principles of supply and demand let our future sieges of sebastopol be done by contractno capture no payi admit that things might sometimes go better so and let us sell the commands of our prospective battles with our vicarages to the lowest bidder so may we have cheap victories and divinity on the other hand if we have so much suspicion of our science that we dare not trust it on military or spiritual business would it not be but reasonable to try whether some authoritative handling may not prosper in matters utilitarian if we were to set our governments to do useful things instead of mischievous possibly even the apparatus itself might in time come to be less costly the machine applied to the building of the house might perhaps pay when it seems not to pay applied to pulling it down if we made in our dockyards ships to carry timber and coals instead of cannon and with provision for the brightening of domestic solid culinary fire instead of for the scattering of liquid hostile fire it might have some effect on the taxes or suppose that we tried the experiment on land instead of water carriage already the government not unapproved carries letters and parcels for us larger packages may in time followeven general merchandisewhy not at last ourselves had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private litigation on the railroads of england been laid out instead under proper government restraint on really useful railroad work and had no absurd expense been incurred in ornamenting stations we might already have hadwhat ultimately it will be found we must havequadruple rails two for passengers and two for traffic on every great line and we might have been carried in swift safety and watched and warded by wellpaid pointsmen for half the present fares for of course a railroad company is merely an association of turnpikekeepers who make the tolls as high as they can not to mend the roads with but to pocket the public will in time discover this and do away with turnpikes on railroads as on all other publicways  129 suppose it should thus turn out finally that a true government set to true work instead of being a costly engine was a paying one that your government rightly organized instead of itself subsisting by an incometax would produce its subjects some subsistence in the shape of an income dividendpolice and judges duly paid besides only with less work than the state at present provides for them  a true government set to true worknot easily to be imagined still less obtained but not beyond human hope or ingenuity only you will have to alter your election systems somewhat first not by universal suffrage nor by votes purchasable with beer is such government to be had that is to say not by universal equal suffrage every man upwards of twenty who has been convicted of no legal crime should have his say in this matter but afterwards a louder voice as he grows older and approves himself wiser if he has one vote at twenty he should have two at thirty four at forty ten at fifty for every single vote which he has with an income of a hundred a year he should have ten with an income of a thousand provided you first see to it that wealth is as nature intended it to be the reward of sagacity and industrynot of good luck in a scramble or a lottery for every single vote which he had as subordinate in any business he should have two when he became a master and every office and authority nationally bestowed implying trustworthiness and intellect should have its known proportional number of votes attached to it but into the detail and working of a true system in these matters we cannot now enter we are concerned as yet with definitions only and statements of first principles which will be established now sufficiently for our purposes when we have examined the nature of that form of government last on the list in ¬ß 105the purely magistral exciting at present its full share of public notice under its ambiguous title of slavery  130 i have not however been able to ascertain in definite terms from the declaimers against slavery what they understand by it if they mean only the imprisonment or compulsion of one person by another such imprisonment or compulsion being in many cases highly expedient slavery so defined would be no evil in itself but only in its abuse that is when men are slaves who should not be or masters who should not be or even the fittest characters for either state placed in it under conditions which should not be it is not for instance a necessary condition of slavery nor a desirable one that parents should be separated from children or husbands from wives but the institution of war against which people declaim with less violence effects such separationsnot unfrequently in a very permanent manner to press a sailor seize a white youth by conscription for a soldier or carry off a black one for a labourer may all be right acts or all wrong ones according to needs and circumstances it is wrong to scourge a man unnecessarily so it is to shoot him both must be done on occasion and it is better and kinder to flog a man to his work than to leave him idle till he robs and flog him afterwards the essential thing for all creatures is to be made to do right how they are made to do itby pleasant promises or hard necessities pathetic oratory or the whipis comparatively immaterial73 to be deceived is perhaps as incompatible with human dignity as to be whipped and i suspect the last method to be not the worst for the help of many individuals the jewish nation throve under it in the hand of a monarch reputed not unwise it is only the change of whip for scorpion which is inexpedient and that change is as likely to come to pass on the side of license as of law for the true scorpion whips are those of the nations pleasant vices which are to it as st johns locustscrown on the head ravin in the mouth and sting in the tail if it will not bear the rule of athena and apollo who shepherd without smiting greek ou pl√™g√™ nemontes athena at last calls no more in the corners of the streets and then follows the rule of tisiphone who smites without shepherding  131 if however by slavery instead of absolute compulsion is meant the purchase by money of the right of compulsion such purchase is necessarily made whenever a portion of any territory is transferred for money from one monarch to another which has happened frequently enough in history without its being supposed that the inhabitants of the districts so transferred became therefore slaves in this as in the former case the dispute seems about the fashion of the thing rather than the fact of it there are two rocks in midsea on each of which neglected equally by instructive and commercial powers a handful of inhabitants live as they may two merchants bid for the two properties but not in the same terms one bids for the people buys them and sets them to work under pain of scourge the other bids for the rock buys it and throws the inhabitants into the sea the former is the american the latter the english method of slavery much is to be said for and something against both which i hope to say in due time and place74  132 if however slavery mean not merely the purchase of the right of compulsion but the purchase of the body and soul of the creature itself for money it is not i think among the black races that purchases of this kind are most extensively made or that separate souls of a fine make fetch the highest price this branch of the inquiry we shall have occasion also to follow out at some length for in the worst instances of the selling of souls we are apt to get when we ask if the sale is valid only pyrrhons answer75none can know  133 the fact is that slavery is not a political institution at all but an inherent natural and eternal inheritance of a large portion of the human raceto whom the more you give of their own free will the more slaves they will make themselves in common parlance we idly confuse captivity with slavery and are always thinking of the difference between pinetrunks ariel in the pine and cowslipbells in the cowslipbell i lie or between carrying wood and drinking calibans slavery and freedom instead of noting the far more serious differences between ariel and caliban themselves and the means by which practically that difference may be brought about or diminished  13476 platos slave in the polity who well dressed and washed aspires to the hand of his masters daughter corresponds curiously to caliban attacking prosperos cell and there is an undercurrent of meaning

ultimately in vain by carlyle in the first of the latterday pamphlets which i commend to the readers gravest reading together with that as much neglected and still more immediately needed on model prisons and with the great chapter on permanence fifth of the last section of past and present which sums what is known and foreshadows or rather forelights all that is to be learned of national discipline i have only here farther to examine the nature of one worldwide and everlasting form of slavery wholesome in use as deadly in abusethe service of the rich by the poor  footnotes  54 think

caused by the failure of mechanical labour the degradation caused by its excess is a far more serious subject of thought and of future fear i shall examine this part of our subject at length hereafter there can hardly be any doubt at present cast on the truth of the above passages as all the great thinkers are unanimous on the matter platos words are terrific in their scorn and pity whenever he

the root of the scorn otherwise apparently most strange and cruel with which homer dante and shakspeare always speak of the populace for it is entirely true that in great states the lower orders are low by nature as well as by task being precisely that part of the commonwealth which has been thrust down for its coarseness or unworthiness by coarseness i mean especially insensibility and irreverencethe profane of horace and when this ceases to be so and the corruption and profanity are in the higher instead of the lower orders there arises first helpless confusion then if the lower classes deserve power ensues swift revolution and they get it but if neither the populace nor their rulers deserve it there follows mere darkness and dissolution till out of the putrid elements some new capacity of order rises like grass on a grave if not there is no more hope nor shadow of turning for that nation atropos has her way with it  so that the law of national health is like that of a

should be put out unless for necessary service at such and such an hour the idea of necessary service being quite indefinable and no penalty possible yet there would be a distinct consciousness of illegal conduct in young ladies minds who danced by candlelight till dawn  60 read this and the next paragraph with attention they contain clear statements which i cannot mend of things most necessary

previous discussions of our subject we must study the relation of the commanding rich to the obeying poor in its simplest elements in order to reach its first principles  the simplest state of it then is this78 a wise and provident person works much consumes little and lays by a store an improvident person works little consumes all his produce and lays by no store accident interrupts the daily work or renders it less productive the idle person must then starve or be supported by the provident one who having him thus at his mercy may either refuse to maintain him altogether or which will evidently be more to his own interest say to him i will maintain you indeed but you shall now work hard instead of indolently and instead of being allowed to lay by what you save as you might have done had you remained independent i will take all the surplus you would not lay it up for yourself it is wholly your own fault that has thrown you into my power and i will force you to work or starve yet you shall have no profit of your work only your daily bread for it and competition shall determine how much of that79 this mode of treatment has now become so universal that it is supposed to be the only naturalnay the only possible one and the market wages are calmly defined by economists as the sum which will maintain the labourer  137 the power of the provident person to do this is only checked by the correlative power of some neighbour of similarly frugal habits who says to the laboureri will give you a little more than this other provident person come and work for me  the power of the provident over the improvident depends thus primarily on their relative numbers secondarily on the modes of agreement of the adverse parties with each other the accidental level of wages is a variable function of the number of provident and idle persons in the world of the enmity between them as classes and of the agreement between those of the same class it depends from beginning to end on moral conditions  138 supposing the rich to be entirely selfish it is always for their interest that the poor should be as numerous as they can employ and restrain for granting that the entire population is no larger than the ground can easily maintainthat the classes are stringently dividedand that there is sense or strength of hand enough with the rich to secure obedience then if ninetenths of a nation are poor the remaining tenth have the service of nine persons each80 but if eighttenths are poor only of four each if seventenths are poor of two and a third each if sixtenths are poor of one and a half each and if fivetenths are poor of only one each but practically if the rich strive always to obtain more power over the poor instead of to raise themand if on the other hand the poor become continually more vicious and numerous through neglect and oppressionthough the range of the power of the rich increases its tenure becomes less secure until at last the measure of iniquity being full revolution civil war or the subjection of the state to a healthier or stronger one closes the moral corruption and industrial disease81  139 it is rarely however that things come to this extremity kind persons among the rich and wise among the poor modify the connexion of the classes the efforts made to raise and relieve on the one side and the success of honest toil on the other bind and blend the orders of society into the confused tissue of halffelt obligation sullenlyrendered obedience and variouslydirected or misdirected toil which form the warp of daily life but this great law rules all the wild design that success while society is guided by laws of competition signifies always so much victory over your neighbour as to obtain the direction of his work and to take the profits of it this is the real source of all great riches no man can become largely rich by his personal toil82 the work of his own hands wisely directed will indeed always maintain himself and his family and make fitting provision for his age but it is only by the discovery of some method of taxing the labour of others that he can become opulent every increase of his capital enables him to extend this taxation more widely that is to invest larger funds in the maintenance of labourersto direct accordingly vaster and yet vaster masses of labour and to appropriate its profits  140 there is much confusion of idea on the subject of this appropriation it is of course the interest of the employer to disguise it from the persons employed and for his own comfort and complacency he often desires no less to disguise it from himself and it is matter of much doubt with me how far the foul and foolish arguments used habitually on this subject are indeed the honest expression of foul and foolish convictionsor rather as i am sometimes forced to conclude from the irritation with which they are advanced are resolutely dishonest wilful and malicious sophisms arranged so as to mask to the last moment the real laws of economy and future duties of men by taking a simple example and working it thoroughly out the subject may be rescued from all but such determined misrepresentation  141 let us imagine a society of peasants living on a rivershore exposed to destructive inundation at somewhat extended intervals and that each peasant possesses of this good but imperilled ground more than he needs to cultivate for immediate subsistence we will assume farther and with too great probability of justice that the greater part of them indolently keep in tillage just as much land as supplies them with daily foodthat they leave their children idle and take no precautions against the rise of the stream but one of them we will say but one for the sake of greater clearness cultivates carefully all the ground of his estate makes his children work hard and healthily uses his spare time and theirs in building a rampart against the river and at the end of some years has in his storehouses large reserves of food and clothingin his stables a welltended breed of cattle and around his fields a wedge of wall against flood  the torrent rises at lastsweeps away the harvests and half the cottages of the careless peasants and leaves them destitute they naturally come for help to the provident one whose fields are unwasted and whose granaries are full he has the right to refuse it to them no one disputes this right83 but he will probably not refuse it it is not his interest to do so even were he entirely selfish and cruel the only question with him will be on what terms his aid is to be granted  142 clearly not on terms of mere charity to maintain his neighbours in idleness would be not only his ruin but theirs he will require work from them in exchange for their maintenance and whether in kindness or cruelty all the work they can give not now the three or four hours they were wont to spend on their own land but the eight or ten hours they ought to have spent84 but how will he apply this labour the men are now his slavesnothing less and nothing more on pain of starvation he can force them to work in the manner and to the end he chooses and it is by his wisdom in this choice that the worthiness of his mastership is proved or its unworthiness evidently he must first set them to bank out the water in some temporary way and to get their ground cleansed and resown else in any case their continued maintenance will be impossible that done and while he has still to feed them suppose he makes them raise a secure rampart for their own ground against all future flood and rebuild their houses in safer places with the best material they can find being allowed time out of their working hours to fetch such material from a distance and for the food and clothing advanced he takes security in land that as much shall be returned at a convenient period  143 we may conceive this security to be redeemed and the debt paid at the end of a few years the prudent peasant has sustained no loss but is no richer than he was and has had all his trouble for nothing but he has enriched his neighbours materially bettered their houses secured their land and rendered them in worldly matters equal to himself in all rational and final sense he has been throughout their true lord and king  144 we will next trace his probable line of conduct presuming his object to be exclusively the increase of his own fortune after roughly recovering and cleansing the ground he allows the ruined peasantry only to build huts upon it such as he thinks protective enough from the weather to keep them in working health the rest of their time he occupies first in pulling down and rebuilding on a magnificent scale his own house and in adding large dependencies to it this done in exchange for his continued supply of corn he buys as much of his neighbours land as he thinks he can superintend the management of and makes the former owners securely embank and protect the ceded portion by this arrangement he leaves to a certain number of the peasantry only as much ground as will just maintain them in their existing numbers as the population increases he takes the extra hands who cannot be maintained on the narrowed estates for his own servants employs some to cultivate the ground he has bought giving them of its produce merely enough for subsistence with the surplus which under his energetic and careful superintendence will be large he maintains a train of servants for state and a body of workmen whom he educates in ornamental arts he now can splendidly decorate his house lay out its grounds magnificently and richly supply his table and that of his household and retinue and thus without any abuse of right we should find established all the phenomena of poverty and riches which it is supposed necessarily accompany modern civilization in one part of the district we should have unhealthy land miserable dwellings and halfstarved poor in another a wellordered estate wellfed servants and refined conditions of highly educated and luxurious life  145 i have put the two cases in simplicity and to some extremity but though in more complex and qualified operation all the relations of society are but the expansion of these two typical sequences of conduct and result i do not say observe that the first procedure is entirely recommendable or even entirely right still less that the second is wholly wrong servants and artists and splendour of habitation and retinue have all their use propriety and office but i am determined that the reader shall understand clearly what they cost and see that the condition of having them is the subjection to us of a certain number of imprudent or unfortunate persons or it may be more fortunate than their masters over whose destinies we exercise a boundless control riches mean eternally and essentially this and god send at last a time when those words of our bestreputed economist shall be true and we shall indeed all know what it is to be rich85 that it is to be slavemaster over farthest earth and over all ways and thoughts of men every operative you employ is your true servant distant or near subject to your immediate orders or ministering to your widelycommunicated capricefor the pay he stipulates or the price he temptsall are alike under this great dominion of the gold the milliner who makes the dress is as much a servant more so in that she uses more intelligence in the service as the maid who puts it on the carpenter who smooths the door as the footman who opens it the tradesmen who supply the table as the labourers and sailors who supply the tradesmen why speak of these lower services painters and singers whether of note or rhyme jesters and storytellers moralists historians priestsso far as these in any degree paint or sing or tell their tale or charm their charm or perform their rite for payin so far they are all slaves abject utterly if the service be for pay only abject less and less in proportion to the degrees of love and of wisdom which enter into their duty or can enter into it according as their function is to do the bidding and the work of a manly peopleor to amuse tempt and deceive a childish one  146 there is always in such amusement and temptation to a certain extent a government of the rich by the poor as of the poor by the rich but the latter is the prevailing and necessary one and it consists when it is honourable in the collection of the profits of labour from those who would have misused them and the administration of those profits for the service either of the same persons in future or of others and when it is dishonourable as is more frequently the case in modern times it consists in the collection of the profits of labour from those who would have rightly used them and their appropriation to the service of the collector himself  147 the examination of these various modes of collection and use of riches will form the third branch of our future inquiries but the key to the whole subject lies in the clear understanding of the difference between selfish and unselfish expenditure it is not easy by any course of reasoning to enforce this on the generally unwilling hearer yet the definition of unselfish expenditure is brief and simple it is expenditure which if you are a capitalist does not pay you but pays somebody else and if you are a consumer does not please you but pleases somebody else take one special instance in further illustration of the general type given above i did not invent that type but spoke of a real river and of real peasantry the languid and sickly race which inhabits or hauntsfor they are often more like spectres than living menthe thorny desolation of the banks of the arve in savoy some years ago a society formed at geneva offered to embank the river for the ground which would have been recovered by the operation but the offer was refused by the then sardinian government the capitalists saw that this expenditure would have paid if the ground saved from the river was to be theirs but if when the offer that had this aspect of profit was refused they had nevertheless persisted in the plan and merely taking security for the return of their outlay lent the funds for the work and thus saved a whole race of human souls from perishing in a pestiferous fen as i presume some among them would at personal risk have dragged any one drowning creature out of the current of the stream and not expected payment therefor such expenditure would have precisely corresponded to the use of his power made in the first instance by our supposed richer peasantit would have been the kings of grace instead of the usurers for gain  148 impossible absurd utopian exclaim ninetenths of the few readers whom these words may find  no good reader this is not utopian but i will tell you what would have seemed if we had not seen it utopian on the side of evil instead of good that ever men should have come to value their money so much more than their lives that if you call upon them to become soldiers and take chance of a bullet through their heart and of wife and children being left desolate for their prides sake they will do it gaily without thinking twice but if you ask them for their countrys sake to spend a hundred pounds without security of getting back a hundredandfive86 they will laugh in your face  149 not but that also this game of lifegiving and taking is in the end somewhat more costly than other forms of play might be rifle practice is indeed a not unhealthy

threshed the corn     that ten daylabourers could not end  150 going back to the matter in hand we will press the example closer on a green knoll above that plain of the arve between cluse and bonneville there was in the year 1860 a cottage inhabited by a welldoing familyman and wife three children and the grandmother i call it a cottage but in truth it was a large chimney on the ground wide at the bottom so that the family might live round the fire lighted by one small broken window and entered by an unclosing door the family i say was welldoing at least it was hopeful and cheerful the wife healthy the children for savoyards pretty and active but the husband threatened with decline from exposure under the cliffs of the mont vergi by day and to draughts between every plank of his chimney in the frosty nights  why could he not plaster the chinks asks the practical reader for the same reason that your child cannot wash its face and hands till you have washed them many a day for it and will not wash them when it can till you force it  151 i passed this cottage often in my walks had its window and door mended sometimes mended also a little the meal of sour bread and broth and generally got kind greeting and smile from the face of young or old which greeting this year narrowed itself into the halfrecognizing stare of the elder child and the old womans tears for the father and mother were both deadone of sickness the other of sorrow it happened that i passed not alone but with a companion a practised english joiner who while these people were dying of cold had been employed from six in the morning to six in the evening for two months in fitting without nails the panels of a single door in a large house in london three days of his work taken at the right time from fastening the oak panels with useless precision and applied to fasten the larch timbers with decent strength would have saved these savoyards lives he would have been maintained equally i suppose him equally paid for his work by the owner of the greater house only the work not consumed selfishly on his own walls and the two peasants and eventually probably their children saved  152 there are thereforelet me finally enforce and leave with the reader this broad conclusionthree things to be considered in employing any poor person it is not enough to give him employment you must employ him first to produce useful things secondly of the several suppose equally useful things he can equally well produce you must set him to make that which will cause him to lead the healthiest life lastly of the things produced it remains a question of wisdom and conscience how much you are to take yourself and how much to leave to others a large quantity remember unless you destroy it must always be so left at one time or another the only questions you have to decide are not what you will give but when and how and to whom you will give the natural law of human life is of course that in youth a man shall labour and lay by store for his old age and when age comes shall use what he has laid by gradually slackening his toil and allowing himself more frank use of his store taking care always to leave himself as much as will surely suffice for him beyond any possible length of life what he has gained or by tranquil and unanxious toil continues to gain more than is enough for his own need he ought so to administer while he yet lives as to see the good of it again beginning in other hands for thus he has himself the greatest sum of pleasure from it and faithfully uses his sagacity in its control whereas most men it appears dislike the sight of their fortunes going out into service again and say to themselvesi can indeed nowise prevent this money from falling at last into the hands of others nor hinder the good of it from becoming theirs not mine but at least let a merciful death save me from being a witness of their satisfaction and may god so far be gracious to me as to let no good come of any of this money of mine before my eyes  153 supposing this feeling unconquerable the safest way of rationally indulging it would be for the capitalist at once to spend all his fortune on himself which might actually in many cases be quite the rightest as well as the pleasantest thing to do if he had just tastes and worthy passions but whether for himself only or through the hands and for the sake of others also the law of wise life is that the maker of the money shall also be the spender of it and spend it approximately all before he dies so that his true ambition as an economist should be to die not as rich but as poor as possible88 calculating the ebb tide of possession in true and calm proportion to the ebb tide of life which law checking the wing of accumulative desire in the midvolley89 and leading to peace of possession and fulness of fruition in old age is also wholesome in that by the freedom of gift together with present help and counsel it at once endears and dignifies age in the sight of youth which then no longer strips the bodies of the dead but receives the grace of the living its chief use would or will be for men are indeed capable of attaining to this much use of their reason that some temperance and measure will be put to the acquisitiveness of commerce90 for as things stand a man holds it his duty to be temperate in his food and of his body but for no duty to be temperate in his riches and of his mind he sees that he ought not to waste his youth and his flesh for luxury but he will waste his age and his soul for money and think he does no wrong nor know the delirium tremens of the intellect for disease but the law of life is that a man should fix the sum he desires to make annually as the food he desires to eat daily and stay when he has reached the limit refusing increase of business and leaving it to others so obtaining due freedom of time for better thoughts91 how the gluttony of business is punished a bill of health for the principals of the richest city houses issued annually would show in a sufficiently impressive manner  154 i know of course that these statements will be received by the modern merchant as an active border rider of the sixteenth century would have heard of its being proper for men of the marches to get their living by the spade instead of the spur but my business is only to state veracities and necessities i neither look for the acceptance of the one nor hope for the nearness of the other near or distant the day will assuredly come when the merchants of a state shall be its true ministers of exchange its porters in the double sense of carriers and gatekeepers bringing all lands into frank and faithful communication and knowing for their master of guild hermes the herald instead of mercury the gainguarder  155 and now finally for immediate rule to all who will accept it  the distress of any population means that they need food houseroom clothes and fuel you can never therefore be wrong in employing any labourer to produce food houseroom clothes or fuel but you are always wrong if you employ him to produce nothing for then some other labourer must be worked double time to feed him and you are generally wrong at present if you employ him unless he can do nothing else to produce works of art or luxuries because modern art is mostly on a false basis and modern luxury is criminally great92  156 the way to produce more food is mainly to bring in fresh ground and increase facilities of carriageto break rock exchange earth drain the moist and water the dry to mend roads and build harbours of refuge taxation thus spent will annihilate taxation but spent in war it annihilates revenue  157 the way to produce houseroom is to apply your force first to the humblest dwellings when your bricklayers are out of employ do not build splendid new streets but better the old ones send your paviours and slaters to the poorest villages and see that your poor are healthily lodged before you try your hand on stately architecture you will find its stateliness rise better under the trowel afterwards and we do do not yet build so well that we need hasten to display our skill to future ages had the labour which has decorated the houses of parliament filled instead rents in walls and roofs throughout the county of middlesex and our deputies met to talk within massive walls that would have needed no stucco for five hundred yearsthe decoration might have been afterwards and the talk now and touching even our highly conscientious church building it may be well to remember that in the best days of church plans their masons called themselves logeurs du bon dieu and that since according to the most trusted reports god spends a good deal of his time in cottages as well as in churches he might perhaps like to be a little better lodged there also  158 the way to get more clothes isnot necessarily to get more cotton there were words written twenty years ago93 which would have saved many of us some shivering had they been minded in time shall we read them again  the continental people it would seem are importing our machinery beginning to spin cotton and manufacture for themselves to cut us out of this market and then out of that sad news indeed but irremediable by no means the saddest newsthe saddest news is that we should find our national existence as i sometimes hear it said depend on selling manufactured cotton at a farthing an ell cheaper than any other people a most narrow stand for a great nation to base itself on a stand which with all the cornlaw abrogations conceivable i do not think will be capable of enduring  my friends suppose we quitted that stand suppose we came honestly down from it and saidthis is our minimum of cotton prices we care not for the present to make cotton any cheaper do you if it seem so blessed to you make cotton cheaper fill your lungs with cotton fur your heart with copperas fumes with rage and mutiny become ye the general gnomes of europe slaves of the lamp i admire a nation which fancies it will die if it do not undersell all other nations to the end of the world brothers we will cease to undersell them we will be content to equalsell them to be happy selling equally with them i do not see the use of underselling them cottoncloth is already twopence a yard or lower and yet bare backs were never more numerous among us let inventive men cease to spend their existence incessantly contriving how cotton can be made cheaper and try to invent a little how cotton at its present cheapness could be somewhat justlier divided among us  let inventive men considerwhether the secret of this universe does after all consist in making money with a hell which meansfailing to make money i do not think there is any heaven possible that would suit one well in brief all this mammon gospel of supplyanddemand competition laissez faire and devil take the hindmost foremost is it not rather mr carlyle begins to be one of the shabbiest gospels ever preached  159 the way to produce more fuel94 is first to make your coal mines safer by sinking more shafts then set all your convicts to work in them and if as is to be hoped you succeed in diminishing the supply of that sort of labourer consider what means there may be first of growing forest where its growth will improve climate secondly of splintering the forests which now make continents of fruitful land pathless and poisonous into fagots for fireso gaining at once dominion icewards and sunwards your steam power has been given you will find eventually for work such as that and not for excursion trains to give the labourer a moments breath at the peril of his breath for ever from amidst the cities which it has crushed into masses of corruption when you know how to build cities and how to rule them you will be able to breathe in their streets and the excursion will be the afternoons walk or game in the fields round them  160 but nothing of this work will pay  no no more than it pays to dust your rooms or wash your doorsteps it will pay not at first in currency but in that which is the end and the source of currencyin life and in currency richly afterwards it will pay in that which is more than lifein light whose true price has not yet been reckoned in any currency and yet into the image of which all wealth one way or other must be cast for your riches must either be as the lightning which                  begot but in a cloud     though shining bright and speaking loud     whilst it begins concludes its violent race     and where it gilds it wounds the place  or else as the lightning of the sacred sign which shines from one part of the heaven to the other there is no other choice you must either take dust for deity spectre for possession fettered dream for life and for epitaph this reversed verse of the great hebrew hymn of economy psalm cxiihe hath gathered together he hath stripped the poor his iniquity remaineth for everor else having the sun of justice to shine on you and the sincere substance of good in your possession and the pure law and liberty of life within you leave men to write this better legend over your grave  he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever  footnotes  78 in the present general examination i concede so much to ordinary economists as to ignore all innocent poverty i adapt my reasoning for once to the modern english practical mind by assuming poverty to be always criminal the conceivable exceptions we will examine afterwards  79 i have no terms of english and can find none in greek nor latin nor in any other strong language known to me contemptuous enough to attach to the bestial idiotism of the modern theory that wages are to be measured by competition  80 i say nothing yet of the quality of the servants which nevertheless is the gist of the business will you have paul

necessary labour rather under than over the third of the day  85 see preface to unto this last  86 i have not hitherto touched on the subject of interest of money it is too complex and must be reserved for its proper place in the body of the work the definition of interest apart from compensation for risk is the exponent of the comfort of accomplished labour separated from its power the power being what is lent and the french economists who have maintained the entire illegality of interest are wrong yet by no means so curiously or wildly wrong as the english and french ones opposed to them whose opinions have been collected by dr whewell at page 41 of his lectures it never seeming to occur to the mind of the compiler any more than to the writers whom he quotes that it is quite possible and even according to jewish proverb prudent for men to hoard as ants and mice do for use not usury and lay by something for winter nights in the expectation of rather sharing than lending the scrapings my savoyard squirrels would pass a pleasant time of it under the snowladen pine branches if they always declined to economize because no one would pay them interest on nuts  i leave this note as it stood but as i have above stated should now side wholly with the french economists spoken of in asserting the absolute illegality of interest  87 compare chaucers feeling respecting birds

remonstrance from a country parson in the times of june 4th or 5th the letter is dated june 3rd 1862i have heard at a vestry meeting a good deal of higgling over a few shillings outlay in cleaning the church but i have never heard any dissatisfaction expressed on account of that part of the rate which is invested in 50 or 100 dozens of birds heads  if we could trace the innermost of all causes of modern war i believe it would be found not in the avarice nor ambition of nations but in the mere idleness of the upper classes they have nothing to do but to teach the peasantry to kill each other  88 see the life of fenelon the labouring peasantry were at all times the objects of his tenderest care his palace at cambray with all his books and writings being consumed by fire he bore the

largeness of transaction and accident of discovery or contrivance i have no doubt that the final interest of every nation is to check the action of these commercial lotteries and that all great accidental gains or losses should be nationalnot individual but speculation absolute unconnected with commercial effort is an unmitigated evil in a state and the root of countless evils beside  91 i desire in the strongest terms to reinforce all that is contained in this paragraph  92 it is especially necessary that the reader should keep his mind fixed on the methods of consumption and destruction as the true sources of national poverty men are apt to call every exchange expenditure but it is only consumption which is expenditure a large number of the purchases made by the richer classes are mere forms of interchange of unused property wholly without effect on national prosperity it matters nothing to the state whether if a china pipkin be rated as worth a hundred pounds a has the pipkin and b the pounds or a the pounds and b the pipkin but if the pipkin is pretty and a or b breaks it there is national loss not otherwise so again when the loss has really taken place no shifting of the shoulders that bear it will do away with the reality of it there is an intensely ludicrous notion in the public mind respecting the abolishment of debt by denying it when a debt is denied the lender loses instead of the borrower that is all the loss is precisely accurately everlastingly the same the americans borrow money to spend in blowing up their own houses they deny their debt by onethird already 1863 gold being at fifty premium and they will probably deny it wholly that merely means that the holders of the notes are to be the losers instead of the issuers the quantity of loss is precisely equal and irrevocable it is the quantity of human industry spent in effecting the explosion plus the quantity of goods exploded honour only decides who shall pay the sum lost not whether it is to be paid or not paid it must be and to the uttermost farthing  93 past and present chap ix of third section to think that for these twentynow twentysixyears this one voice of carlyles

and to use what we get for cooking and warming ourselves instead of for running from place to place     appendices   i have brought together in these last pages a few notes which were not properly to be incorporated with the text and which at the bottom of pages checked the readers attention to the main argument they contain however several statements to which i wish to be able to refer or have already referred in other of my books so that i think right to preserve them   appendix ip 22  the greatest of all economists are those most opposed to the doctrine of laissez faire namely the fortifying virtues which the wisest men of all time have arranged under the general heads of prudence or discretion the spirit which discerns and adopts rightly justice the spirit which rules and divides rightly fortitude the spirit which persists and endures rightly and temperance the spirit which stops and refuses rightly these cardinal and sentinel virtues are not only the means of protecting and prolonging life itself but they are the chief guards or sources of the material means of life and the governing powers and princes of economy thus precisely according to the number of just men in a nation is their power of avoiding either intestine or foreign war all disputes may be peaceably settled if a sufficient number of persons have been trained to submit to the principles of justice while the necessity for war is in direct ratio to the number of unjust persons who are incapable of determining a quarrel but by violence whether the injustice take the form of the desire of dominion or of refusal to submit to it or of lust of territory or lust of money or of mere irregular passion and wanton will the result is economically the sameloss of the quantity of power and life consumed in repressing the injustice added to the material and moral destruction caused by the fact of war the early civil wars of england and the existing95 war in america are curious examplesthese under monarchical this under republican institutionsof the results on large masses of nations of the want of education in principles of justice but the mere dread or distrust resulting from the want of the inner virtues of faith and charity prove often no less costly than war itself the fear which france and england have of each other costs each nation about fifteen millions sterling annually besides various paralyses of commerce that sum being spent in the manufacture of means of destruction instead of means of production there is no more reason in the nature of things that france and england should be hostile to each other than that england and scotland should be or lancashire and yorkshire and the reciprocal terrors of the opposite sides of the english channel are neither more necessary more economical nor more virtuous than the old riding and reiving on the opposite flanks of the cheviots or than englands own weaving for herself of crowns of thorn from the stems of her red and white roses   appendix iip 34  few passages of the book which at least some part of the nations at present most advanced in civilization accept as an expression of final truth have been more distorted than those bearing on idolatry for the idolatry there denounced is neither sculpture nor veneration of sculpture it is simply the substitution of an eidolon phantasm or imagination of good for that which is real and enduring from the highest living good which gives life to the lowest material good which ministers to it the creator and the things created which he is said to have seen good in creating are in this their eternal goodness appointed always to be worshippedi e to have goodness and worth ascribed to them from the heart and the sweep and range of idolatry extend to the rejection of any or all of these calling evil good and good evilputting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter96 for in that rejection and substitution we betray the first of all loyalties to the fixed law of life and with resolute opposite loyalty serve our own imagination of good which is the law not of the house but of the grave otherwise called the law of mark missing which we translate law of sin these two masters between whose services we have to choose being otherwise distinguished as god and mammon which mammon though we narrowly take it as the power of money only is in truth the great evil spirit of false and fond desire or covetousness which is idolatry so that iconoclasmimagebreakingis easy but an idol cannot be brokenit must be forsaken and this is not so easy either to do or persuade to doing for men may readily be convinced of the weakness of an image but not of the emptiness of an imagination   appendix iiip 36  i have not attempted to support by the authority of other writers any of the statements made in these papers indeed if such authorities were rightly collected there would be no occasion for my writing at all even in the scattered passages referring to this subject in three books of carlylessartor resartus past and present and the latter day pamphletsall has been said that needs to be said and far better than i shall ever say it again but the habit of the public mind at present is to require everything to be uttered diffusely loudly and a hundred times over before it will listen and it has revolted against these papers of mine as if they contained things daring and new when there is not one assertion in them of which the truth has not been for ages known to the wisest and proclaimed by the most eloquent of men it would be i had written will be but have now reached a time of life for which there is but one moodthe conditional a far greater pleasure to me hereafter to collect their words than to add to mine horaces clear rendering of the substance of the passages in the text may be found room for at once      si quis emat citharas emptas comportet in unum     nec studio citharae nec musae deditus ulli     si scalpra et formas non sutor nautica vela     aversus mercaturis delirus et amens     undique dicatur merito qui discrepat istis     qui nummos aurumque recondit nescius uti     compositis metuensque velut contingere sacrum  which may be roughly thus translated       were anybody to buy fiddles and collect a number being in      no wise given to fiddling nor fond of music or if being      no cobbler he collected awls and lasts or having no mind      for seaadventure bought sails every one would call him a      madman and deservedly but what difference is there between      such a man and one who lays by coins and gold and does not      know how to use when he has got them  with which it is perhaps desirable also to give xenophons statement it being clearer than any english one can be owing to the power of the general greek term for wealth useable things  i have cut out the greek because i cant be troubled to correct the accents and am always nervous about them here it is in english as well as i can do it  this being so it follows that things are only property to the man who knows how to use them as flutes for instance are property to the man who can pipe upon them respectably but to one who knows not how to pipe they are no property unless he can get rid of them advantageously for if they are not sold the flutes are no property being serviceable for nothing but sold they become property to which socrates made answerand only then if he knows how to sell them for if he sell them to another man who cannot play on them still they are no property   appendix ivp 39  the reader is to include here in the idea of government any branch of the executive or even any body of private persons entrusted with the practical management of public interests unconnected directly with their own personal ones in theoretical discussions of legislative interference with political economy it is usually and of course unnecessarily assumed that government must be always of that form and force in which we have been accustomed to see itthat its abuses can never be less nor its wisdom greater nor its powers more numerous but practically the custom in most civilized countries is for every man to deprecate the interference of government as long as things tell for his personal advantage and to call for it when they cease to do so the request of the manchester economists to be supplied with cotton by government the system of supply and demand having for the time fallen sorrowfully short of the expectations of scientific persons from it is an interesting case in point it were to be wished that less wide and bitter suffering suffering too of the innocent had been needed to force the nation or some part of it to ask itself why a body of men already confessedly capable of managing matters both military and divine should not be permitted or even requested at need to provide in some wise for sustenance as well as for defence and secure if it might beand it might i think even the rather bepurity of bodily as well as of spiritual aliment why having made many roads for the passage of armies may they not make a few for the conveyance of food and after organizing with applause various schemes of theological instruction for the public organize moreover some methods of bodily nourishment for them or is the soul so much less trustworthy in its instincts than the stomach that legislation is necessary for the one but inapplicable to the other   appendix vp 70  i debated with myself whether to make the note on homer longer by examining the typical meaning of the shipwreck of ulysses and his escape from charybdis by help of her figtree but as i should have had to go on to the lovely myth of leucotheas veil and did not care to spoil this by a hurried account of it i left it for future examination and three days after the paper was published observed that the reviewers with their customary helpfulness were endeavouring to throw the whole subject back into confusion by dwelling on this single as they imagined oversight i omitted also a note on the sense of the word greek lygron with respect to the pharmacy of circe and herbfields of helen compare its use in odyssey xvii 473 c which would farther have illustrated the nature of the circean power but not to be led too far into the subtleties of these myths observe respecting them all that even in very simple parables it is not always easy to attach indisputable meaning to every part of them i recollect some years ago throwing an assembly of learned persons who had met to delight themselves with interpretations of the parable of the prodigal son interpretations which had up to that moment gone very smoothly into mute indignation by inadvertently asking who the unprodigal son was and what was to be learned by his example the leading divine of the company mr molyneux at last explained to me that the unprodigal son was a lay figure put in for dramatic effect to make the story prettier and that no note was to be taken of him without however admitting that homer put in the last escape of ulysses merely to make his story prettier this is nevertheless true of all greek myths that they have many opposite lights and shades they are as changeful as opal and like opal usually have one colour by reflected and another by transmitted light but they are true jewels for all that and full of noble enchantment for those who can use them for those who cannot i am content to repeat the words i wrote four years ago in the appendix to the two paths  the entire purpose of a great thinker may be difficult to fathom and we may be over and over again more or less mistaken in guessing at his meaning but the real profound nay quite bottomless and unredeemable mistake is the fools thought that he had no meaning   appendix vip 84  the derivation of words is like that of rivers there is one real source usually small unlikely and difficult to find far up among the hills then as the word flows on and comes into service it takes in the force of other words from other sources and becomes quite another wordoften much more than one word after the junctiona word as it were of many waters sometimes both sweet and bitter thus the whole force of our english charity depends on the guttural in charis getting confused with the c of the latin carus thenceforward throughout the middle ages the two ideas ran on together and both got confused with st pauls greek agap√™ which expresses a different idea in all sorts of ways our charity having not only brought in the entirely foreign sense of almsgiving but lost the essential sense of contentment and lost much more in getting too far away from the charis of the final gospel benedictions for truly it is fine christianity we have come to which professing to expect the perpetual grace or charity of its founder has not itself grace or charity enough to hinder it from overreaching its friends in sixpenny bargains and which supplicating evening and morning the forgiveness of its own debts goes forth at noon to take its fellowservants by the throat sayingnot merely pay me that thou owest but pay me that thou owest me not  it is true

words indeed and good to set against the old royalty of largesse      whose moste joie was i wis     when that she gave and said have this  i am glad to end for this time with these lovely words of chaucer we have heard only too much lately of indiscriminate charity with implied reproval not of the indiscrimination merely but of the charity also we have partly succeeded in enforcing on the minds of the poor the idea that it is disgraceful to receive and are likely without much difficulty to succeed in persuading not a few of the rich that it is disgraceful to give but the political economy of a great state makes both giving and receiving graceful and the political economy of true religion interprets the saying that it is more blessed to give than to receive not as the promise of reward in another life for mortified selfishness in this but as pledge of bestowal upon us of that sweet and better nature which does not mortify itself in giving      brantwood coniston     5th october 1871   the end  footnotes  95 written in 1862 i little thought that when i next corrected my type the existing war best illustrative of the sentence would be between frenchmen in the elysian fields of paris  96 compare the close of the fourth lecture in aratra pentelici     preraphaelitism      to     francis hawksworth fawkes esq     of farnley      these pages     which owe their present form to advantages granted     by his kindness     are affectionately inscribed     by his obliged friend     john ruskin     preface   eight years ago in the close of the first volume of modern painters i ventured to give the following advice to the young artists of england  they should go to nature in all singleness of heart and walk with her laboriously and trustingly having no other thought but how best to penetrate her meaning rejecting nothing selecting nothing and scorning nothing advice which whether bad or good involved infinite labor and humiliation in the following it and was therefore for the most part rejected  it has however at last been carried out to the very letter by a group of men who for their reward have been assailed with the most scurrilous abuse which i ever recollect seeing issue from the public press i have therefore thought it due to them to contradict the directly false statements which have been made respecting their works and to point out the kind of merit which however deficient in some respects those works possess beyond the possibility of dispute      denmark hill      aug 1851     preraphaelitism   it may be proved with much certainty that god intends no man to live in this world without working but it seems to me no less evident that he intends every man to be happy in his work it is written in the sweat of thy brow but it was never written in the breaking of thine heart thou shalt eat bread and i find that as on the one hand infinite misery is caused by idle people who both fail in doing what was appointed for them to do and set in motion various springs of mischief in matters in which they should have had no concern so on the other hand no small misery is caused by overworked and unhappy people in the dark views which they necessarily take up themselves and force upon others of work itself were it not so i believe the fact of their being unhappy is in itself a violation of divine law and a sign of some kind of folly or sin in their way of life now in order that people may be happy in their work these three things are needed they must be fit for it they must not do too much of it and they must have a sense of success in itnot a doubtful sense such as needs some testimony of other people for its confirmation but a sure sense or rather knowledge that so much work has been done well and fruitfully done whatever the world may say or think about it so that in order that a man may be happy it is necessary that he should not only be capable of his work but a good judge of his work  the first thing then that he has to do if unhappily his parents or masters have not done it for him is to find out what he is fit for in which inquiry a man may be very safely guided by his likings if he be not also guided by his pride people usually reason in some such fashion as this i dont seem quite fit for a headmanager in the firm of   co therefore in all probability i am fit to be chancellor of the exchequer whereas they ought rather to reason thus i dont seem quite fit to be headmanager in the firm of   co but i daresay i might do something in a small greengrocery business i used to be a good judge of peas that is to say always trying lower instead of trying higher until they find bottom once well set on the ground a man may build up by degrees safely instead of disturbing every one in his neighborhood by perpetual catastrophes but this kind of humility is rendered especially difficult in these days by the contumely thrown on men in humble employments the very removal of the massy bars which once separated one class of society from another has rendered it tenfold more shameful in foolish peoples i e in most peoples eyes to remain in the lower grades of it than ever it was before when a man born of an artisan was looked upon as an entirely different species of animal from a man born of a noble it made him no more uncomfortable or ashamed to remain that different species of animal than it makes a horse ashamed to remain a horse and not to become a giraffe but now that a man may make money and rise in the world and associate himself unreproached with people once far above him not only is the natural discontentedness of humanity developed to an unheardof extent whatever a mans position but it becomes a veritable shame to him to remain in the state he was born in and everybody thinks it his duty to try to be a gentleman persons who have any influence in the management of public institutions for charitable education know how common this feeling has become hardly a day passes but they receive letters from mothers who want all their six or eight sons to go to college and make the grand tour in the long vacation and who think there is something wrong in the foundations of society because this is not possible out of every ten letters of this kind nine will allege as the reason of the writers importunity their desire to keep their families in such and such a station of life there is no real desire for the safety the discipline or the moral good of the children only a panic horror of the inexpressibly pitiable calamity of their living a ledge or two lower on the molehill of the worlda calamity to be averted at any cost whatever of struggle anxiety and shortening of life itself i do not believe that any greater good could be achieved for the country than the change in public feeling on this head which might be brought about by a few benevolent men undeniably in the class of gentlemen who would on principle enter into some of our commonest trades and make them honorable showing that it was possible for a man to retain his dignity and remain in the best sense a gentleman though part of his time was every day occupied in manual labor or even in serving customers over a counter i do not in the least see why courtesy and gravity and sympathy with the feelings of others and courage and truth and piety and what else goes to make up a gentlemans character should not be found behind a counter as well as elsewhere if they were demanded or even hoped for there  let us suppose then that the mans way of life and manner of work have been discreetly chosen then the next thing to be required is that he do not overwork himself therein i am not going to say anything here about the various errors in our systems of society and commerce which appear i am not sure if they ever do more than appear to force us to overwork ourselves merely that we may live nor about the still more fruitful cause of unhealthy toilthe incapability in many men of being content with the little that is indeed necessary to their happiness i have only a word or two to say about one special cause of overworkthe ambitious desire of doing great or clever things and the hope of accomplishing them by immense efforts hope as vain as it is pernicious not only making men overwork themselves but rendering all the work they do unwholesome to them i say it is a vain hope and let the reader be assured of this it is a truth allimportant to the best interests of humanity no great intellectual thing was ever done by great effort a great thing can only be done by a great man and he does it without effort nothing is at present less understood by us than thisnothing is more necessary to be understood let me try to say it as clearly and explain it as fully as i may  i have said no great intellectual thing for i do not mean the assertion to extend to things moral on the contrary it seems to me that just because we are intended as long as we live to be in a state of intense moral effort we are not intended to be in intense physical or intellectual effort our full energies are to be given to the souls workto the great fight with the dragonthe taking the kingdom of heaven by force but the bodys work and heads work are to be done quietly and comparatively without effort neither limbs nor brain are ever to be strained to their utmost that is not the way in which the greatest quantity of work is to be got out of them they are never to be worked furiously but with tranquillity and constancy we are to follow the plough from sunrise to sunset but not to pull in raceboats at the twilight we shall get no fruit of that kind of work only disease of the heart  how many pangs would be spared to thousands if this great truth and law were but once sincerely humbly understoodthat if a great thing can be done at all it can be done easily that when it is needed to be done there is perhaps only one man in the world who can do it but he can do it without any troublewithout more trouble that is than it costs small people to do small things nay perhaps with less and yet what truth lies more openly on the surface of all human phenomena is not the evidence of ease on the very front of all the greatest works in existence do they not say plainly to us not there has been a great effort here but there has been a great power here it is not the weariness of mortality but the strength of divinity which we have to recognise in all mighty things and that is just what we now never recognise but think that we are to do great things by help of iron bars and perspirationalas we shall do nothing that way but lose some pounds of our own weight  yet let me not be misunderstood nor this great truth be supposed anywise resolvable into the favorite dogma of young men that they need not work if they have genius the fact is that a man of genius is always far more ready to work than other people and gets so much more good from the work that he does and is often so little conscious of the inherent divinity in himself that he is very apt to ascribe all his capacity to his work and to tell those who ask how he came to be what he is if i am anything which i much doubt i made myself so merely by labor this was newtons way of talking and i suppose it would be the general tone of men whose genius had been devoted to the physical sciences genius in the arts must commonly be more selfconscious but in whatever field it will always be distinguished by its perpetual steady welldirected happy and faithful labor in accumulating and disciplining its powers as well as by its gigantic incommunicable facility in exercising them therefore literally it is no mans business whether he has genius or not work he must whatever he is but quietly and steadily and the natural and unforced results of such work will be always the things that god meant him to do and will be his best no agonies nor heartrendings will enable him to do any better if he be a great man they will be great things if a small man small things but always if thus peacefully done good and right always if restlessly and ambitiously done false hollow and despicable  then the third thing needed was i said that a man should be a good judge of his work and this chiefly that he may not be dependent upon popular opinion for the manner of doing it but also that he may have the just encouragement of the sense of progress and an honest consciousness of victory how else can he become      that awful independent on tomorrow     whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile  i am persuaded that the real nourishment and help of such a feeling as this is nearly unknown to half the workmen of the present day for whatever appearance of selfcomplacency there may be in their outward bearing it is visible enough by their feverish jealousy of each other how little confidence they have in the sterling value of their several doings conceit may puff a man up but never prop him up and there is too visible distress and hopelessness in mens aspects to admit of the supposition that they have any stable support of faith in themselves  i have stated these principles generally because there is no branch of labor to which they do not apply but there is one in which our ignorance or forgetfulness of them has caused an incalculable amount of suffering and i would endeavor now to reconsider them with especial reference to itthe branch of the arts  in general the men who are employed in the arts have freely chosen their profession and suppose themselves to have special faculty for it yet as a body they are not happy men for which this seems to me the reason that they are expected and themselves expect to make their bread by being clevernot by steady or quiet work and are therefore for the most part trying to be clever and so living in an utterly false state of mind and action  this is the case to the same extent in no other profession or employment a lawyer may indeed suspect that unless he has more wit than those around him he is not likely to advance in his profession but he will not be always thinking how he is to display his wit he will generally understand early in his career that wit must be left to take care of itself and that it is hard knowledge of law and vigorous examination and collation of the facts of every case entrusted to him which his clients will mainly demand this it is which he has to be paid for and this is healthy and measurable labor payable by the hour if he happen to have keen natural perception and quick wit these will come into play in their due time and place but he will not think of them as his chief power and if he have them not he may still hope that industry and conscientiousness may enable him to rise in his profession without them again in the case of clergymen that they are sorely tempted to display their eloquence or wit none who know their own hearts will deny but then they know this to be a temptation they never would suppose that cleverness was all that was to be expected from them or would sit down deliberately to write a clever sermon even the dullest or vainest of them would throw some veil over their vanity and pretend to some profitableness of purpose in what they did they would not openly ask of their hearersdid you think my sermon ingenious or my language poetical they would early understand that they were not paid for being ingenious nor called to be so but to preach truth that if they happened to possess wit eloquence or originality these would appear and be of service in due time but were not to be continually sought after or exhibited and if it should happen that they had them not they might still be serviceable pastors without them  not so with the unhappy artist no one expects any honest or useful work of him but every one expects him to be ingenious originality dexterity invention imagination every thing is asked of him except what alone is to be had for askinghonesty and sound work and the due discharge of his function as a painter what function asks the reader in some surprise he may well ask for i suppose few painters have any idea what their function is or even that they have any at all  and yet surely it is not so difficult to discover the faculties which when a man finds in himself he resolves to be a painter are i suppose intenseness of observation and facility of imitation the man is created an observer and an imitator and his function is to convey knowledge to his fellowmen of such things as cannot be taught otherwise than ocularly for a long time this function remained a religious one it was to impress upon the popular mind the reality of the objects of faith and the truth of the histories of scripture by giving visible form to both that function has now passed away and none has as yet taken its place the painter has no profession no purpose he is an idler on the earth chasing the shadows of his own fancies  but he was never meant to be this the sudden and universal naturalism or inclination to copy ordinary natural objects which manifested itself among the painters of europe at the moment when the invention of printing superseded their legendary labors was no false instinct it was misunderstood and misapplied but it came at the right time and has maintained itself through all kinds of abuse presenting in the recent schools of landscape perhaps only the first fruits of its power that instinct was urging every painter in europe at the same moment to his true dutythe faithful representation of all objects of historical interest or of natural beauty existent at the period representations such as might at once aid the advance of the sciences and keep faithful record of every monument of past ages which was likely to be swept away in the approaching eras of revolutionary change  the instinct came as i said exactly at the right moment and let the reader consider what amount and kind of general knowledge might by this time have been possessed by the nations of europe had their painters understood and obeyed it suppose that after disciplining themselves so as to be able to draw with unerring precision each the particular kind of subject in which he most delighted they had separated into two great armies of historians and naturaliststhat the first had painted with absolute faithfulness every edifice every city every battlefield every scene of the slightest historical interest precisely and completely rendering their aspect at the time and that their companions according to their several powers had painted with like fidelity the plants and animals the natural scenery and the atmospheric phenomena of every country on the earthsuppose that a faithful and complete record were now in our museums of every building destroyed by war or time or innovation during these last 200 yearssuppose that each recess of every mountain chain of europe had been penetrated and its rocks drawn with such accuracy that the geologists diagram was no longer necessarysuppose that every tree of the forest had been drawn in its noblest aspect every beast of the field in its savage lifethat all these gatherings were already in our national galleries and that the painters of the present day were laboring happily and earnestly to multiply them and put such means of knowledge more and more within reach of the common peoplewould not that be a more honorable life for them than gaining precarious bread by bright effects they think not perhaps they think it easy and therefore contemptible to be truthful they have been taught so all their lives but it is not so whoever taught it them it is most difficult and worthy of the greatest mens greatest effort to render as it should be rendered the simplest of the natural features of the earth but also be it remembered no man is confined to the simplest each may look out work for himself where he chooses and it will be strange if he cannot find something hard enough for him the excuse is however one of the lips only for every painter knows that when he draws back from the attempt to render nature as she is it is oftener in cowardice than in disdain  i must leave the reader to pursue this subject for himself i have not space to suggest to him the tenth part of the advantages which would follow both to the painter from such an understanding of his mission and to the whole people in the results of his labor consider how the man himself would be elevated how content he would become how earnest how full of all accurate and noble knowledge how free from envyknowing creation to be infinite feeling at once the value of what he did and yet the nothingness consider the advantage to the people the immeasurably larger interest given to art itself the easy pleasurable and perfect knowledge conveyed by it in every subject the far greater number of men who might be healthily and profitably occupied with it as a means of livelihood the useful direction of myriads of inferior talents now left fading away in misery conceive all this and then look around at our exhibitions and behold the cattle pieces and sea pieces and fruit pieces and family pieces the eternal brown cows in ditches and white sails in squalls and sliced lemons in saucers and foolish faces in simpersand try to feel what we are and what we might have been  take a single instance in one branch of arch√¶ology let those who are interested in the history of religion consider what a treasure we should now have possessed if instead of painting pots and vegetables and drunken peasantry the most accurate painters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had been set to copy line for line the religious and domestic sculpture on the german flemish and french cathedrals and castles and if every building destroyed in the french or in any other subsequent revolution had thus been drawn in all its parts with the same precision with which gerard douw or mieris paint basreliefs of cupids consider even now what incalculable treasure is still left in ancient basreliefs full of every kind of legendary interest of subtle expression of priceless evidence as to the character feelings habits histories of past generations in neglected and shattered churches and domestic buildings rapidly disappearing over the whole of europetreasure which once lost the labor of all men living cannot bring back again and then look at the myriads of men with skill enough if they had but the commonest schooling to record all this faithfully who are making their bread by drawing dances of naked women from academy models or idealities of chivalry fitted out with wardour street armor or eternal scenes from gil blas don quixote and the vicar of wakefield or mountain sceneries with young idiots of londoners wearing highland bonnets and brandishing rifles in the foregrounds do but think of these things in the breadth of their inexpressible imbecility and then go and stand before that broken basrelief in the southern gate of lincoln cathedral and see if there is no fibre of the heart in you that will break too  but is there to be no place left it will be indignantly asked for imagination and invention for poetical power or love of ideal beauty yes the highest the noblest placethat which these only can attain when they are all used in the cause and with the aid of truth wherever imagination and sentiment are they will either show themselves without forcing or if capable of artificial development the kind of training which such a school of art would give them would be the best they could receive the infinite absurdity and failure of our present training consists mainly in this that we do not rank imagination and invention high enough and suppose that they can be taught throughout every sentence that i ever have written the reader will find the same rank attributed to these powersthe rank of a purely divine gift not to be attained increased or in any wise modified by teaching only in various ways capable of being concealed or quenched understand this thoroughly know once for all that a poet on canvas is exactly the same species of creature as a poet in song and nearly every error in our methods of teaching will be done away with for who among us now thinks of bringing men up to be poetsof producing poets by any kind of general recipe or method of cultivation suppose even that we see in youth that which we hope may in its development become a power of this kind should we instantly supposing that we wanted to make a poet of him and nothing else forbid him all quiet steady rational labor should we force him to perpetual spinning of new crudities out of his boyish brain and set before him as the only objects of his study the laws of versification which criticism has supposed itself to discover in the works of previous writers whatever gifts the boy had would much be likely to come of them so treated unless indeed they were so great as to break through all such snares of falsehood and vanity and build their own foundation in spite of us whereas if as in cases numbering millions against units the natural gifts were too weak to do this could any thing come of such training but utter inanity and spuriousness of the whole man but if we had sense should we not rather restrain and bridle the first flame of invention in early youth heaping material on it as one would on the first sparks and tongues of a fire which we desired to feed into greatness should we not educate the whole intellect into general strength and all the affections into warmth and honesty and look to heaven for the rest this i say we should have sense enough to do in order to produce a poet in words but it being required to produce a poet on canvas what is our way of setting to work we begin in all probability by telling the youth of fifteen or sixteen that nature is full of faults and that he is to improve her but that raphael is perfection and that the more he copies raphael the better that after much copying of raphael he is to try what he can do himself in a raphaelesque but yet original manner that is to say he is to try to do something very clever all out of his own head but yet this clever something is to be properly subjected to raphaelesque rules is to have a principal light occupying oneseventh of its space and a principle shadow occupying onethird of the same that no two peoples heads in the picture are to be turned the same way and that all the personages represented are to possess ideal beauty of the highest order which ideal beauty consists partly in a greek outline of nose partly in proportions expressible in decimal fractions between the lips and chin but partly also in that degree of improvement which the youth of sixteen is to bestow upon gods work in general this i say is the kind of teaching which through various channels royal academy lecturings press criticisms public enthusiasm and not least by solid weight of gold we give to our young men and we wonder we have no painters  but we do worse than this within the last few years some sense of the real tendency of such teaching has appeared in some of our younger painters it only could appear in the younger ones our older men having become familiarised with the false system or else having passed through it and forgotten it not well knowing the degree of harm they had sustained this sense appeared among our youthsincreasedmatured into resolute action necessarily to exist at all it needed the support both of strong instincts and of considerable selfconfidence otherwise it must at once have been borne down by the weight of general authority and received canon law strong instincts are apt to make men strange and rude selfconfidence however well founded to give much of what they do or say the appearance of impertinence look at the selfconfidence of wordsworth stiffening every other sentence of his prefaces into defiance there is no more of it than was needed to enable him to do his work yet it is not a little ungraceful here and there suppose this stubbornness and selftrust in a youth laboring in an art of which the executive part is confessedly to be best learnt from masters and we shall hardly wonder that much of his work has a certain awkwardness and stiffness in it or that he should be regarded with disfavor by many even the most temperate of the judges trained in the system he was breaking through and with utter contempt and reprobation by the envious and the dull consider farther that the particular system to be overthrown was in the present case one of which the main characteristic was the pursuit of beauty at the expense of manliness and truth and it will seem likely √† priori that the men intended successfully to resist the influence of such a system should be endowed with little natural sense of beauty and thus rendered dead to the temptation it presented summing up these conditions there is surely little cause for surprise that pictures painted in a temper of resistance by exceedingly young men of stubborn instincts and positive selftrust and with little natural perception of beauty should not be calculated at the first glance to win us from works enriched by plagiarism polished by convention invested with all the attractiveness of artificial grace and recommended to our respect by established authority  we should however on the other hand have anticipated that in proportion to the strength of character required for the effort and to the absence of distracting sentiments whether respect for precedent or affection for ideal beauty would be the energy exhibited in the pursuit of the special objects which the youths proposed to themselves and their success in attaining them  all this has actually been the case but in a degree which it would have been impossible to anticipate that two youths of the respective ages of eighteen and twenty should have conceived for themselves a totally independent and sincere method of study and enthusiastically persevered in it against every kind of dissuasion and opposition is strange enough that in the third or fourth year of their efforts they should have produced works in many parts not inferior to the best of albert durer this is perhaps not less strange but the loudness and universality of the howl which the common critics of the press have raised against them the utter absence of all generous help or encouragement from those who can both measure their toil and appreciate their success and the shrill shallow laughter of those who can do neither the one nor the otherthese are strangest of allunimaginable unless they had been experienced  and as if these were not enough private malice is at work against them in its own small slimy way the very day after i had written my second letter to the times in the defence of the preraphaelites i received an anonymous letter respecting one of them from some person apparently hardly capable of spelling and about as vile a specimen of petty malignity as ever blotted paper i think it well that the public should know this and so get some insight into the sources of the spirit which is at work against these menhow first roused it is difficult to say for one would hardly have thought that mere eccentricity in young artists could have excited an hostility so determined and so cruelhostility which hesitated at no assertion however impudent that of the absence of perspective was one of the most curious pieces of the hue and cry which began with the times and died away in feeble maundering in the art union i contradicted it in the timesi here contradict it directly for the second time there was not a single error in perspective in three out of the four pictures in question but if otherwise would it have been anything remarkable in them i doubt if with the exception of the pictures of david roberts there were one architectural drawing in perspective on the walls of the academy i never met but with two men in my life who knew enough of perspective to draw a gothic arch in a retiring plane so that its lateral dimensions and curvatures might be calculated to scale from the drawing our architects certainly do not and it was but the other day that talking to one of the most distinguished among them the author of several most valuable works i found he actually did not know how to draw a circle in perspective and in this state of general science our writers for the press take it upon them to tell us that the forest trees in mr hunts sylvia and the bunches of lilies in mr collinss convent thoughts are out of perspective97  it might not i think in such circumstances have been ungraceful or unwise in the academicians themselves to have defended their young pupils at least by the contradiction of statements directly false respecting them98 and the direction of the mind and sight of the public to such real merit as they possess if sir charles eastlake mulready edwin and charles landseer cope and dyce would each of them simply state their own private opinion respecting their paintings sign it and publish it i believe the act would be of more service to english art than any thing the academy has done since it was founded but as i cannot hope for this i can only ask the public to give their pictures careful examination and look at them at once with the indulgence and the respect which i have endeavored to show they deserve  yet let me not be misunderstood i have adduced them only as examples of the kind of study which i would desire to see substituted for that of our modern schools and of singular success in certain characters finish of detail and brilliancy of color what faculties higher than imitative may be in these men i do not yet venture to say but i do say that if they exist such faculties will manifest themselves in due time all the more forcibly because they have received training so severe  for it is always to be remembered that no one mind is like another either in its powers or perceptions and while the main principles of training must be the same for all the result in each will be as various as the kinds of truth which each will apprehend therefore also the modes of effort even in men whose inner principles and final aims are exactly the same suppose for instance two men equally honest equally industrious equally impressed with a humble desire to render some part of what they saw in nature faithfully and otherwise trained in convictions such as i have above endeavored to induce but one of them is quiet in temperament has a feeble memory no invention and excessively keen sight the other is impatient in temperament has a memory which nothing escapes an invention which never rests and is comparatively nearsighted  set them both free in the same field in a mountain valley one sees everything small and large with almost the same clearness mountains and grasshoppers alike the leaves on the branches the veins in the pebbles the bubbles in the stream but he can remember nothing and invent nothing patiently he sets himself to his mighty task abandoning at once all thoughts of seizing transient effects or giving general impressions of that which his eyes present to him in microscopical dissection he chooses some small portion out of the infinite scene and calculates with courage the number of weeks which must elapse before he can do justice to the intensity of his perceptions or the fulness of matter in his subject  meantime the other has been watching the change of the clouds and the march of the light along the mountain sides he beholds the entire scene in broad soft masses of true gradation and the very feebleness of his sight is in some sort an advantage to him in making him more sensible of the a√´rial mystery of distance and hiding from him the multitudes of circumstances which it would have been impossible for him to represent but there is not one change in the casting of the jagged shadows along the hollows of the hills but it is fixed on his mind for ever not a flake of spray has broken from the sea of cloud about their bases but he has watched it as it melts away and could recall it to its lost place in heaven by the slightest effort of his thoughts not only so but thousands and thousands of such images of older scenes remain congregated in his mind each mingling in new associations with those now visibly passing before him and these again confused with other images of his own ceaseless sleepless imagination flashing by in sudden troops fancy how his paper will be covered with stray symbols and blots and undecipherable shorthandas for his sitting down to draw from nature there was not one of the things which he wished to represent that stayed for so much as five seconds together but none of them escaped for all that they are sealed up in that strange storehouse of his he may take one of them out perhaps this day twenty years and paint it in his dark room far away now observe you may tell both of these men when they are young that they are to be honest that they have an important function and that they are not to care what raphael did this you may wholesomely impress on them both but fancy the exquisite absurdity of expecting either of them to possess any of the qualities of the other  i have supposed the feebleness of sight in the last and of invention in the first painter that the contrast between them might be more striking but with very slight modification both the characters are real grant to the first considerable inventive power with exquisite sense of color and give to the second in addition to all his other faculties the eye of an eagle and the first is john everett millais the second joseph mallard william turner  they are among the few men who have defied all false teaching and have therefore in great measure done justice to the gifts with which they were entrusted they stand at opposite poles marking culminating points of art in both directions between them or in various relations to them we may class five or six more living artists who in like manner have done justice to their powers i trust that i may be pardoned for naming them in order that the reader may know how the strong innate genius in each has been invariably accompanied with the same humility earnestness and industry in study  it is hardly necessary to point out the earnestness or humility in the works of william hunt but it may be so to suggest the high value they possess as records of english rural life and still life who is there who for a moment could contend with him in the unaffected yet humorous truth with which he has painted our peasant children who is there who does not sympathize with him in the simple love with which he dwells on the brightness and bloom of our summer fruit and flowers and yet there is something to be regretted concerning him why should he be allowed continually to paint the same bunches of hothouse grapes and supply to the water color society a succession of pineapples with the regularity of a covent garden fruiterer he has of late discovered that primrose banks are lovely but there are other things grow wild besides primroses what undreamtof loveliness might he not bring back to us if he would lose himself for a summer in highland foregrounds if he would paint the heather as it grows and the foxglove and the harebell as they nestle in the clefts of the rocks and the mosses and bright lichens of the rocks themselves and then cross to the jura and bring back a piece of jura pasture in spring with the gentians in their earliest blue and the soldanelle beside the fading snow and return again and paint a gray wall of alpine crag with budding roses crowning it like a wreath of rubies that is what he was meant to do in this world not to paint bouquets in china vases  i have in various other places expressed my sincere respect for the works of samuel prout his shortness of sight has necessarily prevented their possessing delicacy of finish or fulness of minor detail but i think that those of no other living artist furnish an example so striking of innate and special instinct sent to do a particular work at the exact and only period when it was possible at the instant when peace had been established all over europe but when neither national character nor national architecture had as yet been seriously changed by promiscuous intercourse or modern improvement when however nearly every ancient and beautiful building had been long left in a state of comparative neglect so that its aspect of partial ruinousness and of separation from recent active life gave to every edifice a peculiar interesthalf sorrowful half sublimeat that moment prout was trained among the rough rocks and simple cottages of cornwall until his eye was accustomed to follow with delight the rents and breaks and irregularities which to another man would have been offensive and then gifted with infinite readiness in composition but also with infinite affection for the kind of subjects he had to portray he was sent to preserve in an almost innumerable series of drawings every one made on the spot the aspect borne at the beginning of the nineteenth century by cities which in a few years more rekindled wars or unexpected prosperities were to ravage or renovate into nothingness  it seems strange to pass from prout to john lewis but there is this fellowship between them that both seem to have been intended to appreciate the characters of foreign countries more than of their ownnay to have been born in england chiefly that the excitement of strangeness might enhance to them the interest of the scenes they had to represent i believe john lewis to have done more entire justice to all his powers and they are magnificent ones than any other man amongst us his mission was evidently to portray the comparatively animal life of the southern and eastern families of mankind for this he was prepared in a somewhat singular wayby being led to study and endowed with altogether peculiar apprehension of the most sublime characters of animals themselves rubens rembrandt snyders tintoret and titian have all in various ways drawn wild beasts magnificently but they have in some sort humanized or demonized them making them either ravenous fiends or educated beasts that would draw cars and had respect for hermits the sullen isolation of the brutal nature the dignity and quietness of the mighty limbs the shaggy mountainous power mingled with grace as of a flowing stream the stealthy restraint of strength and wrath in every soundless motion of the gigantic frame all this seems never to have been seen much less drawn until lewis drew and himself engraved a series of animal subjects now many years ago since then he has devoted himself to the portraiture of those european and asiatic races among whom the refinements of civilization exist without its laws or its energies and in whom the fierceness indolence and subtlety of animal nature are associated with brilliant imagination and strong affections to this task he has brought not only intense perception of the kind of character but powers of artistical composition like those of the great venetians displaying at the same time a refinement of drawing almost miraculous and appreciable only as the minuti√¶ of nature itself are appreciable by the help of the microscope the value therefore of his works as records of the aspect of the scenery and inhabitants of the south of spain and of the east in the earlier part of the nineteenth century is quite above all estimate  i hardly know how to speak of mulready in delicacy and completion of drawing and splendor of color he takes place beside john lewis and the preraphaelites but he has throughout his career displayed no definiteness in choice of subject he must be named among the painters who have studied with industry and have made themselves great by doing so but having obtained a consummate method of execution he has thrown it away on subjects either altogether uninteresting or above his powers or unfit for pictorial representation the cherry woman exhibited in 1850 may be named as an example of the first kind the burchell and sophia of the second the character of sir william thornhill being utterly missed the seven ages of the third for this subject cannot be painted in the written passage the thoughts are progressive and connected in the picture they must be coexistent and yet separate nor can all the characters of the ages be rendered in painting at all one may represent the soldier at the cannons mouth but one cannot paint the bubble reputation which he seeks mulready therefore while he has always produced exquisite pieces of painting has failed in doing anything which can be of true or extensive use he has indeed understood how to discipline his genius but never how to direct it  edwin landseer is the last painter but one whom i shall name i need not point out to any one acquainted with his earlier works the labor or watchfulness of nature which they involve nor need i do more than allude to the peculiar faculties of his mind it will at once be granted that the highest merits of his pictures are throughout found in those parts of them which are least like what had before been accomplished and that it was not by the study of raphael that he attained his eminent success but by a healthy love of scotch terriers  none of these painters however it will be answered afford examples of the rise of the highest imaginative power out of close study of matters of fact be it remembered however that the imaginative power in its magnificence is not to be found every day lewis has it in no mean degree but we cannot hope to find it at its highest more than once in an age we have had it once and must be content  towards the close of the last century among the various drawings executed according to the quiet manner of the time in greyish blue with brown foregrounds some began to be noticed as exhibiting rather more than ordinary diligence and delicacy signed w turner99 there was nothing however in them at all indicative of genius or even of more than ordinary talent unless in some of the subjects a large perception of space and excessive clearness and decision in the arrangement of masses gradually and cautiously the blues became mingled with delicate green and then with gold the browns in the foreground became first more positive and then were slightly mingled with other local colors while the touch which had at first been heavy and broken like that of the ordinary drawing masters of the time grew more and more refined and expressive until it lost itself in a method of execution often too delicate for the eye to follow rendering with a precision before unexampled both the texture and the form of every object the style may be considered as perfectly formed about the year 1800 and it remained unchanged for twenty years  during that period the painter had attempted and with more or less success had rendered every order of landscape subject but always on the same principle subduing the colors of nature into a harmony of which the keynotes are greyish green and brown pure blues and delicate golden yellows being admitted in small quantity as the lowest and highest limits of shade and light and bright local colors in extremely small quantity in figures or other minor accessories  pictures executed on such a system are not properly speaking works in color at all they are studies of light and shade in which both the shade and the distance are rendered in the general hue which best expresses their attributes of coolness and transparency and the lights and the foreground are executed in that which best expresses their warmth and solidity this advantage may just as well be taken as not in studies of light and shadow to be executed with the hand but the use of two three or four colors always in the same relations and places does not in the least constitute the work a study of color any more than the brown engravings of the liber studiorum nor would the idea of color be in general more present to the artists mind when he was at work on one of these drawings than when he was using pure brown in the mezzotint engraving but the idea of space warmth and freshness being not successfully expressible in a single tint and perfectly expressible by the admission of three or four he allows himself this advantage when it is possible without in the least embarrassing himself with the actual color of the objects to be represented a stone in the fore ground might in nature have been cold grey but it will be drawn nevertheless of a rich brown because it is in the foreground a hill in the distance might in nature be purple with heath or golden with furze but it will be drawn nevertheless of a cool grey because it is in the distance  this at least was the general theorycarried out with great severity in many both of the drawings and pictures executed by him during the period in others more or less modified by the cautious introduction of color as the painter felt his liberty increasing for the system was evidently never considered as final or as anything more than a means of progress the conventional easily manageable color was visibly adopted only that his mind might be at perfect liberty to address itself to the acquirement of the first and most necessary knowledge in all artthat of form but as form in landscape implies vast bulk and space the use of the tints which enabled him best to express them was actually auxiliary to the mere drawing and therefore not only permissible but even necessary while more brilliant or varied tints were never indulged in except when they might be introduced without the slightest danger of diverting his mind for an instant from his principal object and therefore it will be generally found in the works of this period that exactly in proportion to the importance and general toil of the composition is the severity of the tint and that the play of color begins to show itself first in slight and small drawings where he felt that he could easily secure all that he wanted in form  thus the crossing the brook and such other elaborate and large compositions are actually painted in nothing but grey brown and blue with a point or two of severe local color in the figures but in the minor drawings tender passages of complicated color occur not unfrequently in easy places and even before the year 1800 he begins to introduce it with evident joyfulness and longing in his rude and simple studies just as a child if it could be supposed to govern itself by a fully developed intellect would cautiously but with infinite pleasure add now and then a tiny dish of fruit or other dangerous luxury to the simple order of its daily fare thus in the foregrounds of his most severe drawings we not unfrequently find him indulging in the luxury of a peacock and it is impossible to express the joyfulness with which he seems to design its graceful form and deepen with soft pencilling the bloom of its blue after he has worked through the stern detail of his almost colorless drawing a rainbow is another of his most frequently permitted indulgences and we find him very early allowing the edges of his evening clouds to be touched with soft rosecolor or gold while whenever the hues of nature in anywise fall into his system and can be caught without a dangerous departure from it he instantly throws his whole soul into the faithful rendering of them thus the usual brown tones of his foreground become warmed into sudden vigor and are varied and enhanced with indescribable delight when he finds himself by the shore of a moorland stream where they truly express the stain of its golden rocks and the darkness of its clear cairngormlike pools and the usual serenity of his a√´rial blue is enriched into the softness and depth of the sapphire when it can deepen the distant slumber of some highland lake or temper the gloomy shadows of the evening upon its hills  the system of his color being thus simplified he could address all the strength of his mind to the accumulation of facts of form his choice of subject and his methods of treatment are therefore as various as his color is simple and it is not a little difficult to give the reader who is unacquainted with his works an idea either of their infinitude of aims on the one hand or of the kind of feeling which prevades them all on the other no subject was too low or too high for him we find him one day hard at work on a cock and hen with their family of chickens in a farmyard and bringing all the refinement of his execution into play to express the texture of the plumage next day he is drawing the dragon of colchis one hour he is much interested in a gust of wind blowing away an old womans cap the next he is painting the fifth plague of egypt every landscape painter before him had acquired distinction by confining his efforts to one class of subject hobbima painted oaks ruysdael waterfalls and copses cuyp river or meadow scenes in quiet afternoons salvator and poussin such kind of mountain scenery as people could conceive who lived in towns in the seventeenth century but i am well persuaded that if all the works of turner up to the year 1820 were divided into classes as he has himself divided them in the liber studiorum no preponderance could be assigned to one class over another there is architecture including a large number of formal gentlemens seats i suppose drawings commissioned by the owners then lowland pastoral scenery of every kind including nearly all farming operationsploughing harrowing hedging and ditching felling trees sheepwashing and i know not what else then all kinds of town lifecourtyards of inns starting of mail coaches interiors of shops housebuildings fairs elections c then all kinds of inner domestic lifeinteriors of rooms studies of costumes of still life and heraldry including multitudes of symbolical vignettes then marine scenery of every kind full of local incident every kind of boat and method of fishing for particular fish being specifically drawn round the whole coast of englandpilchard fishing at st ives whiting fishing at margate herring at loch fyne and all kinds of shipping including studies of every separate part of the vessels and many marine battlepieces two in particular of trafalgar both of high importanceone of the victory after the battle now in greenwich hospital another of the death of nelson in his own gallery then all kinds of mountain scenery some idealised into compositions others of definite localities together with classical compositions romes and carthages and such others by the myriad with mythological historical or allegorical figuresnymphs monsters and spectres heroes and divinities100  what general feeling it may be asked incredulously can possibly pervade all this this the greatest of all feelingsan utter forgetfulness of self throughout the whole period with which we are at present concerned turner appears as a man of sympathy absolutely infinitea sympathy so allembracing that i know nothing but that of shakespeare comparable with it a soldiers wife resting by the roadside is not beneath it rizpah the daughter of aiah watching the dead bodies of her sons not above it nothing can possibly be so mean as that it will not interest his whole mind and carry away his whole heart nothing so great or solemn but that he can raise himself into harmony with it and it is impossible to prophesy of him at any moment whether the next he will be in laughter or in tears  this is the root of the mans greatness and it follows as a matter of course that this sympathy must give him a subtle power of expression even of the characters of mere material things such as no other painter ever possessed the man who can best feel the difference between rudeness and tenderness in humanity perceives also more difference between the branches of an oak and a willow than any one else would and therefore necessarily the most striking character of the drawings themselves is the speciality of whatever they representthe thorough stiffness of what is stiff and grace of what is graceful and vastness of what is vast but through and beyond all this the condition of the mind of the painter himself is easily enough discoverable by comparison of a large number of the drawings it is singularly serene and peaceful in itself quite passionless though entering with ease into the external passion which it contemplates by the effort of its will it sympathises with tumult or distress even in their extremes but there is no tumult no sorrow in itself only a chastened and exquisitely peaceful cheerfulness deeply meditative touched without loss of its own perfect balance by sadness on the one side and stooping to playfulness upon the other i shall never cease to regret the destruction by fire now several years ago of a drawing which always seemed to me to be the perfect image of the painters mind at this periodthe drawing of brignal church near rokeby of which a feeble idea may still be gathered from the engraving in the yorkshire series the spectator stands on the brignal banks looking down into the glen at twilight the sky is still full of soft rays though the sun is gone and the greta glances brightly in the valley singing its eveningsong two white clouds following each other move without wind through the hollows of the ravine and others lie couched on the far away moorlands every leaf of the woods is still in the delicate air a boys kite incapable of rising has become entangled in their branches he is climbing to recover it and just behind it in the picture almost indicated by it the lowly church is seen in its secluded field between the rocks and the stream and around it the low churchyard wall and the few white stones which mark the resting places of those who can climb the rocks no more nor hear the river sing as it passes  there are many other existing drawings which indicate the same character of mind though i think none so touching or so beautiful yet they are not as i said above more numerous than those which express his sympathy with sublimer or more active scenes but they are almost always marked by a tenderness of execution and have a look of being beloved in every part of them which shows them to be the truest expression of his own feelings  one other characteristic of his mind at this period remains to be noticedits reverence for talent in others not the reverence which acts upon the practices of men as if they were the laws of nature but that which is ready to appreciate the power and receive the assistance of every mind which has been previously employed in the same direction so far as its teaching seems to be consistent with the great textbook of nature itself turner thus studied almost every preceding landscape painter chiefly claude poussin vandevelde loutherbourg and wilson it was probably by the sir george beaumonts and other feeble conventionalists of the period that he was persuaded to devote his attention to the works of these men and his having done so will be thought a few scores of years hence evidence of perhaps the greatest modesty ever shown by a man of original power modesty at once admirable and unfortunate for the study of the works of vandevelde and claude was productive of unmixed mischief to him he spoiled many of his marine pictures as for instance lord ellesmeres by imitation of the former and from the latter learned a false ideal which confirmed by the notions of greek art prevalent in london in the beginning of this century has manifested itself in many vulgarities in his composition pictures vulgarities which may perhaps be best expressed by the general term twickenham classicism as consisting principally in conceptions of ancient or of rural life such as have influenced the erection of most of our suburban villas from nicolo poussin and loutherbourg he seems to have derived advantage perhaps also from wilson and much in his subsequent travels from far higher men especially tintoret and paul veronese i have myself heard him speaking with singular delight of the putting in of the beech leaves in the upper righthand corner of titians peter martyr i cannot in any of his works trace the slightest influence of salvator and i am not surprised at it for though salvator was a man of far higher powers than either vandevelde or claude he was a wilful and gross caricaturist turner would condescend to be helped by feeble men but could not be corrupted by false men besides he had never himself seen classical life and claude was represented to him as competent authority for it but he had seen mountains and torrents and knew therefore that salvator could not paint them  one of the most characteristic drawings of this period fortunately bears a date 1818 and brings us within two years of another dated drawing no less characteristic of what i shall henceforward call turners second period it is in the possession of mr hawkesworth fawkes of farnley one of turners earliest and truest friends and bears the inscription unusually conspicuous heaving itself up and down over the eminences of the foregroundpassage of mont cenis j m w turner january 15th 1820  the scene is on the summit of the pass close to the hospice or what seems to have been a hospice at that timei do not remember such at presenta small squarebuilt house built as if partly for a fortress with a detached flight of stone steps in front of it and a kind of drawbridge to the door this building about 400 or 500 yards off is seen in a dim ashy grey against the light which by help of a violent blast of mountain wind has broken through the depth of clouds which hangs upon the crags there is no sky properly so called nothing but this roof of drifting cloud but neither is there any weight of darknessthe high air is too thin for itall savage howling and luminous with cold the massy bases of the granite hills jutting out here and there grimly through the snow wreaths there is a desolatelooking refuge on the left with its number 16 marked on it in long ghastly figures and the wind is drifting the snow off the roof and through its window in a frantic whirl the near ground is all wan with halfthawed halftrampled snow a diligence in front whose horses unable to face the wind have turned right round with fright its passengers struggling to escape jammed in the window a little farther on is another carriage off the road some figures pushing at its wheels and its driver at the horses heads pulling and lashing with all his strength his lifted arm stretched out against the light of the distance though too far off for the whip to be seen  now i am perfectly certain that any one thoroughly accustomed to the earlier works of the painter and shown this picture for the first time would be struck by two altogether new characters in it  the first a seeming enjoyment of the excitement of the scene totally different from the contemplative philosophy with which it would formerly have been regarded every incident of motion and of energy is seized upon with indescribable delight and every line of the composition animated with a force and fury which are now no longer the mere expression of a contemplated external truth but have origin in some inherent feeling in the painters mind  the second that although the subject is one in itself almost incapable of color and although in order to increase the wildness of the impression all brilliant local color has been refused even where it might easily have been introduced as in the figures yet in the low minor key which has been chosen the melodies of color have been elaborated to the utmost possible pitch so as to become a leading instead of a subordinate element in the composition the subdued warm hues of the granite promontories the dull stone color of the walls of the buildings clearly opposed even in shade to the grey of the snow wreaths heaped against them and the faint greens and ghastly blues of the glacier ice being all expressed with delicacies of transition utterly unexampled in any previous drawings  these accordingly are the chief characteristics of the works of turners second period as distinguished from the firsta new energy inherent in the mind of the painter diminishing the repose and exalting the force and fire of his conceptions and the presence of color as at least an essential and often a principal element of design  not that it is impossible or even unusual to find drawings of serene subject and perfectly quiet feeling among the compositions of this period but the repose is in them just as the energy and tumult were in the earlier period an external quality which the painter images by an effort of the will it is no longer a character inherent in himself the ulleswater in the england series is one of those which are in most perfect peace in the cowes the silence is only broken by the dash of the boats oars and in the alnwick by a stag drinking but in at least nine drawings out of ten either sky water or figures are in rapid motion and the grandest drawings are almost always those which have even violent action in one or other or in all e g high force of tees coventry llanthony salisbury llanberis and such others  the color is however a more absolute distinction and we must return to mr fawkess collection in order to see how the change in it was effected that such a change would take place at one time or other was of course to be securely anticipated the conventional system of the first period being as above stated merely a means of study but the immediate cause was the journey of the year 1820 as might be guessed from the legend on the drawing above described passage of mont cenis january 15th 1820 that drawing represents what happened on the day in question to the painter himself he passed the alps then in the winter of 1820 and either in the previous or subsequent summer but on the same journey he made a series of sketches on the rhine in body color now in mr fawkess collection every one of those sketches is the almost instantaneous record of an effect of color or atmosphere taken strictly from nature the drawing and the details of every subject being comparatively subordinate and the color nearly as principal as the light and shade had been beforecertainly the leading feature though the light and shade are always exquisitely harmonized with it and naturally as the color becomes the leading object those times of day are chosen in which it is most lovely and whereas before at least five out of six of turners drawings represented ordinary daylight we now find his attention directed constantly to the evening and for the first time we have those rosy lights upon the hills those gorgeous falls of sun through flaming heavens those solemn twilights with the blue moon rising as the western sky grows dim which have ever since been the themes of his mightiest thoughts  i have no doubt that the immediate reason of this change was the impression made upon him by the colors of the continental skies when he first travelled on the continent 1800 he was comparatively a young student not yet able to draw form as he wanted he was forced to give all his thoughts and strength to this primary object but now he was free to receive other impressions the time was come for perfecting his art and the first sunset which he saw on the rhine taught him that all previous landscape art was vain and valueless that in comparison with natural color the things that had been called paintings were mere ink and charcoal and that all precedent and all authority must be cast away at once and trodden under foot he cast them away the memories of vandevelde and claude were at once weeded out of the great mind they had encumbered they and all the rubbish of the schools together with them the waves of the rhine swept them away for ever and a new dawn rose over the rocks of the siebengebirge  there was another motive at work which rendered the change still more complete his fellow artists were already conscious enough of his superior power in drawing and their best hope was that he might not be able to color they had begun to express this hope loudly enough for it to reach his ears the engraver of one of his most important marine pictures told me not long ago that one day about the period in question turner came into his room to examine the progress of the plate not having seen his own picture for several months it was one of his dark early pictures but in the foreground was a little piece of luxury a pearly fish wrought into hues like those of an opal he stood before the picture for some moments then laughed and pointed joyously to the fishthey say that turner cant color and turned away  under the force of these various impulses the change was total every subject thenceforth was primarily conceived in color and no engraving ever gave the slightest idea of any drawing of this period  the artists who had any perception of the truth were in despair the beaumontites classicalists and owl species in general in as much indignation as their dulness was capable of they had deliberately closed their eyes to all nature and had gone on inquiring where do you put your brown tree a vast revelation was made to them at once enough to have dazzled any one but to them light unendurable as incomprehensible they did to the moon complain in one vociferous unanimous continuous tu whoo shrieking rose from all dark places at the same instant just the same kind of shrieking that is now raised against the preraphaelites those glorious old arabian nights how true they are mocking and whispering and abuse loud and low by turns from all the black stones beside the road when one living soul is toiling up the hill to get the golden water mocking and whispering that he may look back and become a black stone like themselves  turner looked not back but he went on in such a temper as a strong man must be in when he is forced to walk with his fingers in his ears he retired into himself he could look no longer for help or counsel or sympathy from any one and the spirit of defiance in which he was forced to labor led him sometimes into violences from which the slightest expression of sympathy would have saved him the new energy that was upon him and the utter isolation into which he was driven were both alike dangerous and many drawings of the time show the evil effects of both some of them being hasty wild or experimental and others little more than magnificent expressions of defiance of public opinion  but all have this noble virtuethey are in everything his own there are no more reminiscences of dead masters no more trials of skill in the manner of claude or poussin every faculty of his soul is fixed upon nature only as he saw her or as he remembered her  i have spoken above of his gigantic memory it is especially necessary to notice this in order that we may understand the kind of grasp which a man of real imagination takes of all things that are once brought within his reachgrasp thenceforth not to be relaxed for ever  on looking over any catalogues of his works or of particular series of them we shall notice the recurrence of the same subject two three or even many times in any other artist this would be nothing remarkable probably most modern landscape painters multiply a favorite subject twenty thirty or sixty fold putting the shadows and the clouds in different places and inventing as they are pleased to call it a new effect every time but if we examine the successions of turners subjects we shall find them either the records of a succession of impressions actually perceived by him at some favorite locality or else repetitions of one impression received in early youth and again and again realised as his increasing powers enabled him to do better justice to it in either case we shall find them records of seen facts never compositions in his room to fill up a favorite outline  for instance every traveller at least every traveller of thirty years standing must love calais the place where he first felt himself in a strange world turner evidently loved it excessively i have never catalogued his studies of calais but i remember at this moment five there is first the pas de calais a very large oil painting which is what he saw in broad daylight as he crossed over when he got near the french side it is a careful study of french fishing boats running for the shore before the wind with the picturesque old city in the distance then there is the calais harbor in the liber studiorum that is what he saw just as he was going into the harbora heavy brig warping out and very likely to get in his way or run against the pier and bad weather coming on then there is the calais pier a large painting engraved some years ago by mr lupton101 that is what he saw when he had landed and ran back directly to the pier to see what had become of the brig the weather had got still worse the fishwomen were being blown about in a distressful manner on the pier head and some more fishing boats were running in with all speed then there is the fortrouge calais that is what he saw after he had been home to desseins and dined and went out again in the evening to walk on the sands the tide being down he had never seen such a waste of sands before and it made an impression on him the shrimp girls were all scattered over them too and moved about in white spots on the wild shore and the storm had lulled a little and there was a sunsetsuch a sunsetand the bars of fortrouge seen against it skeletonwise  he did not paint that directly thought over itpainted it a long while afterwards  then there is the vignette in the illustrations to scott that is what he saw as he was going home meditatively and the revolving lighthouse came blazing out upon him suddenly and disturbed him he did not like that so much made a vignette of it however when he was asked to do a bit of calais twenty or thirty years afterwards having already done all the rest  turner never told me all this but any one may see it if he will compare the pictures they might possibly not be impressions of a single day but of two days or three though in all human probability they were seen just as i have stated them102 but they are records of successive impressions as plainly written as ever travellers diary all of them pure veracities therefore immortal  i could multiply these series almost indefinitely from the rest of his works what is curious some of them have a kind of private mark running through all the subjects thus i know three drawings of scarborough and all of them have a starfish in the foreground i do not remember any others of his marine subjects which have a starfish  the other kind of repetitionthe recurrence to one early impressionis however still more remarkable in the collection of f h bale esq there is a small drawing of llanthony abbey it is in his boyish manner its date probably about 1795 evidently a sketch from nature finished at home it had been a showery day the hills were partially concealed by the rain and gleams of sunshine breaking out at intervals a man was fishing in the mountain stream the young turner sought a place of some shelter under the bushes made his sketch took great pains when he got home to imitate the rain as he best could added his childs luxury of a rainbow put in the very bush under which he had taken shelter and the fisherman a somewhat illjointed and longlegged fisherman in the courtly short breeches which were the fashion of the time  some thirty years afterwards with all his powers in their strongest training and after the total change in his feelings and principles which i have endeavored to describe he undertook the series of england and wales and in that series introduced the subject of llanthony abbey and behold he went back to his boys sketch and boys thought he kept the very bushes in their places but brought the fisherman to the other side of the river and put him in somewhat less courtly dress under their shelter instead of himself and then he set all his gained strength and new knowledge at work on the wellremembered shower of rain that had fallen thirty years before to do it better the resultant drawing103 is one of the very noblest of his second period  another of the drawings of the england series ulleswater is the repetition of one in mr fawkess collection which by the method of its execution i should conjecture to have been executed about the year 1808 or 1810 at all events it is a very quiet drawing of the first period the lake is quite calm the western hills in grey shadow the eastern massed in light helvellyn rising like a mist between them all being mirrored in the calm water some thin and slightly evanescent cows are standing in the shallow water in front a boat floats motionless about a hundred yards from the shore the foreground is of broken rocks with lovely pieces of copse on the right and left  this was evidently turners record of a quiet evening by the shore of ulleswater but it was a feeble one he could not at that time render the sunset colors he went back to it therefore in the england series and painted it again with his new power the same hills are there the same shadows the same cowsthey had stood in his mind on the same spot for twenty yearsthe same boat the same rocks only the copse is cut awayit interfered with the masses of his color some figures are introduced bathing and what was grey and feeble gold in the first drawing becomes purple and burning rosecolor in the last  but perhaps one of the most curious examples is in the series of subjects from winchelsea that in the liber studiorum winchelsea sussex bears date 1812 and its figures consist of a soldier speaking to a woman who is resting on the bank beside the road there is another small subject with winchelsea in the distance of which the engraving bears date 1817 it has two women with bundles and two soldiers toiling along the embankment in the plain and a baggage waggon in the distance neither of these seems to have satisfied him and at last he did another for the england series of which the engraving bears date 1830 there is now a regiment on the march the baggage waggon is there having got no further on in the thirteen years but one of the women is tired and has fainted on the bank another is supporting her against her bundle and giving her drink a third sympathetic woman is added and the two soldiers have stopped and one is drinking from his canteen  nor is it merely of entire scenes or of particular incidents that turners memory is thus tenacious the slightest passages of color or arrangement that have pleased himthe fork of a bough the casting of a shadow the fracture of a stonewill be taken up again and again and strangely worked into new relations with other thoughts there is a single sketch from nature in one of the portfolios at farnley of a common woodwalk on the estate which has furnished passages to no fewer than three of the most elaborate compositions in the liber studiorum  i am thus tedious in dwelling on turners powers of memory because i wish it to be thoroughly seen how all his greatness all his infinite luxuriance of invention depends on his taking possession of everything that he seeson his grasping all and losing hold of nothingon his forgetting himself and forgetting nothing else i wish it to be understood how every great man paints what he sees or did see his greatness being indeed little else than his intense sense of fact and thus preraphaelitism and raphaelitism and turnerism are all one and the same so far as education can influence them they are different in their choice different in their faculties but all the same in this that raphael himself so far as he was great and all who preceded or followed him who ever were great became so by painting the truths around them as they appeared to each mans own mind not as he had been taught to see them except by the god who made both him and them  there is however one more characteristic of turners second period on which i have still to dwell especially with reference to what has been above advanced respecting the fallacy of overtoil namely the magnificent ease with which all is done when it is successfully done for there are one or two drawings of this time which are not done easily turner had in these set himself to do a fine thing to exhibit his powers in the common phrase to excel himself so sure as he does this the work is a failure the worst drawings that have ever come from his hands are some of this second period on which he has spent much time and laborious thought drawings filled with incident from one side to the other with skies stippled into morbid blue and warm lights set against them in violent contrast one of bamborough castle a large watercolor may be named as an example but the truly noble works are those in which without effort he has expressed his thoughts as they came and forgotten himself and in these the outpouring of invention is not less miraculous than the swiftness and obedience of the mighty hand that expresses it any one who examines the drawings may see the evidence of this facility in the strange freshness and sharpness of every touch of color but when the multitude of delicate touches with which all the a√´rial tones are worked is taken into consideration it would still appear impossible that the drawing could have been completed with ease unless we had direct evidence in the matter fortunately it is not wanting there is a drawing in mr fawkess collection of a manofwar taking in stores it is of the usual size of those of the england series about sixteen inches by eleven it does not appear one of the most highly finished but is still farther removed from slightness the hull of a firstrate occupies nearly onehalf of the picture on the right her bows towards the spectator seen in sharp perspective from stem to stern with all her portholes guns anchors and lower rigging elaborately detailed there are two other ships of the line in the middle distance drawn with equal precision a noble breezy sea dancing against their broad bows full of delicate drawing in its waves a storeship beneath the hull of the larger vessel and several other boats and a complicated cloudy sky it might appear no small exertion of mind to draw the detail of all this shipping down to the smallest ropes from memory in the drawingroom of a mansion in the middle of yorkshire even if considerable time had been given for the effort but mr fawkes sat beside the painter from the first stroke to the last turner took a piece of blank paper one morning after breakfast outlined his ships finished the drawing in three hours and went out to shoot  let this single fact be quietly meditated upon by our ordinary painters and they will see the truth of what was above assertedthat if a great thing can be done at all it can be done easily and let them not torment themselves with twisting of compositions this way and that and repeating and experimenting and sceneshifting if a man can compose at all he can compose at once or rather he must compose in spite of himself and this is the reason of that silence which i have kept in most of my works on the subject of composition many critics especially the architects have found fault with me for not teaching people how to arrange masses for not attributing sufficient importance to composition alas i attribute far more importance to it than they doso much importance that i should just as soon think of sitting down to teach a man how to write a divina commedia or king lear as how to compose in the true sense a single building or picture the marvellous stupidity of this age of lecturers is that they do not see that what they call principles of composition are mere principles of common sense in everything as well as in pictures and buildingsa picture is to have a principal light yes and so a dinner is to have a principal dish and an oration a principal point and an air of music a principal note and every man a principal object a picture is to have harmony of relation among its parts yes and so is a speech well uttered and an action well ordered and a company well chosen and a ragout well mixed composition as if a man were not composing every moment of his life well or ill and would not do it instinctively in his picture as well as elsewhere if he could composition of this lower or common kind is of exactly the same importance in a picture that it is in any thing elseno more it is well that a man should say what he has to say in good order and sequence but the main thing is to say it truly and yet we go on preaching to our pupils as if to have a principal light was every thing and so cover our academy walls with shacabac feasts wherein the courses are indeed well ordered but the dishes empty  it is not however only in invention that men overwork themselves but in execution also and here i have a word to say to the preraphaelites specially they are working too hard there is evidence in failing portions of their pictures showing that they have wrought so long upon them that their very sight has failed for weariness and that the hand refused any more to obey the heart and besides this there are certain qualities of drawing which they miss from overcarefulness for let them be assured there is a great truth lurking in that common desire of men to see things done in what they call a masterly or bold or broad manner a truth oppressed and abused like almost every other in this world but an eternal one nevertheless and whatever mischief may have followed from mens looking for nothing else but this facility of execution and supposing that a picture was assuredly all right if only it were done with broad dashes of the brush still the truth remains the samethat because it is not intended that men shall torment or weary themselves with any earthly labor it is appointed that the noblest results should only be attainable by a certain ease and decision of manipulation i only wish people understood this much of sculpture as well as of painting and could see that the finely finished statue is in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a far more vulgar work than that which shows rough signs of the right hand laid to the workmans hammer but at all events in painting it is felt by all men and justly felt the freedom of the lines of nature can only be represented by a similar freedom in the hand that follows them there are curves in the flow of the hair and in the form of the features and in the muscular outline of the body which can in no wise be caught but by a sympathetic freedom in the stroke of the pencil i do not care what example is taken be it the most subtle and careful work of leonardo himself there will be found a play and power and ease in the outlines which no slow effort could ever imitate and if the preraphaelites do not understand how this kind of power in its highest perfection may be united with the most severe rendering of all other orders of truth and especially of those with which they themselves have most sympathy let them look at the drawings of john lewis  these then are the principal lessons which we have to learn from turner in his second or central period of labor there is one more however to be received and that is a warning for towards the close of it what with doing small conventional vignettes for publishers making showy drawings from sketches taken by other people of places he had never seen and touching up the bad engravings from his works submitted to him almost every dayengravings utterly destitute of animation and which had to be raised into a specious brilliancy by scratching them over with white spotty lights he gradually got inured to many conventionalities and even falsities and having trusted for ten or twelve years almost entirely to his memory and invention living i believe mostly in london and receiving a new sensation only from the burning of the houses of parliament he painted many pictures between 1830 and 1840 altogether unworthy of him but he was not thus to close his career  in the summer either of 1840 or 1841 he undertook another journey into switzerland it was then at least forty years since he had first seen the alps the source of the arveron in mr fawkess collection which could not have been painted till he had seen the thing itself bears date 1800 and the direction of his journey in 1840 marks his fond memory of that earliest one for if we look over the swiss studies and drawings executed in his first period we shall be struck with his fondness for the pass of the st gothard the most elaborate drawing in the farnley collection is one of the lake of lucerne from fluelen and counting the liber studiorum subjects there are to my knowledge six compositions taken at the same period from the pass of st gothard and probably several others are in existence the valleys of sallenche and chamouni and lake of geneva are the only other swiss scenes which seem to have made very profound impressions on him  he returned in 1841 to lucerne walked up mont pilate on foot crossed the st gothard and returned by lausanne and geneva he made a large number of colored sketches on this journey and realised several of them on his return the drawings thus produced are different from all that had preceded them and are the first which belong definitely to what i shall henceforth call his third period  the perfect repose of his youth had returned to his mind while the faculties of imagination and execution appeared in renewed strength all conventionality being done away with by the force of the impression which he had received from the alps after his long separation from them the drawings are marked by a peculiar largeness and simplicity of thought most of them by deep serenity passing into melancholy all by a richness of color such as he had never before conceived they and the works done in following years bear the same relation to those of the rest of his life that the colors of sunset do to those of the day and will be recognised in a few years more as the noblest landscapes ever yet conceived by human intellect  such has been the career of the greatest painter of this century many a century may pass away before there rises such another but what greatness any among us may be capable of will at least be best attained by following in his path by beginning in all quietness and hopefulness to use whatever powers we may possess to represent the things around us as we see and feel them trusting to the close of life to give the perfect crown to the course of its labors and knowing assuredly that the determination of the degree in which watchfulness is to be exalted into invention rests with a higher will than our own and if not greatness at least a certain good is thus to be achieved for though i have above spoken of the mission of the more humble artist as if it were merely to be subservient to that of the antiquarian or the man of science there is an ulterior aspect in which it is not subservient but superior every arch√¶ologist every natural philosopher knows that there is a peculiar rigidity of mind brought on by long devotion to logical and analytical inquiries weak men giving themselves to such studies are utterly hardened by them and become incapable of understanding anything nobler or even of feeling the value of the results to which they lead but even the best men are in a sort injured by them and pay a definite price as in most other matters for definite advantages they gain a peculiar strength but lose in tenderness elasticity and impressibility the man who has gone hammer in hand over the surface of a romantic country feels no longer in the mountain ranges he has so laboriously explored the sublimity or mystery with which they were veiled when he first beheld them and with which they are adorned in the mind of the passing traveller in his more informed conception they arrange themselves like a dissected model where another man would be awestruck by the magnificence of the precipice he sees nothing but the emergence of a fossiliferous rock familiarised already to his imagination as extending in a shallow stratum over a perhaps uninteresting district where the unlearned spectator would be touched with strong emotion by the aspect of the snowy summits which rise in the distance he sees only the culminating points of a metamorphic formation with an uncomfortable web of fanlike fissures radiating in his imagination through their centres104 that in the grasp he has obtained of the inner relations of all these things to the universe and to man that in the views which have been opened to him of natural energies such as no human mind would have ventured to conceive and of past states of being each in some new way bearing witness to the unity of purpose and everlastingly consistent providence of the maker of all things he has received reward well worthy the sacrifice i would not for an instant deny but the sense of the loss is not less painful to him if his mind be rightly constituted and it would be with infinite gratitude that he would regard the man who retaining in his delineation of natural scenery a fidelity to the facts of science so rigid as to make his work at once acceptable and credible to the most sternly critical intellect should yet invest its features again with the sweet veil of their daily aspect should make them dazzling with the splendor of wandering light and involve them in the unsearchableness of stormy obscurity should restore to the divided anatomy its visible vitality of operation clothe naked crags with soft forests enrich the mountain ruins with bright pastures and lead the thoughts from the monotonous recurrence of the phenomena of the physical world to the sweet interests and sorrows of human life and death   the end  footnotes  97 it was not a little curious that in the very number of the art union which repeated this direct falsehood about the preraphaelite rejection of linear perspective bythebye the next time j b takes upon him to speak of any one connected with the universities he may as well first ascertain the difference between a graduate and an undergraduate the second plate given should have been of a picture of boningtonsa professional landscape painter observefor the want of a√´rial perspective in which the art union itself was obliged to apologise and in which the artist has committed nearly as many blunders in linear perspective as there are lines in the picture  98 these false statements may be reduced to three principal heads and directly contradicted in succession  the first the current fallacy of society as well as of the press was that the preraphaelites imitated the errors of early painters  a falsehood of this kind could not have obtained credence anywhere but in england few english people comparatively having ever seen a picture of early italian masters if they had they would have known that the preraphaelite pictures are just as superior to the early italian in skill of manipulation power of drawing and knowledge of effect as inferior to them in grace of design and that in a word there is not a shadow of resemblance between the two styles the preraphaelites imitate no pictures they paint from nature only but they have opposed themselves as a body to that kind of teaching above described which only began after raphaels time and they have opposed themselves as sternly to the entire feeling of the renaissance schools a feeling compounded of indolence infidelity sensuality and shallow pride therefore they have called themselves preraphaelites if they adhere to their principles and paint nature as it is around them with the help of modern science with the earnestness of the men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries they will as i said found a new and noble school in england if their sympathies with the early artists lead them into medi√¶valism or romanism they will of course come to nothing but i believe there is no danger of this at least for the strongest among them there may be some weak ones whom the tractarian heresies may touch but if so they will drop off like decayed branches from a strong stem i hope all things from the school  the second falsehood was that the preraphaelites did not draw well this was asserted and could have been asserted only by persons who had never looked at the pictures  the third falsehood was that they had no system of light and shade to which it may be simply replied that their system of light and shade is exactly the same as the suns which is i believe likely to outlast that of the renaissance however brilliant  99 he did not use his full signature j m w until about the year 1800  100 i shall give a catalogue raisonn√©e of all this in the third volume of modern painters  101 the plate was however never published  102 and the more probably because turner was never fond of staying long at any place and was least of all likely to make a pause of two or three days at the beginning of his journey  103 vide modern painters part ii sect iii chap iv ¬ß 14  104 this state of mind appears to have been the only one which wordsworth had been able to discern in men of science and in disdain of which he wrote that shortsighted passage in the excursion book iii l 165190 which is i think the only one in the whole range of his works which his true friends would have desired to see blotted out what else has been found fault with as feeble or superfluous is not so in the intense distinctive relief which it gives to his character but these lines are written in mere ignorance of the matter they treat in mere want of sympathy with the men they describe for observe though the passage is put into the mouth of the solitary it is fully confirmed and even rendered more scornful by the speech which follows     aratra pentelici  six lectures  on the elements of  sculpture  given before the university of oxford in michaelmas term 1870     preface   i must pray the readers of the following lectures to remember that the duty at present laid on me at oxford is of an exceptionally complex character directly it is to awaken the interest of my pupils in a study which they have hitherto found unattractive and imagined to be useless but more imperatively it is to define the principles by which the study itself should be guided and to vindicate their security against the doubts with which frequent discussion has lately encumbered a subject which all think themselves competent to discuss the possibility of such vindication is of course implied in the original consent of the universities to the establishment of art professorships nothing can be made an element of education of which it is impossible to determine whether it is ill done or well and the clear assertion that there is a canon law in formative art is at this time a more important function of each university than the instruction of its younger members in any branch of practical skill it matters comparatively little whether few or many of our students learn to draw but it matters much that all who learn should be taught with accuracy and the number who may be justifiably advised to give any part of the time they spend at college to the study of painting or sculpture ought to depend and finally must depend on their being certified that painting and sculpture no less than language or than reasoning have grammar and methodthat they permit a recognizable distinction between scholarship and ignorance and enforce a constant distinction between right and wrong  this opening course of lectures on sculpture is therefore restricted to the statement not only of first principles but of those which were illustrated by the practice of one school and by that practice in its simplest branch the analysis of which could be certified by easily accessible examples and aided by the indisputable evidence of photography105  the exclusion of the terminal lecture of the course from the series now published is in order to mark more definitely this limitation of my subject but in other respects the lectures have been amplified in arranging them for the press and the portions of them trusted at the time to extempore delivery not through indolence but because explanations of detail are always most intelligible when most familiar have been in substance to the best of my power set down and in what i said too imperfectly completed  in one essential particular i have felt it necessary to write what i would not have spoken i had intended to make no reference in my university lectures to existing schools of art except in cases where it might be necessary to point out some undervalued excellence the objects specified in the eleventh paragraph of my inaugural lecture might i hoped have been accomplished without reference to any works deserving of blame but the exhibition of the royal academy in the present year showed me a necessity of departing from my original intention the task of impartial criticism106 is now unhappily no longer to rescue modest skill from neglect but to withstand the errors of insolent genius and abate the influence of plausible mediocrity  the exhibition of 1871 was very notable in this important particular that it embraced some representation of the modern schools of nearly every country in europe and i am well assured that looking back upon it after the excitement of that singular interest has passed away every thoughtful judge of art will confirm my assertion that it contained not a single picture of accomplished merit while it contained many that were disgraceful to art and some that were disgraceful to humanity  it becomes under such circumstances my inevitable duty to speak of the existing conditions of art with plainness enough to guard the youths whose judgments i am entrusted to form from being misled either by their own naturally vivid interest in what represents however unworthily the scenes and persons of their own day or by the cunningly devised and without doubt powerful allurements of art which has long since confessed itself to have no other object than to allure i have therefore added to the second of these lectures such illustration of the motives and course of modern industry as naturally arose out of its subject and shall continue in future to make similar applications rarely indeed permitting myself in the lectures actually read before the university to introduce subjects of instant and therefore too exciting interest but completing the addresses which i prepare for publication in these and in any other particulars which may render them more widely serviceable  the present course of lectures will be followed if i am able to fulfil the design of them by one of a like elementary character on architecture and that by a third series on christian sculpture but in the meantime my effort is to direct the attention of the resident students to natural history and to the higher branches of ideal landscape and it will be i trust accepted as sufficient reason for the delay which has occurred in preparing the following sheets for the press that i have not only been interrupted by a dangerous illness but engaged in what remained to me of the summer in an endeavour to deduce from the overwhelming complexity of modern classification in the natural sciences some forms capable of easier reference by art students to whom the anatomy of brutal and floral nature is often no less important than that of the human body  the preparation of examples for manual practice and the arrangement of standards for reference both in painting and sculpture had to be carried on meanwhile as i was able for what has already been done the reader is referred to the catalogue of the educational series published at the end of the spring term of what remains to be done i will make no anticipatory statement being content to have ascribed to me rather the fault of narrowness in design than of extravagance in expectation      denmark hill      25th november 1871  footnotes  105 photography cannot exhibit the character of large and finished sculpture but its audacity of shadow is in perfect harmony with the more roughly picturesque treatment necessary in coins for the rendering of all such frank relief and for the better explanation of forms disturbed by the lustre of metal or polished stone the method employed in the plates of this volume will be found i believe satisfactory casts are first taken from the coins in white plaster these are photographed and the photograph printed by the heliotype process of messrs edwards and kidd plate xii is exceptional being a pure mezzotint engraving of the old school excellently carried through by my assistant mr allen who was taught as a personal favour to myself by my friend and turners fellowworker thomas lupton plate iv was intended to be a photograph from the superb vase in the british museum no 564 in mr newtons catalogue but its variety of colour defied photography and after the sheets had gone to press i was compelled to reduce le normands plate of it which is unsatisfactory but answers my immediate purpose  the enlarged photographs for use in the lecture room were made for me with most successful skill by sergeant spackman of south kensington and the help throughout rendered to me by mr burgess is acknowledged in the course of the lectures though with thanks which must remain inadequate lest they should become tedious for mr burgess drew the subjects of plates iii x and xiii drew and engraved every woodcut in the book and printed all the plates with his own hand  106 a pamphlet by the earl of southesk britains art paradise edmonston and douglas edinburgh contains an entirely admirable criticism of the most faultful pictures of the 1871 exhibition it is to be regretted that lord southesk speaks only to condemn but indeed in my own three days review of the rooms i found nothing deserving of notice otherwise except mr hooks always pleasant sketches from fisher life and mr petties graceful and powerful though too slightly painted study from henry vi     aratra pentelici     lecture i  of the division of arts  november 1870   1 if as is commonly believed the subject of study which it is my special function to bring before you had no relation to the great interests of mankind i should have less courage in asking for your attention today than when i first addressed you though even then i did not do so without painful diffidence for at this moment even supposing that in other places it were possible for men to pursue their ordinary avocations undisturbed by indignation or pity here at least in the midst of the deliberative and religious influences of england only one subject i am well assured can seriously occupy your thoughtsthe necessity namely of determining how it has come to pass that in these recent days iniquity the most reckless and monstrous can be committed unanimously by men more generous than ever yet in the worlds history were deceived into deeds of cruelty and that prolonged agony of body and spirit such as we should shrink from inflicting wilfully on a single criminal has become the appointed and accepted portion of unnumbered multitudes of innocent persons inhabiting the districts of the world which of all others as it seemed were best instructed in the laws of civilization and most richly invested with the honour and indulged in the felicity of peace  believe me however the subject of artinstead of being foreign to these deep questions of social duty and perilis so vitally connected with them that it would be impossible for me now to pursue the line of thought in which i began these lectures because so ghastly an emphasis would be given to every sentence by the force of passing events it is well then that in the plan i have laid down for your study we shall now be led into the examination of technical details or abstract conditions of sentiment so that the hours you spend with me may be times of repose from heavier thoughts but it chances strangely that in this course of minutely detailed study i have first to set before you the most essential piece of human workmanship the plough at the very moment whenyou may see the announcement in the journals either of yesterday or the day beforethe swords of your soldiers have been sent for to be sharpened and not at all to be beaten into ploughshares i permit myself therefore to remind you of the watchword of all my earnest writingssoldiers of the ploughshare instead of soldiers of the swordand i know it my duty to assert to you that the work we enter upon today is no trivial one but full of solemn hope the hope namely that among you there may be found men wise enough to lead the national passions towards the arts of peace instead of the arts of war  i say the work we enter upon because the first four lectures i gave in the spring were wholly prefatory and the following three only defined for you methods of practice today we begin the systematic analysis and progressive study of our subject  2 in general the three great or fine arts of painting sculpture and architecture are thought of as distinct from the lower and more mechanical formative arts such as carpentry or pottery but we cannot either verbally or with any practical advantage admit such classification how are we to distinguish painting on canvas from painting on chinaor painting on china from painting on glassor painting on glass from infusion of colour into any vitreous substance such as enamelor the infusion of colour into glass and enamel from the infusion of colour into wool or silk and weaving of pictures in tapestry or patterns in dress you will find that although in ultimately accurate use of the word painting must be held to mean only the laying of a pigment on a surface with a soft instrument yet in broad comparison of the functions of art we must conceive of one and the same great artistic faculty as governing every mode of disposing colours in a permanent relation on or in a solid substance whether it be by tinting canvas or dyeing stuffs inlaying metals with fused flint or coating walls with coloured stone  3 similarly the word sculpturethough in ultimate accuracy it is to be limited to the development of form in hard substances by cutting away portions of their massin broad definition must be held to signify the reduction of any shapeless mass of solid matter into an intended shape whatever the consistence of the substance or nature of the instrument employed whether we carve a granite mountain or a piece of boxwood and whether we use for our forming instrument axe or hammer or chisel or our own hands or water to soften or fire to fusewhenever and however we bring a shapeless thing into shape we do so under the laws of the one great art of sculpture  4 having thus broadly defined painting and sculpture we shall see that there is in the third place a class of work separated from both in a specific manner and including a great group of arts which neither of necessity tint nor for the sake of form merely shape the substances they deal with but construct or arrange them with a view to the resistance of some external force we construct for instance a table with a flat top and some support of prop or leg proportioned in strength to such weights as the table is intended to carry we construct a ship out of planks or plates of iron with reference to certain forces of impact to be sustained and of inertia to be overcome or we construct a wall or roof with distinct reference to forces of pressure and oscillation to be sustained or guarded against and therefore in every case with especial consideration of the strength of our materials and the nature of that strength elastic tenacious brittle and the like  now although this group of arts nearly always involves the putting of two or more separate pieces together we must not define it by that accident the blade of an oar is not less formed with reference to external force than if it were made of many pieces and the frame of a boat whether hollowed out of a treetrunk or constructed of planks nailed together is essentially the same piece of art to be judged by its buoyancy and capacity of progression still from the most wonderful piece of all architecture the human skeleton to this simple one107 the ploughshare on which it depends for its subsistence the putting of two or more pieces together is curiously necessary to the perfectness of every fine instrument and the peculiar mechanical work of d√¶dalusinlayingbecomes all the more delightful to us in external aspect because as in the jawbone of a saurian or the wood of a bow it is essential to the finest capacities of tension and resistance  5 and observe how unbroken the ascent from this the simplest architecture to the loftiest the placing of the timbers in a ships stem and the laying of the stones in a bridge buttress are similar in art to the construction of the ploughshare differing in no essential point either in that they deal with other materials or because of the three things produced one has to divide earth by advancing through it another to divide water by advancing through it and the third to divide water which advances against it and again the buttress of a bridge differs only from that of a cathedral in having less weight to sustain and more to resist we can find no term in the gradation from the ploughshare to the cathedral buttress at which we can set a logical distinction  6 thus then we have simply three divisions of artone that of giving colours to substance another that of giving form to it without question of resistance to force and the third that of giving form or position which will make it capable of such resistance all the fine arts are embraced under these three divisions do not think that it is only a logical or scientific affectation to mass them together in this manner it is on the contrary of the first practical importance to understand that the painters faculty or masterhood over colour being as subtle as a musicians over sound must be looked to for the government of every operation in which colour is employed and that in the same manner the appliance of any art whatsoever to minor objects cannot be right unless under the direction of a true master of that art under the present system you keep your academician occupied only in producing tinted pieces of canvas to be shown in frames and smooth pieces of marble to be placed in niches while you expect your builder or constructor to design coloured patterns in stone and brick and your chinaware merchant to keep a separate body of workwomen who can paint china but nothing else by this division of labour you ruin all the arts at once the work of the academician becomes mean and effeminate because he is not used to treat colour on a grand scale and in rough materials and your manufactures become base because no well educated person sets hand to them and therefore it is necessary to understand not merely as a logical statement but as a practical necessity that wherever beautiful colour is to be arranged you need a master of painting and wherever noble form is to be given a master of sculpture and wherever complex mechanical force is to be resisted a master of architecture  7 but over this triple division there must rule another yet more important any of these three arts may be either imitative of natural objects or limited to useful appliance you may either paint a picture that represents a scene or your street door to keep it from rotting you may mould a statue or a plate build the resemblance of a cluster of lotus stalks or only a square pier generally speaking painting and sculpture will be imitative and architecture merely useful but there is a great deal of sculptureas this crystal ball108 for instance which is not imitative and a great deal of architecture which to some extent is so as the so called foils of gothic apertures and for many other reasons you will find it necessary to keep distinction clear in your minds between the artsof whatever kindwhich are imitative and produce a resemblance or image of something which is not present and those which are limited to the production of some useful reality as the blade of a knife or the wall of a house you will perceive also as we advance that sculpture and painting are indeed in this respect only one art and that we shall have constantly to speak and think of them as simply graphic whether with chisel or colour their principal function being to make us in the words of aristotle greek the√¥r√™tikoi tou peri ta s√¥mata kallous polit 8 3 having capacity and habit of contemplation of the beauty that is in material things while architecture and its corelative arts are to be practised under quite other conditions of sentiment  8 now it is obvious that so far as the fine arts consist either in imitation or mechanical construction the right judgment of them must depend on our knowledge of the things they imitate and forces they resist and my function of teaching here would for instance so far resolve itself either into demonstration that this painting of a peach109 does resemble a peach or explanation of the way in which this ploughshare for instance is shaped so as to throw the earth aside with least force of thrust and in both of these methods of study though of course your own diligence must be your chief master to a certain extent your professor of art can always guide you securely and can show you either that the image does truly resemble what it attempts to resemble or that the structure is rightly prepared for the service it has to perform but there is yet another virtue of fine art which is perhaps exactly that about which you will expect your professor to teach you most and which on the contrary is exactly that about which you must teach yourselves all that it is essential to learn  9 i have here in my hand one of the simplest possible examples of the union of the graphic and constructive powersone of my breakfast plates since all the finely architectural arts we said began in the shaping of the cup and the platter we will begin ourselves with the platter  why has it been made round for two structural reasons first that the greatest holding surface may be gathered into the smallest space and secondly that in being pushed past other things on the table it may come into least contact with them  illustration fig 1  next why has it a rim for two other structural reasons first that it is convenient to put salt or mustard upon but secondly and chiefly that the plate may be easily laid hold of the rim is the simplest form of continuous handle  farther to keep it from soiling the cloth it will be wise to put this ridge beneath round the bottom for as the rim is the simplest possible form of continuous handle so this is the simplest form of continuous leg and we get the section given beneath the figure for the essential one of a rightly made platter  10 thus far our art has been strictly utilitarian having respect to conditions of collision of carriage and of support but now on the surface of our piece of pottery here are various bands and spots of colour which are presumably set there to make it pleasanter to the eye six of the spots seen closely you discover are intended to represent flowers these then have as distinctly a graphic purpose as the other properties of the plate have an architectural one and the first critical question we have to ask about them is whether they are like roses or not i will anticipate what i have to say in subsequent lectures so far as to assure you that if they are to be like roses at all the liker they can be the better do not suppose as many people will tell you that because this is a common manufactured article your roses on it are the better for being illpainted or halfpainted if they had been painted by the same hand that did this peach the plate would have been all the better for it but as it chanced there was no hand such as william hunts to paint them and their graphic power is not distinguished in any case however that graphic power must have been subordinate to their effect as pink spots while the band of greenblue round the plates edge and the spots of gold pretend to no graphic power at all but are meaningless spaces of colour or metal still less have they any mechanical office they add nowise to the serviceableness of the plate and their agreeableness if they possess any depends therefore neither on any imitative nor any structural character but on some inherent pleasantness in themselves either of mere colours to the eye as of taste to the tongue or in the placing of those colours in relations which obey some mental principle of order or physical principle of harmony  11 these abstract relations and inherent pleasantnesses whether in space number or time and whether of colours or sounds form what we may properly term the musical or harmonic element in every art and the study of them is an entirely separate science it is the branch of artphilosophy to which the word √¶sthetics should be strictly limited being the inquiry into the nature of things that in themselves are pleasant to the human senses or instincts though they represent nothing and serve for nothing their only service being their pleasantness thus it is the province of √¶sthetics to tell you if you did not know it before that the taste and colour of a peach are pleasant and to ascertain if it be ascertainable and you have any curiosity to know why they are so  12 the information would i presume to most of you be gratuitous if it were not and you chanced to be in a sick state of body in which you disliked peaches it would be for the time to you false information and so far as it was true of other people to you useless nearly the whole study of √¶sthetics is in like manner either gratuitous or useless either you like the right things without being recommended to do so or if you dislike them your mind cannot be changed by lectures on the laws of taste you recollect the story of thackeray provoked as he was helping himself to strawberries by a young coxcombs telling him that he never took fruit or sweets that replied or is said to have replied thackeray is because you are a sot and a glutton and the whole science of √¶sthetics is in the depth of it expressed by one passage of goethes in the end of the 2nd part of faustthe notable one that follows the song of the lemures when the angels enter to dispute with the fiends for the soul of faust they enter singingpardon to sinners and life to the dust mephistopheles hears them first and exclaims to his troop discord i hear and filthy jinglingmist√∂ne h√∂re ich garstiges geklimper this you see is the extreme of bad taste in music presently the angelic host begin strewing roses which discomfits the diabolic crowd altogether mephistopheles in vain calls to themwhat do you duck and shrink foris that proper hellish behaviour stand fast and let them strewwas duckt und zuckt ihr ist das hellenbrauch so haltet stand und lasst sie streuen there you have also the extreme of bad taste in sight and smell and in the whole passage is a brief embodiment for you of the ultimate fact that all √¶sthetics depend on the health of soul and body and the proper exercise of both not only through years but generations only by harmony of both collateral and successive lives can the great doctrine of the muses be received which enables men greek chairein orth√¥s to have pleasures rightly and there is no other definition of the beautiful nor of any subject of delight to the √¶sthetic faculty than that it is what one noble spirit has created seen and felt by another of similar or equal nobility so much as there is in you of ox or of swine perceives no beauty and creates none what is human in you in exact proportion to the perfectness of its humanity can create it and receive  13 returning now to the very elementary form in which the appeal to our √¶sthetic virtue is made in our breakfastplate you notice that there are two distinct kinds of pleasantness attempted one by hues of colour the other by proportions of space i have called these the musical elements of the arts relating to sight and there are indeed two complete sciences one of the combinations of colour and the other of the combinations of line and form which might each of them separately engage us in as intricate study as that of the science of music but of the two the science of colour is in the greek sense the more musical being one of the divisions of the apolline power and it is so practically educational that if we are not using the faculty for colour to discipline nations they will infallibly use it themselves as a means of corruption both music and colour are naturally influences of peace but in the war trumpet and the war shield in the battle song and battle standard they have concentrated by beautiful imagination the cruel passions of men and there is nothing in all the divina commedia of history more grotesque yet more frightful than the fact that from the almost fabulous period when the insanity and impiety of war wrote themselves in the symbols of the shields of the seven against thebes colours have been the sign and stimulus of the most furious and fatal passions that have rent the nations blue against green in the decline of the roman empire black against white in that of florence red against white in the wars of the royal houses in england and at this moment red against white in the contest of anarchy and loyalty in all the world  14 on the other hand the directly ethical influence of colour in the sky the trees flowers and coloured creatures round us and in our own various arts massed under the one name of painting is so essential and constant that we cease to recognize it because we are never long enough altogether deprived of it to feel our need and the mental diseases induced by the influence of corrupt colour are as little suspected or traced to their true source as the bodily weaknesses resulting from atmospheric miasmata  15 the second musical science which belongs peculiarly to sculpture and to painting so far as it represents form consists in the disposition of beautiful masses that is to say beautiful surfaces limited by beautiful lines beautiful surfaces observe and remember what is noted in my fourth lecture of the difference between a space and a mass if you have at any time examined carefully or practised from the drawings of shells placed in your copying series you cannot but have felt the difference in the grace between the aspects of the same line when enclosing a rounded or unrounded space the exact science of sculpture is that of the relations between outline and the solid form it limits and it does not matter whether that relation be indicated by drawing or carving so long as the expression of solid form is the mental purpose it is the science always of the beauty of relation in three dimensions to take the simplest possible line of continuous limitthe circle the flat disc enclosed by it may indeed be made an element of decoration though a very meagre one but its relative mass the ball being gradated in three dimensions is always delightful here110 is at once the simplest and in mere patient mechanism the most skilful piece of sculpture i can possibly show youa piece of the purest rockcrystal chiselled i believe by mere toil of hand into a perfect sphere imitating nothing constructing nothing sculpture for sculptures sake of purest natural substance into simplest primary form  16 again out of the nacre of any mussel or oystershell you might cut at your pleasure any quantity of small flat circular discs of the prettiest colour and lustre to some extent such tinsel or foil of shell is used pleasantly for decoration but the mussel or oyster becoming itself an unwilling modeller agglutinates its juice into three dimensions and the fact of the surface being now geometrically gradated together with the savage instinct of attributing value to what is difficult to obtain make the little boss so precious in mens sight that wise eagerness of search for the kingdom of heaven can be likened to their eagerness of search for it and the gates of paradise can be no otherwise rendered so fair to their poor intelligence as by telling them that every several gate was of one pearl  17 but take note here we have just seen that the sum of the perceptive faculty is expressed in those words of aristotles to take pleasure rightly or straightlygreek chairein orth√¥s now it is not possible to do the direct opposite of thatto take pleasure iniquitously or obliquelygreek chairein adik√¥s or greek skoli√¥smore than you do in enjoying a thing because your neighbour cannot get it you may enjoy a thing legitimately because it is rare and cannot be seen often as you do a fine aurora or a sunset or an unusually lovely flower that is natures way of stimulating your attention but if you enjoy it because your neighbour cannot have itand remember all value attached to pearls more than glass beads is merely and purely for that causethen you rejoice through the worst of idolatries covetousness and neither arithmetic nor writing nor any other socalled essential of education is now so vitally necessary to the population of europe as such acquaintance with the principles of intrinsic value as may result in the iconoclasm of jewellery and in the clear understanding that we are not in that instinct civilized but yet remain wholly savage so far as we care for display of this selfish kind  you think perhaps i am quitting my subject and proceeding as it is too often with appearance of justice alleged against me into irrelevant matter pardon me the end not only of these lectures but of my whole professorship would be accomplishedand far more than thatif only the english nation could be made to understand that the beauty which is indeed to be a joy for ever must be a joy for all and that though the idolatry may not have been wholly divine which sculptured gods the idolatry is wholly diabolic which for vulgar display sculptures diamonds  18 to go back to the point under discussion a pearl or a glass bead may owe its pleasantness in some degree to its lustre as well as to its roundness but a mere and simple ball of unpolished stone is enough for sculpturesque value you may have noticed that the quatrefoil used in the ducal palace of venice owes its complete loveliness in distant effect to the finishing of its cusps the extremity of the cusp is a mere ball of istrian marble and consider how subtle the faculty of sight must be since it recognizes at any distance and is gratified by the mystery of the termination of cusp obtained by the gradated light on the ball  in that venetian tracery this simplest element of sculptured form is used sparingly as the most precious that can be employed to finish the fa√ßade but alike in our own and the french central gothic the ballflower is lavished on every lineand in your st marys spire and the salisbury spire and the towers of notre dame of paris the rich pleasantness of decorationindeed their socalled decorated styleconsists only in being daintily beset with stone balls it is true the balls are modified into dim likeness of flowers but do you trace the resemblance to the rose in their distant which is their intended effect  19 but farther let the ball have motion then the form it generates will be that of a cylinder you have perhaps thought that pure early english architecture depended for its charm on visibility of construction it depends for its charm altogether on the abstract harmony of groups of cylinders111 arbitrarily bent into mouldings and arbitrarily associated as shafts having no real relation to construction whatsoever and a theoretical relation so subtle that none of us had seen it till professor willis worked it out for us  20 and now proceeding to analysis of higher sculpture you may have observed the importance i have attached to the porch of san zenone at verona by making it among your standards the first of the group which is to illustrate the system of sculpture and architecture founded on faith in a future life that porch fortunately represented in the photograph from which plate i has been engraved under a clear and pleasant light furnishes you with examples of sculpture of every kind from the flattest incised basrelief to solid statues both in marble and bronze and the two points i have been pressing upon you are conclusively exhibited here namely1 that sculpture is essentially the production of a pleasant bossiness or roundness of surface 2 that the pleasantness of that bossy condition to the eye is irrespective of imitation on one side and of structure on the other  21 1 sculpture is essentially the production of a pleasant bossiness or roundness of surface  if you look from some distance at these two engravings of greek coins place the book open so that you can see the opposite plate three or four yards off you will find the relief on each of them simplifies itself into a pearllike portion of a sphere with exquisitely gradated light on its surface when you look at them nearer you will see that each smaller portion into which they are dividedcheek or brow or leaf or tress of hairresolves itself also into a rounded or undulated surface pleasant by gradation of light every several surface is delightful in itself as a shell or a tuft of rounded moss or the bossy masses of distant forest would be that these intricately modulated masses present some resemblance to a girls face such as the syracusans imagined that of the watergoddess arethusa is entirely a secondary matter the primary condition is that the masses shall be beautifully rounded and disposed with due discretion and order  illustration plate iporch of san zenone verona  22 2 it is difficult for you at first to feel this order and beauty of surface apart from the imitation but you can see there is a pretty disposition of and relation between the projections of a fircone though the studded spiral imitates nothing order exactly the same in kind only much more complex and an abstract beauty of surface rendered definite by increase and decline of lightfor every curve of surface has its own luminous law and the light and shade on a parabolic solid differs specifically from that on an elliptical or spherical oneit is the essential business of the sculptor to obtain as it is the essential business of a painter to get good colour whether he imitates anything or not at a distance from the picture or carving where the things represented become absolutely unintelligible we must yet be able to say at a glance that is good painting or good carving  and you will be surprised to find when you try the experiment how much the eye must instinctively judge in this manner take the front of san zenone for instance plate i you will find it impossible without a lens to distinguish in the bronze gates and in great part of the wall anything that their bosses represent you cannot tell whether the sculpture is of men animals or trees only you feel it to be composed of pleasant projecting masses you acknowledge that both gates and wall are somehow delightfully roughened and only afterwards by slow degrees can you make out what this roughness means nay though here plate iii i magnify112 one of the bronze plates of the gate to a scale which gives you the same advantage as if you saw it quite close in the realityyou may still be obliged to me for the information that this boss represents the madonna asleep in her little bed and this smaller boss the infant christ in his and this at the top a cloud with an angel coming out of it and these jagged bosses two of the three kings with their crowns on looking up to the star which is intelligible enough i admit but what this straggling threelegged boss beneath signifies i suppose neither you nor i can tell unless it be the shepherds dog who has come suddenly upon the kings with their crowns on and is greatly startled at them  23 farther and much more definitely the pleasantness of the surface decoration is independent of structure that is to say of any architectural requirement of stability the greater part of the sculpture here is exclusively ornamentation of a flat wall or of door panelling only a small portion of the church front is thus treated and the sculpture has no more to do with the form of the building than a piece of a lace veil would have suspended beside its gates on a festal day the proportions of shaft and arch might be altered in a hundred different ways without diminishing their stability and the pillars would stand more safely on the ground than on the backs of these carved animals  24 i wish you especially to notice these points because the false theory that ornamentation should be merely decorated structure is so pretty and plausible that it is likely to take away your attention from the far more important abstract conditions of design structure should never be contradicted and in the best buildings it is pleasantly exhibited and enforced in this very porch the joints of every stone are visible and you will find me in the fifth lecture insisting on this clearness of its anatomy as a merit yet so independent is the mechanical structure of the true design that when i begin my lectures on architecture the first building i shall give you as a standard will be one in which the structure is wholly concealed it will be the baptistry of florence which is in reality as much a buttressed chapel with a vaulted roof as the chapter house of yorkbut round it in order to conceal that buttressed structure not to decorate observe but to conceal a flat external wall is raised simplifying the whole to a mere hexagonal box like a wooden piece of tunbridge ware on the surface of which the eye and intellect are to be interested by the relations of dimension and curve between pieces of encrusting marble of different colours which have no more to do with the real make of the building than the diaper of a harlequins jacket has to do with his bones  illustration plate iithe arethusa of syracuse  illustration plate iiithe warning to the kings  san zenone verona  25 the sense of abstract proportion on which the enjoyment of such a piece of art entirely depends is one of the √¶sthetic faculties which nothing can develop but time and education it belongs only to highlytrained nations and among them to their most strictly refined classes though the germs of it are found as part of their innate power in every people capable of art it has for the most part vanished at present from the english mind in consequence of our eager desire for excitement and for the kind of splendour that exhibits wealth careless of dignity so that i suppose there are very few now even of our besttrained londoners who know the difference between the design of whitehall and that of any modern clubhouse in pallmall the order and harmony which in his enthusiastic account of the theatre of epidaurus pausanias insists on before beauty can only be recognized by stern order and harmony in our daily lives and the perception of them is as little to be compelled or taught suddenly as the laws of still finer choice in the conception of dramatic incident which regulate poetic sculpture  26 and now at last i think we can sketch out the subject before us in a clear light we have a structural art divine and human of which the investigation comes under the general term anatomy whether the junctions or joints be in mountains or in branches of trees or in buildings or in bones of animals we have next a musical art falling into two distinct divisionsone using colours the other masses for its elements of composition lastly we have an imitative art concerned with the representation of the outward appearances of things and for many reasons i think it best to begin with imitative sculpture that being defined as the art which by the musical disposition of masses imitates anything of which the imitation is justly pleasant to us and does so in accordance with structural laws having due reference to the materials employed  so that you see our task will involve the immediate inquiry what the things are of which the imitation is justly pleasant to us what in few wordsif we are to be occupied in the making of graven imageswe ought to like to make images of secondly after having determined its subject what degree of imitation or likeness we ought to desire in our graven image and lastly under what limitations demanded by structure and material such likeness may be obtained  these inquiries i shall endeavour to pursue with you to some practical conclusion in my next four lectures and in the sixth i will briefly sketch the actual facts that have taken place in the development of sculpture by the two greatest schools of it that hitherto have existed in the world  27 the tenor of our next lecture then must be an inquiry into the real nature of idolatry that is to say the invention and service of idols and in the interval may i commend to your own thoughts this question not wholly irrelevant yet which i cannot pursue namely whether the god to whom we have so habitually prayed for deliverance from battle murder and sudden death is indeed seeing that the present state of christendom is the result of a thousand years praying to that effect as the gods of the heathen who were but idols or whetherand observe one or other of these things must be truewhether our prayers to him have been by this much worse than idolatrythat heathen prayer was true prayer to false gods and our prayers have been false prayers to the true one  footnotes  107 i had a real ploughshare on my lecture table but it would interrupt the drift of the statements in the text too long if i attempted here to illustrate by figures the relation of the coulter to the share and of the hard to the soft pieces of metal in the share itself  108 a sphere of rock crystal cut in japan enough imaginable by the reader without a figure  109 one of william hunts peaches not i am afraid imaginable altogether but still less representable by figure  110 the crystal ball above mentioned  111 all grandest effects in mouldings may be and for the most part have been obtained by rolls and cavettos of circular segmental section more refined sections as that of the fluting of a doric shaft are only of use near the eye and in beautiful stone and the pursuit of them was one of the many errors of later gothic the statement in the text that the mouldings even of best time have no real relation to construction is scarcely strong enough they in fact contend with and deny the construction their principal purpose seeming to be the concealment of the joints of the voussoirs  112 some of the most precious work done for me by my assistant mr burgess during the course of these lectures consisted in making enlarged drawings from portions of photographs plate iii is engraved from a drawing of his enlarged from the original photograph of which plate i is a reduction     lecture ii  idolatry  november 1870   28 beginning with the simple conception of sculpture as the art of fiction in solid substance we are now to consider what its subjects should be whathaving the gift of imageryshould we by preference endeavour to image a question which is indeed subordinate to the deeper onewhy we should wish to image anything at all  29 some years ago having been always desirous that the education of women should begin in learning how to cook i got leave one day for a little girl of eleven years old to exchange much to her satisfaction her schoolroom for the kitchen but as ill fortune would have it there was some pastry toward and she was left unadvisedly in command of some delicately rolled paste whereof she made no pies but an unlimited quantity of cats and mice  now you may read the works of the gravest critics of art from end to end but you will find at last they can give you no other true account of the spirit of sculpture than that it is an irresistible human instinct for the making of cats and mice and other imitable living creatures in such permanent form that one may play with the images at leisure  play with them or love them or fear them or worship them the cat may become the goddess pasht and the mouse in the hand of the sculptured king enforce his enduring words greek es eme tis ore√¥n euseb√™s est√¥ but the great mimetic instinct underlies all such purpose and is zooplasticlifeshapingalike in the reverent and the impious  30 is i say and has been hitherto none of us dare say that it will be i shall have to show you hereafter that the greater part of the technic energy of men as yet has indicated a kind of childhood and that the race becomes if not more wise at least more manly113 with every gained century i can fancy that all this sculpturing and painting of ours may be looked back upon in some distant time as a kind of dollmaking and that the words of sir isaac newton may be smiled at no more only it will not be for stars that we desert our stone dolls but for men when the day comes as come it must in which we no more deface and defile gods image in living clay i am not sure that we shall any of us care so much for the images made of him in burnt clay  31 but hitherto the energy of growth in any people may be almost directly measured by their passion for imitative art namely for sculpture or for the drama which is living and speaking sculpture or as in greece for both and in national as in actual childhood it is not merely the making but the makingbelieve not merely the acting for the sake of the scene but acting for the sake of acting that is delightful and of the two mimetic arts the drama being more passionate and involving conditions of greater excitement and luxury is usually in its excellence the sign of culminating strength in the people while fine sculpture requiring always submission to severe law is an unfailing proof of their being in early and active progress there is no instance of fine sculpture being produced by a nation either torpid weak or in decadence their drama may gain in grace and wit but their sculpture in days of decline is always base  32 if my little lady in the kitchen had been put in command of colours as well as of dough and if the paste would have taken the colours we may be sure her mice would have been painted brown and her cats tortoiseshell and this partly indeed for the added delight and prettiness of colour itself but more for the sake of absolute realization to her eyes and mind now all the early sculpture of the most accomplished nations has been thus coloured rudely or finely and therefore you see at once how necessary it is that we should keep the term graphic for imitative art generally since no separation can at first be made between carving and painting with reference to the mental powers exerted in or addressed by them in the earliest known art of the world a reindeer hunt may be scratched in outline on the flat side of a cleanpicked bone and a reindeers head carved out of the end of it both these are flintknife work and strictly speaking sculpture but the scratched outline is the beginning of drawing and the carved head of sculpture proper when the spaces enclosed by the scratched outline are filled with colour the colouring soon becomes a principal means of effect so that in the engraving of an egyptiancolour basrelief s 101 rosellini has been content to miss the outlining incisions altogether and represent it as a painting only its proper definition is painting accented by sculpture on the other hand in solid coloured statuesdresden china figures for examplewe have pretty sculpture accented by painting the mental purpose in both kinds of art being to obtain the utmost degree of realization possible and the ocular impression being the same whether the delineation is obtained by engraving or painting for as i pointed out to you in my fifth lecture everything is seen by the eye as patches of colour and of colour only a fact which the greeks knew well so that when it becomes a question in the dialogue of minos greek tini onti t√™ opsei horatai ta ho√¥mena the answer is greek aisth√™sei taut√™ t√™ dia t√¥n ophthalm√¥n d√™lois√™ h√™min ta chr√¥matawhat kind of power is the sight with which we see things it is that sense which through the eyes can reveal colours to us  33 and now observe that while the graphic arts begin in the mere mimetic effort they proceed as they obtain more perfect realization to act under the influence of a stronger and higher instinct they begin by scratching the reindeer the most interesting object of sight but presently as the human creature rises in scale of intellect it proceeds to scratch not the most interesting object of sight only but the most interesting object of imagination not the reindeer but the maker and giver of the reindeer and the second great condition for the advance of the art of sculpture is that the race should possess in addition to the mimetic instinct the realistic or idolizing instinct the desire to see as substantial the powers that are unseen and bring near those that are far off and to possess and cherish those that are strange to make in some way tangible and visible the nature of the godsto illustrate and explain it by symbols to bring the immortals out of the recesses of the clouds and make them penates to bring back the dead from darkness and make them lares  34 our conception of this tremendous and universal human passion has been altogether narrowed by the current idea that pagan religious art consisted only or chiefly in giving personality to the gods the personality was never doubted it was visibility interpretation and possession that the hearts of men sought possession

is used in lucians dreamgreek pheidias edeixe ton dia showed114 zeus manifested him nay in a certain sense brought forth or created as you have it in anacreons ode to the rose of the birth of athena

healing115 night a divine dream so clear that it missed nothing of the truth itself yes and still after all this time the shapes of what i saw remain in my sight and the sound of what i heard dwells in my earsnote the lovely sense of greek enaulosthe sound being as of a stream passing always by in the same channelso distinct was everything to me two women laid hold of my hands and pulled me each towards herself so violently that i had like to have been pulled asunder and they cried out against one anotherthe one that she was resolved to have me to herself being indeed her own and the other that it was vain for her to claim what belonged to othersand the one who first claimed me for her own was like a hard worker and had strength as a mans and her hair was dusty and her hand full of horny places and her dress fastened tight about her and the folds of it loaded with white marbledust so that she looked just as my uncle used to look when he was filing stones but the other was pleasant in features and delicate in form and orderly in her dress and so in the end they left it to me to decide after hearing what they had to say with which of them i would go and first the hard featured and masculine one spoke  illustration iv  the nativity of athena  36 dear child i am the art of imagesculpture which yesterday you began to learn and i am as one of your own people and of your house for your grandfather and she named my mothers father was a stonecutter and both your uncles had good name through me and if you will keep yourself well clear of the sillinesses and fluent follies that come from this creature and she pointed to the other woman and will follow me and live with me first of all you shall be brought up as a man should be and have strong shoulders and besides that you shall be kept well quit of all restless desires and you shall never be obliged to go away into any foreign places leaving your own country and the people of your house neither shall all men praise you for your talk116 and you must not despise this rude serviceableness of my body neither this meanness of my dusty dress for pushing on in their strength from such things as these that great phidias revealed zeus and polyclitus wrought out hera and myron was praised and praxiteles marvelled at therefore are these men worshipped with the gods  37 there is a beautiful ambiguity in the use of the preposition with the genitive in this last sentence pushing on from these things means indeed justly that the sculptors rose from a mean state to a noble one but not as leaving the mean statenot as from a hard life attaining to a soft onebut as being helped and strengthened by the rough life to do what was greatest again worshipped with the gods does not mean that they are thought of as in any sense equal to or like to the gods but as being on the side of the gods against what is base and ungodly and that the kind of worth which is in them is therefore indeed worshipful as having its source with the gods finally observe that every one of the expressions used of the four sculptors is definitely the best that lucian could have chosen phidias carved like one who had seen zeus and had only to reveal him polyclitus in labour of intellect completed his sculpture by just law and wrought out hera myron was of all most praised because he did best what pleased the vulgar and praxiteles the most wondered at or admired because he bestowed utmost exquisiteness of beauty  38 i am sorry not to go on with the dream the more refined lady as you may remember is liberal or gentlemanly education and prevails at last so that lucian becomes an author instead of a sculptor i think to his own regret though to our present benefit one more passage of his i must refer you to as illustrative of the point before us the description of the temple of the syrian hieropolis where he explains the absence of the images of the sun and moon in the temple itself he says on the left hand as one goes in there is set first the throne of the sun but no form of him is thereon for of these two powers alone the sun and the moon they show no carved images and i also learned why this is their law for they say that it is permissible indeed to make of the other gods graven images since the forms of them are not visible to all men but helios and selenaia are everywhere clearbright and all men behold them what need is there therefore for sculptured work of these who appear in the air  39 this then is the second instinct necessary to sculpture the desire for the manifestation description and companionship of unknown powers and for possession of a bodily substancethe bronze strasbourg which you can embrace and hang immortelles on the head ofinstead of an abstract idea but if you get nothing more in the depth of the national mind than these two feelings the mimetic and idolizing instincts there may be still no progress possible for the arts except in delicacy of manipulation and accumulative caprice of design you must have not only the idolizing instinct but an greek √™thos which chooses the right thing to idolize else you will get states of art like those in china or india nonprogressive and in great part diseased and frightful being wrought under the influence of foolish terror or foolish admiration so that a third condition completing and confirming both the others must exist in order to the development of the creative power  40 this third condition is that the heart of the nation shall be set on the discovery of just or equal law and shall be from day to day developing that law more perfectly the greek school of sculpture is formed during and in consequence of the national effort to discover the nature of justice the tuscan during and in consequence of the national effort to discover the nature of justification i assert to you at present briefly what will i hope be the subject of prolonged illustration hereafter  41 now when a nation with mimetic instinct and imaginative longing is also thus occupied earnestly in the discovery of ethic law that effort gradually brings precision and truth into all its manual acts and the physical progress of sculpture as in the greek so in the tuscan school consists in gradually limiting what was before indefinite in verifying what was inaccurate and in humanizing what was monstrous i might perhaps content you by showing these external phenomena and by dwelling simply on the increasing desire of naturalness which compels in every successive decade of years literally in the sculptured images the mimicked bones to come together bone to his bone and the flesh to come up upon them until from a flattened and pinched handful of clay respecting which you may gravely question whether it was intended for a human form at allby slow degrees and added touch to touch in increasing consciousness of the bodily truthat last the aphrodite of melos stands before you a perfect woman but all that search for physical accuracy is merely the external operation in the arts of the seeking for truth in the inner soul it is impossible without that higher effort and the demonstration of it would be worse than useless to you unless i made you aware at the same time of its spiritual cause  42 observe farther the increasing truth in representation is corelative with increasing beauty in the thing to be represented the pursuit of justice which regulates the imitative effort regulates also the development of the race into dignity of person as of mind and their culminating artskill attains the grasp of entire truth at the moment when the truth becomes most lovely and then ideal sculpture may go on safely into portraiture but i shall not touch on the subject of portrait sculpture today it introduces many questions of detail and must be a matter for subsequent consideration  43 these then are the three great passions which are concerned in true sculpture i cannot find better or at least more easily remembered names for them than the instincts of mimicry idolatry and discipline meaning by the last the desire of equity and wholesome restraint in all acts and works of life now of these there is no question but that the love of mimicry is natural and right and the love of discipline is natural and right but it looks a grave question whether the yearning for idolatry the desire of companionship with images is right whether indeed if such an instinct be essential to good sculpture the art founded on it can possibly be fine art  44 i must now beg for your close attention because i have to point out distinctions in modes of conception which will appear trivial to you unless accurately understood but of an importance in the history of art which cannot be overrated  when the populace of paris adorned the statue of strasbourg with immortelles none even the simplest of the pious decorators would suppose that the city of strasbourg itself or any spirit or ghost of the city was actually there sitting in the place de la concorde the figure was delightful to them as a visible nucleus for their fond thoughts about strasbourg but never for a moment supposed to be strasbourg  similarly they might have taken delight in a statue purporting to represent a river instead of a citythe rhine or garonne supposeand have been touched with strong emotion in looking at it if the real river were dear to them and yet never think for an instant that the statue was the river  and yet again similarly but much more distinctly they might take delight in the beautiful image of a god because it gathered and perpetuated their thoughts about that god and yet never suppose nor be capable of being deceived by any arguments into supposing that the statue was the god  on the other hand if a meteoric stone fell from the sky in the sight of a savage and he picked it up hot he would most probably lay it aside in some to him sacred place and believe the stone itself to be a kind of god and offer prayer and sacrifice to it  in like manner any other strange or terrifying object such for instance as a powerfully noxious animal or plant he would be apt to regard in the same way and very possibly also construct for himself frightful idols of some kind calculated to produce upon him a vague impression of their being alive whose imaginary anger he might deprecate or avert with sacrifice although incapable of conceiving in them any one attribute of exalted intellectual or moral nature  45 if you will now refer to ¬ß 5259 of my introductory lectures you will find this distinction between a resolute conception recognized for such and an involuntary apprehension of spiritual existence already insisted on at some length and you will see more and more clearly as we proceed that the deliberate and intellectually commanded conception is not idolatrous in any evil sense whatever but is one of the grandest and wholesomest functions of the human soul and that the essence of evil idolatry begins only in the idea or belief of a real presence of any kind in a thing in which there is no such presence  46 i need not say that the harm of the idolatry must depend on the certainty of the negative if there be a real presence in a pillar of cloud in an unconsuming flame or in a still small voice it is no sin to bow down before these  but as matter of historical fact the idea of such presence has generally been both ignoble and false and confined to nations of inferior race who are often condemned to remain for ages in conditions of vile terror destitute of thought nearly all indian architecture and chinese design arise out of such a state so also though in a less gross degree ninevite and phoenician art early irish and scandinavian the latter however with vital elements of high intellect mingled in it from the first  but the greatest races are never grossly subject to such terror even in their childhood and the course of their minds is broadly divisible into three distinct stages  47 i in their infancy they begin to imitate the real animals about them as my little girl made the cats and mice but with an undercurrent of partial superstitiona sense that there must be more in the creatures than they can see also they catch up vividly any of the fancies of the baser nations round them and repeat these more or less apishly yet rapidly naturalizing and beautifying them they then connect all kinds of shapes together compounding meanings out of the old chimeras and inventing new ones with the speed of a running wildfire but always getting more of man into their images and admitting less of monster or brute their own characters meanwhile expanding and purging themselves and shaking off the feverish fancy as springing flowers shake the earth off their stalks  48 ii in the second stage being now themselves perfect men and women they reach the conception of true and great gods as existent in the universe and absolutely cease to think of them as in any wise present in statues or images but they have now learned to make these statues beautifully human and to surround them with attributes that may concentrate their thoughts of the gods this is in greece accurately the pindaric time just a little preceding the phidian the phidian is already dimmed with a faint shadow of infidelity still the olympic zeus may be taken as a sufficiently central type of a statue which was no more supposed to be zeus than the gold or elephants tusks it was made of but in which the most splendid powers of human art were exhausted in representing a believed and honoured god to the happy and holy imagination of a sincerely religious people  49 iii the third stage of national existence follows in which the imagination having now done its utmost and being partly restrained by the sanctities of tradition which permit no farther change in the conceptions previously created begins to be superseded by logical deduction and scientific investigation at the same moment the elder artists having done all that is possible in realizing the national conceptions of the gods the younger ones forbidden to change the scheme of existing representations and incapable of doing anything better in that kind betake themselves to refine and decorate the old ideas with more attractive skill their aims are thus more and more limited to manual dexterity and their fancy paralyzed also in the course of centuries the methods of every art continually improving and being made subjects of popular inquiry praise is now to be got for eminence in these from the whole mob of the nation whereas intellectual design can never be discerned but by the few so that in this third √¶ra we find every kind of imitative and vulgar dexterity more and more cultivated while design and imagination are every day less cared for and less possible  50 meanwhile as i have just said the leading minds in literature and science become continually more logical and investigative and once that they are established in the habit of testing facts accurately a very few years are enough to convince all the strongest thinkers that the old imaginative religion is untenable and cannot any longer be honestly taught in its fixed traditional form except by ignorant persons and at this point the fate of the people absolutely depends on the degree of moral strength into which their hearts have been already trained if it be a strong industrious chaste and honest race the taking its old gods or at least the old forms of them away from it will indeed make it deeply sorrowful and amazed but will in no whit shake its will nor alter its practice exceptional persons naturally disposed to become drunkards harlots and cheats but who had been previously restrained from indulging these dispositions by their fear of god will of course break out into open vice when that fear is removed but the heads of the families of the people instructed in the pure habits and perfect delights of an honest life and to whom the thought of a father in heaven had been a comfort not a restraint will assuredly not seek relief from the discomfort of their orphanage by becoming uncharitable and vile also the high leaders of their thought gather their whole strength together in the gloom and at the first entrance of this valley of the shadow of death look their new enemy full in the eyeless face of him and subdue him and his terror under their feet metus omnes et inexorabile fatum strepitumque acherontis avari this is the condition of national soul expressed by the art and the words of holbein durer shakspeare pope and goethe  51 but if the people at the moment when the trial of darkness approaches be not confirmed in moral character but are only maintaining a superficial virtue by the aid of a spectral religion the moment the staff of their faith is broken the character of the race falls like a climbing plant cut from its hold then all the earthliest vices attack it as it lies in the dust every form of sensual and insane sin is developed and half a century is sometimes enough to close in hopeless shame the career of the nation in literature art and war  52 notably within the last hundred years all religion has perished from the practically active national mind of france and england no statesman in the senate of either country would dare to use a sentence out of their acceptedly divine revelation as having now a literal authority over them for their guidance or even a suggestive wisdom for their contemplation england especially has cast her bible full in the face of her former god and proclaimed with open challenge to him her resolved worship of his declared enemy mammon all the arts therefore founded on religion and sculpture chiefly are here in england effete and corrupt to a degree which arts never were hitherto in the history of mankind and it is possible to show you the condition of sculpture living and sculpture dead in accurate opposition by simply comparing the nascent pisan school in italy with the existing school in england  53 you were perhaps surprised at my placing in your educational series as a type of original italian sculpture the pulpit by niccola pisano in the duomo of siena i would rather had it been possible have given the pulpit by giovanni pisano in the duomo of pisa but that pulpit is dispersed in fragments through the upper galleries of the duomo and the cloister of the campo santo and the casts of its fragments now put together at kensington are too coarse to be of use to you you may partly judge however of the method of their execution by the eagles head which i have sketched from the marble in the campo santo edu no 113 and the lioness with her cubs edu no 103 more carefully studied at siena and i will get you other illustrations in due time meanwhile i want you to compare the main purpose of the cathedral of pisa and its associated bell tower baptistery and holy field with the main purpose of the principal building lately raised for the people of london in these days we indeed desire no cathedrals but we have constructed an enormous and costly edifice which in claiming educational influence over the whole london populace and middle class is verily the metropolitan cathedral of this centurythe crystal palace  54 it was proclaimed at its erection an example of a newly discovered style of architecture greater than any hitherto knownour best popular writers in their enthusiasm describing it as an edifice of fairyland you are nevertheless to observe that this novel production of fairy enchantment is destitute of every kind of sculpture except the bosses produced by the heads of nails and rivets while the duomo of pisa in the wreathen work of its doors in the foliage of its capitals inlaid colour designs of its fa√ßade embossed panels of its baptistery font and figure sculpture of its two pulpits contained the germ of a school of sculpture which was to maintain through a subsequent period of four hundred years the greatest power yet reached by the arts of the world in description of form and expression of thought  55 now it is easy to show you the essential cause of the vast discrepancy in the character of these two buildings  in the vault of the apse of the duomo of pisa was a colossal image of christ in coloured mosaic bearing to the temple as nearly as possible the relation which the statue of athena bore to the parthenon and in the same manner concentrating the imagination of the pisan on the attributes of the god in whom he believed  in precisely the same position with respect to the nave of the building but of larger size as proportioned to the three or four times greater scale of the whole a colossal piece of sculpture was placed by english designers at the extremity of the crystal palace in preparation for their solemnities in honour of the birthday of christ in december 1867 or 1868  that piece of sculpture was the face of the clown in a pantomime some twelve feet high from brow to chin which face being moved by the mechanism which is our pride every half minute opened its mouth from ear to ear showed its teeth and revolved its eyes the force of these periodical seasons of expression being increased and explained by the illuminated inscription underneath here we are again  56 when it is assumed and with too good reason that the mind of the english populace is to be addressed in the principal sacred festival of its year by sculpture such as this i need scarcely point out to you that the hope is absolutely futile of advancing their intelligence by collecting within this building itself devoid absolutely of every kind of art and so vilely constructed that those who traverse it are continually in danger of falling over the crossbars that bind it together examples of sculpture filched indiscriminately from the past work bad and good of turks greeks romans moors and christians miscoloured misplaced and misinterpreted117 here thrust into unseemly corners and there mortised together into mere confusion of heterogeneous obstacle pronouncing itself hourly more intolerable in weariness until any kind of relief is sought from it in steam wheelbarrows or cheap toyshops and most of all in beer and meat the corks and the bones being dropped through the chinks in the damp deal flooring of the english fairy palace  57 but you will probably think me unjust in assuming that a building prepared only for the amusement of the people can typically represent the architecture or sculpture of modern england you may urge that i ought rather to describe the qualities of the refined sculpture which is executed in large quantities for private persons belonging to the upper classes and for sepulchral and memorial purposes but i could not now criticise that sculpture with any power of conviction to you because i have not yet stated to you the principles of good sculpture in general i will however in some points tell you the facts by anticipation  58 we have much excellent portrait sculpture but portrait sculpture which is nothing more is always thirdrate work even when produced by men of geniusnor does it in the least require men of genius to produce it to paint a portrait indeed implies the very highest gifts of painting but any man of ordinary patience and artistic feeling can carve a satisfactory bust  59 of our powers in historical sculpture i am without question just in taking for sufficient evidence the monuments we have erected to our two greatest heroes by sea and land namely the nelson column and the statue of the duke of wellington opposite apsley house nor will you i hope think me severecertainly whatever you may think me i am using only the most temperate language in saying of both these monuments that they are absolutely devoid of high sculptural merit but consider how much is involved in the fact thus dispassionately stated respecting the two monuments in the principal places of our capital to our two greatest heroes  60 remember that we have before our eyes as subjects of perpetual study and thought the art of all the world for three thousand years past especially we have the best sculpture of greece for example of bodily perfection the best of rome for example of character in portraiture the best of florence for example of romantic passion we have unlimited access to books and other sources of instruction we have the most perfect scientific illustrations of anatomy both human and comparative and we have bribes for the reward of success large in the proportion of at least twenty to one as compared with those offered to the artists of any other period and with all these advantages and the stimulus also of fame carried instantly by the press to the remotest corners of europe the best efforts we can make on the grandest of occasions result in work which it is impossible in any one particular to praise  now consider for yourselves what an intensity of the negation of the faculty of sculpture this implies in the national mind what measures can be assigned to the gulf of incapacity which can deliberately swallow up in the gorge of it the teaching and example of three thousand years and produce as the result of that instruction what it is courteous to call nothing  61 that is the conclusion at which we arrive on the evidence presented by our historical sculpture to complete the measure of ourselves we must endeavour to estimate the rank of the two opposite schools of sculpture employed by us in the nominal service of religion and in the actual service of vice  i am aware of no statue of christ nor of any apostle of christ nor of any scene related in the new testament produced by us within the last three hundred years which has possessed even superficial merit enough to attract public attention  whereas the steadily immoral effect of the formative art which we learn more or less apishly from the french schools and employ but too gladly in manufacturing articles for the amusement of the luxurious classes must be ranked as one of the chief instruments used by joyful fiends and angry fates for the ruin of our civilization  if after i have set before you the nature and principles of true sculpture in athens pisa and florence you reconsider these factswhich you will then at once recognize as suchyou will find that they absolutely justify my assertion that the state of sculpture in modern england as compared with that of the great ancients is literally one of corrupt and dishonourable death as opposed to bright and fameful life  62 and now will you bear with me while i tell you finally why this is so  the cause with which you are personally concerned is your own frivolity though essentially this is not your fault but that of the system of your early training but the fact remains the same that here in oxford you a chosen body of english youth in no wise care for the history of your country for its present dangers or its present duties you still like children of seven or eight years old are interested only in bats balls and oars nay including with you the students of germany and france it is certain that the general body of modern european youth have their minds occupied more seriously by the sculpture and painting of the bowls of their tobaccopipes than by all the divinest workmanship and passionate imagination of greece rome and medi√¶val christendom  63 but the elementary causes both of this frivolity in you and of worse than frivolity in older persons are the two forms of deadly idolatry which are now all but universal in england  the first of these is the worship of the eidolon or phantasm of wealth worship of which you will find the nature partly examined in the 37th paragraph of my munera pulveris but which is briefly to be defined as the servile apprehension of an active power in money and the submission to it as the god of our life  64 the second elementary cause of the loss of our nobly imaginative faculty is the worship of the letter instead of the spirit in what we chiefly accept as the ordinance and teaching of deity and the apprehension of a healing sacredness in the act of reading the book whose primal commands we refuse to obey  no feather idol of polynesia was ever a sign of a more shameful idolatry than the modern notion in the minds of certainly the majority of english religious persons that the word of god by which the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the waterthe word of god which came to the prophets and comes still for ever to all who will hear it and to many who will forbear and which called faithful and true is to lead forth in the judgment the armies of heaventhat this word of god may yet be bound at our pleasure in morocco and carried about in a young ladys pocket with tasselled ribands to mark the passages she most approves of  65 gentlemen there has hitherto been seen no instance and england is little likely to give the unexampled spectacle of a country successful in the noble arts yet in which the youths were frivolous the maidens falsely religious the men slaves of money and the matrons of vanity not from all the marble of the hills of luni will such a people ever shape one statue that may stand nobly against the sky not from all the treasures bequeathed to them by the great dead will they gather for their own descendants any inheritance but shame  footnotes  113 glance forward at once to ¬ß 75 read it and return to this  114 there is a primary and vulgar sense of exhibited in lucians mind but the higher meaning is involved in it  115 in the greek ambrosial recollect always that ambrosia as food of gods is the continual restorer of strength that all food is ambrosial when it nourishes and that the night is called ambrosial because it restores strength to the soul through its peace as in the 23rd psalm the stillness of waters  116 i have italicised this final promise of blessedness given by the noble spirit of workmanship compare carlyles 5th latterday pamphlet throughout but especially pp 1214 in the first edition  117 falsely represented would be the better expression in the cast of the tomb of queen eleanor for a single instance the gothic foliage of which one essential virtue is its change over every shield is represented by a repetition of casts from one mould of which the design itself is entirely conjectural     lecture iii  imagination  november 1870   66 the principal object of the preceding lecture and i choose rather to incur your blame for tediousness in repeating than for obscurity in defining it was to enforce the distinction between the ignoble and false phase of idolatry which consists in the attribution of a spiritual power to a material thing and the noble and truthseeking phase of it to which i shall in these lectures118 give the general term of imaginationthat is to say the invention of material symbols which may lead us to contemplate the character and nature of gods spirits or abstract virtues and powers without in the least implying the actual presence of such beings among us or even their possession in reality of the forms we attribute to them  illustration fig 2  67 for instance in the ordinarily received greek type of athena on vases of the phidian time sufficiently represented in the opposite woodcut no greek would have supposed the vase on which this was painted to be itself athena nor to contain athena inside of it as the arabian fishermans casket contained the genie neither did he think that this rude black painting done at speed as the potters fancy urged his hand represented anything like the form or aspect of the goddess herself nor would he have thought so even had the image been ever so beautifully wrought the goddess might indeed visibly appear under the form of an armed virgin as she might under that of a hawk or a swallow when it pleased her to give such manifestation of her presence but it did not therefore follow that she was constantly invested with any of these forms or that the best which human skill could even by her own aid picture of her was indeed a likeness of her the real use at all events of this rude image was only to signify to the eye and heart the facts of the existence in some manner of a spirit of wisdom perfect in gentleness irresistible in anger having also physical dominion over the air which is the life and breadth of all creatures and clothed to human eyes with √¶gis of fiery cloud and raiment of falling dew  68 in the yet more abstract conception of the spirit of agriculture in which the wings of the chariot represent the winds of spring and its crested dragons are originally a mere type of the seed with its twisted root piercing the ground and sharpedged leaves rising above it we are in still less danger of mistaking the symbol for the presumed form of an actual person but i must with persistence beg of you to observe that in all the noble actions of imagination in this kind the distinction from idolatry consists not in the denial of the being or presence of the spirit but only in the due recognition of our human incapacity to conceive the one or compel the other  illustration fig 3  69 fartherand for this statement i claim your attention still more earnestly as no nation has ever attained real greatness during periods in which it was subject to any condition of idolatry so no nation has ever attained or persevered in greatness except in reaching and maintaining a passionate imagination of a spiritual estate higher than that of men and of spiritual creatures nobler than men having a quite real and personal existence however imperfectly apprehended by us  and all the arts of the present age deserving to be included under the name of sculpture have been degraded by us and all principles of just policy have vanished from usand that totallyfor this double reason that we are on one side given up to idolatries of the most servile kind as i showed you in the close of the last lecturewhile on the other hand we have absolutely ceased from the exercise of faithful imagination and the only remnants of the desire of truth which remain in us have been corrupted into a prurient itch to discover the origin of life in the nature of the dust and prove that the source of the order of the universe is the accidental concurrence of its atoms  70 under these two calamities of our time the art of sculpture has perished more totally than any other because the object of that art is exclusively the representation of form as the exponent of life it is essentially concerned only with the human form which is the exponent of the highest life we know and with all subordinate forms only as they exhibit conditions of vital power which have some certain relation to humanity it deals with the particula undique desecta of the animal nature and itself contemplates and brings forward for its disciples contemplation all the energies of creation which transform the greek p√™los or lower still the greek borboros of the trivia by athenas help into forms of powergreek to men holon architekt√¥n autos √™n syneirgazeto de toi kai √™ ath√™na empneousa ton p√™lon kai empsycha poiousa einai ta plasmata119but it has nothing whatever to do with the representation of forms not living however beautiful as of clouds or waves nor may it condescend to use its perfect skill except in expressing the noblest conditions of life  these laws of sculpture being wholly contrary to the practice of our day i cannot expect you to accept on my assertion nor do i wish you to do so by placing definitely good and bad sculpture before you i do not doubt but that i shall gradually prove to you the nature of all excelling and enduring qualities but today i will only confirm my assertions by laying before you the statement of the greeks themselves on the subject given in their own noblest time and assuredly authoritative in every point which it embraces for all time to come  71 if any of you have looked at the explanation i have given of the myth of athena in my queen of the air you cannot but have been surprised that i took scarcely any note of the story of her birth i did not because that story is connected intimately with the apolline myths and is told of athena not essentially as the goddess of the air but as the goddess of artwisdom  you have probably often smiled at the legend itself or avoided thinking of it as revolting it is indeed one of the most painful and childish of sacred myths yet remember ludicrous and ugly as it seems to us this story satisfied the fancy of the athenian people in their highest state and if it did not satisfyyet it was accepted by all later mythologists you may also remember i told you to be prepared to find that given a certain degree of national intellect the ruder the symbol the deeper would be its purpose and this legend of the birth of athena is the central myth of all that the greeks have left us respecting the power of their arts and in it they have expressed as it seemed good to them the most important things they had to tell us on these matters we may read them wrongly but we must read them here if anywhere  72 there are so many threads to be gathered up in the legend that i cannot hope to put it before you in total clearness but i will take main points athena is born in the island of rhodes and that island is raised out of the sea by apollo after he had been left without inheritance among the gods zeus120 would have cast the lot again but apollo orders the goldengirdled lachesis to stretch out her hands and not now by chance or lot but by noble enchantment the island rises out of the sea  physically this represents the action of heat and light on chaos especially on the deep sea it is the fiat lux of genesis the first process in the conquest of fate by harmony the island is dedicated to the nymph rhodos by whom apollo has the seven sons who teach greek soph√¥tata no√™mata because the rose is the most beautiful organism existing in matter not vital expressive of the direct action of light on the earth giving lovely form and colour at once compare the use of it by dante as the form of the sainted crowd in highest heaven and remember that therefore the rose is in the greek mind essentially a doric flower expressing the worship of light as the iris or ion is an ionic one expressing the worship of the winds and dew  73 to understand the agency of heph√¶stus at the birth of athena we must again return to the founding of the arts on agriculture by the hand before you can cultivate land you must clear it and the characteristic weapon of heph√¶stuswhich is as much his attribute as the trident is of poseidon and the rhabdos of hermes is not as you would have expected the hammer but the clearingaxethe doublededged greek p√©lekys the same that calypso gives ulysses with which to cut down the trees for his home voyage so that both the naval and agricultural strength of the athenians are expressed by this weapon with which they had to hew out their fortune and you must keep in mind this agriculturally laborious character of heph√¶stus even when he is most distinctly the god of serviceable fire thus horaces perfect epithet for him avidus expresses at once the devouring eagerness of fire and the zeal of progressive labour for horace gives it to him when he is fighting against the giants and this rude symbol of his cleaving the forehead of zeus with the axe and giving birth to athena signifies indeed physically the thrilling power of heat in the heavens rending the clouds and giving birth to the blue air but far more deeply it signifies the subduing of adverse fate by true labour until out of the chasm cleft by resolute and industrious fortitude springs the spirit of wisdom  74 here fig 4 is an early drawing of the myth to which i shall have to refer afterwards in illustration of the childishness of the greek mind at the time when its artsymbols were first fixed but it is of peculiar value because the physical character of vulcan as fire is indicated by his wearing the greek endromides of hermes while the antagonism of zeus as the adverse chaos either of cloud or of fate is shown by his striking at heph√¶stus with his thunderbolt but plate iv gives you as far as the light on the rounded vase will allow it to be deciphered a characteristic representation of the scene as conceived in later art  illustration fig 4  75 i told you in a former lecture of this course that the entire greek intellect was in a childish phase as compared to that of modern times observe however childishness does not necessarily imply universal inferiority there may be a vigorous acute pure and solemn childhood and there may be a weak foul and ridiculous condition of advanced life but the one is still essentially the childish and the other the adult phase of existence  76 you will find then that the greeks were the first people that were born into complete humanity all nations before them had been and all around them still were partly savage bestial clayencumbered inhuman still semigoat or semiant or semistone or semicloud but the power of a new spirit came upon the greeks and the stones were filled with breath and the clouds clothed with flesh and then came the great spiritual battle between the centaurs and lapith√¶ and the living creatures became children of men taught yet by the centaursown as they knew in the fangfrom the dappled skin of the brute from the leprous scale of the serpent their flesh came again as the flesh of a little child and they were clean  fix your mind on this as the very central character of the greek racethe being born pure and human out of the brutal misery of the past and looking abroad for the first time with their childrens eyes wonderingly open on the strange and divine world  77 make some effort to remember so far as may be possible to you either what you felt in yourselves when you were young or what you have observed in other children of the action of thought and fancy children are continually represented as living in an ideal world of their own so far as i have myself observed the distinctive character of a child is to live always in the tangible present having little pleasure in memory and being utterly impatient and tormented by anticipation weak alike in reflection and forethought but having an intense possession of the actual present down to the shortest moments and least objects of it possessing it indeed so intensely that the sweet childish days are as long as twenty days will be and setting all the faculties of heart and imagination on little things so as to be able to make anything out of them he chooses confined to a little garden he does not imagine himself somewhere else but makes a great garden out of that possessed of an acorncup he will not despise it and throw it away and covet a golden one in its stead it is the adult who does so the child keeps his acorncup as a treasure and makes a golden one out of it in his mind so that the wondering grownup person standing beside him is always tempted to ask concerning his treasures not what would you have more than these but what possibly can you see in these for to the bystander there is a ludicrous and incomprehensible inconsistency between the childs words and the reality the little thing tells him gravely holding up the acorncup that this is a queens crown or a fairys boat and with beautiful effrontery expects him to believe the same but observethe acorncup must be there and in his own hand give it me then i will make more of it for myself that is the childs one word always  illustration fig 5  78 it is also the one word of the greekgive it me give me any thing definite here in my sight then i will make more of it  illustration plate vtomb of the doges jacopo and lorenzo tiepolo  i cannot easily express to you how strange it seems to me that i am obliged here in oxford to take the position of an apologist for greek art that i find in spite of all the devotion of the admirable scholars who have so long maintained in our public schools the authority of greek literature our younger students take no interest in the manual work of the people upon whose thoughts the tone of their early intellectual life has exclusively depended but i am not surprised that the interest if awakened should not at first take the form of admiration the inconsistency between an homeric description of a piece of furniture or armour and the actual rudeness of any piece of art approximating within even three or four centuries to the homeric period is so great that we at first cannot recognize the art as elucidatory of or in any way related to the poetic language  79 you will find however exactly the same kind of discrepancy between early sculpture and the languages of deed and thought in the second birth and childhood of the world under christianity the same fair thoughts and bright imaginations arise again and similarly the fancy is content with the rudest symbols by which they can be formalized to the eyes you cannot understand that the rigid figure 2 with chequers or spots on its breast and sharp lines of drapery to its feet could represent to the greek the healing majesty of heaven but can you any better understand how a symbol so haggard as this fig 5 could represent to the noblest hearts of the christian ages the power and ministration of angels yet it not only did so but retained in the rude undulatory and linear ornamentation of its dress record of the thoughts intended to be conveyed by the spotted √¶gis and falling chiton of athena eighteen hundred years before greek and venetian alike in their noble childhood knew with the same terror the coiling wind and congealed hail in heavensaw with the same thankfulness the dew shed softly on the earth and on its flowers and both recognized ruling these and symbolized by them the great helpful spirit of wisdom which leads the children of men to all knowledge all courage and all art  80 read the inscription written on the sarcophagus plate v at the extremity of which this angel is sculptured it stands in an open recess in the rude brick wall of the west front of the church of st john and paul at venice being the tomb of the two doges father and son jacopo and lorenzo tiepolo this is the inscription      quos natura pares studiis virtutibus arte     edidit

mentibus ambo      dominus jachobus hobiit121 mccli      dominus laurentius hobiit mcclxxviii  you see therefore this tomb is an invaluable example of thirteenth century sculpture in venice in plate vi you have an example of the coin sculpture of the date accurately corresponding in greece to the thirteenth century in venice when the meaning of symbols was everything and the workmanship comparatively nothing the upper head is an athena of athenian work in the seventh or sixth centurythe coin itself may have been struck later but the archaic type was retained the two smaller impressions below are the front and obverse of a coin of the same age from corinth the head of athena on one side and pegasus with the archaic koppa on the other the smaller head is bare the hair being looped up at the back and closely bound with an olive branch you are to note this general outline of the head already given in a more finished type in plate ii as a most important elementary form in the finest sculpture not of greece only but of all christendom in the upper head the hair is restrained still more closely by a round helmet for the most part smooth but embossed with a single flower tendril having one bud one flower and above it two olive leaves you have thus the most absolutely restricted symbol possible to human thought of the power of athena over the flowers and trees of the earth an olive leaf by itself could not have stood for the sign of a tree but the two can when set in position of growth  illustration plate viarchaic athena of athens and corinth  i would not give you the reverse of the coin on the same plate because you would have looked at it only laughed at it and not examined the rest but here it is wonderfully engraved for you fig 6 of it we shall have more to say afterwards  illustration fig 6  81 and now as you look at these rude vestiges of the religion of greece and at the vestiges still ruder on the ducal tomb of the religion of christendom take warning against two opposite errors  there is a school of teachers who will tell you that nothing but greek art is deserving of study and that all our work at this day should be an imitation of it  whenever you feel tempted to believe them think of these portraits of athena and her owl and be assured that greek art is not in all respects perfect nor exclusively deserving of imitation  there is another school of teachers who will tell you that greek art is good for nothing that the soul of the greek was outcast and that christianity entirely superseded its faith and excelled its works  whenever you feel tempted to believe them think of this angel on the tomb of jacopo tiepolo and remember that christianity after it had been twelve hundred years existent as an imaginative power on the earth could do no better work than this though with all the former power of greece to help it nor was able to engrave its triumph in having stained its fleets in the seas of greece with the blood of her people but between barbarous imitations of the pillars which that people had invented  82 receiving these two warnings receive also this lesson in both examples childish though it be this heathen and christian art is alike sincere and alike vividly imaginative the actual work is that of infancy the thoughts in their visionary simplicity are also the thoughts of infancy but in their solemn virtue they are the thoughts of men  we on the contrary are now in all that we do absolutely without sincerityabsolutely therefore without imagination and without virtue our hands are dexterous with the vile and deadly dexterity of machines our minds filled with incoherent fragments of faith which we cling to in cowardice without believing and make pictures of in vanity without loving false and base alike whether we admire or imitate we cannot learn from the heathens art but only pilfer it we cannot revive the christians art but only galvanize it we are in the sum of us not human artists at all but mechanisms of conceited clay masked in the furs and feathers of living creatures and convulsed with voltaic spasms in mockery of animation  83 you think perhaps that i am using terms unjustifiable in violence they would indeed be unjustifiable if spoken from this chair they were violent at all they are unhappily temperate and accurateexcept in shortcoming of blame for we are not only impotent to restore but strong to defile the work of past ages of the impotence take but this one utterly humiliatory and in the full meaning of it ghastly example we have lately been busy embanking in the capital of the country the river which of all its waters the imagination of our ancestors had made most sacred and the bounty of nature most useful of all architectural features of the metropolis that embankment will be in future the most conspicuous and in its position and purpose it was the most capable of noble adornment  for that adornment nevertheless the utmost which our modern poetical imagination has been able to invent is a row of gaslamps it has indeed farther suggested itself to our minds as appropriate to gaslamps set beside a river that the gas should come out of fishes tails but we have not ingenuity enough to cast so much as a smelt or a sprat for ourselves so we borrow the shape of a neapolitan marble which has been the refuse of the plate and candlestick shops in every capital of europe for the last fifty years we cast that badly and give lustre to the illcast fish with lacquer in imitation of bronze on the base of their pedestals towards the road we put for advertisements sake the initials of the casting firm and for farther originality and christianitys sake the caduceus of mercury and to adorn the front of the pedestals towards the river being now wholly at our wits end we can think of nothing better than to borrow the doorknocker whichagain for the last fifty yearshas disturbed and decorated two or three millions of london streetdoors and magnifying the marvellous device of it a lions head with a ring in its mouth still borrowed from the greek we complete the embankment with a row of heads and rings on a scale which enables them to produce at the distance at which only they can be seen the exact effect of a row of sentry boxes  84 farther in the very centre of the city and at the point where the embankment commands a view of westminster abbey on one side and of st pauls on the otherthat is to say at precisely the most important and stately moment of its whole courseit has to pass under one of the arches of waterloo bridge which in the sweep of its curve is as vastit aloneas the rialto at venice and scarcely less seemly in proportions but over the rialto though of late and debased venetian work there still reigns some power of human imagination on the two flanks of it are carved the virgin and the angel of the annunciation on the keystone the descending dove it is not indeed the fault of living designers that the waterloo arch is nothing more than a gloomy and hollow heap of wedged blocks of blind granite but just beyond the damp shadow of it the new embankment is reached by a flight of stairs which are in point of fact the principal approach to it afoot from central london the descent from the very midst of the metropolis of england to the banks of the chief river of england and for this approach living designers are answerable  85 the principal decoration of the descent is again a gaslamp but a shattered one with a brass crown on the top of it or rather halfcrown and that turned the wrong way the back of it to the river and causeway its flame supplied by a visible pipe far wandering along the wall the whole apparatus being supported by a rough crossbeam fastened to the centre of the arch above is a large placard stating that the royal humane societys drags are in constant readiness and that their office is at 4 trafalgar square on each side of the arch are temporary but dismally old and battered boardings across two angles capable of unseemly use by the british public above one of these is another placard stating that this is the victoria embankment the steps themselvessome forty of themdescend under a tunnel which the shattered gaslamp lights by night and nothing by day they are covered with filthy dust shaken off from infinitude of filthy feet mixed up with shreds of paper orangepeel foul straw rags and cigar ends and ashes the whole agglutinated more or less by dry saliva into slippery blotches and patches or when not so fastened blown dismally by the sooty wind hither and thither or into the faces of those who ascend and descend the place is worth your visit for you are not likely to find elsewhere a spot which either in costly and ponderous brutality of building or in the squalid and indecent accompaniment of it is so far separated from the peace and grace of nature and so accurately indicative of the methods of our national resistance to the grace mercy and peace of heaven  86 i am obliged always to use the english word grace in two senses but remember that the greek greek charis includes them both the bestowing that is to say of beauty and mercy and especially it includes these in the passage of pindars first ode which gives us the key to the right interpretation of the power of sculpture in greece you remember that i told you in my sixth introductory lecture ¬ß 151 that the mythic accounts of greek sculpture begin in the legends of the family of tantalus and especially in the most grotesque legend of them all the inlaying of the ivory shoulder of pelops at that story pindar pausesnot indeed without admiration nor alleging any impossibility in the circumstances themselves but doubting the careless hunger of demeterand gives his own reading of the event instead of the ancient one he justifies this to himself and to his hearers by the plea that myths have in some sort or degree greek pou ti led the mind of mortals beyond the truth and then he goes on  grace which creates everything that is kindly and soothing for mortals adding honour has often made things at first untrustworthy become trustworthy through love  87 i cannot except in these lengthened terms give you the complete force of the passage especially of the greek apiston em√™sato piotonmade it trustworthy by passionate desire that it should be sowhich exactly describes the temper of religious persons at the present day who are kindly and sincere in clinging to the forms of faith which either have long been precious to themselves or which they feel to have been without question instrumental in advancing the dignity of mankind and it is part of the constitution of humanitya part which above others you are in danger of unwisely contemning under the existing conditions of our knowledge that the things thus sought for belief with eager passion do indeed become trustworthy to us that to each of us they verily become what we would have them the force of the greek m√™nis and greek mn√™m√™ with which we seek after them does indeed make them powerful to us for actual good or evil and it is thus granted to us to create not only with our hands things that exalt or degrade our sight but with our hearts also things that exalt or degrade our souls giving true substance to all that we hoped for evidence to things that we have not seen but have desired to see and calling in the sense of creating things that are not as though they were  88 you remember that in distinguishing imagination from idolatry i referred you to the forms of passionate affection with which a noble people commonly regards the rivers and springs of its native land some conception of personality or of spiritual power in the stream is almost necessarily involved in such emotion and prolonged greek charis in the form of gratitude the return of love for benefits continually bestowed at last alike in all the highest and the simplest minds when they are honourable and pure makes this untrue thing trustworthy greek apiston em√™sato piston until it becomes to them the safe basis of some of the happiest impulses of their moral nature next to the marbles of verona given you as a primal type of the sculpture of christianity moved to its best energy in adorning the entrance of its temples i have not unwillingly placed as your introduction to the best sculpture of the religion of greece the forms under which it represented the personality of the fountain arethusa but without restriction to those days of absolute devotion let me simply point out to you how this untrue thing made true by love has intimate and heavenly authority even over the minds of men of the most practical sense the most shrewd wit and the most severe precision of moral temper the fair vision of sabrina in comus the endearing and tender promise fies nobilium tu quoque fontium and the joyful and proud affection of the great lombards address to the lakes of his enchanted land                   te lari maxume teque     fluctibus et fremitu assurgens benace marino  may surely be remembered by you with regretful piety when you stand by the blank stones which at once restrain and disgrace your native river as the final worship rendered to it by modern philosophy but a little incident which i saw last summer on its bridge at wallingford may put the contrast of ancient and modern feeling before you still more forcibly  89 those of you who have read with attention none of us can read with too much attention moli√®res most perfect work the misanthrope must remember celim√©nes description of her lovers and her excellent reason for being unable to regard with any favour notre grand flandrin de vicomtedepuis que je lai vu trois quarts dheure durant cracher dans un puits pour faire des ronds that sentence is worth noting both in contrast to the reverence paid by the ancients to wells and springs and as one of the most interesting traces of the extension of the loathsome habit among the upper classes of europe and america which now renders all external grace dignity and decency impossible in the thoroughfares of their principal cities in connection with that sentence of moli√®res you may advisably also remember this fact which i chanced to notice on the bridge of wallingford i was walking from end to end of it and back again one sunday afternoon of last may trying to conjecture what had made this especial bend and ford of the thames so important in all the anglosaxon wars it was one of the few sunny afternoons of the bitter spring and i was very thankful for its light and happy in watching beneath it the flow and the glittering of the classical river when i noticed a welldressed boy apparently just out of some orderly sundayschool leaning far over the parapet watching as i conjectured some bird or insect on the bridgebuttress i went up to him to see what he was looking at but just as i got close to him he started over to the opposite parapet and put himself there into the same position his object being as i then perceived to spit from both sides upon the heads of a pleasure party who were passing in a boat below  90 the incident may seem to you too trivial to be noticed in this place to me gentlemen it was by no means trivial it meant in the depth of it such absence of all true greek charis reverence and intellect as it is very dreadful to trace in the mind of any human creature much more in that of a child educated with apparently every advantage of circumstance in a beautiful english country town within ten miles of our university most of all is it terrific when we regard it as the exponent and this in truth it is of the temper which as distinguished from former methods either of discipline or recreation the present tenor of our general teaching fosters in the mind of youthteaching which asserts liberty to be a right and obedience a degradation and which regardless alike of the fairness of nature and the grace of behaviour leaves the insolent spirit and degraded senses to find their only occupation in malice and their only satisfaction in shame  91 you will i hope proceed with me not scornfully any more to trace in the early art of a noble heathen nation the feeling of what was at least a better childishness than this of ours and the efforts to express though with hands yet failing and minds oppressed by ignorant phantasy the first truth by which they knew that they lived the birth of wisdom and of all her powers of help to man as the reward of his resolute labour  92 greek aphaistou technaisi note that word of pindar in the seventh olympic this axeblow of vulcans was to the greek mind truly what clytemnestra falsely asserts hers to have been greek t√™s de dexias cheros ergon dikaias tektonos physically it meant the opening of the blue through the rent clouds of heaven by the action of local terrestrial heat of heph√¶stus as opposed to apollo who shines on the surface of the upper clouds but cannot pierce them and spiritually it meant the first birth of prudent thought out of rude labour the clearingaxe in the hand of the woodman being the practical elementary sign of his difference from the wild animals of the wood then he goes on from the high head of her father athenaia rushing forth cried with her great and exceeding cry and the heaven trembled at her and the earth mother the cry of athena i have before pointed out physically distinguishes her as the spirit of the air from silent elemental powers but in this grand passage of pindar it is again the mythic cry of which he thinks that is to say the giving articulate words by intelligence to the silence of fate wisdom crieth aloud she uttereth her voice in the streets and heaven and earth tremble at her reproof  93 uttereth her voice in the streets for all men that is to say but to what work did the greeks think that her voice was to call them what was to be the impulse communicated by her prevailing presence what the sign of the peoples obedience to her  this was to be the signbut she the goddess herself gave to them to prevail over the dwellers upon earth with bestlabouring hands in every art and by their paths there were the likenesses of living and of creeping things and the glory was deep for to the cunning workman greater knowledge comes undeceitful  94 an infinitely pregnant passage this of which today you are to note mainly these three things first that athena is the goddess of doing not at all of sentimental inaction she is begotten as it were of the woodmans axe her purpose is never in a word only but in a word and a blow she guides the hands that labour best in every art  95 secondly the victory given by wisdom the worker to the hands that labour best is that the streets and ways greek keleuthoi shall be filled by likenesses of living and creeping things  things living and creeping are the reptile things not alive then you think pindar wrote that carelessly or that if he had only known a little modern anatomy instead of reptile things he would have said monochondylous things be patient and let us attend to the main points first  sculpture it thus appears is the only work of wisdom that the greeks care to speak of they think it involves and crowns every other imagemaking art this is athenas as queenliest of the arts literature the order and the strength of word of course belongs to apollo and the muses under athena are the substances and the forms of things  96 thirdly by this forming of images there is to be gained a deepthat is to saya weighty and prevailing glory not a floating nor fugitive one for to the cunning workman greater knowledge comes undeceitful  greek daenti i am forced to use two english words to translate that single greek one the cunning workman thoughtful in experience touch and vision of the thing to be done no machine witless and of necessary motion yet not cunning only but having perfect habitual skill of hand also the confirmed reward of truthful doing recollect in connection with this passage of pindar homers three verses about getting the lines of shiptimber true il xv 410      greek     all √¥ste stathm√™ dory n√™ion exithynei     tektonos en palam√™si da√™monos hos ra te pas√™s     ed eid√™ sophi√™s upoth√™mosyn√™sin ath√™n√™s  and the beautiful epithet of persephone greek daeira as the tryer and knower of good work and remembering these trust pindar for the truth of his saying that to the cunning workmanand let me solemnly enforce the words by addingthat to him only knowledge comes undeceitful  97 you may have noticed perhaps and with a smile as one of the paradoxes you often hear me blamed for too fondly stating what i told you in the close of my third introductory lecture that so far from arts being immoral little else except art is moral i have now farther to tell you that little else except art is wise that all knowledge unaccompanied by a habit of useful action is too likely to become deceitful and that every habit of useful action must resolve itself into some elementary practice of manual labour and i would in all sober and direct earnestness advise you whatever may be the aim predilection or necessity of your lives to resolve upon this one thing at least that you will enable yourselves daily to do actually with your hands something that is useful to mankind to do anything well with your hands useful or notto be even in trifling greek palam√™si da√™m√¥n is already muchwhen we come to examine the art of the middle ages i shall be able to show you that the strongest of all influences of right then brought to bear upon character was the necessity for exquisite manual dexterity in the management of the spear and bridle and in your own experience most of you will be able to recognize the wholesome effect alike on body and mind of striving within proper limits of time to become either good batsmen or good oarsmen but the bat and the racers oar are childrens toys resolve that you will be men in usefulness as well as in strength and you will find that then also but not till then you can become men in understanding and that every fine vision and subtle theorem will present itself to you thenceforward undeceitfully greek hypoth√™mosyn√™sin ath√™n√™s  98 but there is more to be gathered yet from the words of pindar he is thinking in his brief intense way at once of athenas work on the soul and of her literal power on the dust of the earth his greek keleuthoi is a wide word meaning all the paths of sea and land consider therefore what athenas own work actually isin the literal fact of it the blue clear air is the sculpturing power upon the earth and sea where the surface of the earth is reached by that and its matter and substance inspired with and filled by that organic form becomes possible you must indeed have the sun also and moisture the kingdom of apollo risen out of the sea but the sculpturing of living things shape by shape is athenas so that under the brooding spirit of the air what was without form and void brings forth the moving creature that hath life  99 that is her work thenthe giving of form then the separately apolline work is the giving of light or more strictly sight giving that faculty to the retina to which we owe not merely the idea of light but the existence of it for light is to be defined only as the sensation produced in the eye of an animal under given conditions those same conditions being to a stone only warmth or chemical influence but not light and that power of seeing and the other various personalities and authorities of the animal body in pleasure and pain have never hitherto been i do not say explained but in any wise touched or approached by scientific discovery some of the conditions of mere external animal form and of muscular vitality have been shown but for the most part that is true even of external form which i wrote six years ago you may always stand by form against force to a painter the essential character of anything is the form of it and the philosophers cannot touch that they come and tell you for instance that there is as much heat or motion or calorific energy or whatever else they like to call it in a teakettle as in a giereagle very good that is so and it is very interesting it requires just as much heat as will boil the kettle to take the giereagle up to his nest and as much more to bring him down again on a hare or a partridge but we painters acknowledging the equality and similarity of the kettle and the bird in all scientific respects attach for our part our principal interest to the difference in their forms for us the primarily cognisable facts in the two things are that the kettle has a spout and the eagle a beak the one a lid on its back the other a pair of wings not to speak of the distinction also of volition which the philosophers may properly call merely a form or mode of forcebut then to an artist the form or mode is the gist of the business  100 as you will find that it is not to the artist only but to all of us the laws under which matter is collected and constructed are the same throughout the universe the substance so collected whether for the making of the eagle or the worm may be analyzed into gaseous identity a diffusive vital force apparently so closely related to mechanically measurable heat as to admit the conception of its being itself mechanically measurable and unchanging in total quantity ebbs and flows alike through the limbs of men and the fibres of insects but above all this and ruling every grotesque or degraded accident of this are two laws of beauty in form and of nobility in character which stand in the chaos of creation between the living and the dead to separate the things that have in them a sacred and helpful from those that have in them an accursed and destroying nature and the power of athena first physically put forth in the sculpturing of these greek z√¥a and erpeta these living and reptile things is put forth finally in enabling the hearts of men to discern the one from the other to know the unquenchable fires of the spirit from the unquenchable fires of death and to choose not unaided between submission to the love that cannot end or to the worm that cannot die  101 the unconsciousness of their antagonism is the most notable characteristic of the modern scientific mind and i believe no credulity or fallacy admitted by the weakness or it may sometimes rather have been the strength of early imagination indicates so strange a depression beneath the due scale of human intellect as the failure of the sense of beauty in form and loss of faith in heroism of conduct which have become the curses of recent science122 art and policy  102 that depression of intellect has been alike exhibited in the mean consternation confessedly felt on one side and the mean triumph apparently felt on the other during the course of the dispute now pending as to the origin of man dispute for the present not to be decided and of which the decision is to persons in the modern temper of mind wholly without significance and i earnestly desire that you my pupils may have firmness enough to disengage your energies from investigation so premature and so fruitless and sense enough to perceive that it does not matter how you have been made so long as you are satisfied with being what you are if you are dissatisfied with yourselves it ought not to console but humiliate you to imagine that you were once seraphs and if you are pleased with yourselves it is not any ground of reasonable shame to you if by no fault of your own you have passed through the elementary condition of apes  103 remember therefore that it is of the very highest importance that you should know what you are and determine to be the best that you may be but it is of no importance whatever except as it may contribute to that end to know what you have been whether your creator shaped you with fingers or tools as a sculptor would a lump of clay or gradually raised you to manhood through a series of inferior forms is only of moment to you in this respectthat in the one case you cannot expect your children to be nobler creatures than you are yourselvesin the other every act and thought of your present life may be hastening the advent of a race which will look back to you their fathers and you ought at least to have attained the dignity of desiring that it may be so with incredulous disdain  104 but that you are yourselves capable of that disdain and dismay that you are ashamed of having been apes if you ever were so that you acknowledge instinctively a relation of better and worse and a law respecting what is noble and base which makes it no question to you that the man is worthier than the baboonthis is a fact of infinite significance this law of preference in your hearts is the true essence of your being and the consciousness of that law is a more positive existence than any dependent on the coherence or forms of matter  105 now but a few words more of mythology and i have done remember that athena holds the weavers shuttle not merely as an instrument of texture but as an instrument of picture the ideas of clothing and of the warmth of life being thus inseparably connected with those of graphic beauty and the brightness of life i have told you that no art could be recovered among us without perfectness in dress nor without the elementary graphic art of women in divers colours of needlework there has been no nation of any artenergy but has strenuously occupied and interested itself in this household picturing from the web of penelope to the tapestry of queen matilda and the meshes of arras and gobelins  106 we should then naturally ask what kind of embroidery athena put on her own robe greek peplon heanon poikilon hou r aut√™ poi√™sato kai kame chersin  the subject of that greek poikilia of hers as you know was the war of the giants and gods now the real name of these giants remember is that used by hesiod greek p√™lochonoi mudbegotten and the meaning of the contest between these and zeus greek p√™logon√¥n elat√™r is again the inspiration of life into the clay by the goddess of breath and the actual confusion going on visibly before you daily of the earth heaping itself into cumbrous war with the powers above it  107 thus briefly the entire material of art under athenas hand is the contest of life with clay and all my task in explaining to you the early thought of both the athenian and tuscan schools will only be the tracing of this battle of the giants into its full heroic form when not in tapestry onlybut in sculptureand on the portal of the temple of delphi itself you have the greek klonos en teichesi lainoisi gigant√¥n and their defeat hailed by the passionate cry of delight from the athenian maids beholding pallas in her full power greek leuss√¥ pallad eman theon my own goddess all our work i repeat will be nothing but the inquiry into the development of this the subject and the pressing fully home the question of plato about that embroideryand think you that there is verily war with each other among the gods and dreadful enmities and battle such as the poets have told and such as our painters set forth in graven scripture to adorn all our sacred rites and holy places yes and in the great panathenaea themselves the peplus full of such wild picturing is carried up into the acropolisshall we say that these things are true oh euthuphron rightminded friend  108 yes we say and know that these things are true and true for ever battles of the gods not among themselves but against the earthgiants battle prevailing age by age in nobler life and lovelier imagery creation which no theory of mechanism no definition of force can explain the adoption and completing of individual form by individual animation breathed out of the lips of the father of spirits and to recognize the presence in every knitted shape of dust by which it lives and moves and has its beingto recognize it revere and show it forth is to be our eternal idolatry  thou shalt not bow down to them nor worship them  assuredly no we answered once in our pride and through porch and aisle broke down the carved work thereof with axes and hammers  who would have thought the day so near when we should bow down to worship not the creatures but their atomsnot the forces that form but those that dissolve them trust me gentlemen the command which is stringent against adoration of brutality is stringent no less against adoration of chaos nor is faith in an image fallen from heaven to be reformed by a faith only in the phenomenon of decadence we have ceased from the making of monsters to be appeased by sacrificeit is wellif indeed we have also ceased from making them in our thoughts we have learned to distrust the adorning of fair phantasms to which we once sought for succourit is well if we learn to distrust also the adorning of those to which we seek for temptation but the verity of gains like these can only be known by our confession of the divine seal of strength and beauty upon the tempered frame and honour in the fervent heart by which increasing visibly may yet be manifested to us the holy presence and the approving love of the loving god who visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him and shows mercy unto thousands in them that love him and keep his commandments  footnotes  118 i shall be obliged in future lectures as hitherto in my other writings to use the terms idolatry and imagination in a more comprehensive sense but here i use them for convenience sake limitedly to avoid the continual occurrence of the terms noble and ignoble or false and true with reference to modes of conception  119 and in sum he himself prometheus was the mastermaker and athena worked together with him breathing into the clay and caused the moulded things to have soul psyche in themlucian prometheus  120 his relations with the two great titans themis

lizards and insects absolute incapability of representing either a man a horse or a lion     lecture iv  likeness  november 1870   109 you were probably vexed and tired towards the close of my last lecture by the time it took us to arrive at the apparently simple conclusion that sculpture must only represent organic form and the strength of life in its contest with matter but it is no small thing to have that greek leuss√¥ pallada fixed in your minds as the one necessary sign by which you are to recognize right sculpture and believe me you will find it the best of all things if you can take for yourselves the saying from the lips of the athenian maids in its entirety and say alsogreek leuss√¥ pallad eman theon i proceed today into the practical appliance of this apparently speculative but in reality imperative law  110 you observe i have hitherto spoken of the power of athena as over painting no less than sculpture but her rule over both arts is only so far as they are zoographicrepresentative that is to say of animal life or of such order and discipline among other elements as may invigorate and purify it now there is a speciality of the art of painting beyond this namely the representation of phenomena of colour and shadow as such without question of the nature of the things that receive them i am now accordingly obliged to speak of sculpture and painting as distinct arts but the laws which bind sculpture bind no less the painting of the higher schools which has for its main purpose the showing beauty in human or animal form and which is therefore placed by the greeks equally under the rule of athena as the spirit first of life and then of wisdom in conduct  111 first i say you are to see pallas in all such work as the queen of life and the practical law which follows from this is one of enormous range and importance namely that nothing must be represented by sculpture external to any living form which does not help to enforce or illustrate the conception of life both dress and armour may be made to do this by great sculptors and are continually so used by the greatest one of the essential distinctions between the athenian and florentine schools is dependent on their treatment of drapery in this respect an athenian always sets it to exhibit the action of the body by flowing with it or over it or from it so as to illustrate both its form and gesture a florentine on the contrary always uses his drapery to conceal or disguise the forms of the body and exhibit mental emotion but both use it to enhance the life either of the body or soul donatello and michael angelo no less than the sculptors of gothic chivalry ennoble armour in the same way but base sculptors carve drapery and armour for the sake of their folds and picturesqueness only and forget the body beneath the rule is so stern that all delight in mere incidental beauty which painting often triumphs in is wholly forbidden to sculpturefor instance in painting the branch of a tree you may rightly represent and enjoy the lichens and moss on it but a sculptor must not touch one of them they are inessential to the trees lifehe must give the flow and bending of the branch only else he does not enough see pallas in it  or to take a higher instance here is an exquisite little painted poem by edward frere a cottage interior one of the thousands which within the last two months123 have been laid desolate in unhappy france every accessory in the painting is of valuethe fireside the tiled floor the vegetables lying upon it and the basket hanging from the roof but not one of these accessories would have been admissible in sculpture you must carve nothing but what has life why you probably feel instantly inclined to ask meyou see the principle we have got instead of being blunt or useless is such an edged tool that you are startled the moment i apply it must we refuse every pleasant accessory and picturesque detail and petrify nothing but living creatureseven so i would not assert it on my own authority it is the greeks who say it but whatever they say of sculpture be assured is true  112 that then is the first lawyou must see pallas as the lady of lifethe second is you must see her as the lady of wisdom or greek sophiaand this is the chief matter of all i cannot but think that after the considerations into which we have now entered you will find more interest than hitherto in comparing the statements of aristotle in the ethics with those of plato in the polity which are authoritative as greek definitions of goodness in art and which you may safely hold authoritative as constant definitions of it you remember doubtless that the greek sophia or greek aret√™ techn√™s for the sake of which phidias is called greek sophos as a sculptor and polyclitus as an imagemaker eth 6 7 the opposition is both between ideal and portrait sculpture and between working in stone and bronze consists in the greek nous t√¥n timi√¥tat√¥n t√™ physei the mental apprehension of the things that are most honourable in their nature therefore what is indeed most lovely the true imagemaker will most love and what is most hateful he will most hate and in all things discern the best and strongest part of them and represent that essentially or if the opposite of that then with manifest detestation and horror that is his art wisdom the knowledge of good and evil and the love of good so that you may discern even in his representation of the vilest thing his acknowledgment of what redemption is possible for it or latent power exists in it and contrariwise his sense of its present misery but for the most part he will idolize and force us also to idolize whatever is living and virtuous and victoriously right opposing to it in some definite mode the image of the conquered greek herpeton  113 this is generally true of both the great arts but in severity and precision true of sculpture to return to our illustration this poor little girl was more interesting to edward frere he being a painter because she was poorly dressed and wore these clumsy shoes and old red cap and patched gown may we sculpture her so no we may sculpture her naked if we like but not in rags  but if we may not put her into marble in rags may we give her a pretty frock with ribands and flounces to it and put her into marble in that no we may put her simplest peasants dress so it be perfect and orderly into marble anything finer than that would be more dishonourable in the eyes of athena than rags if she were a french princess you might carve her embroidered robe and diadem if she were joan of arc you might carve her armourfor then these also would be greek t√¥n timi√¥tat√¥n not otherwise  114 is not this an edgetool we have got hold of unawares and a subtle one too so delicate and scimitarlike in decision for note that even joan of arcs armour must be only sculptured if she has it on it is not the honourableness or beauty of it that are enough but the direct bearing of it by her body you might be deeply even pathetically interested by looking at a good knights dinted coat of mail left in his desolate hall may you sculpture it where it hangs no the helmet for his pillow if you willno more  you see we did not do our dull work for nothing in last lecture i define what we have gained once more and then we will enter on our new ground  115 the proper subject of sculpture we have determined is the spiritual power seen in the form of any living thing and so represented as to give evidence that the sculptor has loved the good of it and hated the evil  so represented we say but how is that to be done why should it not be represented if possible just as it is seen what mode or limit of representation may we adopt we are to carve things that have lifeshall we try so to imitate them that they may indeed seem livingor only half living and like stone instead of flesh  it will simplify this question if i show you three examples of what the greeks actually did three typical pieces of their sculpture in order of perfection  116 and now observe that in all our historical work i will endeavour to do myself what i have asked you to do in your drawing exercises namely to outline firmly in the beginning and then fill in the detail more minutely i will give you first therefore in a symmetrical form absolutely simple and easily remembered the large chronology of the greek school within that unforgettable scheme we will place as we discover them the minor relations of arts and times  i number the nine centuries before christ thus upwards and divide them into three groups of three each                             9     a archaic            8                            7                                                       6     b best               5                            4                                                       3     c corrupt            2                            1  then the ninth eighth and seventh centuries are the period of archaic greek art steadily progressive wherever it existed  the sixth fifth and fourth are the period of central greek art the fifth or central century producing the finest that is easily recollected by the battle of marathon and the third second and first centuries are the period of steady decline  illustration plate viiarchaic central and declining art of greece  learn this a b c thoroughly and mark for yourselves what you at present think the vital events in each century as you know more you will think other events the vital ones but the best historical knowledge only approximates to true thought in that matter only be sure that what is truly vital in the character which governs events is always expressed by the art of the century so that if you could interpret that art rightly the better part of your task in reading history would be done to your hand  117 it is generally impossible to date with precision art of the archaic periodoften difficult to date even that of the central three hundred years i will not weary you with futile minor divisions of time here are three coins plate vii roughly but decisively characteristic of the three ages the first is an early coin of tarentum the city was founded as you know by the spartan phalanthus late in the eighth century i believe the head is meant for that of apollo archegetes it may however be taras the son of poseidon it is no matter to us at present whom it is meant for but the fact that we cannot know is itself of the greatest import we cannot say with any certainty unless by discovery of some collateral evidence whether this head is intended for that of a god or demigod or a mortal warrior ought not that to disturb some of your thoughts respecting greek idealism farther if by investigation we discover that the head is meant for that of phalanthus we shall know nothing of the character of phalanthus from the face for there is no portraiture at this early time  118 the second coin is of √Ünus in macedonia probably of the fifth or early fourth century and entirely characteristic of the central period this we know to represent the face of a godhermes the third coin is a kings not a citys i will not tell you at this moment what kings but only that it is a late coin of the third period and that it is as distinct in purpose as the coin of tarentum is obscure we know of this coin that it represents no god nor demigod but a mere mortal and we know precisely from the portrait what that mortals face was like  119 a glance at the three coins as they are set side by side will now show you the main differences in the three great greek styles the archaic coin is sharp and hard every line decisive and numbered set unhesitatingly in its place nothing is wrong though everything incomplete and to us who have seen finer art ugly the central coin is as decisive and clear in arrangement of masses but its contours are completely rounded and finished there is no character in its execution so prominent that you can give an epithet to the style it is not hard it is not soft it is not delicate it is not coarse it is not grotesque it is not beautiful and i am convinced unless you had been told that this is fine central greek art you would have seen nothing at all in it to interest you do not let yourselves be anywise forced into admiring it there is indeed nothing more here than an approximately true rendering of a healthy youthful face without the slightest attempt to give an expression of activity cunning nobility or any other attribute of the mercurial mind extreme simplicity unpretending vigour of work which claims no admiration either for minuteness or dexterity and suggests no idea of effort at all refusal of extraneous ornament and perfectly arranged disposition of counted masses in a sequent order whether in the beads or the ringlets of hair this is all you have to be pleased with neither will you ever find in the best greek art more you might at first suppose that the chain of beads round the cap was an extraneous ornament but i have little doubt that it is as definitely the proper fillet for the head of hermes as the olive for zeus or corn for triptolemus the cap or petasus cannot have expanded edges there is no room for them on the coin these must be understood therefore but the nature of the cloudpetasus is explained by edging it with beads representing either dew or hail the shield of athena often bears white pellets for hail in like manner  120 the third coin will i think at once strike you by what we moderns should call its vigour of character you may observe also that the features are finished with great care and subtlety but at the cost of simplicity and breadth but the essential difference between it and the central art is its disorder in designyou see the locks of hair cannot be counted any longerthey are entirely dishevelled and irregular now the individual character may or may not be a sign of decline but the licentiousness the casting loose of the masses in the design is an infallible one the effort at portraiture is good for art if the men to be portrayed are good men not otherwise in the instance before you the head is that of mithridates vi of pontus who had indeed the good qualities of being a linguist and a patron of the arts but as you will remember murdered according to report his mother certainly his brother certainly his wives and sisters i have not counted how many of his children and from a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand persons besides these last in a single days massacre the effort to represent this kind of person is not by any means a method of study from life ultimately beneficial to art  121 this however is not the point i have to urge today what i want you to observe is that though the master of the great time does not attempt portraiture he does attempt animation and as far as his means will admit he succeeds in making the faceyou might almost thinkvulgarly animated as like a real face literally as it can stare yes and its sculptor meant it to be so and that was what phidias meant his jupiter to be if he could manage it not indeed to be taken for zeus himself and yet to be as like a living zeus as art could make it perhaps you think he tried to make it look living only for the sake of the mob and would not have tried to do so for connoisseurs pardon me for real connoisseurs he would and did and herein consists a truth which belongs to all the arts and which i will at once drive home in your minds as firmly as i can  122 all secondrate artistsand remember the secondrate ones are a loquacious multitude while the great come only one or two in a century and then silentlyall secondrate artists will tell you that the object of fine art is not resemblance but some kind of abstraction more refined than reality put that out of your heads at once the object of the great resemblant arts is and always has been to resemble and to resemble as closely as possible it is the function of a good portrait to set the man before you in habit as he lived and i would we had a few more that did so it is the function of a good landscape to set the scene before you in its reality to make you if it may be think the clouds are flying and the streams foaming it is the function of the best sculptorthe true d√¶dalusto make stillness look like breathing and marble look like flesh  123 and in all great times of art this purpose is as na√Øvely expressed as it is steadily held all the talk about abstraction belongs to periods of decadence in living times people see something living that pleases them and they try to make it live for ever or to make it something as like it as possible that will last for ever they paint their statues and inlay the eyes with jewels and set real crowns on their heads they finish in their pictures every thread of embroidery and would fain if they could draw every leaf upon the trees and their only verbal expression of conscious success is that they have made their work look real  124 you think all that very wrong so did i once but it was i that was wrong a long time ago before ever i had seen oxford i painted a picture of the lake of como for my father it was not at all like the lake of como but i thought it rather the better for that my father differed with me and objected particularly to a boat with a red and yellow awning which i had put into the most conspicuous corner of my drawing i declared this boat to be necessary to the composition my father not the less objected that he had never seen such a boat either at como or elsewhere and suggested that if i would make the lake look a little more like water i should be under no necessity of explaining its nature by the presence of floating objects i thought him at the time a very simple person for his pains but have since learned and it is the very gist of all practical matters which as professor of fine art i have now to tell you that the great point in painting a lake isto get it to look like water  125 so far so good we lay it down for a first principle that our graphic art whether painting or sculpture is to produce something which shall look as like nature as possible but now we must go one step farther and say that it is to produce what shall look like nature to people who know what nature is like you see this is at once a great restriction as well as a great exaltation of our aim our business is not to deceive the simple but to deceive the wise here for instance is a modern italian print representing to the best of its power st cecilia in a brilliantly realistic manner and the fault of the work is not in its earnest endeavour to show st cecilia in habit as she lived but in that the effort could only be successful with persons unaware of the habit st cecilia lived in and this condition of appeal only to the wise increases the difficulty of imitative resemblance so greatly that with only average skill or materials we must surrender all hope of it and be content with an imperfect representation true as far as it reaches and such as to excite the imagination of a wise beholder to complete it though falling very far short of what either he or we should otherwise have desired for instance here is a suggestion by sir joshua reynolds of the general appearance of a british judgerequiring the imagination of a very wise beholder indeed to fill it up or even at first to discover what it is meant for nevertheless it is better art than the italian st cecilia because the artist however little he may have done to represent his knowledge does indeed know altogether what a judge is like and appeals only to the criticism of those who know also  126 there must be therefore two degrees of truth to be looked for in the good graphic arts one the commonest which by any partial or imperfect sign conveys to you an idea which you must complete for yourself and the other the finest a representation so perfect as to leave you nothing to be farther accomplished by this independent exertion but to give you the same feeling of possession and presence which you would experience from the natural object itself for instance of the first in this representation of a rainbow124 the artist has no hope that by the black lines of engraving he can deceive you into any belief of the rainbows being there but he gives indication enough of what he intends to enable you to supply the rest of the idea yourself providing always you know beforehand what a rainbow is like but in this drawing of the falls of terni125 the painter has strained his skill to the utmost to give an actually deceptive resemblance of the iris dawning and fading among the foam so far as he has not actually deceived you it is not because he would not have done so if he could but only because his colours and science have fallen short of his desire they have fallen so little short that in a good light you may all but believe the foam and the sunshine are drifting and changing among the rocks  127 and after looking a little while you will begin to regret that they are not so you will feel that lovely as the drawing is you would like far better to see the real place and the goats skipping among the rocks and the spray floating above the fall and this is the true sign of the greatest artto part voluntarily with its greatnessto make itself poor and unnoticed but so to exalt and set forth its theme that you may be fain to see the theme instead of it so that you have never enough admired a great workmans doing till you have begun to despise it the best homage that could be paid to the athena of phidias would be to desire rather to see the living goddess and the loveliest madonnas of christian art fall short of their due power if they do not make their beholders sick at heart to see the living virgin  128 we have then for our requirement of the finest art sculpture or anything else that it shall be so like the thing it represents as to please those who best know or can conceive the original and if possible please them deceptivelyits final triumph being to deceive even the wise and the greeks thought to please even the immortals who were so wise as to be undeceivable so that you get the greek thus far entirely true idea of perfectness in sculpture expressed to you by what phalaris says at first sight of the bull of perilaus it only wanted motion and bellowing to seem alive and as soon as i saw it i cried out it ought to be sent to the god to apollo for only he the undeceivable could thoroughly understand such sculpture and perfectly delight in it  129 and with this expression of the greek ideal of sculpture i wish you to join the early italian summed in a single line by dantenon vide me di me chi vide l vero read the 12th canto of the purgatory and learn that whole passage by heart and if ever you chance to go to pistoja look at la robbias coloured porcelain basreliefs of the seven works of mercy on the front of the hospital there and note especially the faces of the two sick menone at the point of death and the other in the first peace and longdrawn breathing of health after feverand you will know what dante meant by the preceding line morti li morti e i vivi par√®n vivi  130 but now may we not ask fartheris it impossible for art such as this prepared for the wise to please the simple also without entering on the awkward questions of degree how many the wise can be or how much men should know in order to be rightly called wise may we not conceive an art to be possible which would deceive everybody or everybody worth deceiving i showed you at my first lecture a little ringlet of japan ivory as a type of elementary basrelief touched with colour and in your rudimentary series you have a drawing by mr burgess of one of the little fishes enlarged with every touch of the chisel facsimiled on the more visible scale and showing the little black bead inlaid for the eye which in the original is hardly to be seen without a lens you may perhaps be surprised when i tell you that putting the question of subject aside for the moment and speaking only of the mode of execution and aim at resemblance you have there a perfect example of the greek ideal of method in sculpture and you will admit that to the simplest person whom we could introduce as a critic that fish would be a satisfactory nay almost a deceptive fish while to any one caring for subtleties of art i need not point out that every touch of the chisel is applied with consummate knowledge and that it would be impossible to convey more truth and life with the given quantity of workmanship  illustration fig 7  131 here is indeed a drawing by turner edu 131 in which with some fifty times the quantity of labour and far more highly educated faculty of sight the artist has expressed some qualities of lustre and colour which only very wise persons indeed could perceive in a john dory and this piece of paper contains therefore much more and more subtle art than the japan ivory but are we sure that it is therefore greater art or that the painter was better employed in producing this drawing which only one person can possess and only one in a hundred enjoy than he would have been in producing two or three pieces on a larger scale which should have been at once accessible to and enjoyable by a number of simpler persons suppose for instance that turner instead of faintly touching this outline on white paper with his camels hair pencil had struck the main forms of his fish into marble thus fig 7 and instead of colouring the white paper so delicately that perhaps only a few of the most keenly observant artists in england can see it at all had with his strong hand tinted the marble with a few colours deceptive to the people and harmonious to the initiated suppose that he had even conceded so much to the spirit of popular applause as to allow of a bright glass bead being inlaid for the eye in the japanese manner and that the enlarged deceptive and popularly pleasing work had been carved on the outside of a great buildingsay fishmongers hallwhere everybody commercially connected with billingsgate could have seen it and ratified it with the wisdom of the marketmight not the art have been greater worthier and kinder in such use  132 perhaps the idea does not once approve itself to you of having your public buildings covered with ornaments like this but pray remember that the choice of subject is an ethical question not now before us all i ask you to decide is whether the method is right and would be pleasant in giving the distinctiveness to pretty things which it has here given to what i suppose it may be assumed you feel to be an ugly thing of course i must note parenthetically such realistic work is impossible in a country where the buildings are to be discoloured by coalsmoke but so is all fine sculpture whatsoever and the whiter the worse its chance for that which is prepared for private persons to be kept under cover will of necessity degenerate into the copyism of past work or merely sensational and sensual forms of present life unless there be a governing school addressing the populace for their instruction on the outside of buildings so that as i partly warned you in my third lecture you can simply have no sculpture in a coal country whether you like coals or carvings best is no business of mine i merely have to assure you of the fact that they are incompatible  but assuming that we are again some day to become a civilized and governing race deputing ironmongery coaldigging and lucredigging to our slaves in other countries it is quite conceivable that with an increasing knowledge of natural history and desire for such knowledge what is now done by careful but inefficient woodcuts and in illcoloured engravings might be put in quite permanent sculptures with inlay of variegated precious stones on the outside of buildings where such pictures would be little costly to the people and in a more popular manner still by robbia ware and palissy ware and inlaid majolica which would differ from the housewives present favourite decoration of plates above her kitchen dresser by being every piece of it various instructive and universally visible  133 you hardly know i suppose whether i am speaking in jest or earnest in the most solemn earnest i assure you though such is the strange course of our popular life that all the irrational arts of destruction are at once felt to be earnest while any plan for those of instruction on a grand scale sounds like a dream or jest still i do not absolutely propose to decorate our public buildings with sculpture wholly of this character though beast and fowl and creeping things and fishes might all find room on such a building as the solomons house of a new atlantis and some of them might even become symbolic of much to us again passing through the strand only the other day for instance i saw four highly finished and delicately coloured pictures of cockfighting which for imitative quality were nearly all that could be desired going far beyond the greek cock of himera and they would have delighted a greeks soul if they had meant as much as a greek cockfight but they were only types of the greek endomachas alekt√¥r and of the spirit of home contest which has been so fatal lately to the bird of france and not of the defence of ones own barnyard in thought of which the olympians set the cock on the pillars of their chariot course and gave it goodly alliance in its battle as you may see here in what is left of the angle of mouldering marble in the chair of the priest of dionusos the cast of it from the centre of the theatre under the acropolis is in the british museum and i wanted its spiral for you and this kneeling angel of victoryit is late greek art but nobly systematic flat basrelief so i set mr burgess to draw it but neither he nor i for a little while could make out what the angel of victory was kneeling for his attitude is an ancient and grandly conventional one among the egyptians and i was tracing it back to a kneeling goddess of the greatest dynasty of the pharaohsa goddess of evening or death laying down the sun out of her right handwhen one bright day the shadows came out clear on the athenian throne and i saw that my angel of victory was only backing a cock at a cockfight  134 still as i have said there is no reason why sculpture even for simplest persons should confine itself to imagery of fish or fowl or fourfooted things  we go back to our first principle we ought to carve nothing but what is honourable and you are offended at this moment with my fish as i believe when the first sculptures appeared on the windows of this museum offence was taken at the unnecessary introduction of cats these dissatisfactions being properly felt by your greek nous t√¥n timi√¥tat√¥n for indeed in all cases our right judgment must depend on our wish to give honour only to things and creatures that deserve it  135 and now i must state to you another principle of veracity both in sculpture and all following arts of wider scope than any hitherto examined we have seen that sculpture is to be a true representation of true external form much more is it to be a representation of true internal emotion you must carve only what you yourself see as you see it but much more you must carve only what you yourself feel as you feel it you may no more endeavour to feel through other mens souls than to see with other mens eyes whereas generally now in europe and america every mans energy is bent upon acquiring some false emotion not his own but belonging to the past or to other persons because he has been taught that such and such a result of it will be fine every attempted sentiment in relation to art is hypocritical our notions of sublimity of grace or pious serenity are all second hand and we are practically incapable of designing so much as a bellhandle or a doorknocker without borrowing the first notion of it from those who are gonewhere we shall not wake them with our knocking i would we could  136 in the midst of this desolation we have nothing to count on for real growth but what we can find of honest liking and longing in ourselves and in others we must discover if we would healthily advance what things are verily greek timi√¥tata among us and if we delight to honour the dishonourable consider how in future we may better bestow our likings now it appears to me from all our popular declarations that we at present honour nothing so much as liberty and independence and no person so much as the free man and selfmade man who will be ruled by no one and has been taught or helped by no one and the reason i chose a fish for you as the first subject of sculpture was that in men who are free and selfmade you have the nearest approach humanly possible to the state of the fish and finely organized greek herpeton you get the exact phrase in habakkuk if you take the septuagint textgreek poi√™seis tous anthr√¥pous h√¥s tous ichthyas t√™s thalass√™s kai h√¥s ta herpeta ta ouk echonta h√™goumenon thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea and as the reptile things that have no ruler over them and it chanced that as i was preparing this lecture one of our most able and popular prints gave me a woodcut of the selfmade man specified as such so vigorously drawn and with so few touches that phidias or turner himself could scarcely have done it better so that i had only to ask my assistant to enlarge it with accuracy and it became comparable with my fish at once of course it is not given by the caricaturist as an admirable face only i am enabled by his skill to set before you without any suspicion of unfairness on my part the expression to which the life we profess to think most honourable naturally leads if we were to take the hat off you see how nearly the profile corresponds with that of the typical fish  illustration plate viiithe apollo of syracuse and the selfmade man  137 such then being the definition by your best popular art of the ideal of feature at which we are gradually arriving by selfmanufacture when i place opposite to it in plate viii the profile of a man not in any wise selfmade neither by the law of his own will nor by the love of his own interestnor capable for a moment of any kind of independence or of the idea of independence but wholly dependent upon and subjected to external influence of just law wise teaching and trusted love and truth in his fellowspiritssetting before you i say this profile of a godmade instead of a selfmade man i know that you will feel on the instant that you are brought into contact with the vital elements of human art and that this the sculpture of the good is indeed the only permissible sculpture  138 a godmade man i say the face indeed stands as a symbol of more than man in its sculptors mind for as i gave you to lead your first effort in the form of leaves the sceptre of apollo so this which i give you as the first type of rightness in the form of flesh is the countenance of the holder of that sceptre the sungod of syracuse but there is nothing in the face nor did the greek suppose there was more perfect than might be seen in the daily beauty of the creatures the sungod shone upon and whom his strength and honour animated this is not an ideal but a quite literally true face of a greek youth nay i will undertake to show you that it is not supremely beautiful and even to surpass it altogether with the literal portrait of an italian one it is in verity no more than the form habitually taken by the features of a well educated young athenian or sicilian citizen and the one requirement for the sculptors of today is not as it has been thought to invent the same ideal but merely to see the same reality  now you know i told you in my fourth lecture that the beginning of art was in getting our country clean and our people beautiful and you supposed that to be a statement irrelevant to my subject just as at this moment you perhaps think i am quitting the great subject of this present lecturethe method of likenessmakingand letting myself branch into the discussion of what things we are to make likeness of but you shall see hereafter that the method of imitating a beautiful thing must be different from the method of imitating an ugly one and that with the change in subject from what is dishonourable to what is honourable there will be involved a parallel change in the management of tools of lines and of colours so that before i can determine for you how you are to imitate you must tell me what kind of face you wish to imitate the best draughtsmen in the world could not draw this apollo in ten scratches though he can draw the selfmade man still less this nobler apollo of ionian greece plate ix in which the incisions are softened into a harmony like that of correggios painting so that you see the method itselfthe choice between black incision or fine sculpture and perhaps presently the choice between colour or no colour will depend on what you have to represent colour may be expedient for a glistening dolphin or a spotted fawnperhaps inexpedient for white poseidon and gleaming dian so that before defining the laws of sculpture i am compelled to ask you what you mean to carve and that little as you think it is asking you how you mean to live and what the laws of your state are to be for they determine those of your statue you can only have this kind of face to study from in the sort of state that produced it and you will find that sort of state described in the beginning of the fourth book of the laws of plato as founded for one thing on the conviction that of all the evils that can happen to a state quantity of money is the greatest greek meizon kakon √¥s epos eipein polei ouden an gignoito eis gennai√¥n kai dikai√¥n √™th√¥n kt√™sin for to speak shortly no greater evil matching each against each can possibly happen to a city as adverse to its forming just or generous character than its being full of silver and gold  139 of course the greek notion may be wrong and ours right onlygreek √¥s epos eipeinyou can have greek sculpture only on that greek theory shortly expressed by the words put into the mouth of poverty herself in the plutus of aristophanes greek tou ploutou parech√¥ beltionas andras kai t√™n gn√¥m√™n kai t√™n idean i deliver to you better men than the god of money can both in imagination and feature so on the other hand this ichthyoid reptilian or monochondyloid ideal of the selfmade man can only be reached universally by a nation which holds that poverty either of purse or spiritbut especially the spiritual character of being greek pt√¥choi t√¥ pneumati is the lowest of degradations and which believes that the desire of wealth is the first of manly and moral sentiments as i have been able to get the popular ideal represented by its own living art so i can give you this popular faith in its own living words but in words meant seriously and not at all as caricature from one of our leading journals professedly √¶sthetic also in its very name the spectator of august 6th 1870  illustration plate ixapollo chrysocomes of clazomen√Ü  mr ruskins plan it says would make england poor in order that she might be cultivated and refined and artistic a wilder proposal was never broached by a man of ability and it might be regarded as a proof that the assiduous study of art emasculates the intellect and even the moral sense such a theory almost warrants the contempt with which art is often regarded by essentially intellectual natures like proudhon sic art is noble as the flower of life and the creations of a titian are a great heritage of the race but if england could secure high art and venetian glory of colour only by the sacrifice of her manufacturing supremacy and by the acceptance of national poverty then the pursuit of such artistic achievements would imply that we had ceased to possess natures of manly strength or to know the meaning of moral aims if we must choose between a titian and a lancashire cotton mill then in the name of manhood and of morality give us the cotton mill only the dilettantism of the studio that dilettantism which loosens the moral no less than the intellectual fibre and which is as fatal to rectitude of action as to correctness of reasoning power would make a different choice  you see also by this interesting and most memorable passage how completely the question is admitted to be one of ethicsthe only real point at issue being whether this face or that is developed on the truer moral principle  140 i assume however for the present that this apolline type is the kind of form you wish to reach and to represent and now observe instantly the whole question of manner of imitation is altered for us the fins of the fish the plumes of the swan and the flowing of the sungods hair are all represented by incisionsbut the incisions do sufficiently represent the fin and featherthey insufficiently represent the hair if i chose with a little more care and labor i could absolutely get the surface of the scales and spines of the fish and the expression of its mouth but no quantity of labor would obtain the real surface of a tress of apollos hair and the full expression of his mouth so that we are compelled at once to call the imagination to help us and say to it you know what the apollo chrysocomes must be like finish all this for yourself now the law under which imagination works is just that of other good workers you must give me clear orders show me what i have to do and where i am to begin and let me alone and the orders can be given quite clearly up to a certain point in form but they cannot be given clearly in color now that the subject is subtle all beauty of this high kind depends on harmony let but the slightest discord come into it and the finer the thing is the more fatal will be the flaw now on a flat surface i can command my color to be precisely what and where i mean it to be on a round one i cannot for all harmony depends first on the fixed proportion of the color of the light to that of the relative shadow and therefore if i fasten my color i must fasten my shade but on a round surface the shadow changes at every hour of the day and therefore all coloring which is expressive of form is impossible and if the form is fine and here there is nothing but what is fine you may bid farewell to color  141 farewell to color that is to say if the thing is to be seen distinctly and you have only wise people to show it to but if it is to be seen indistinctly at a distance color may become explanatory and if you have simple people to show it to color may be necessary to excite their imaginations though not to excite yours and the art is great always by meeting its conditions in the straightest way and if it is to please a multitude of innocent and bluntlyminded persons must express itself in the terms that will touch them else it is not good and i have to trace for you through the history of the past and possibilities of the future the expedients used by great sculptors to obtain clearness impressiveness or splendor and the manner of their appeal to the people under various light and shadow and with reference to different degrees of public intelligence such investigation resolving itself again and again as we proceed into questions absolutely ethical as for instance whether color is to be bright or dullthat is to say for a populace cheerful or heartlesswhether it is to be delicate or strongthat is to say for a populace attentive or careless whether it is to be a background like the sky for a procession of young men and maidens because your populace revere lifeor the shadow of the vault behind a corpse stained with drops of blackened blood for a populace taught to worship death every critical determination of rightness depends on the obedience to some ethic law by the most rational and therefore simplest means and you see how it depends most of all things on whether you are working for chosen persons or for the mob for the joy of the boudoir or of the borgo and if for the mob whether the mob of olympia or of st antoine phidias showing his jupiter for the first time hides behind the temple door to listen resolved afterwards greek rhythmizein to agalma pros to tois pleistois dokoun ou gar h√™geito mikran einai symboul√™n d√™mou tosoutou and truly as your people is in judgment and in multitude so must your sculpture be in glory an elementary principle which has been too long out of mind  142 i leave you to consider it since for some time we shall not again be able to take up the inquiries to which it leads but ultimately i do not doubt that you will rest satisfied in these following conclusions  1 not only sculpture but all the other fine arts must be for the people  2 they must be didactic to the people and that as their chief end the structural arts didactic in their manner the graphic arts in their matter also  3 and chiefly the great representative and imaginative artsthat is to say the drama and sculptureare to teach what is noble in past history and lovely in existing human and organic life  4 and the test of right manner of execution in these arts is that they strike in the most emphatic manner the rank of popular minds to which they are addressed  5 and the test of utmost fineness in execution in these arts is that they make themselves be forgotten in what they represent and so fulfil the words of their greatest master      the best in this kind are but shadows  footnotes  123 see date of delivery of lecture the picture was of a peasant girl of eleven or twelve years old peeling carrots by a cottage fire  124 in durers melencholia  125 turners in the hakewill series     lecture v  structure  december 1870   143 on previous occasions of addressing you i have endeavoured to show you first how sculpture is distinguished from other arts then its proper subjects then its proper method in the realization of these subjects today we must in the fourth place consider the means at its command for the accomplishment of these ends the nature of its materials and the mechanical or other difficulties of their treatment  and however doubtful we may have remained as to the justice of greek ideals or propriety of greek methods of representing them we may be certain that the example of the greeks will be instructive in all practical matters relating to this great art peculiarly their own i think even the evidence i have already laid before you is enough to convince you that it was by rightness and reality not by idealism or delightfulness only that their minds were finally guided and i am sure that before closing the present course i shall be able so far to complete that evidence as to prove to you that the commonly received notions of classic art are not only unfounded but even in many respects directly contrary to the truth you are constantly told that greece idealized whatever she contemplated she did the exact contrary she realized and verified it you are constantly told she sought only the beautiful she sought indeed with all her heart but she found because she never doubted that the search was to be consistent with propriety and common sense and the first thing you will always discern in greek work is the first which you ought to discern in all work namely that the object of it has been rational and has been obtained by simple and unostentatious means  144 that the object of the work has been rational consider how much that implies that it should be by all means seen to have been determined upon and carried through with sense and discretion these being gifts of intellect far more precious than any knowledge of mathematics or of the mechanical resources of art therefore also that it should be a modest and temperate work a structure fitted to the actual state of men proportioned to their actual size as animalsto their average strengthto their true necessitiesand to the degree of easy command they have over the forces and substances of nature  145 you see how much this law excludes all that is fondly magnificent insolently ambitious or vainly difficult there is indeed such a thing as magnanimity in design but never unless it be joined also with modesty and equanimity nothing extravagant monstrous strained or singular can be structurally beautiful no towers of babel envious of the skies no pyramids in mimicry of the mountains of the earth no streets that are a weariness to traverse nor temples that make pigmies of the worshippers  it is one of the primal merits and decencies of greek work that it was on the whole singularly small in scale and wholly within reach of sight to its finest details and indeed the best buildings that i know are thus modest and some of the best are minute jewel cases for sweet sculpture the parthenon would hardly attract notice if it were set by the charing cross railway station the church of the miracoli at venice the chapel of the rose at lucca and the chapel of the thorn at pisa would not i suppose all three together fill the tenth part cube of a transept of the crystal palace and they are better so  146 in the chapter on power in the seven lamps of architecture i have stated what seems at first the reverse of what i am saying now namely that it is better to have one grand building than any number of mean ones and that is true but you cannot command grandeur by size till you can command grace in minuteness and least of all remember will you so command it today when magnitude has become the chief exponent of folly and misery coordinate in the fraternal enormities of the factory and poorhousethe barracks and hospital and the final law in this matter is that if you require edifices only for the grace and health of mankind and build them without pretence and without chicanery they will be sublime on a modest scale and lovely with little decoration  147 from these principles of simplicity and temperance two very severely fixed laws of construction follow namely first that our structure to be beautiful must be produced with tools of men and secondly that it must be composed of natural substances first i say produced with tools of men all fine art requires the application of the whole strength and subtlety of the body so that such art is not possible to any sickly person but involves the action and force of a strong mans arm from the shoulder as well as the delicatest touch of his finger and it is the evidence that this full and fine strength has been spent on it which makes the art executively noble so that no instrument must be used habitually which is either too heavy to be delicately restrained or too small and weak to transmit a vigorous impulse much less any mechanical aid such as would render the sensibility of the fingers ineffectual126  148 of course any kind of work in glass or in metal on a large scale involves some painful endurance of heat and working in clay some habitual endurance of cold but the point beyond which the effort must not be carried is marked by loss of power of manipulation as long as the eyes and fingers have complete command of the material as a glass blower has for instance in doing fine ornamental workthe law is not violated but all our great engine and furnace work in gunmaking and the like is degrading to the intellect and no nation can long persist in it without losing many of its human faculties nay even the use of machinery other than the common rope and pully for the lifting of weights is degrading to architecture the invention of expedients for the raising of enormous stones has always been a characteristic of partly savage or corrupted races a block of marble not larger than a cart with a couple of oxen could carry and a crossbeam with a couple of pulleys raise is as large as should generally be used in any building the employment of large masses is sure to lead to vulgar exhibitions of geometrical arrangement127 and to draw away the attention from the sculpture in general rocks naturally break into such pieces as the human beings that have to build with them can easily lift and no larger should be sought for  149 in this respect and in many other subtle ways the law that the work is to be with tools of men is connected with the farther condition of its modesty that it is to be wrought in substance provided by nature and to have a faithful respect to all the essential qualities of such substance  and here i must ask your attention to the idea and more than ideathe fact involved in that infinitely misused term providentia when applied to the divine power in its truest sense and scholarly use it is a human virtue greek prom√™theia the personal type of it is in prometheus and all the first power of greek techn√™ is from him as compared to the weakness of days when men without foresight greek ephyron eik√™ panta but so far as we use the word providence as an attribute of the maker and giver of all things it does not mean that in a shipwreck he takes care of the passengers who are to be saved and takes none of those who are to be drowned but it does mean that every race of creatures is born into the world under circumstances of approximate adaptation to its necessities and beyond all others the ingenious and observant race of man is surrounded with elements naturally good for his food pleasant to his sight and suitable for the subjects of his ingenuitythe stone metal and clay of the earth he walks upon lending themselves at once to his hand for all manner of workmanship  150 thus his truest respect for the law of the entire creation is shown by his making the most of what he can get most easily and there is no virtue of art nor application of common sense more sacredly necessary than this respect to the beauty of natural substance and the ease of local use neither are there any other precepts of construction so vital as thesethat you show all the strength of your material tempt none of its weaknesses and do with it only what can be simply and permanently done  151 thus all good building will be with rocks or pebbles or burnt clay but with no artificial compound all good painting with common oils and pigments on common canvas paper plaster or woodadmitting sometimes for precious work precious things but all applied in a simple and visible way the highest imitative art should not indeed at first sight call attention to the means of it but even that at length should do so distinctly and provoke the observer to take pleasure in seeing how completely the workman is master of the particular material he has used and how beautiful and desirable a substance it was for work of that kind in oil painting its unctious quality is to be delighted in in fresco its chalky quality in glass its transparency in wood its grain in marble its softness in porphyry its hardness in iron its toughness in a flint country one should feel the delightfulness of having flints to pick up and fasten together into rugged walls in a marble country one should be always more and more astonished at the exquisite colour and structure of marble in a slate country one should feel as if every rock cleft itself only for the sake of being built with conveniently  illustration plate xmarble masonry in the duomo of verona  152 now for sculpture there are briefly two materialsclay and stone for glass is only a clay that gets clear and brittle as it cools and metal a clay that gets opaque and tough as it cools indeed the true use of gold in this world is only as a very pretty and very ductile clay which you can spread as flat as you like spin as fine as you like and which will neither crack nor tarnish  all the arts of sculpture in clay may be summed up under the word plastic and all of those in stone under the word glyptic  153 sculpture in clay will accordingly include all cast brickwork pottery and tilework128a somewhat important branch of human skill next to the potters work you have all the arts in porcelain glass enamel and metal everything that is to say playful and familiar in design much of what is most felicitously inventive and in bronze or gold most precious and permanent  154 sculpture in stone whether granite gem or marble while we accurately use the general term glyptic for it may be thought of with perhaps the most clear force under the english word engraving for from the mere angular incision which the greek consecrated in the triglyphs of his greatest order of architecture grow forth all the arts of basrelief and methods of localized groups of sculpture connected with each other and with architecture as in another direction the arts of engraving and woodcutting themselves  155 over all this vast field of human skill the laws which i have enunciated to you rule with inevitable authority embracing the greatest and consenting to the humblest exertion strong to repress the ambition of nations if fantastic and vain but gentle to approve the efforts of children made in accordance with the visible intention of the maker of all flesh and the giver of all intelligence these laws therefore i now repeat and beg of you to observe them as irrefragable  1 that the work is to be with tools of men  2 that it is to be in natural materials  3 that it is to exhibit the virtues of those materials and aim at no quality inconsistent with them  4 that its temper is to be quiet and gentle in harmony with common needs and in consent to common intelligence  we will now observe the bearing of these laws on the elementary conditions of the art at present under discussion  156 there is first work in baked clay which contracts as it dries and is very easily frangible then you must put no work into it requiring niceness in dimension nor any so elaborate that it would be a great loss if it were broken but as the clay yields at once to the hand and the sculptor can do anything with it he likes it is a material for him to sketch with and play withto record his fancies in before they escape himand to express roughly for people who can enjoy such sketches what he has not time to complete in marble the clay being ductile lends itself to all softness of line being easily frangible it would be ridiculous to give it sharp edges so that a blunt and massive rendering of graceful gesture will be its natural function but as it can be pinched or pulled or thrust in a moment into projection which it would take hours of chiselling to get in stone it will also properly be used for all fantastic and grotesque form not involving sharp edges therefore what is true of chalk and charcoal for painters is equally true of clay for sculptors they are all most precious materials for true masters but tempt the false ones into fatal license and to judge rightly of terracotta work is a far higher reach of skill in sculpturecriticism than to distinguish the merits of a finished statue  157 we have secondly work in bronze iron gold and other metals in which the laws of structure are still more definite  all kinds of twisted and wreathen work on every scale become delightful when wrought in ductile or tenacious metal but metal which is to be hammered into form separates itself into two great divisionssolid and flat  illustration plate xithe first elements of sculpture  incised outline and opened space  a in solid metal work i e metal cast thick enough to resist bending whether it be hollow or not violent and various projection may be admitted which would be offensive in marble but no sharp edges because it is difficult to produce them with the hammer but since the permanence of the material justifies exquisiteness of workmanship whatever delicate ornamentation can be wrought with rounded surfaces may be advisedly introduced and since the colour of bronze or any other metal is not so pleasantly representative of flesh as that of marble a wise sculptor will depend less on flesh contour and more on picturesque accessories which though they would be vulgar if attempted in stone are rightly entertaining in bronze or silver verrochios statue of colleone at venice cellinis perseus at florence and ghibertis gates at florence are models of bronze treatment  b when metal is beaten thin it becomes what is technically called plate the flattened thing and may be treated advisably in two ways one by beating it out into bosses the other by cutting it into strips and ramifications the vast schools of goldsmiths work and of iron decoration founded on these two principles have had the most powerful influences over general taste in all ages and countries one of the simplest and most interesting elementary examples of the treatment of flat metal by cutting is the common branched iron bar fig 8 used to close small apertures in countries possessing any good primitive style of ironwork formed by alternate cuts on its sides and the bending down of the several portions the ordinary domestic window balcony of verona is formed by mere ribands of iron bent into curves as studiously refined as those of a greek vase and decorated merely by their own terminations in spiral volutes  illustration fig 8  all cast work in metal unfinished by hand is inadmissible in any school of living art since it cannot possess the perfection of form due to a permanent substance and the continual sight of it is destructive of the faculty of taste but metal stamped with precision as in coins is to sculpture what engraving is to painting  158 thirdly stonesculpture divides itself into three schools one in very hard material one in very soft and one in that of centrally useful consistence  a the virtue of work in hard material is the expression of form in shallow relief or in broad contours deep cutting in hard material is inadmissible and the art at once pompous and trivial of gem engraving has been in the last degree destructive of the honour and service of sculpture  b the virtue of work in soft material is deep cutting with studiously graceful disposition of the masses of light and shade the greater number of flamboyant churches of france are cut out of an adhesive chalk and the fantasy of their latest decoration was in great part induced by the facility of obtaining contrast of black space undercut with white tracery easily left in sweeping and interwoven rodsthe lavish use of wood in domestic architecture materially increasing the habit of delight in branched complexity of line these points however i must reserve for illustration in my lectures on architecture today i shall limit myself to the illustration of elementary sculptural structure in the best materialthat is to say in crystalline marble neither soft enough to encourage the caprice of the workman nor hard enough to resist his will  159 c by the true providence of nature the rock which is thus submissive has been in some places stained with the fairest colours and in others blanched into the fairest absence of colour that can be found to give harmony to inlaying or dignity to form the possession by the greeks of their greek leukos lithos was indeed the first circumstance regulating the development of their art it enabled them at once to express their passion for light by executing the faces hands and feet of their dark wooden statues in white marble so that what we look upon only with pleasure for fineness of texture was to them an imitation of the luminous body of the deity shining from behind its dark robes and ivory afterwards is employed in their best statues for its yet more soft and fleshlike brightness receptive also of the most delicate colourtherefore to this day the favourite ground of miniature painters in like manner the existence of quarries of peachcoloured marble within twelve miles of verona and of white marble and green serpentine between pisa and genoa defined the manner both of sculpture and architecture for all the gothic buildings of italy no subtlety of education could have formed a high school of art without these materials  160 next to the colour the fineness of substance which will take a perfectly sharp edge is essential and this not merely to admit fine delineation in the sculpture itself but to secure a delightful precision in placing the blocks of which it is composed for the possession of too fine marble as far as regards the work itself is a temptation instead of an advantage to an inferior sculptor and the abuse of the facility of undercutting especially of undercutting so as to leave profiles defined by an edge against shadow is one of the chief causes of decline of style in such encrusted basreliefs as those of the certosa of pavia and its contemporary monuments but no undue temptation ever exists as to the fineness of block fitting nothing contributes to give so pure and healthy a tone to sculpture as the attention of the builder to the jointing of his stones and his having both the power to make them fit so perfectly as not to admit of the slightest portion of cement showing externally and the skill to insure if needful and to suggest always their stability in cementless construction plate x represents a piece of entirely fine lombardic building the central portion of the arch in the duomo of verona which corresponds to that of the porch of san zenone represented in plate i in both these pieces of building the only line that traces the architrave round the arch is that of the masonry joint yet this line is drawn with extremest subtlety with intention of delighting the eye by its relation of varied curvature to the arch itself and it is just as much considered as the finest penline of a raphael drawing every joint of the stone is used in like manner as a thin black line which the slightest sign of cement would spoil like a blot and so proud is the builder of his fine jointing and so fearless of any distortion or strain spoiling the adjustment afterwards that in one place he runs his joint quite gratuitously through a basrelief and gives the keystone its only sign of preeminence by the minute inlaying of the head of the lamb into the stone of the course above  161 proceeding from this fine jointing to fine draughtsmanship you have in the very outset and earliest stage of sculpture your flat stone surface given you as a sheet of white paper on which you are required to produce the utmost effect you can with the simplest means cutting away as little of the stone as may be to save both time and trouble and above all leaving the block itself when shaped as solid as you can that its surface may better resist weather and the carved parts be as much protected as possible by the masses left around them  162 the first thing to be done is clearly to trace the outline of subject with an incision approximating in section to that of the furrow of a plough only more equalsided a fine sculptor strikes it as his chisel leans freely on marble an egyptian in hard rock cuts it sharp as in cuneiform inscriptions in any case you have a result somewhat like the upper figure plate xi in which i show you the most elementary indication of form possible by cutting the outline of the typical archaic greek head with an incision like that of a greek triglyph only not so precise in edge or slope as it is to be modified afterwards  163 now the simplest thing we can do next is to round off the flat surface within the incision and put what form we can get into the feebler projection of it thus obtained the egyptians do this often with exquisite skill and then as i showed you in a former lecture colour the wholeusing the incision as an outline such a method of treatment is capable of good service in representing at little cost of pains subjects in distant effect and common or merely picturesque subjects even near to show you what it is capable of and what coloured sculpture would be in its rudest type i have prepared the coloured relief of the john dory129 as a natural history drawing for distant effect you know also that i meant him to be uglyas ugly as any creature can well be in time i hope to show you prettier thingspeacocks and kingfishersbutterflies and flowers on grounds of gold and the like as they were in byzantine work i shall expect you in right use of your √¶sthetic faculties to like those better than what i show you today but it is now a question of method only and if you will look after the lecture first at the mere white relief and then see how much may be gained by a few dashes of colour such as a practised workman could lay in a quarter of an hourthe whole forming if well done almost a deceptive imageyou will at least have the range of power in egyptian sculpture clearly expressed to you  164 but for fine sculpture we must advance by far other methods if we carve the subject with real delicacy the cast shadow of the incision will interfere with its outline so that for representation of beautiful things you must clear away the ground about it at all events for a little distance as the law of work is to use the least pains possible you clear it only just as far back as you need and then for the sake of order and finish you give the space a geometrical outline by taking in this case the simplest i cana circlei can clear the head with little labor in the removal of surface round it see the lower figure in plate xi  165 now these are the first terms of all wellconstructed basrelief the mass you have to treat consists of a piece of stone which however you afterwards carve it can but at its most projecting point reach the level of the external plane surface out of which it was mapped and defined by a depression round it that depression being at first a mere trench then a moat of certain width of which the outer sloping bank is in contact as a limiting geometrical line with the laterally salient portions of sculpture this i repeat is the primal construction of good basrelief implying first perfect protection to its surface from any transverse blow and a geometrically limited space to be occupied by the design into which it shall pleasantly and as you shall ultimately see ingeniously contract itself implying secondly a determined depth of projection which it shall rarely reach and never exceed and implying finally the production of the whole piece with the least possible labor of chisel and loss of stone  166 and these which are the first are very nearly the last constructive laws of sculpture you will be surprised to find how much they include and how much of minor propriety in treatment their observance involves  in a very interesting essay on the architecture of the parthenon by the professor of architecture of the ecole polytechnique m emile boutmy you will find it noticed that the greeks do not usually weaken by carving the constructive masses of their building but put their chief sculpture in the empty spaces between the triglyphs or beneath the roof this is true but in so doing they merely build their panel instead of carving it they accept no less than the goths the laws of recess and limitation as being vital to the safety and dignity of their design and their noblest recumbent statues are constructively the fillings of the acute extremity of a panel in the form of an obtusely summitted triangle  167 in gradual descent from that severest type you will find that an immense quantity of sculpture of all times and styles may be generally embraced under the notion of a mass hewn out of or at least placed in a panel or recess deepening it may be into a niche the sculpture being always designed with reference to its position in such recess and therefore to the effect of the building out of which the recess is hewn  but for the sake of simplifying our inquiry i will at first suppose no surrounding protective ledge to exist and that the area of stone we have to deal with is simply a flat slab extant from a flat surface depressed all round it  168 a flat slab observe the flatness of surface is essential to the problem of basrelief the lateral limit of the panel may or may not be required but the vertical limit of surface must be expressed and the art of basrelief is to give the effect of true form on that condition for observe if nothing more were needed than to make first a cast of a solid form then cut it in half and apply the half of it to the flat surfaceif for instance to carve a basrelief of an apple all i had to do was to cut my sculpture of the whole apple in half and pin it to the wall any ordinary trained sculptor or even a mechanical workman could produce basrelief but the business is to carve a round thing out of flat thing to carve an apple out of a biscuitto conquer as a subtle florentine has here conquered130 his marble so as not only to get motion into what is most rigidly fixed but to get boundlessness into what is most narrowly bounded and carve madonna and child rolling clouds flying angels and space of heavenly air behind all out of a film of stone not the third of an inch thick where it is thickest  169 carried however to such a degree of subtlety as this and with so ambitious and extravagant aim basrelief becomes a tourdeforce and you know i have just told you all toursdeforce are wrong the true law of basrelief is to begin with a depth of incision proportioned justly to the distance of the observer and the character of the subject and out of that rationally determined depth neither increased for ostentation of effect nor diminished for ostentation of skill to do the utmost that will be easily visible to an observer supposing him to give an average human amount of attention but not to peer into or critically scrutinize the work  170 i cannot arrest you today by the statement of any of the laws of sight and distance which determine the proper depth of basrelief suppose that depth fixed then observe what a pretty problem or rather continually varying cluster of problems will be offered to us you might at first imagine that given what we may call our scale of solidity or scale of depth the diminution from nature would be in regular proportion as for instance if the real depth of your subject be suppose a foot and the depth of your basrelief an inch then the parts of the real subject which were six inches round the side of it would be carved you might imagine at the depth of halfaninch and so the whole thing mechanically reduced to scale but not a bit of it here is a greek basrelief of a chariot with two horses upper figure plate xxi your whole subject has therefore the depth of two horses side by side say six or eight feet your basrelief has on the scale131 say the depth of the third of an inch now if you gave only the sixth of an inch for the depth of the off horse and dividing him again only the twelfth of an inch for that of each foreleg you would make him look a mile away from the other and his own forelegs a mile apart actually the greek has made the near leg of the off horse project much beyond the off leg of the near horse and has put nearly the whole depth and power of his relief into the breast of the off horse while for the whole distance from the head of the nearest to the neck of the other he has allowed himself only a shallow line knowing that if he deepened that he would give the nearest horse the look of having a thick nose whereas by keeping that line down he has not only made the head itself more delicate but detached it from the other by giving no cast shadow and left the shadow below to serve for thickness of breast cutting it as sharp down as he possibly can to make it bolder  171 here is a fine piece of business we have got intoeven supposing that all this selection and adaptation were to be contrived under constant laws and related only to the expression of given forms but the greek sculptor all this while is not only debating and deciding how to show what he wants but much more debating and deciding what as he cant show everything he will choose to show at all thus being himself interested and supposing that you will be in the manner of the driving he takes great pains to carve the reins to show you where they are knotted and how they are fastened round the drivers waist you recollect how hippolytus was lost by doing that but he does not care the least bit about the chariot and having rather more geometry than he likes in the cross and circle of one wheel of it entirely omits the other  172 i think you must see by this time that the sculptors is not quite a trade which you can teach like brickmaking nor its produce an article of which you can supply any quantity demanded for the next railroad waitingroom it may perhaps indeed seem to you that in the difficulties thus presented by it basrelief involves more direct exertion of intellect than finished solid sculpture it is not so however the questions involved by basrelief are of a more curious and amusing kind requiring great variety of expedients though none except such as a true workmanly instinct delights in inventing and invents easily but design in solid sculpture involves considerations of weight in mass of balance of perspective and opposition in projecting forms and of restraint for those which must not project such as none but the greatest masters have ever completely solved and they not always the difficulty of arranging the composition so as to be agreeable from points of view on all sides of it being itself arduous enough  173 thus far i have been speaking only of the laws of structure relating to the projection of the mass which becomes itself the sculpture another most interesting group of constructive laws governs its relation to the line that contains or defines it  in your standard series i have placed a photograph of the south transept of rouen cathedral strictly speaking all standards of gothic are of the thirteenth century but in the fourteenth certain qualities of richness are obtained by the diminution of restraint out of which we must choose what is best in their kinds the pedestals of the statues which once occupied the lateral recesses are as you see covered with groups of figures enclosed each in a quatrefoil panel the spaces between this panel and the enclosing square being filled with sculptures of animals  you cannot anywhere find a more lovely piece of fancy or more illustrative of the quantity of result that may be obtained with low and simple chiselling the figures are all perfectly simple in drapery the story told by lines of action only in the main group no accessories being admitted there is no undercutting anywhere nor exhibition of technical skill but the fondest and tenderest appliance of it and one of the principal charms of the whole is the adaptation of every subject to its quaint limit the tale must be told within the four petals of the quatrefoil and the wildest and playfullest beasts must never come out of their narrow corners the attention with which spaces of this kind are filled by the gothic designers is not merely a beautiful compliance with architectural requirements but a definite assertion of their delight in the restraint of law for in illuminating books although if they chose it they might have designed floral ornaments as we now usually do rambling loosely over the leaves and although in later works such license is often taken by them in all books of the fine time the wandering tendrils are enclosed by limits approximately rectilinear and in gracefullest branching often detach themselves from the right line only by curvature of extreme severity  174 since the darkness and extent of shadow by which the sculpture is relieved necessarily vary with the depth of the recess there arise a series of problems in deciding which the wholesome desire for emphasis by means of shadow is too often exaggerated by the ambition of the sculptor to show his skill in undercutting the extreme of vulgarity is usually reached when the entire basrelief is cut hollow underneath as in much indian and chinese work so as to relieve its forms against an absolute darkness but no formal law can ever be given for exactly the same thing may be beautifully done for a wise purpose by one person which is basely done and to no purpose or to a bad one by another thus the desire for emphasis itself may be the craving of a deadened imagination or the passion of a vigorous one and relief against shadow may be sought by one man only for sensation and by another for intelligibility john of pisa undercuts fiercely in order to bring out the vigour of life which no level contour could render the lombardi of venice undercut delicately in order to obtain beautiful lines and edges of faultless precision but the base indian craftsmen undercut only that people may wonder how the chiselling was done through the holes or that they may see every monster white against black  175 yet here again we are met by another necessity for discrimination there may be a true delight in the inlaying of white on dark as there is a true delight in vigorous rounding nevertheless the general law is always that the lighter the incisions and the broader the surface the grander c√¶teris paribus will be the work of the structural terms of that work you now know enough to understand that the schools of good sculpture considered in relation to projection divide themselves into four entirely distinct groups       1st flat relief in which the surface is in many places      absolutely flat and the expression depends greatly on the      lines of its outer contour and on fine incisions within      them       2nd round relief in which as in the best coins the      sculptured mass projects so as to be capable of complete      modulation into form but is not anywhere undercut the      formation of a coin by the blow of a die necessitates of      course the severest obedience to this law       3rd edged relief undercutting admitted so as to throw out      the forms against a background of shadow       4th full relief the statue completely solid in form and      unreduced in retreating depth of it yet connected locally      with some definite part of the building so as to be still      dependent on the shadow of its background and direction of      protective line  176 let me recommend you at once to take what pains may be needful to enable you to distinguish these four kinds of sculpture for the distinctions between them are not founded on mere differences in gradation of depth they are truly four species or orders of sculpture separated from each other by determined characters i have used you may have noted hitherto in my lectures the word basrelief almost indiscriminately for all because the degree of lowness or highness of relief is not the question but the method of relief observe again therefore  a if a portion of the surface is absolutely flat you have the first orderflat relief  b if every portion of the surface is rounded but none undercut you have round reliefessentially that of seals and coins  c if any part of the edges be undercut but the general projection of solid form reduced you have what i think you may conveniently call foliate reliefthe parts of the design overlapping each other in places like edges of leaves  d if the undercutting is bold and deep and the projection of solid form unreduced you have full relief  learn these four names at once by heart      flat relief     round relief     foliate relief     full relief  and whenever you look at any piece of sculpture determine first to which of these classes it belongs and then consider how the sculptor has treated it with reference to the necessary structurethat reference remember being partly to the mechanical conditions of the material partly to the means of light and shade at his command  illustration plate xiibranch of phillyrea dark purple  177 to take a single instance you know for these many years i have been telling our architects with all the force of voice i had in me that they could design nothing until they could carve natural forms rightly many imagine that work was easy but judge for yourselves whether it be or not in plate xii i have drawn with approximate accuracy a cluster of phillyrea leaves as they grow now if we wanted to cut them in basrelief the first thing we should have to consider would be the position of their outline on the marblehere it is as far down as the spring of the leaves but do you suppose that is what an ordinary sculptor could either lay for his first sketch or contemplate as a limit to be worked down to then consider how the interlacing and springing of the leaves can be expressed within this outline it must be done by leaving such projection in the marble as will take the light in the same proportion as the drawing doesand a florentine workman could do it for close sight without driving one incision deeper or raising a single surface higher than the eighth of an inch indeed no sculptor of the finest time would design such a complex cluster of leaves as this except for bronze or iron work they would take simpler contours for marble but the laws of treatment would under these conditions remain just as strict and you may perhaps believe me now when i tell you that in any piece of fine structural sculpture by the great masters there is more subtlety and noble obedience to lovely laws than could be explained to you if i took twenty lectures to do it in instead of one  illustration fig 9  178 there remains yet a point of mechanical treatment on which i have not yet touched at all nor that the least importantnamely the actual method and style of handling a great sculptor uses his tools exactly as a painter his pencil and you may recognize the decision of his thought and glow of his temper no less in the workmanship than the design the modern system of modelling the work in clay getting it into form by machinery and by the hands of subordinates and touching it at last if indeed the so called sculptor touch it at all only to correct their inefficiencies renders the production of good work in marble a physical impossibility the first result of it is that the sculptor thinks in clay instead of marble and loses his instinctive sense of the proper treatment of a brittle substance the second is that neither he nor the public recognize the touch of the chisel as expressive of personal feeling or power and that nothing is looked for except mechanical polish  179 the perfectly simple piece of greek relief represented in plate xiii will enable you to understand at onceexamination of the original at your leisure will prevent you i trust from ever forgettingwhat is meant by the virtue of handling in sculpture  illustration plate xiiigreek flat relief and sculpture by edged incision  the projection of the heads of the four horses one behind the other is certainly not more altogether than threequarters of an inch from the flat ground and the one in front does not in reality project more than the one behind it yet by mere drawing132 you see the sculptor has got them to appear to recede in due order and by the soft rounding of the flesh surfaces and modulation of the veins he has taken away all look of flatness from the necks he has drawn the eyes and nostrils with dark incision careful as the finest touches of a painters pencil and then at last when he comes to the manes he has let fly hand and chisel with their full force and where a base workman above all if he had modelled the thing in clay first would have lost himself in laborious imitation of hair the greek has struck the tresses out with angular incisions deep driven every one in appointed place and deliberate curve yet flowing so free under his noble hand that you cannot alter without harm the bending of any single ridge nor contract nor extend a point of them and if you will look back to plate ix you will see the difference between this sharp incision used to express horsehair and the soft incision with intervening rounded ridge used to express the hair of apollo chrysocomes and beneath the obliquely ridged incision used to express the plumes of his swan in both these cases the handling being much more slow because the engraving is in metal but the structural importance of incision as the means of effect never lost sight of finally here are two actual examples of the work in marble of the two great schools of the world one a little fortune standing tiptoe on the globe of the earth its surface traced with lines in hexagons not chaotic under fortunes feet greek this and by a trained workmandug up in the temple of neptune at corfuand here a florentine portraitmarble found in the recent alterations face downwards under the pavement of sta maria novella133 both of them firstrate of their kind and both of them while exquisitely finished at the telling points showing on all their unregarded surfaces the rough furrow of the fastdriven chisel as distinctly as the edge of a common pavingstone  180 let me suggest to you in conclusion one most interesting point of mental expression in these necessary aspects of finely executed sculpture i have already again and again pressed on your attention the beginning of the arts of men in the make and use of the ploughshare read more carefullyyou might indeed do well to learn at once by heartthe twentyseven lines of the fourth pythian which describe the ploughing of jason there is nothing grander extant in human fancy nor set down in human words but this great mythical expression of the conquest of the earthclay and bruteforce by vital human energy will become yet more interesting to you when you reflect what enchantment has been cut on whiter clay by the tracing of finer furrowswhat the delicate and consummate arts of man have done by the ploughing of marble and granite and iron you will learn daily more and more as you advance in actual practice how the primary manual art of engraving in the steadiness clearness and irrevocableness of it is the best artdiscipline that can be given either to mind or hand134 you will recognize one law of right pronouncing itself in the wellresolved work of every age you will see the firmly traced and irrevocable incision determining not only the forms but in great part the moral temper of all vitally progressive art you will trace the same principle and power in the furrows which the oblique sun shows on the granite of his own egyptian cityin the white scratch of the stylus through the colour on a greek vasein the first delineation on the wet wall of the groups of an italian fresco in the unerring and unalterable touch of the great engraver of n√ºrembergand in the deep driven and deep bitten ravines of metal by which turner closed in embossed limits the shadows of the liber studiorum  learn therefore in its full extent the force of the great greek word greek charass√¥and give me pardonif you think pardon needed that i ask you also to learn the full meaning of the english word derived from it here at the ford of the oxen of jason are other furrows to be driven than these in the marble of pentelicus the fruitfullest or the fatallest of all ploughing is that by the thoughts of your youth on the white field of its imagination for by these either down to the disturbed spirit greek kekoptai kai charassetai pedon or around the quiet spirit and on all the laws of conduct that hold it as a fair vase its frankincense are ordained the pure colours and engraved the just characters of √Üonian life  footnotes  126 nothing is more wonderful or more disgraceful among the forms of ignorance engendered by modern vulgar occupations in pursuit of gain than the unconsciousness now total that fine art is essentially athletic i received a letter from birmingham some little time since inviting me to see how much in glass manufacture machinery excelled rude hand work the writer had not the remotest conception that he might as well have asked me to come and see a mechanical boatrace rowed by automata and how much machinery excelled rude armwork  127 such as the sculptureless arch of waterloo bridge for instance referred to in the third lecture ¬ß 84  128 it is strange at this day to think of the relation of the athenian ceramicus to the french tilefields tileries or tuileries and how these last may yet becomehave already partly becomethe potters field bloodbought december 1870  129 this relief is now among the other casts which i have placed in the lower school in the university galleries  130 the reference is to a cast from a small and low relief of florentine work in the kensington museum  131 the actual basrelief is on a coin and the projection not above the twentieth of an inch but i magnified it in photograph for this lecture so as to represent a relief with about the third of an inch for maximum projection  132 this plate has been executed from a drawing by mr burgess in which he has followed the curves of incision with exquisite care and preserved the effect of the surface of the stone where a photograph would have lost it by exaggerating accidental stains  133 these two marbles will always henceforward be sufficiently accessible for reference in my room at corpus christi college  134 that it was also in some cases the earliest that the greeks gave is proved by lucians account of his first lesson at his uncles the greek enkopeus literally incutterbeing the first tool put into his hand and an earthenware tablet to cut upon which the boy pressing too hard presently breaksgets beatengoes home crying and becomes after his dream above quoted a philosopher instead of a sculptor     lecture vi  the school of athens  december 1870   181 it can scarcely be needful for me to tell even the younger members of my present audience that the conditions necessary for the production of a perfect school of sculpture have only twice been met in the history of the world and then for a short time nor for short time only but also in narrow districts namely in the valleys and islands of ionian greece and in the strip of land deposited by the arno between the apennine crests and the sea  all other schools except these two led severally by athens in the fifth century before christ and by florence in the fifteenth of our own era are imperfect and the best of them are derivative these two are consummate in themselves and the origin of what is best in others  182 and observe these athenian and florentine schools are both of equal rank as essentially original and independent the florentine being subsequent to the greek borrowed much from it but it would have existed just as stronglyand perhaps in some respects more noblyhad it been the first instead of the latter of the two the task set to each of these mightiest of the nations was indeed practically the same and as hard to the one as to the other the greeks found phoenician and etruscan art monstrous and had to make them human the italians found byzantine and norman art monstrous and had to make them human the original power in the one case is easily traced in the other it has partly to be unmasked because the change at florence was in many points suggested and stimulated by the former school but we mistake in supposing that athens taught florence the laws of design she taught her in reality only the duty of truth  183 you remember that i told you the highest art could do no more than rightly represent the human form this is the simple test then of a perfect schoolthat it has represented the human form so that it is impossible to conceive of its being better done and that i repeat has been accomplished twice only once in athens once in florence and so narrow is the excellence even of these two exclusive schools that it cannot be said of either of them that they represented the entire human form the greeks perfectly drew and perfectly moulded the body and limbs but there is so far as i am aware no instance of their representing the face as well as any great italian on the other hand the italian painted and carved the face insuperably but i believe there is no instance of his having perfectly represented the body which by command of his religion it became his pride to despise and his safety to mortify  184 the general course of your study here renders it desirable that you should be accurately acquainted with the leading principles of greek sculpture but i cannot lay these before you without giving undue prominence to some of the special merits of that school unless i previously indicate the relation it holds to the more advanced though less disciplined excellence of christian art  in this and the last lecture of the present course135 i shall endeavour therefore to mass for you in such rude and diagramlike outline as may be possible or intelligible the main characteristics of the two schools completing and correcting the details of comparison afterwards and not answering observe at present for any generalization i give you except as a ground for subsequent closer and more qualified statements  and in carrying out this parallel i shall speak indifferently of works of sculpture and of the modes of painting which propose to themselves the same objects as sculpture and this indeed florentine as opposed to venetian painting and that of athens in the fifth century nearly always did  185 i begin therefore by comparing two designs of the simplest kindengravings or at least linear drawings both one on clay one on copper made in the central periods of each style and representing the same goddessaphrodite they are now set beside each other in your rudimentary series the first is from a patera lately found at camirus authoritatively assigned by mr newton in his recent catalogue to the best period of greek art the second is from one of the series of engravings executed probably by baccio baldini in 1485 out of which i chose your first practical exercisethe sceptre of apollo i cannot however make the comparison accurate in all respects for i am obliged to set the restricted type of the aphrodite urania of the greeks beside the universal deity conceived by the italian as governing the air earth and sea nevertheless the restriction in the mind of the greek and expatiation in that of the florentine are both characteristic the greek venus urania is flying in heaven her power over the waters symbolized by her being borne by a swan and her power over the earth by a single flower in her right hand but the italian aphrodite is rising out of the actual sea and only half risen her limbs are still in the sea her merely animal strength filling the waters with their life but her body to the loins is in the sunshine her face raised to the sky her hand is about to lay a garland of flowers on the earth  186 the venus urania of the greeks in her relation to men has power only over lawful and domestic love therefore she is fully dressed and not only quite dressed but most daintily and trimly her feet delicately sandalled her gown spotted with little stars her hair brushed exquisitely smooth at the top of her head trickling in minute waves down her forehead and though because theres such a quantity of it she cant possibly help having a chignon look how tightly she has fastened it in with her broad fillet of course she is married so she must wear a cap with pretty minute pendant jewels at the border and a very small necklace all that her husband can properly afford just enough to go closely round the neck and no more on the contrary the aphrodite of the italian being universal love is purenaked and her long hair is thrown wild to the wind and sea  these primal differences in the symbolism observe are only because the artists are thinking of separate powers they do not necessarily involve any national distinction in feeling but the differences i have next to indicate are essential and characterize the two opposed national modes of mind  187 first and chiefly the greek aphrodite is a very pretty person and the italian a decidedly plain one that is because a greek thought no one could possibly love any but pretty people but an italian thought that love could give dignity to the meanest form that it inhabited and light to the poorest that it looked upon so his aphrodite will not condescend to be pretty  188 secondly in the greek venus the breasts are broad and full though perfectly severe in their almost conical profileyou are allowed on purpose to see the outline of the right breast under the chitonalso the right arm is left bare and you can just see the contour of the front of the right limb and knee both arm and limb pure and firm but lovely the plant she holds in her hand is a branching and flowering one the seed vessel prominent these signs all mean that her essential function is childbearing  on the contrary in the italian venus the breasts are so small as to be scarcely traceable the body strong and almost masculine in its angles the arms meagre and unattractive and she lays a decorative garland of flowers on the earth these signs mean that the italian thought of love as the strength of an eternal spirit for ever helpful and for ever crowned with flowers that neither know seedtime nor harvest and bloom where there is neither death nor birth  189 thirdly the greek aphrodite is entirely calm and looks straight forward not one feature of her face is disturbed or seems ever to have been subject to emotion the italian aphrodite looks up her face all quivering and burning with passion and wasting anxiety the greek one is quiet selfpossessed and selfsatisfied the italian incapable of rest she has had no thought nor care for herself her hair has been bound by a fillet like the greeks but it is now all fallen loose and clotted with the sea or clinging to her body only the front tress of it is caught by the breeze from her raised forehead and lifted in the place where the tongues of fire rest on the brows in the early christian pictures of pentecost and the waving fires abide upon the heads of angelicos seraphim  190 there are almost endless points of interest great and small to be noted in these differences of treatment this binding of the hair by the single fillet marks the straight course of one great system of art method from that greek head which i showed you on the archaic coin of the seventh century before christ to this of the fifteenth of our own eranay when you look close you will see the entire action of the head depends on one lock of hair falling back from the ear which it does in compliance with the old greek observance of its being bent there by the pressure of the helmet that rippling of it down her shoulders comes from the athena of corinth the raising of it on her forehead from the knot of the hair of diana changed into the vestal fire of the angels but chiefly the calmness of the features in the one face and their anxiety in the other indicate first indeed the characteristic difference in every conception of the schools the greek never representing expression the italian primarily seeking it but far more mark for us here the utter change in the conception of love from the tranquil guide and queen of a happy terrestrial domestic life accepting its immediate pleasures and natural duties to the agonizing hope of an infinite good and the ever mingled joy and terror of a love divine in jealousy crying set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave  the vast issues dependent on this change in the conception of the ruling passion of the human soul i will endeavour to show you on a future occasion in my present lecture i shall limit myself to the definition of the temper of greek sculpture and of its distinctions from florentine in the treatment of any subject whatever be it love or hatred hope or despair  these great differences are mainly the following  191 1 a greek never expresses momentary passion a florentine looks to momentary passion as the ultimate object of his skill  when you are next in london look carefully in the british museum at the casts from the statues in the pediment of the temple of minerva at √Ügina you have there greek work of definite dateabout 600 bc certainly before 580of the purest kind and you have the representation of a noble ideal subject the combats of the √Üacid√¶ at troy with athena herself looking on but there is no attempt whatever to represent expression in the features none to give complexity of action or gesture there is no struggling no anxiety no visible temporary exertion of muscles there are fallen figures one pulling a lance out of his wound and others in attitudes of attack and defence several kneeling to draw their bows but all inflict and suffer conquer or expire with the same smile  192 plate xiv gives you examples from more advanced art of true greek representation the subjects being the two contests of leading import to the greek heartthat of apollo with the python and of hercules with the nemean lion you see that in neither case is there the slightest effort to represent the greek lyssa or agony of contest no good greek artist would have you behold the suffering either of gods heroes or men nor allow you to be apprehensive of the issue of their contest with evil beasts or evil spirits all such lower sources of excitement are to be closed to you your interest is to be in the thoughts involved by the fact of the war and in the beauty or rightness of form whether active or inactive i have to work out this subject with you afterwards and to compare with the pure greek method of thought that of modern dramatic passion engrafted on it as typically in turners contest of apollo and the python in the meantime be content with the statement of this first great principlethat a greek as such never expresses momentary passion  illustration plate xivapollo and the python  heracles and the nemean lion  illustration plate xvhera of argos zeus of syracuse  193 secondly the greek as such never expresses personal character while a florentine holds it to be the ultimate condition of beauty you are startled i suppose at my saying this having had it often pointed out to you as a transcendent piece of subtlety in greek art that you could distinguish hercules from apollo by his being stout and diana from juno by her being slender that is very true but those are general distinctions of class not special distinctions of personal character even as general they are bodily not mental they are the distinctions in fleshly aspect between an athlete and a musicianbetween a matron and a huntress but in no wise distinguish the simplehearted hero from the subtle master of the muses nor the wilful and fitful girlgoddess from the cruel and resolute matrongoddess but judge for yourselvesin the successive plates xvxviii i show you136 typically represented as the protectresses of nations the argive cretan and lacinian hera the messenian demeter the athena of corinth the artemis of syracuse the fountain arethusa of syracuse and the sirem ligeia of terina now of these heads it is true that some are more delicate in feature than the rest and some softer in expression in other respects can you trace any distinction between the goddesses of earth and heaven or between the goddess of wisdom and the water nymph of syracuse so little can you do so that it would have remained a disputed questionhad not the name luckily been inscribed on some syracusan coinswhether the head upon them was meant for arethusa at all and continually it becomes a question respecting finished statues if without attributes is this bacchus or apollozeus or poseidon there is a fact for you noteworthy i think there is no personal character in true greek artabstract ideas of youth and age strength and swiftness virtue and viceyes but there is no individuality and the negative holds down to the revived conventionalism of the greek school by leonardo when he tells you how you are to paint young women and how old ones though a greek would hardly have been so discourteous to age as the italian is in his canon of itold women should be represented as passionate and hasty after the manner of infernal furies  194 but at least if the greeks do not give character they give ideal beauty so it is said without contradiction but will you look again at the series of coins of the best time of greek art which i have just set before you are any of these goddesses or nymphs very beautiful certainly the junos are not certainly the demeters are not the siren and arethusa have wellformed and regular features but i am quite sure that if you look at them without prejudice you will think neither reach even the average standard of pretty english girls the venus urania suggests at first the idea of a very charming person but you will find there is no real depth nor sweetness in the contours looked at closely and remember these are chosen examples the best i can find of art current in greece at the great time and if even i were to take the celebrated statues of which only two or three are extant not one of them excels the venus of melos and she as i have already asserted in the queen of the air has nothing notable in feature except dignity and simplicity of athena i do not know one authentic type of great beauty but the intense ugliness which the greeks could tolerate in their symbolism of her will be convincingly proved to you by the coin represented in plate vi you need only look at two or three vases of the best time to assure yourselves that beauty of feature was in popular art not only unattained but unattempted and finallyand this you may accept as a conclusive proof of the greek insensitiveness to the most subtle beautythere is little evidence even in their literature and none in their art of their having ever perceived any beauty in infancy or early childhood  illustration plate xvidemeter of messene hera of crossus  illustration plate xviiathena of thurium  sereie ligeia of terina  195 the greeks then do not give passion do not give character do not give refined or na√Øve beauty but you may think that the absence of these is intended to give dignity to the gods and nymphs and that their calm faces would be found if you long observed them instinct with some expression of divine mystery or power  i will convince you of the narrow range of greek thought in these respects by showing you from the two sides of one and the same coin images of the most mysterious of their deities and the most powerfuldemeter and zeus  remember that just as the west coasts of ireland and england catch first on their hills the rain of the atlantic so the western peloponnese arrests in the clouds of the first mountain ranges of arcadia the moisture of the mediterranean and over all the plains of elis pylos and messene the strength and sustenance of men was naturally felt to be granted by zeus as on the east coast of greece the greater clearness of the air by the power of athena if you will recollect the prayer of rhea in the single line of callimachusgreek gaia phil√™ teke kai su teai d √¥dines elaphrai compare pausanias iv 33 at the beginningit will mark for you the connection in the greek mind of the birth of the mountain springs of arcadia with the birth of zeus and the centres of greek thought on this western coast are necessarily elis and after the time of epaminondas messene  196 i show you the coin of messene because the splendid height and form of mount ithome were more expressive of the physical power of zeus than the lower hills of olympia and also because it was struck just at the time of the most finished and delicate greek arta little after the main strength of phidias but before decadence had generally pronounced itself the coin is a silver didrachm bearing on one side a head of demeter plate xvi at the top on the other a full figure of zeus aietophoros plate xix at the top the two together signifying the sustaining strength of the earth and heaven look first at the head of demeter it is merely meant to personify fulness of harvest there is no mystery in it no sadness no vestige of the expression which we should have looked for in any effort to realize the greek thoughts of the earth mother as we find them spoken by the poets but take it merely as personified abundancethe goddess of black furrow and tawny grasshow commonplace it is and how poor the hair is grand and there is one stalk of wheat set in it which is enough to indicate the goddess who is meant but in that very office ignoble for it shows that the artist could only inform you that this was demeter by such a symbol how easy it would have been for a great designer to have made the hair lovely with fruitful flowers and the features noble in mystery of gloom or of tenderness but here you have nothing to interest you except the common greek perfections of a straight nose and a full chin  197 we pass on the reverse of the die to the figure of zeus aietophoros think of the invocation to zeus in the suppliants 525 king of kings and happiest of the happy perfectest of the perfect in strength abounding in all things jovehear us and be with us and then consider what strange phase of mind it was which under the very mountainhome of the god was content with this symbol of him as a wellfed athlete holding a diminutive and crouching eagle on his fist the features and the right hand have been injured in this coin but the action of the arms shows that it held a thunderbolt of which i believe the twisted rays were triple in the presumably earlier coin engraved by millingen however137 it is singly pointed only and the added inscription greek ith√îm in the field renders the conjecture of millingen probable that this is a rude representation of the statue of zeus ithomates made by ageladas the master of phidias and i think it has indeed the aspect of the endeavour by a workman of more advanced knowledge and more vulgar temper to put the softer anatomy of later schools into the simple action of an archaic figure be that as it may here is one of the most refined cities of greece content with the figure of an athlete as the representative of their own mountain god marked as a divine power merely by the attributes of the eagle and thunderbolt  illustration plate xviiiartemis of syracuse  hera of lacinian cape  illustration plate xixzeus of messene ajax of opus  198 lastly the greeks have not it appears in any supreme way given to their statues character beauty or divine strength can they give divine sadness shall we find in their artwork any of that pensiveness and yearning for the dead which fills the chants of their tragedy i suppose if anything like nearness or firmness of faith in afterlife is to be found in greek legend you might look for it in the stories about the island of leuce at the mouth of the danube inhabited by the ghosts of achilles patroclus ajax the son of o√Øleus and helen and in which the pavement of the temple of achilles was washed daily by the seabirds with their wings dipping them in the sea  now it happens that we have actually on a coin of the locrians the representation of the ghost of the lesser ajax there is nothing in the history of human imagination more lovely than their leaving always a place for his spirit vacant in their ranks of battle but here is their sculptural representation of the phantom lower figure plate xix and i think you will at once agree with me in feeling that it would be impossible to conceive anything more completely unspiritual you might more than doubt that it could have been meant for the departed soul unless you were aware of the meaning of this little circlet between the feet on other coins you find his name inscribed there but in this you have his habitation the haunted island of leuce itself with the waves flowing round it  199 again and again however i have to remind you with respect to these apparently frank and simple failures that the greek always intends you to think for yourself and understand more than he can speak take this instance at our hands the trim little circlet for the island of leuce the workman knows very well it is not like the island and that he could not make it so that at its best his sculpture can be little more than a letter and yet in putting this circlet and its encompassing fretwork of minute waves he does more than if he had merely given you a letter l or written leuce if you know anything of beaches and sea this symbol will set your imagination at work in recalling them then you will think of the temple service of the novitiate seabirds and of the ghosts of achilles and patroclus appearing like the dioscuri above the stormclouds of the euxine and the artist throughout his work never for an instant loses faith in your sympathy and passion being ready to answer hisif you have none to give he does not care to take you into his counsel on the whole would rather that you should not look at his work  200 but if you have this sympathy to give you may be sure that whatever he does for you will be right as far as he can render it so it may not be sublime nor beautiful nor amusing but it will be full of meaning and faithful in guidance he will give you clue to myriads of things that he cannot literally teach and so far as he does teach you may trust him is not this saying much  and as he strove only to teach what was true so in his sculptured symbol he strove only to carve what wasright he rules over the arts to this day and will for ever because he sought not first for beauty nor first for passion or for invention but for rightness striving to display neither himself nor his art but the thing that he dealt with in its simplicity that is his specific character as a greek of course every nations character is connected with that of others surrounding or preceding it and in the best greek work you will find some things that are still false or fanciful but whatever in it is false or fanciful is not the greek part of itit is the phoenician or egyptian or pelasgian part the essential hellenic stamp is veracityeastern nations drew their heroes with eight legs but the greeks drew them with twoegyptians drew their deities with cats heads but the greeks drew them with mens and out of all fallacy disproportion and indefiniteness they were day by day resolvedly withdrawing and exalting themselves into restricted and demonstrable truth  201 and now having cut away the misconceptions which encumbered our thoughts i shall be able to put the greek school into some clearness of its position for you with respect to the art of the world that relation is strangely duplicate for on one side greek art is the root of all simplicity and on the other of all complexity  illustration plate xxgreek and barbarian sculpture  on one side i say it is the root of all simplicity if you were for some prolonged period to study greek sculpture exclusively in the elgin room of the british museum and were then suddenly transported to the h√¥tel de cluny or any other museum of gothic and barbarian workmanship you would imagine the greeks were the masters of all that was grand simple wise and tenderly human opposed to the pettiness of the toys of the rest of mankind  202 on one side of their work they are so from all vain and mean decorationall weak and monstrous error the greeks rescue the forms of man and beast and sculpture them in the nakedness of their true flesh and with the fire of their living soul distinctively from other races as i have now perhaps to your weariness told you this is the work of the greek to give health to what was diseased and chastisement to what was untrue so far as this is found in any other school hereafter it belongs to them by inheritance from the greeks or invests them with the brotherhood of the greek and this is the deep meaning of the myth of d√¶dalus as the giver of motion to statues the literal change from the binding together of the feet to their separation and the other modifications of action which took place either in progressive skill or often as the mere consequence of the transition from wood to stone a figure carved out of one wooden log must have necessarily its feet near each other and hands at its sides these literal changes are as nothing in the greek fable compared to the bestowing of apparent life the figures of monstrous gods on indian temples have their legs separate enough but they are infinitely more dead than the rude figures at branchid√¶ sitting with their hands on their knees and briefly the work of d√¶dalus is the giving of deceptive life as that of prometheus the giving of real life and i can put the relation of greek to all other art in this function before you in easily compared and remembered examples  203 here on the right in plate xx is an indian bull colossal and elaborately carved which you may take as a sufficient type of the bad art of all the earth false in form dead in heart and loaded with wealth externally we will not ask the date of this it may rest in the eternal obscurity of evil art everywhere and for ever now besides this colossal bull here is a bit of d√¶dalus work enlarged from a coin not bigger than a shilling look at the two together and you ought to know henceforward what greek art means to the end of your days  204 in this aspect of it then i say it is the simplest and nakedest of lovely veracities but it has another aspect or rather another pole for the opposition is diametric as the simplest so also it is the most complex of human art i told you in my fifth lecture showing you the spotty picture of velasquez that an essential greek character is a liking for things that are dappled and you cannot but have noticed how often and how prevalently the idea which gave its name to the porch of polygnotus greek stoa poikil√™ occurs to the greeks as connected with the finest art thus when the luxurious city is opposed to the simple and healthful one in the second book of platos polity you find that next to perfumes pretty ladies and dice you must have in it greek poikilia which observe both in that place and again in the third book is the separate art of joiners work or inlaying but the idea of exquisitely divided variegation or division both in sight and soundthe ravishing division to the lute as in pindars greek poikiloi hymnoiruns through the compass of all greek artdescription and if instead of studying that art among marbles you were to look at it only on vases of a fine time look back for instance to plate iv here your impression of it would be instead of breadth and simplicity one of universal spottiness and chequeredness greek en ange√¥n herkesin pampoikilois and of the artists delighting in nothing so much as in crossed or starred or spotted things which in right places he and his public both do unlimitedly indeed they hold it complimentary even to a trout to call him a spotty do you recollect the trout in the tributaries of the ladon which pausanias says were spotted so that they were like thrushes and which the arcadians told him could speak in this last greek poikilia however they disappointed him i indeed saw some of them caught he says but i did not hear any of them speak though i waited beside the river till sunset  illustration plate xxithe beginnings of chivalry  205 i must sum roughly now for i have detained you too long  the greeks have been thus the origin not only of all broad mighty and calm conception but of all that is divided delicate and tremulous variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made to them as first leaders of ornamental design belongs of right the praise of glistenings in gold piercings in ivory stainings in purple burnishings in dark blue steel of the fantasy of the arabian roofquartering of the christian shieldrubric and arabesque of christian scripture in fine all enlargement and all diminution of adorning thought from the temple to the toy and from the mountainous pillars of agrigentum to the last fineness of fretwork in the pisan chapel of the thorn  and in their doing all this they stand as masters of human order and justice subduing the animal nature guided by the spiritual one as you see the sicilian charioteer stands holding his horsereins with the wild lion racing beneath him and the flying angel above on the beautiful coin of early syracuse lowest in plate xxi  and the beginnings of christian chivalary were in that greek bridling of the dark and the white horses  206 not that a greek never made mistakes he made as many as we do ourselves nearlyhe died of his mistakes at lastas we shall die of them but so far he was separated from the herd of more mistaken and more wretched nationsso far as he was greekit was by his rightness he lived and worked and was satisfied with the fatness of his land and the fame of his deeds by his justice and reason and modesty he became gr√¶culus esuriens little and hungry and every mans errandboy by his iniquity and his competition and his love of talk but his gr√¶cism was in having done at least at one period of his dominion more than anybody else what was modest useful and eternally true and as a workman he verily did or first suggested the doing of everything possible to man  take d√¶dalus his great type of the practically executive craftsman and the inventor of expedients in craftsmanship as distinguished from prometheus the institutor of moral order in art d√¶dalus inventshe or his nephew  the potters wheel and all work in clay  the saw and all work in wood  the masts and sails of ships and all modes of motion wings only proving too dangerous  the entire art of minute ornament  and the deceptive life of statues  by his personal toil he involves the fatal labyrinth for minos builds an impregnable fortress for the agrigentines adorns healing baths among the wild parsley fields of selinus buttresses the precipices of eryx under the temple of aphrodite and for her temple itselffinishes in exquisiteness the golden honeycomb  207 take note of that last piece of his art it is connected with many things which i must bring before you when we enter on the study of architecture that study we shall begin at the foot of the baptistery of florence which of all buildings known to me unites the most perfect symmetry with the quaintest greek poikilia then from the tomb of your own edward the confessor to the farthest shrine of the opposite arabian and indian world i must show you how the glittering and iridescent dominion of d√¶dalus prevails and his ingenuity in division interposition and labyrinthine sequence more widely still only this last summer i found the dark red masses of the rough sandstone of furness abbey had been fitted by him with no less pleasure than he had in carving them into wedged hexagonsreminiscences of the honeycomb of venus erycina his ingenuity plays around the framework of all the noblest things and yet the brightness of it has a lurid shadow the spot of the fawn of the bird and the moth may be harmless but d√¶dalus reigns no less over the spot of the leopard and snake that cruel and venomous power of his art is marked in the legends of him by his invention of the saw from the serpents tooth and his seeking refuge under bloodguiltiness with minos who can judge evil and measure or remit the penalty of it but not reward good rhadamanthus only can measure that but minos is essentially the recognizer of evil deeds conoscitor delle peccata whom therefore you find in dante under the form of the greek erpeton cignesi con la coda tante volte quantunque gradi vuol che giu sia messa  and this peril of the influence of d√¶dalus is twofold first in leading us to delight in glitterings and semblances of things more than in their form or truthadmire the harlequins jacket more than the heros strength and love the gilding of the missal more than its wordsbut farther and worse the ingenuity of d√¶dalus may even become bestial an instinct for mechanical labour only strangely involved with a feverish and ghastly crueltyyou will find this distinct in the intensely d√¶dal work of the japanese rebellious finally against the laws of nature and honour and building labyrinths for monstersnot combs for bees  208 gentlemen we of the rough northern race may never perhaps be able to learn from the greek his reverence for beauty but we may at least learn his disdain of mechanismof all work which he felt to be monstrous and inhuman in its imprudent dexterities  we hold ourselves we english to be good workmen i do not think i speak with light reference to recent calamity for i myself lost a young relation full of hope and good purpose in the foundered ship london when i say that either an √Üginetan or ionian shipwright built ships that could be fought from though they were under water and neither of them would have been proud of having built one that would fill and sink helplessly if the sea washed over her deck or turn upside down if a squall struck her topsail  believe me gentlemen good workmanship consists in continence and common sense more than in frantic expatiation of mechanical ingenuity and if you would be continent and rational you had better learn more of art than you do now and less of engineering what is taking place at this very hour138 among the streets once so bright and avenues once so pleasant of the fairest city in europe may surely lead us all to feel that the skill of d√¶dalus set to build impregnable fortresses is not so wisely applied as in framing the greek tr√™ton ponouthe golden honeycomb  footnotes  135 the closing lecture on the religious temper of the florentine though necessary for the complete explanation of the subject to my class at the time introduced new points of inquiry which i do not choose to lay before the general reader until they can be examined in fuller sequence the present volume therefore closes with the sixth lecture and that on christian art will be given as the first of the published course on florentine sculpture  136 these plates of coins are given for future reference and examination not merely for the use

most destructive phases     the future of england  delivered at the r a institution woolwich december 14 1869   i would fain have left to the frank expression of the moment but fear i could not have found clear wordsi cannot easily find them even deliberatelyto tell you how glad i am and yet how ashamed to accept your permission to speak to you ashamed of appearing to think that i can tell you any truth which you have not more deeply felt than i but glad in the thought that my less experience and way of life sheltered from the trials and free from the responsibilities of yours may have left me with something of a childs power of help to you a sureness of hope which may perhaps be the one thing that can be helpful to men who have done too much not to have often failed in doing all that they desired and indeed even the most hopeful of us cannot but now be in many things apprehensive for this at least we all know too well that we are on the eve of a great political crisis if not of political change that a struggle is approaching between the newlyrisen power of democracy and the apparently departing power of feudalism and another struggle no less imminent and far more dangerous between wealth and pauperism these two quarrels are constantly thought of as the same they are being fought together and an apparently common interest unites for the most part the millionaire with the noble in resistance to a multitude crying part of it for bread and part of it for liberty  and yet no two quarrels can be more distinct richesso far from being necessary to noblesseare adverse to it so utterly adverse that the first character of all the nobilities which have founded great dynasties in the world is to be pooroften poor by oathalways poor by generosity and of every true knight in the chivalric ages the first thing history tells you is that he never kept treasure for himself  thus the causes of wealth and noblesse are not the same but opposite on the other hand the causes of anarchy and of the poor are not the same but opposite side by side in the same rank are now indeed set the pride that revolts against authority and the misery that appeals against avarice but so far from being a common cause all anarchy is the forerunner of poverty and all prosperity begins in obedience so that thus it has become impossible to give due support to the cause of order without seeming to countenance injury and impossible to plead justly the claims of sorrow without seeming to plead also for those of license  let me try then to put in very brief terms the real plan of this various quarrel and the truth of the cause on each side let us face that full truth whatever it may be and decide what part according to our power we should take in the quarrel  first for eleven hundred years all but five since charlemagne set on his head the lombard crown the body of european people have submitted patiently to be governed generally by kingsalways by single leaders of some kind but for the last fifty years they have begun to suspect and of late they have many of them concluded that they have been on the whole illgoverned or misgoverned by their kings whereupon they say more and more widely let us henceforth have no kings and no government at all  now we said we must face the full truth of the matter in order to see what we are to do and the truth is that the people have been misgovernedthat very little is to be said hitherto for most of their mastersand that certainly in many places they will try their new system of no mastersand as that arrangement will be delightful to all foolish persons and at first profitable to all wicked onesand as these classes are not wanting or unimportant in any human societythe experiment is likely to be tried extensively and the world may be quite content to endure much suffering with this fresh hope and retain its faith in anarchy whatever comes of it till it can endure no more  then secondly the people have begun to suspect that one particular form of this past misgovernment has been that their masters have set them to do all the work and have themselves taken all the wages in a word that what was called governing them meant only wearing fine clothes and living on good fare at their expense and i am sorry to say the people are quite right in this opinion also if you inquire into the vital fact of the matter this you will find to be the constant structure of european society for the thousand years of the feudal system it was divided into peasants who lived by working priests who lived by begging and knights who lived by pillaging and as the luminous public mind becomes gradually cognizant of these facts it will assuredly not suffer things to be altogether arranged that way any more and the devising of other ways will be an agitating business especially because the first impression of the intelligent populace is that whereas in the dark ages half the nation lived idle in the bright ages to come the whole of it may  now thirdlyand here is much the worst phase of the crisis this past system of misgovernment especially during the last three hundred years has prepared by its neglect a class among the lower orders which it is now peculiarly difficult to govern it deservedly lost their respectbut that was the least part of the mischief the deadly part of it was that the lower orders lost their habit and at last their faculty of respectlost the very capability of reverence which is the most precious part of the human soul exactly in the degree in which you can find creatures greater than yourself to look up to in that degree you are ennobled yourself and in that degree happy if you could live always in the presence of archangels you would be happier than in that of men but even if only in the company of admirable knights and beautiful ladies the more noble and bright they were and the more you could reverence their virtue the happier you would be on the contrary if you were condemned to live among a multitude of idiots dumb distorted and malicious you would not be happy in the constant sense of your own superiority thus all real joy and power of progress in humanity depend on finding something to reverence and all the baseness and misery of humanity begin in a habit of disdain now by general misgovernment i repeat we have created in europe a vast populace and out of europe a still vaster one which has lost even the power and conception of reverence139which exists only in the worship of itselfwhich can neither see anything beautiful around it nor conceive anything virtuous above it which has towards all goodness and greatness no other feelings than those of the lowest creaturesfear hatred or hunger a populace which has sunk below your appeal in their nature as it has risen beyond your power in their multitudewhom you can now no more charm than you can the adder nor discipline than you can the summer fly  it is a crisis gentlemen and time to think of it i have roughly and broadly put it before you in its darkness let us look what we may find of light  only the other day in a journal which is a fairly representative exponent of the conservatism of our day and for the most part not at all in favor of strikes or other popular proceedings only about three weeks since there was a leader with this or a similar titlewhat is to become of the house of lords it startled me for it seemed as if we were going even faster than i had thought when such a question was put as a subject of quite open debate in a journal meant chiefly for the reading of the middle and upper classes open or notthe debate is near what is to become of them and the answer to such question depends first on their being able to answer another questionwhat is the use of them for some time back i think the theory of the nation has been that they are useful as impediments to business so as to give time for second thoughts but the nation is getting impatient of impediments to business and certainly sooner or later will think it needless to maintain these expensive obstacles to its humors and i have not heard either in public or from any of themselves a clear expression of their own conception of their use so that it seems thus to become needful for all men to tell them as our one quite clearsighted teacher carlyle has been telling us for many a year that the use of the lords of a country is to govern the country if they answer that use the country will rejoice in keeping them if not that will become of them which must of all things found to have lost their serviceableness  here therefore is the one question at this crisis for them and for us will they be lords indeed and give us lawsdukes indeed and give us guidingprinces indeed and give us beginning of truer dynasty which shall not be soiled by covetousness nor disordered by iniquity have they themselves sunk so far as not to hope this are there yet any among them who can stand forward with open english brows and sayso far as in me lies i will govern with my might not for dieu et mon droit but for the first grand reading of the war cry from which that was corrupted dieu et droit among them i know there are someamong you soldiers of england i know there are many who can do this and in you is our trust i one of the lower people of your country ask of you in their nameyou whom i will not any more call soldiers but by the truer name of knightsequites of england how many yet of you are there knights errant now beyond all former fields of dangerknights patient now beyond all former endurance who still retain the ancient and eternal purpose of knighthood to subdue the wicked and aid the weak to them be they few or many we english people call for help to the wretchedness and for rule over the baseness of multitudes desolate and deceived shrieking to one another this new gospel of their new religion let the weak do as they can and the wicked as they will  i can hear you saying in your hearts even the bravest of you the time is past for all that gentlemen it is not so the time has come for more than all that hitherto soldiers have given their lives for false fame and for cruel power the day is now when they must give their lives for true fame and for beneficent power and the work is near every one of youclose beside youthe means of it even thrust into your hands the people are crying to you for command and you stand there at pause and silent you think they dont want to be commanded try them determine what is needful for themhonorable for them show it them promise to bring them to it and they will follow you through fire govern us they cry with one heart though many minds they can be governed still these english they are men still not gnats nor serpents they love their old ways yet and their old masters and their old land they would fain live in it as many as may stay there if you will show them how there to liveor show them even how there like englishmen to die  to live in it as many as may how many do you think may how many can how many do you want to live there as masters your first object must be to increase your power and in what does the power of a country consist will you have dominion over its stones or over its clouds or over its souls what do you mean by a great nation but a great multitude of men who are true to each other and strong and of worth now you can increase the multitude only definitelyyour island has only so much standing roombut you can increase the worth indefinitely it is but a little islandsuppose little as it is you were to fill it with friends you may and that easily you must and that speedily or there will be an end to this england of ours and to all its loves and enmities  to fill this little island with true friendsmen brave wise and happy is it so impossible think you after the worlds eighteen hundred years of christianity and our own thousand years of toil to fill only this little white gleaming crag with happy creatures helpful to each other africa and india and the brazilian widewatered plain are these not wide enough for the ignorance of our race have they not space enough for its pain must we remain here also savagehere at enmity with each otherhere foodless houseless in rags in dust and without hope as thousands and tens of thousands of us are lying do not think it gentlemen the thought that it is inevitable is the last infidelity infidelity not to god only but to every creature and every law that he has made are we to think that the earth was only shaped to be a globe of torture and that there cannot be one spot of it where peace can rest or justice reign where are men ever to be happy if not in england by whom shall they ever be taught to do right if not by you are we not of a race first among the strong ones of the earth the blood in us incapable of weariness unconquerable by grief have we not a history of which we can hardly think without becoming insolent in our just pride of it can we dare without passing every limit of courtesy to other nations to say how much more we have to be proud of in our ancestors than they among our ancient monarchs great crimes stand out as monstrous and strange but their valor and according to their understanding their benevolence are constant the wars of the roses which are as a fearful crimson shadow on our land represent the normal condition of other nations while from the days of the heptarchy downwards we have had examples given us in all ranks of the most varied and exalted virtue a heap of treasure that no moth can corrupt and which even our traitorship if we are to become traitors to it cannot sully  and this is the race then that we know not any more how to govern and this the history which we are to behold broken off by sedition and this is the country of all others where life is to become difficult to the honest and ridiculous to the wise and the catastrophe forsooth is to come just when we have been making swiftest progress beyond the wisdom and wealth of the past our cities are a wilderness of spinning wheels instead of palaces yet the people have not clothes we have blackened every leaf of english greenwood with ashes and the people die of cold our harbors are a forest of merchant ships and the people die of hunger  whose fault is it yours gentlemen yours only you alone can feed them and clothe and bring into their right minds for you only can governthat is to say you only can educate them  educate or govern they are one and the same word education does not mean teaching people to know what they do not know it means teaching them to behave as they do not behave and the true compulsory education which the people now ask of you is not catechism but drill it is not teaching the youth of england the shapes of letters and the tricks of numbers and then leaving them to turn their arithmetic to roguery and their literature to lust it is on the contrary training them into the perfect exercise and kingly continence of their bodies and souls it is a painful continual and difficult work to be done by kindness by watching by warning by precept and by praisebut above allby example  compulsory yes by all means go ye out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in compulsory yes and gratis also dei gratia they must be taught as dei gratia you are set to teach them i hear strange talk continually how difficult it is to make people pay for being educated why i should think so do you make your children pay for their education or do you give it them compulsorily and gratis you do not expect them to pay you for their teaching except by becoming good children why should you expect a peasant to pay for his except by becoming a good manpayment enough i think if we knew it payment enough to himself as to us for that is another of our grand popular mistakespeople are always thinking of education as a means of livelihood education is not a profitable business but a costly one nay even the best attainments of it are always unprofitable in any terms of coin no nation ever made its bread either by its great arts or its great wisdoms by its minor arts or manufactures by its practical knowledges yes but its noble scholarship its noble philosophy and its noble art are always to be bought as a treasure not sold for a livelihood you do not learn that you may liveyou live that you may learn you are to spend on national education and to be spent for it and to make by it not more money but better mento get into this british island the greatest possible number of good and brave englishmen they are to be your moneys worth  but where is the money to come from yes that is to be asked let us as quite the first business in this our national crisis look not only into our affairs but into our accounts and obtain some general notion how we annually spend our money and what we are getting for it observe i do not mean to inquire into the public revenue only of that some account is rendered already but let us do the best we can to set down the items of the national private expenditure and know what we spend altogether and how  to begin with this matter of education you probably have nearly all seen the admirable lecture lately given by captain maxse at southampton it contains a clear statement of the facts at present ascertained as to our expenditure in that respect it appears that of our public moneys for every pound that we spend on education we spend twelve either in charity or punishmentten millions a year in pauperism and crime and eight hundred thousand in instruction now captain maxse adds to this estimate of ten millions public money spent on crime and want a more or less conjectural sum of eight millions for private charities my impression is that this is much beneath the truth but at all events it leaves out of consideration much the heaviest and saddest form of charitythe maintenance by the working members of families of the unfortunate or illconducted persons whom the general course of misrule now leaves helpless to be the burden of the rest  now i want to get first at some i do not say approximate but at all events some suggestive estimate of the quantity of real distress and misguided life in this country then next i want some fairly representative estimate of our private expenditure in luxuries we wont spend more publicly it appears than eight hundred thousand a year on educating men gratis i want to know as nearly as possible what we spend privately a year in educating horses gratis let us at least quit ourselves in this from the taunt of rabshakeh and see that for every horse we train also a horseman and that the rider be at least as highbred as the horse not jockey but chevalier again we spend eight hundred thousand which is certainly a great deal of money in making rough minds bright i want to know how much we spend annually in making rough stones bright that is to say what may be the united annual sum or near it of our jewellers bills so much we pay for educating children gratishow much for educating diamonds gratis and which pays best for brightening the spirit or the charcoal let us get those two items set down with some sincerity and a few more of the same kind publicly set down we must not be ashamed of the way we spend our money if our right hand is not to know what our left does it must not be because it would be ashamed if it did  that is therefore quite the first practical thing to be done let every man who wishes well to his country render it yearly an account of his income and of the main heads of his expenditure or if he is ashamed to do so let him no more impute to the poor their poverty as a crime nor set them to break stones in order to frighten them from committing it to lose money ill is indeed often a crime but to get it ill is a worse one and to spend it ill worst of all you object lords of england to increase to the poor the wages you give them because they spend them you say unadvisedly render them therefore an account of the wages which they give you and show them by your example how to spend theirs to the last farthing advisedly  it is indeed time to make this an acknowledged subject of instruction to the workingmanhow to spend his wages for gentlemen we must give that instruction whether we will or no one way or the other we have given it in years gone by and now we find fault with our peasantry for having been too docile and profited too shrewdly by our tuition only a few days since i had a letter from the wife of a village rector a man of common sense and kindness who was greatly troubled in his mind because it was precisely the men who got highest wages in summer that came destitute to his door in the winter destitute and of riotous temperfor their method of spending wages in their period of prosperity was by sitting two days a week in the tavern parlor ladling port wine not out of bowls but out of buckets well gentlemen who taught them that method of festivity thirty years ago i a most inexperienced freshman went to my first college supper at the head of the table sat a nobleman of high promise and of admirable powers since dead of palsy there also we had in the midst of us not buckets indeed but bowls as large as buckets there also we helped ourselves with ladles there for this beginning of college education was compulsory i choosing ladlefuls of punch instead of claret because i was then able unperceived to pour them into my waistcoat instead of down my throat stood it out to the end and helped to carry four of my fellowstudents one of them the son of the head of a college head foremost down stairs and home  such things are no more but the fruit of them remains and will for many a day to come the laborers whom you cannot now shut out of the alehouse are only the too faithful disciples of the gentlemen who were wont to shut themselves into the diningroom the gentlemen have not thought it necessary in order to correct their own habits to diminish their incomes and believe me the way to deal with your drunken workman is not to lower his wagesbut to mend his wits140  and if indeed we do not yet see quite clearly how to deal with the sins of our poor brother it is possible that our dimness of sight may still have other causes that can be cast out there are two opposite cries of the great liberal and conservative parties which are both most right and worthy to be rallying cries on their side let every man have his chance on yours let every man stand in his place yes indeed let that be so every man in his place and every man fit for it see that he holds that place from heavens providence and not from his familys providence let the lords spiritual quit themselves of simony we laymen will look after the heretics for them let the lords temporal quit themselves of nepotism and we will take care of their authority for them publish for us you soldiers an army gazette in which the one subject of daily intelligence shall be the grounds of promotion a gazette which shall simply tell us what there certainly can be no detriment to the service in our knowing when any officer is appointed to a new commandwhat his former services and successes have beenwhom he has supersededand on what ground it will be always a satisfaction to us it may sometimes be an advantage to you and then when there is really necessary debate respecting reduction of wages let us always begin not with the wages of the industrious classes but with those of the idle ones let there be honorary titles if people like them but let there be no honorary incomes  so much for the masters motto every man in his place next for the laborers motto every man his chance let us mend that for them a little and say every man his certaintycertainty that if he does well he will be honored and aided and advanced in such degree as may be fitting for his faculty and consistent with his peace and equal certainty that if he does ill he will by sure justice be judged and by sure punishment be chastised if it may be corrected and if that may not be condemned that is the right reading of the republican motto every man his chance and then with such a system of government pure watchful and just you may approach your great problem of national education or in other words of national employment for all education begins in work what we think or what we know or what we believe is in the end of little consequence the only thing of consequence is what we do and for man woman or child the first point of education is to make them do their best it is the law of good economy to make the best of everything how much more to make the best of every creature therefore when your pauper comes to you and asks for bread ask of him instantlywhat faculty have you what can you do best can you drive a nail into wood go and mend the parish fences can you lay a brick mend the walls of the cottages where the wind comes in can you lift a spadeful of earth turn this field up three feet deep all over can you only drag a weight with your shoulders stand at the bottom of this hill and help up the overladen horses can you weld iron and chisel stone fortify this wreckstrewn coast into a harbor and change these shifting sands into fruitful ground wherever death was bring life that is to be your work that your parish refuge that your education so and no otherwise can we meet existent distress but for the continual education of the whole people and for their future happiness they must have such consistent employment as shall develop all the powers of the fingers and the limbs and the brain and that development is only to be obtained by handlabor of which you have these four great divisionshandlabor on the earth handlabor on the sea handlabor in art handlabor in war of the last two of these i cannot speak tonight and of the first two only with extreme brevity  i handlabor on the earth the work of the husbandman and of the shepherdto dress the earth and to keep the flocks of itthe first task of man and the final onethe education always of noblest lawgivers kings and teachers the education of hesiod of moses of david of all the true strength of rome and all its tenderness the pride of cincinnatus and the inspiration of virgil handlabor on the earth and the harvest of it brought forth with singingnot steampiston labor on the earth and the harvest of it brought forth with steamwhistling you will have no prophets voice accompanied by that shepherds pipe and pastoral symphony do you know that lately in cumberland in the chief pastoral district of englandin wordsworths own homea procession of villagers on their festa day provided for themselves by way of music a steamplough whistling at the head of them  give me patience while i put the principle of machine labor before you as clearly and in as short compass as possible it is one that should be known at this juncture suppose a farming proprietor needs to employ a hundred men on his estate and that the labor of these hundred men is enough but not more than enough to till all his land and to raise from it food for his own family and for the hundred laborers he is obliged under such circumstances to maintain all the men in moderate comfort and can only by economy accumulate much for himself but suppose he contrive a machine that will easily do the work of fifty men with only one man to watch it this sounds like a great advance in civilization the farmer of course gets his machine made turns off the fifty men who may starve or emigrate at their choice and now he can keep half of the produce of his estate which formerly went to feed them all to himself that is the essential and constant operation of machinery among us at this moment  nay it is at first answered no man can in reality keep half the produce of an estate to himself nor can he in the end keep more than his own human share of anything his riches must diffuse themselves at some time he must maintain somebody else with them however he spends them that is mainly true not altogether so for food and fuel are in ordinary circumstances personally wasted by rich people in quantities which would save many lives one of my own great luxuries for instance is candlelightand i probably burn for myself alone as many candles during the winter as would comfort the old eyes or spare the young ones of a whole rushlighted country village still it is mainly true that it is not by their personal waste that rich people prevent the lives of the poor this is the way they do it let me go back to my farmer he has got his machine made which goes creaking screaming and occasionally exploding about modern arcadia he has turned off his fifty men to starve now at some distance from his own farm there is another on which the laborers were working for their bread in the same way by tilling the land the machinist sends over to these sayingi have got food enough for you without your digging or ploughing any more i can maintain you in other occupations instead of ploughing that land if you rake in its gravel you will find some hard stonesyou shall grind those on mills till they glitter then my wife shall wear a necklace of them also if you turn up the meadows below you will find some fine white clay of which you shall make a porcelain service for me and the rest of the farm i want for pasture for horses for my carriageand you shall groom them and some of you ride behind the carriage with staves in your hands and i will keep you much fatter for doing that than you can keep yourselves by digging  wellbut it is answered are we to have no diamonds nor china nor pictures nor footmen thenbut all to be farmers i am not saying what we ought to do i want only to show you with perfect clearness first what we are doing and that i repeat is the upshot of machinecontriving in this country and observe its effect on the national strength without machines you have a hundred and fifty yeomen ready to join for defence of the land you get your machine starve fifty of them make diamondcutters or footmen of as many more and for your national defence against an enemy you have now and can have only fifty men instead of a hundred and fifty these also now with minds much alienated from you as their chief141 and the rest lapidaries or footmen and a steam plough  that is one effect of machinery but at all events if we have thus lost in men we have gained in riches instead of happy human souls we have at least got pictures china horses and are ourselves better off than we were before but very often and in much of our machinecontriving even that result does not follow we are not one whit the richer for the machine we only employ it for our amusement for observe our gaining in riches depends on the men who are out of employment consenting to be starved or sent out of the country but suppose they do not consent passively to be starved but some of them become criminals and have to be taken charge of and fed at a much greater cost than if they were at work and others paupers rioters and the like then you attain the real outcome of modern wisdom and ingenuity you have your hundred men honestly at country work but you dont like the sight of human beings in your fields you like better to see a smoking kettle you pay as an amateur for that pleasure and you employ your fifty men in picking oakum or begging rioting and thieving  by handlabor therefore and that alone we are to till the ground by handlabor also to plough the sea both for food and in commerce and in war not with floating kettles there neither but with hempen bridle and the winds of heaven in harness that is the way the power of greece rose on her egean the power of venice on her adria of amalfi in her blue bay of the norman seariders from the north cape to sicilyso your own dominion also of the past of the past mind you on the baltic and the nile your power is already departed by machinery you would advance to discovery by machinery you would carry your commerceyou would be engineers instead of sailors and instantly in the north seas you are beaten among the ice and before the very gods of nile beaten among the sand agriculture then by the hand or by the plough drawn only by animals and shepherd and pastoral husbandry are to be the chief schools of englishmen and this most royal academy of all academies you have to open over all the land purifying your heaths and hills and waters and keeping them full of every kind of lovely natural organism in tree herb and living creature all land that is waste and ugly you must redeem into ordered fruitfulness all ruin desolateness imperfectness of hut or habitation you must do away with and throughout every village and city of your english dominion there must not be a hand that cannot find a helper nor a heart that cannot find a comforter  how impossible i know you are thinking ah so far from impossible it is easy it is natural it is necessary and i declare to you that sooner or later it must be done at our peril if now our english lords of land will fix this idea steadily before them take the people to their hearts trust to their loyalty lead their laborthen indeed there will be princes again in the midst of us worthy of the island throne      this royal throne of kingsthis sceptred isle     this fortress built by nature for herself     against infection and the hand of war     this precious stone set in the silver sea     this happy breed of menthis little world     this other edendemiparadise  but if they refuse to do this and hesitate and equivocate clutching through the confused catastrophe of all things only at what they can still keep stealthily for themselvestheir doom is nearer than even their adversaries hope and it will be deeper than even their despisers dream  that believe me is the work you have to do in england and out of england you have room for everything else you care to do are her dominions in the world so narrow that she can find no place to spin cotton in but yorkshire we may organize emigration into an infinite power we may assemble troops of the more adventurous and ambitious of our youth we may send them on truest foreign service founding new seats of authority and centres of thought in uncultivated and unconquered lands retaining the full affection to the native country no less in our colonists than in our armies teaching them to maintain allegiance to their fatherland in labor no less than in battle aiding them with free hand in the prosecution of discovery and the victory over adverse natural powers establishing seats of every manufacture in the climates and places best fitted for it and bringing ourselves into due alliance and harmony of skill with the dexterities of every race and the wisdoms of every tradition and every tongue  and then you may make england itself the centre of the learning of the arts of the courtesies and felicities of the world yon may cover her mountains with pasture her plains with corn her valleys with the lily and her gardens with the rose you may bring together there in peace the wise and the pure and the gentle of the earth and by their word command through its farthest darkness the birth of gods first creature which was light you know whose words those are the words of the wisest of englishmen he and with him the wisest of all other great nations have spoken always to men of

regiment a week     notes on the political economy of prussia   i am often accused of inconsistency but believe myself defensible against the charge with respect to what i have said on nearly every subject except that of war it is impossible for me to write consistently of war for the groups of facts i have gathered about it lead me to two precisely opposite conclusions  when i find this the case in other matters i am silent till i can choose my conclusion but with respect to war i am forced to speak by the necessities of the time and forced to act one way or another the conviction on which i act is that it causes an incalculable amount of avoidable human suffering and that it ought to cease among christian nations and if therefore any of my boyfriends desire to be soldiers i try my utmost to bring them into what i conceive to be a better mind but on the other hand i know certainly that the most beautiful characters yet developed among men have been formed in warthat all great nations have been warrior nations and that the only kinds of peace which we are likely to get in the present age are ruinous alike to the intellect and the heart  the lecture on war in this volume addressed to young soldiers had for its object to strengthen their trust in the virtue of their profession it is inconsistent with itself in its closing appeal to women praying them to use their influence to bring wars to an end and i have been hindered from completing my long intended notes on the economy of the kings of prussia by continually increasing doubt how far the machinery and discipline of war under which they learned the art of government was essential for such lesson and what the honesty and sagacity of the friedrich who so nobly repaired his ruined prussia might have done for the happiness of his prussia unruined  in war however or in peace the character which carlyle chiefly loves him for and in which carlyle has shown him to differ from all kings up to this time succeeding him is his constant purpose to use every power entrusted to him for the good of his people and be not in name only but in heart and hand their king  not in ambition but in natural instinct of duty friedrich born to govern determines to govern to the best of his faculty that best may sometimes be unwise and selfwill or love of glory may have their oblique hold on his mind and warp it this way or that but they are never principal with him he believes that war is necessary and maintains it sees that peace is necessary and calmly persists in the work of it to the day of his death not claiming therein more praise than the head of any ordinary household who rules it simply because it is his place and he must not yield the mastery of it to another  how far in the future it may be possible for men to gain the strength necessary for kingship without either fronting death or inflicting it seems to me not at present determinable the historical facts are that broadly speaking none but soldiers or persons with a soldierly faculty have ever yet shown themselves fit to be kings and that no other men are so gentle so just or so clearsighted wordsworths character of the happy warrior cannot be reached in the height of it but by a warrior nay so much is it beyond common strength that i had supposed the entire meaning of it to be metaphorical until one of the best soldiers of england himself read me the poem142 and taught me what i might have known had i enough watched his own life that it was entirely literal there is nothing of so high reach distinctly demonstrable in friedrich but i see more and more as i grow older that the things which are the most worth encumbered among the errors and faults of every mans nature are never clearly demonstrable and are often most forcible when they are scarcely distinct to his own consciencehow much less clamorous for recognition by others  nothing can be more beautiful than carlyles showing of this to any careful reader of friedrich but careful readers are but one in the thousand and by the careless the masses of detail with which the historian must deal are insurmountable  my own notes made for the special purpose of hunting down the one point of economy though they cruelly spoil carlyles own current and method of thought may yet be useful in enabling readers unaccustomed to books involving so vast a range of conception to discern what on this one subject only may be gathered from that history on any other subject of importance similar gatherings might be made of other passages the historian has to deal with all at once  i therefore have determined to print here as a sequel to the essay on war my notes from the first volume of friedrich on the economies of brandenburg up to the date of the establishment of the prussian monarchy the economies of the first three kings of prussia i shall then take up in fors clavigera finding them fitter for examination in connection with the subject of that book than of this  i assume that the reader will take down his first volume of carlyle and read attentively the passages to which i refer him i give the reference first to the largest edition in six volumes 18581865 then in parenthesis to the smallest or peoples edition 18721873 the pieces which i have quoted in my own text are for the use of readers who may not have ready access to the book and are enough for the explanation of the points to which i wish them to direct their thoughts in reading such histories of soldiers or soldierkingdoms   i  year 928 to 936dawn of order in christian germany  book ii chap i p 67 47  henry the fowler the beginning of german kings is a mighty soldier in the cause of peace his essential work the building and organization of fortified towns for the protection of men  read page 72 with utmost care 51 he fortified towns to end of small print i have added some notes on the matter in my lecture on giovanni pisano but whether you can glance at them or not fix in your mind this institution of truly civil or civic building in germany as distinct from the building of baronial castles for the security of robbers and of a standing army consisting of every ninth man called a burgher townsmana soldier appointed to learn that profession that he may guard the wallsthe exact reverse of our notion of a burgher  fredericks final idea of his army is indeed only this  brannibor a chief fortress of the wends is thus taken and further strengthened by henry the fowler wardens appointed for it and thus the history of brandenburg begins on all frontiers also this beginning of german kings has his markgraf ancient of the marked place read page 73 measuredly learning it by heart if it may be 512   ii  9361000history of nascent brandenburg  the passage i last desired you to read ends with this sentence the seawall you build and what main floodgates you establish in it will depend on the state of the outer sea  from this time forward you have to keep clearly separate in your minds a the history of that outer sea pagan scandinavia russia and borrussia or prussia proper b the history of henry the fowlers eastern and western marches asserting themselves gradually as austria and the netherlands and c the history of this inconsiderable fortress of brandenburg gradually becoming considerable and the capital city of increasing district between them that last history however carlyle is obliged to leave vague and gray for two hundred years after henrys death absolutely dim for the first century in which nothing is evident but that its wardens or markgraves had no peaceable possession of the place read the second paragraph in page 74 523 in old books to reader and the first in page 83 59 meanwhile to substantial consecutively they bring the story of brandenburg itself down at any rate from 936 to 1000   iii  9361000state of the outer sea  read now chapter ii beginning at page 76 54 wherein you will get account of the beginning of vigorous missionary work on the outer sea in prussia proper of the death of st adalbert and of the purchase of his dead body by the duke of poland  you will not easily understand carlyles laugh in this chapter unless you have learned yourself to laugh in sadness and to laugh in love  no czech blows his pipe in the woodlands without certain precautions and preliminary fuglings of a devotional nature imagine st adalbert in spirit at the railway station in birmingham  my own main point for notice in the chapter is the purchase of his body for its weight in gold swindling angels held it up in the scales it did not weigh so much as a web of gossamer had such excellent odor too and came for a mere nothing of gold says carlyle it is one of the first commercial transactions of germany but i regret the conduct of the angels on the occasion evangelicalism has been proud of ceasing to invest in relics its swindling angels helping it to better things as it supposes for my own part i believe christian germany could not have bought at this time any treasure more precious nevertheless the missionary work itself you find is wholly vain the difference of opinion between st adalbert and the wends on divine matters does not signify to the fates they will not have it disputed about and end the dispute adversely to st adalbertadversely even to brandenburg and its civilizing power as you will immediately see   iv  10001030history of brandenburg in trouble  book ii chap iii p 83 59  the adventures of brandenburg in contest with pagan prussia irritated rather than amended by st adalbert in 1023 roughly a hundred years after henry the fowlers death brandenburg is taken by the wends and its first line of markgraves ended its population

whose castle of ascanica is on the northern slope of the hartz mountains ruins still dimly traceable  there had been no soldier or king of note among the ditmarsch markgraves so that you will do well to fix in your mind successively the three men henry the fowler st adalbert and albert the bear a soldier again and a strong one named the bear only from the device on his shield first wholly definite markgraf of brandenburg that there is and that the luckiest of events for brandenburg read page 93 66 carefully and note this of his economies                                       nothing better is known to me of albert the bear than his introducing large numbers of dutch netherlanders into those countries men thrown out of work who already knew how to deal with bog and sand by mixing and delving and who first taught brandenburg what greenness and cowpasture was the wends in presence of such things could not but consent more and more to efface themselveseither to become german and grow milk and cheese in the dutch manner or to disappear from the world                                       after twohundred and fifty years of barking and worrying the wends are now finally reduced to silence their anarchy well buried and wholesome dutch cabbage planted over it albert did several great things in the world but this for posterity remains his memorable feat not done quite easily but done big destinies of nations or of persons are not founded gratis in this world he had a sore toilsome time of it coercing warring managing among his fellowcreatures while his days work lastedfifty years or so for it began early he died in his castle of ballenst√§dt peaceably among the hartz mountains at last in the year 1170 age about sixtyfive                                       now note in all this the steady gain of soldiership enforcing order and agriculture with st adalbert giving higher strain to the imagination henry the fowler establishes walled towns fighting for mere peace albert the bear plants the country with cabbages fighting for his cabbagefields and the disciples of st adalbert generally have succeeded in substituting some idea of christ for the idea of triglaph some idea only other ideas than of christ haunt even to this day those hartz mountains among which albert the bear dies so peacefully mephistopheles and all his ministers inhabit there commanding

finally 1319 exactly say 1320 for memory the ascanien line expired in brandenburg and the little town and its electorate lapsed to the kaiser meantime other economical arrangements had been in progress but observe first how far we have got  the fowler st adalbert and the bear have established order and some sort of christianity but the established persons begin to think somewhat too well of themselves on quite honest terms a dead saint or a living knight ought to be worth their true weight in gold but a pyramid with only the point of the spear seen at top would be many times over ones weight in gold and although men were yet far enough from the notion of modern days that the gold is better than the flesh and from buying it with the clay of ones body and even the fire of ones soul instead of soul and body with it they were beginning to fight for their own supremacy or for their own religious fancies and not at all to any useful end until an entirely unexpected movement is made

extensively high personages came on crusade to them ottocar king of bohemia with his extensive farshining chivalry conquered samland in a month tore up the romova where adalbert had been massacred and

it was the rallying place of all brave men who had a career to seek on terms other than vulgar the noble soul aiming beyond money and sensible to more than hunger in this world had a beacon burning as

of all states for their own hand or st adalberts partly for mere love of fight partly for love of order partly for love of god meantime other riders have been fighting wholly for what they could get

of the men whom you are to remember as creators of the prussian monarchy henry the fowler st adalbert albert the bear of ascanien and friedrich of n√ºremberg of hohenzollern by name and by country of the black forest north of the lake of constance  brandenburg is sold to him at constance during the great council for about 200000l of our money worth perhaps a million in that day still with its capabilities dog cheap admitting what no one at the time denied the general marketableness of states as private property this is the one practical result thinks carlyle not likely to think wrong of that oecumenical deliberation four years long of the elixir of the intellect and dignity of europe and that one thing was not its doing but a pawnbroking job intercalated putting however at last brandenburg again under the will of one strong man on st johns day 1412 he first set foot in his town and brandenburg under its wise kurf√ºrst begins to be cosmic again the story of heavy peg pages 195198 138 140 is one of the most brilliant and important passages of the first volume page 199 specially to our purpose must be given entire       the offer to be kaiser was made him in his old days but he      wisely declined that too it was in brandenburg by what he      silently founded there that he did his chief benefit to      germany and mankind he understood the noble art of      governing men had in him the justness clearness valor      and patience needed for that a man of sterling probity for      one thing which indeed is the first requisite in said      artif you will have your laws obeyed without mutiny see      well that they be pieces of god almightys law otherwise      all the artillery in the world will not keep down mutiny       friedrich travelled much over brandenburg looking into      everything with his own eyes making i can well fancy      innumerable crooked things straight reducing more and more      that famishing dogkennel of a brandenburg into a fruitful      arable field his portraits represent a squareheaded      mildlooking solid gentleman with a certain twinkle of      mirth in the serious eyes of him except in those hussite      wars for kaiser sigismund and the reich in which no man      could prosper he may be defined as constantly prosperous      to brandenburg he was very literally the blessing of      blessings redemption out of death into life in the ruins      of that old friesack castle battered down by heavy peg      antiquarian science if it had any eyes might look for the      taproot of the prussian nation and the beginning of all      that brandenburg has since grown to under the sun  which growth is now traced by carlyle in its various budding and withering under the succession of the twelve electors of whom friedrich with his heavy peg is first and friedrich first king of prussia grandfather of friedrich the great the twelfth   xi  14161701brandenburg under the hohenzollern kurf√ºrsts  book iii  who the

have to say they followed generally in their ancestors steps and had success of the like kind more or less hohenzollerns all of them by character and behaviour as well as by descent no lack of quiet energy of thrift sound sense there was likewise solid fairplay in general no founding of yourself on ground that will not carry and there was instant gentle but inexorable crushing of mutiny if it showed itself which after the second elector or at most the third it had altogether ceased to do  this is the general account of them of special matters note the following   ii friedrich called ironteeth from his firmness proves a notable manager and governor builds the palace at berlin in its first form and makes it his chief residence buys neumark from the fallen teutsch ritters and generally establishes things on securer footing   iii albert a fiery tough old gentlemen called the achilles of germany in his day has halfacentury of fighting with his own n√ºrembergers with bavaria france burgundy and its fiery charles besides being head constable to the kaiser among any disorderly persons in the east his skull long shown on his tomb marvellous for strength and with no visible sutures   iv john the orator of his race but the orations unrecorded his second son archbishop of maintz for whose piece of memorable work see page 223 143 and read in connection with that the history of margraf george pp 237241 152154 and the 8th chapter of the third book   v joachim i of little note thinks there has been enough reformation and checks proceedings in a dull stubbornness causing him at least grave domestic difficultiespage 271 173   vi joachim ii again active in the reformation and staunch       though generally in a cautious weighty never in a rash      swift way to the great cause of protestantism and to all      good causes he was himself a solemnly devout man deep      awestricken reverence dwelling in his view of this      universe most serious though with a jocose dialect      commonly having a cheerful wit in speaking to men luthers      books he called his seelenschatz souls treasure luther      and the bible were his chief reading fond of profane      learning too and of the useful or ornamental arts given      to music and would himself sing aloud when he had a      melodious leisure hour   vii johann george a prudent thrifty herr no mistresses no luxuries allowed at the sight of a newfashioned coat he would fly out on an unhappy youth and pack him from his presence very strict in point of justice a peasant once appealing to him in one of his inspection journeys through the country       grant me justice durchlaucht against so and so i am your      highnesss born subject thou shouldst have it man wert      thou a born turk answered johann george  thus generally we find this line of electors representing in europe the puritan mind of england in a somewhat duller but less dangerous form receiving what protestantism could teach of honesty and common sense but not its anticatholic fury or its selfish spiritual anxiety pardon of sins is not to be had from tetzel neither the hohenzollern mind advises with itself from even tetzels master for either the buying or the asking on the whole we had better commit as few as possible and live just lives and plain ones       a conspicuous thrift veracity modest solidity looks      through the conduct of this herr a determined protestant he      too as indeed all the following were and are   viii joachim friedrich gets hold of prussia which hitherto you observe has always been spoken of as a separate country from brandenburg march 11 1605squeezed his way into the actual guardianship of preussen and its imbecile duke which was his by right  for my own part i do not trouble myself much about these rights never being able to make out any single one to begin with except the right to keep everything and every place about you in as good order as you canprussia poland or what else i should much like for instance just now to hear of any honest cornish gentleman of the old drake breed taking a fancy to land in spain and trying what he could make of his rights as far round gibraltar as he could enforce them at all events master joachim has somehow got hold of prussia and means to keep it   ix johann sigismund only notable for our economical purposes as getting the guardianship of prussia confirmed to him the story at page 317 226 a strong flame of choler indicates a new order of things among the knights of europeprincely etiquettes melting all into smoke too literally so that being one of the calamitous functions of the plain lives we are living and of the busy life our country is living in the duchy of cleve especially concerning which legal dispute begins in sigismunds time and it is well worth the lawyers trouble it seems       it amounted perhaps to two yorkshires in extent a      naturally opulent country of fertile meadows shipping      capabilities metalliferous hills and at this time in      consequence of the dutchspanish war and the multitude of      protestant refugees it was getting filled with ingenious      industries and rising to be what it still is the busiest      quarter of germany a country lowing with kine the hum of      the flaxspindle heard in its cottages in those old      daysmuch of the linen called hollands is made in j√ºlich      and only bleached stamped and sold by the dutch says      b√ºsching a country in our days which is shrouded at short      intervals with the due canopy of coalsmoke and loud with      sounds of the anvil and the loom  the lawyers took two hundred and six years to settle the question concerning this duchy and the thing johann sigismund had claimed legally in 1609 was actually handed over to johann sigismunds descendant in the seventh generation these litigated duchies are now the prussian provinces j√ºlich berg cleve and the nucleus of prussias possessions in the rhine country   x george wilhelm read pp 325 to 327 231 233 on this elector and german protestantism now fallen cold and somewhat too little dangerous but george wilhelm is the only weak prince of all the twelve for another example how the heart and life of a country depend upon its prince not on its council read this of gustavus adolphus demanding the cession of spandau and k√ºstrin       which cession kurf√ºrst george wilhelm though giving all his      prayers to the good cause could by no means grant gustav      had to insist with more and more emphasis advancing at      last with military menace upon berlin itself he was met by      george wilhelm and his council in the woods of c√∂penick      short way to the east of that city there george wilhelm and      his council wandered about sending messages hopelessly      consulting saying among each other que faire ils ont des      canons for many hours so round the inflexible gustav who      was there like a fixed milestone and to all questions and      comers had only one answer  on our special question of war and its consequences read this of the thirty years one       but on the whole the grand weapon in it and towards the      latter times the exclusive one was hunger the opposing      armies tried to starve one another at lowest tried each      not to starve each trying to eat the country or at any      rate to leave nothing eatable in it what that will mean      for the country we may consider as the armies too      frequently and the kaisers armies habitually lived      without commissariat often enough without pay all horrors      of war and of being a seat of war that have been since      heard of are poor to those then practised the detail of      which is still horrible to read germany in all eatable      quarters of it had to undergo the process tortured torn      to pieces wrecked and brayed as in a mortar under the      iron mace of war brandenburg saw its towns seized and      sacked its country populations driven to despair by the one      party and the other three timesfirst in the      wallensteinmecklenburg times while fire and sword were the      weapons and again twice over in the ultimate stages of      the struggle when starvation had become the      methodbrandenburg fell to be the principal theatre of      conflict where all forms of the dismal were at their      height in 1638 three years after that precious peace of      prag the ravages of the starving gallas and his      imperialists excelled all precedent men ate human flesh      nay human creatures ate their own children que faire ils      ont des canons  we have now arrived at the lowest nadir point says carlyle of the history of brandenburg under the hohenzollerns is this then all that heavy peg and our nine kurf√ºrsts have done for us  carlyle does not mean that but even he greatest of historians since tacitus is not enough careful to mark for us the growth of national character as distinct from the prosperity of dynasties  a republican historian would think of this development only and suppose it to be possible without any dynasties  which is indeed in a measure so and the work now chiefly needed in moral philosophy as well as history is an analysis of the constant and prevalent yet unthought of influences which without any external help from kings and in a silent and entirely necessary manner form in sweden in bavaria in the tyrol in the scottish border and on the french seacoast races of noble peasants pacific poetic heroic christianhearted in the deepest sense who may indeed perish by sword or famine in any cruel thirty years war or ignoble thirty years peace and yet leave such strength to their children that the country apparently ravaged into hopeless ruin revives under any prudent king as the cultivated fields do under the spring rain how the rock to which no seed can cling and which no rain can soften is subdued into the good ground which can bring forth its hundredfold we forget to watch while we follow the footsteps of the sower or mourn the catastrophes of storm all this while the prussian earththe prussian soulhas been thus dealt upon by successive fate and now though laid as it seems utterly desolate it can be revived by a few years of wisdom and of peace  vol i book iii chap xviiithe great elector friedrich wilhelm eleventh of the dynasty       there hardly ever came to sovereign power a young man of      twenty under more distressing hopelesslooking      circumstances political significance brandenburg had none      a mere protestant appendage dragged about by a papist      kaiser his fathers prime minister as we have seen was in      the interest of his enemies not brandenburgs servant but      austrias the very commandants of his fortresses      commandant of spandau more especially refused to obey      friedrich wilhelm on his accession were bound to obey the      kaiser in the first place       for twenty years past brandenburg had been scoured by      hostile armies which especially the kaisers part of      which committed outrages new in human history in a year or      two hence brandenburg became again the theatre of business      austrian gallas advancing thither again 1644 with intent      to shut up torstenson and his swedes in jutland gallas      could by no means do what he intended on the contrary he      had to run from torstensonwhat feet could do was hunted      he and his merode br√ºder beautiful inventors of the      marauding art till they pretty much all died crepirten      says k√∂hler no great loss to society the death of these      artists but we can fancy what their life and especially      what the process of their dying may have cost poor      brandenburg again       friedrich wilhelms aim in this as in other emergencies      was sunclear to himself but for most part dim to everybody      else he had to walk very warily sweden on one hand of him      suspicious kaiser on the other he had to wear semblances      to be ready with evasive words and advance noiselessly by      many circuits more delicate operation could not be      imagined but advance he did advance and arrive with      extraordinary talent diligence and felicity the young man      wound himself out of this first fatal position got those      foreign armies pushed out of his country and kept them out      his first concern had been to find some vestige of revenue      to put that upon a clear footing and by loans or otherwise      to scrape a little readymoney together on the strength of      which a small body of soldiers could be collected about him      and drilled into real ability to fight and obey this as a      basis on this followed all manner of things freedom from      swedishaustrian invasions as the first thing he was      himself as appeared byandby a fighter of the first      quality when it came to that but never was willing to      fight if he could help it preferred rather to shift      manoeuvre and negotiate which he did in most vigilant      adroit and masterly manner but by degrees he had grown to      have and could maintain it an army of twentyfour thousand      men among the best troops then in being  to wear semblances to be ready with evasive words how is this mr carlyle thinks perhaps the rightly thoughtful reader  yes such things have to be there are lies and lies and there are truths and truths ulysses cannot ride on the rams back like phryxus but must ride under his belly read also this presently following       shortly after which friedrich wilhelm who had shone much      in the battle of warsaw into which he was dragged against      his will changed sides an inconsistent treacherous man      perhaps not o reader

         20     preface to the second edition   i have seldom been more disappointed by the result of my best pains given to any of my books than by the earnest request of my publisher after the opinion of the public had been taken on the ethics of the dust that i would write no more in dialogue however i bowed to public judgment in this matter at once knowing also my inventive powers to be of the feeblest but in reprinting the book at the prevailing request of my kind friend mr henry willett i would pray the readers whom it may at first offend by its disconnected method to examine nevertheless with care the passages in which the principal speaker sums the conclusions of any dialogue for these summaries were written as introductions for young people to all that i have said on the same matters in my larger books and on rereading them they satisfy me better and seem to me calculated to be more generally useful than anything else i have done of the kind  the summary of the contents of the whole book beginning you may at least earnestly believe at p 130 is thus the clearest exposition i have ever yet given of the general conditions under which the personal creative power manifests itself in the forms of matter and the analysis of heathen conceptions of deity beginning at p 131 and closing at p 138 not only prefaces but very nearly supersedes all that in more lengthy terms i have since asserted or pleaded for in aratra pentelici and the queen of the air  and thus however the book may fail in its intention of suggesting new occupations or interests to its younger readers i think it worth reprinting in the way i have also reprinted unto this lastpage for page that the students of my more advanced works may be able to refer to these as the original documents of them of which the most essential in this book are these following  i the explanation of the baseness of the avaricious functions of the lower pthah p 39 with his beetlegospel p 41 that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues explains the main motive of all my books on political economy  ii the examination of the connexion between stupidity and crime pp 5762 anticipated all that i have had to urge in fors clavigera against the commonly alleged excuse for public wickednessthey dont mean itthey dont know any better  iii the examination of the roots of moral power pp 9092 is a summary of what is afterwards developed with utmost care in my inaugural lecture at oxford on the relation of art to morals compare in that lecture ¬ß¬ß 8385 with the sentence in p 91 of this book nothing is ever done so as really to please our father unless we would also have done it though we had had no father to know of it  this sentence however it must be observed regards only the general conditions of action in the children of god in consequence of which it is foretold of them by christ that they will say at the judgment when saw we thee it does not refer to the distinct cases in which virtue consists in faith given to command appearing to foolish human judgment inconsistent with the moral law as in the sacrifice of isaac nor to those in which any directlygiven command requires nothing more of virtue than obedience  iv the subsequent pages 9297 were written especially to check the dangerous impulses natural to the minds of many amiable young women in the direction of narrow and selfish religious sentiment and they contain therefore nearly everything which i believe it necessary that young people should be made to observe respecting the errors of monastic life but they in nowise enter on the reverse or favourable side of which indeed i did not and as yet do not feel myself able to speak with any decisiveness the evidence on that side as stated in the text having never yet been dispassionately examined  v the dialogue with lucilla beginning at p 63 is to my own fancy the best bit of conversation in the book and the issue of it at p 67 the most practically and immediately useful for on the idea of the inevitable weakness and corruption of human nature has logically followed in our daily life the horrible creed of modern social science that all social action must be scientifically founded on vicious impulses but on the habit of measuring and reverencing our powers and talents that we may kindly use them will be founded a true social science developing by the employment of them all the real powers and honourable feelings of the race  vi finally the account given in the second and third lectures of the real nature and marvellousness of the laws of crystallization is necessary to the understanding of what farther teaching of the beauty of inorganic form i may be able to give either in deucalion or in my elements of drawing i wish however that the second lecture had been made the beginning of the book and would fain now cancel the first altogether which i perceive to be both obscure and dull it was meant for a metaphorical description of the pleasures and dangers in the kingdom of mammon or of worldly wealth its waters mixed with blood its fruits entangled in thickets of trouble and poisonous when gathered and the final captivity of its inhabitants within frozen walls of cruelty and disdain but the imagery is stupid and ineffective throughout and i retain this chapter only because i am resolved to leave no room for any one to say that i have withdrawn as erroneous in principle so much as a single sentence of any of my books written since 1860  one license taken in this book however though often permitted to essaywriters for the relief of their dulness i never mean to take morethe relation of composed metaphor as of actual dream pp 23 and 104 i assumed it is true that in these places the supposed dream would be easily seen to be an invention but must not any more even under so transparent disguise pretend to any share in the real powers of vision possessed by great poets and true painters      brantwood      10th october 1877     preface   the following lectures were really given in substance at a girls school far in the country which in the course of various experiments on the possibility of introducing some better practice of drawing into the modern scheme of female education i visited frequently enough to enable the children to regard me as a friend the lectures always fell more or less into the form of fragmentary answers to questions and they are allowed to retain that form as on the whole likely to be more interesting than the symmetries of a continuous treatise many children for the school was large took part at different times in the conversations but i have endeavoured without confusedly multiplying the number of imaginary144 speakers to represent as far as i could the general tone of comment and enquiry among young people  it will be at once seen that these lectures were not intended for an introduction to mineralogy their purpose was merely to awaken in the minds of young girls who were ready to work earnestly and systematically a vital interest in the subject of their study no science can be learned in play but it is often possible in play to bring good fruit out of past labour or show sufficient reasons for the labour of the future  the narrowness of this aim does not indeed justify the absence of all reference to many important principles of structure and many of the most interesting orders of minerals but i felt it impossible to go far into detail without illustrations and if readers find this book useful i may perhaps endeavour to supplement it by illustrated notes of the more interesting phenomena in separate groups of familiar mineralsflints of the chalkagates of the basaltsand the fantastic and exquisitely beautiful varieties of the veinores of the two commonest metals lead and iron but i have always found that the less we speak of our intentions the more chance there is of our realizing them and this poor little book will sufficiently have done its work for the present if it engages any of its young readers in study which may enable them to despise it for its shortcomings      denmark hill      christmas 1865  footnotes  144 i do not mean in saying imaginary that i have not permitted to myself in several instances the affectionate discourtesy of some reminiscence of personal character for which i must hope to be forgiven by my old pupils and their friends as i could not otherwise have written the book at all but only two sentences in all the dialogues and the anecdote of dotty are literally historical     the ethics of the dust     lecture i  the valley of diamonds       a very idle talk by the diningroom fire after      raisinandalmond time   old lecturer florrie isabel may lily and sibyl  old lecturer l come here isabel and tell me what the makebelieve was this afternoon  isabel arranging herself very primly on the footstool such a dreadful one florrie and i were lost in the valley of diamonds  l what sindbads which nobody could get out of  isabel yes but florrie and i got out of it  l so i see at least i see you did but are you sure florrie did  isabel quite sure  florrie putting her head round from behind ls sofacushion quite sure disappears again  l i think i could be made to feel surer about it       florrie reappears gives l a kiss and again exit  l i suppose its all right but how did you manage it  isabel well you know the eagle that took up sindbad was very largevery very largethe largest of all the eagles  l how large were the others  isabel i dont quite knowthey were so far off but this one was oh so big and it had great wings as wide astwice over the ceiling so when it was picking up sindbad florrie and i thought it wouldnt know if we got on its back too so i got up first and then i pulled up florrie and we put our arms round its neck and away it flew  l but why did you want to get out of the valley and why havent you brought me some diamonds  isabel it was because of the serpents i couldnt pick up even the least little bit of a diamond i was so frightened  l you should not have minded the serpents  isabel oh but suppose that they had minded me  l we all of us mind you a little too much isabel im afraid  isabel nonono indeed  l i tell you what isabeli dont believe either sindbad or florrie or you ever were in the valley of diamonds  isabel you naughty when i tell you we were  l because you say you were frightened at the serpents  isabel and wouldnt you have been  l not at those serpents nobody who really goes into the valley is ever frightened at themthey are so beautiful  isabel suddenly serious but theres no real valley of diamonds is there  l yes isabel very real indeed  florrie reappearing oh where tell me about it  l i cannot tell you a great deal about it only i know it is very different from sindbads in his valley there was only a diamond lying here and there but in the real valley there are diamonds covering the grass in showers every morning instead of dew and there are clusters of trees which look like lilac trees but in spring all their blossoms are of amethyst  florrie but there cant be any serpents there then  l why not  florrie because they dont come into such beautiful places  l i never said it was a beautiful place  florrie what not with diamonds strewed about it like dew  l thats according te your fancy florrie for myself i like dew better  isabel oh but the dew wont stay it all dries  l yes and it would be much nicer if the diamonds dried too for the people in the valley have to sweep them off the grass in heaps whenever they want to walk on it and then the heaps glitter so they hurt ones eyes  florrie now youre just playing you know  l so are you you know  florrie yes but you mustnt play  l thats very hard florrie why mustnt i if you may  florrie oh i may because im little but you mustnt because yourehesitates for a delicate expression of magnitude  l rudely taking the first that comes because im big no thats not the way of it at all florrie because youre little you should have very little play and because im big i should have a great deal  isabel and florrie both nononono that isnt it at all isabel sola quoting miss ingelow the lambs play alwaysthey know no better putting her head very much on one side ah nowpleasepleasetell us true we want to know  l but why do you want me to tell you true any more than the man who wrote the arabian nights  isabel becausebecause we like to know about real things and you can tell us and we cant ask the man who wrote the stories  l what do you call real things  isabel now you know things that really are  l whether you can see them or not  isabel yes if somebody else saw them  l but if nobody has ever seen them  isabel evading the point well but you know if there were a real valley of diamonds somebody must have seen it  l you cannot be so sure of that isabel many people go to real places and never see them and many people pass through this valley and never see it  florrie what stupid people they must be  l no florrie they are much wiser than the people who do see it  may i think i know where it is  isabel tell us more about it and then well guess  l well theres a great broad road by a riverside leading up into it  may gravely cunning with emphasis on the last word does the road really go up  l you think it should go down into a valley no it goes up this is a valley among the hills and it is as high as the clouds and is often full of them so that even the people who most want to see it cannot always  isabel and what is the river beside the road like  l it ought to be very beautiful because it flows over diamond sandonly the water is thick and red  isabel red water  l it isnt all water  may oh please never mind that isabel just now i want to hear about the valley  l so the entrance to it is very wide under a steep rock only such numbers of people are always trying to get in that they keep jostling each other and manage it but slowly some weak ones are pushed back and never get in at all and make great moaning as they go away but perhaps they are none the worse in the end  may and when one gets in what is it like  l it is up and down broken kind of ground the road stops directly and there are great dark rocks covered all over with wild gourds and wild vines the gourds if you cut them are red with black seeds like watermelons and look ever so nice and the people of the place make a red pottage of them but you must take care not to eat any if you ever want to leave the valley though i believe putting plenty of meal in it makes it wholesome then the wild vines have clusters of the colour of amber and the people of the country say they are the grape of eshcol and sweeter than honey but indeed if anybody else tastes them they are like gall then there are thickets of bramble so thorny that they would be cut away directly anywhere else but here they are covered with little cinquefoiled blossoms of pure silver and for berries they have clusters of rubies dark rubies which you only see are red after gathering them but you may fancy what blackberry parties the children have only they get their frocks and hands sadly torn  lily but rubies cant spot ones frocks as blackberries do  l no but ill tell you what spots themthe mulberries there are great forests of them all up the hills covered with silkworms some munching the leaves so loud that it is like mills at work and some spinning but the berries are the blackest you ever saw and wherever they fall they stain a deep red and nothing ever washes it out again and it is their juice soaking through the grass which makes the river so red because all its springs are in this wood and the boughs of the trees are twisted as if in pain like old olive branches and their leaves are dark and it is in these forests that the serpents are but nobody is afraid of them they have fine crimson crests and they are wreathed about the wild branches one in every tree nearly and they are singing serpents for the serpents are in this forest what birds are in ours  florrie oh i dont want to go there at all now  l you would like it very much indeed florrie if you were there the serpents would not bite you the only fear would be of your turning into one  florrie oh dear but thats worse  l you wouldnt think so if you really were turned into one florrie you would be very proud of your crest and as long as you were yourself not that you could get there if you remained quite the little florrie you are now you would like to hear the serpents sing they hiss a little through it like the cicadas in italy but they keep good time and sing delightful melodies and most of them have seven heads with throats which each take a note of the octave so that they can sing chordsit is very fine indeed and the fireflies fly round the edge of the forests all the night long you wade in fireflies they make the fields look like a lake trembling with reflection of stars but you must take care not to touch them for they are not like italian fireflies but burn like real sparks  florrie i dont like it at all ill never go there  l i hope not florrie or at least that you will get out again if you do and it is very difficult to get out for beyond these serpent forests there are great cliffs of dead gold which form a labyrinth winding always higher and higher till the gold is all split asunder by wedges of ice and glaciers welded half of ice seven times frozen and half of gold seven times frozen hang down from them and fall in thunder cleaving into deadly splinters like the cretan arrowheads and into a mixed dust of snow and gold ponderous yet which the mountain whirlwinds are able to lift and drive in wreaths and pillars hiding the paths with a burial cloud fatal at once with wintry chill and weight of golden ashes so the wanderers in the labyrinth fall one by one and are buried thereyet over the drifted graves those who are spared climb to the last through coil on coil of the pathfor at the end of it they see the king of the valley sitting on his throne and beside him but it is only a false vision spectra of creatures like themselves set on thrones from which they seem to look down on all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and on the canopy of his throne there is an inscription in fiery letters which they strive to read but cannot for it is written in words which are like the words of all languages and yet are of none men say it is more like their own tongue to the english than it is to any other nation but the only record of it is by an italian who heard the king himself cry it as a war cry pape satan pape satan aleppe145  sibyl but do they all perish there you said there was a way through the valley and out of it  l yes but few find it if any of them keep to the grass paths where the diamonds are swept aside and hold their hands over their eyes so as not to be dazzled the grass paths lead forward gradually to a place where one sees a little opening in the golden rocks you were at chamouni last year sibyl did your guide chance to show you the pierced rock of the aiguille du midi  sibyl no indeed we only got up from geneva on monday night and it rained all tuesday and we had to be back at geneva again early on wednesday morning  l of course that is the way to see a country in a sibylline manner by inner consciousness but you might have seen the pierced rock in your drive up or down if the clouds broke not that there is much to see in it one of the crags of the aiguilleedge on the southern slope of it is struck sharply through as by an awl into a little eyelet hole which you may see seven thousand feet above the valley as the clouds flit past behind it or leave the sky first white and then dark blue well theres just such an eyelet hole in one of the upper crags of the diamond valley and from a distance you think that it is no bigger than the eye of a needle but if you get up to it they say you may drive a loaded camel through it and that there are fine things on the other side but i have never spoken with anybody who had been through  sibyl i think we understand it now we will try to write it down and think of it  l meantime florrie though all that i have been telling you is very true yet you must not think the sort of diamonds that people wear in rings and necklaces are found lying about on the grass would you like to see how they really are found  florrie oh yesyes  l isabelor lilyrun up to my room and fetch me the little box with a glass lid out of the top drawer of the chest of drawers race between lily and isabel       reenter isabel with the box very much out of breath      lily behind  l why you never can beat lily in a race on the stairs can you isabel  isabel panting lilybeat meever so farbut she gave methe boxto carry in  l take off the lid then gently  florrie after peeping in disappointed theres only a great ugly brown stone  l not much more than that certainly florrie if people were wise but look it is not a single stone but a knot of pebbles fastened together by gravel and in the gravel or compressed sand if you look close you will see grains of gold glittering everywhere all through and then do you see these two white beads which shine as if they had been covered with grease  florrie may i touch them  l yes you will find they are not greasy only very smooth well those are the fatal jewels native here in their dust with gold so that you may see cradled here together the two great enemies of mankindthe strongest of all malignant physical powers that have tormented our race  sibyl is that really so i know they do great harm but do they not also do great good  l my dear child what good was any woman do you suppose ever the better for possessing diamonds but how many have been made base frivolous and miserable by desiring them was ever man the better for having coffers full of gold but who shall measure the guilt that is incurred to fill them look into the history of any civilised nations analyse with reference to this one cause of crime and misery the lives and thoughts of their nobles priests merchants and men of luxurious life every other temptation is at last concentrated into this pride and lust and envy and anger all give up their strength to avarice the sin of the whole world is essentially the sin of judas men do not disbelieve their christ but they sell him  sibyl but surely that is the fault of human nature it is not caused by the accident as it were of there being a pretty metal like gold to be found by digging if people could not find that would they not find something else and quarrel for it instead  l no wherever legislators have succeeded in excluding for a time jewels and precious metals from among national possessions the national spirit has remained healthy covetousness is not natural to mangenerosity is but covetousness must be excited by a special cause as a given disease by a given miasma and the essential nature of a material for the excitement of covetousness is that it shall be a beautiful thing which can be retained without a use the moment we can use our possessions to any good purpose ourselves the instinct of communicating that use to others rises side by side with our power if you can read a book rightly you will want others to hear it if you can enjoy a picture rightly you will want others to see it learn how to manage a horse a plough or a ship and you will desire to make your subordinates good horsemen ploughmen or sailors you will never be able to see the fine instrument you are master of abused but once fix your desire on anything useless and all the purest pride and folly in your heart will mix with the desire and make you at last wholly inhuman a mere ugly lump of stomach and suckers like a cuttlefish  sibyl but surely these two beautiful things gold and diamonds must have been appointed to some good purpose  l quite conceivably so my dear as also earthquakes and pestilences but of such ultimate purposes we can have no sight the practical immediate office of the earthquake and pestilence is to slay us like moths and as moths we shall be wise to live out of their way so the practical immediate office of gold and diamonds is the multiplied destruction of souls in whatever sense you have been taught to understand that phrase and the paralysis of wholesome human effort and thought on the face of gods earth and a wise nation will live out of the way of them the money which the english habitually spend in cutting diamonds would in ten years if it were applied to cutting rocks instead leave no dangerous reef nor difficult harbour round the whole island coast great britain would be a diamond worth cutting indeed a true piece of regalia leaves this to their thoughts for a little while then also we poor mineralogists might sometimes have the chance of seeing a fine crystal of diamond unhacked by the jeweller  sibyl would it be more beautiful uncut  l no but of infinite interest we might even come to know something about the making of diamonds  sibyl i thought the chemists could make them already  l in very small black crystals yes but no one knows how they are formed where they are found or if indeed they are formed there at all these in my hand look as if they had been swept down with the gravel and gold only we can trace the gravel and gold to their native rocks but not the diamonds read the account given of the diamond in any good work on mineralogyyou will find nothing but lists of localities of gravel or conglomerate rock which is only an old indurated gravel some say it was once a vegetable gum but it may have been charred wood but what one would like to know is mainly why charcoal should make itself into diamonds in india and only into black lead in borrowdale  sibyl are they wholly the same then  l there is a little iron mixed with our black lead but nothing to hinder its crystallisation your pencils in fact are all pointed with formless diamond though they would be hhh pencils to purpose if it crystallised  subyl but what is crystallisation  l a pleasant question when ones half asleep and it has been tea time these two hours what thoughtless things girls are  sibyl yes we are but we want to know for all that  l my dear it would take a week to tell you  sibyl well take it and tell us  l but nobody knows anything about it  sibyl then tell us something that nobody knows  l get along with you and tell dora to make tea       the house rises but of course the lecturer wanted to be      forced to lecture again and was  footnotes  145 dante inf 7 1     lecture ii  the pyramid builders       in the large schoolroom to which everybody has been      summoned by ringing of the great bell   l so you have all actually come to hear about crystallisation i cannot conceive why unless the little ones think that the discussion may involve some reference to sugarcandy       symptoms of high displeasure among the younger members of      council isabel frowns severely at l and shakes her head      violently  my dear children if you knew it you are yourselves at this moment as you sit in your ranks nothing in the eye of a mineralogist but a lovely group of rosy sugarcandy arranged by atomic forces and even admitting you to be something more you have certainly been crystallising without knowing it did i not hear a great hurrying and whispering ten minutes ago when you were late in from the playground and thought you would not all be quietly seated by the time i was readybesides some discussion about placessomething about its not being fair that the little ones should always be nearest well you were then all being crystallised when you ran in from the garden and against one another in the passages you were in what mineralogists would call a state of solution and gradual confluence when you got seated in those orderly rows each in her proper place you became crystalline that is just what the atoms of a mineral do if they can whenever they get disordered they get into order again as soon as may be  i hope you feel inclined to interrupt me and say but we know our places how do the atoms know theirs and sometimes we dispute about our places do the atomsand besides we dont like being compared to atoms at allnever dispute about theirs two wise questions these if you had a mind to put them it was long before i asked them myself of myself and i will not call you atoms any more may i call youlet me seeprimary molecules general dissent indicated in subdued but decisive murmurs no not even in familiar saxon dust       pause with expression on faces of sorrowful doubt lily      gives voice to the general sentiment in a timid please      dont  no children i wont call you that and mind as you grow up that you do not get into an idle and wicked habit of calling yourselves that you are something better than dust and have other duties to do than ever dust can do and the bonds of affection you will enter into are better than merely getting into order but see to it on the other hand that you always behave at least as well as dust remember it is only on compulsion and while it has no free permission to do as it likes that it ever gets out of order but sometimes with some of us the compulsion has to be the other wayhasnt it remonstratory whispers expressive of opinion that the lecturer is becoming too personal im not looking at anybody in particularindeed i am not nay if you blush so kathleen how can one help looking well go back to the atoms  how do they know their places you asked or should have asked yes and they have to do much more than know them they have to find their way to them and that quietly and at once without running against each other  we may indeed state it briefly thussuppose you have to build a castle with towers and roofs and buttresses out of bricks of a given shape and that these bricks are all lying in a huge heap at the bottom in utter confusion upset out of carts at random you would have to draw a great many plans and count all your bricks and be sure you had enough for this and that tower before you began and then you would have to lay your foundation and add layer by layer in order slowly  but how would you be astonished in these melancholy days when children dont read childrens books nor believe any more in fairies if suddenly a real benevolent fairy in a bright brickred gown were to rise in the midst of the red bricks and to tap the heap of them with her wand and say bricks bricks to your places and then you saw in an instant the whole heap rise in the air like a swarm of red bees andyou have been used to see bees make a honeycomb and to think that strange enough but now you would see the honeycomb make itselfyou want to ask something florrie by the look of your eyes  florrie are they turned into real bees with stings  l no florrie you are only to fancy flying bricks as you saw the slates flying from the roof the other day in the storm only those slates didnt seem to know where they were going and besides were going where they had no business but my spellbound bricks though they have no wings and what is worse no heads and no eyes yet find their way in the air just where they should settle into towers and roofs each flying to his place and fastening there at the right moment so that every other one shall fit to him in his turn  lily but who are the fairies then who build the crystals  l there is one great fairy lily who builds much more than crystals but she builds these also i dreamed that i saw her building a pyramid the other day as she used to do for the pharaohs  isabel but that was only a dream  l some dreams are truer than some wakings isabel but i wont tell it you unless you like  isabel oh please please  l you are all such wise children theres no talking to you you wont believe anything  lily no we are not wise and we will believe anything when you say we ought  l well it came about this way sibyl do you recollect that evening when we had been looking at your old cave by cum√¶ and wondering why you didnt live there still and then we wondered how old you were and egypt said you wouldnt tell and nobody else could tell but she and you laughedi thought very gaily for a sibyland said you would harness a flock of cranes for us and we might fly over to egypt if we liked and see  sibyl yes and you went and couldnt find out after all  l why you know egypt had been just doubling that third pyramid of hers146 and making a new entrance into it and a fine entrance it was first we had to go through an anteroom which had both its doors blocked up with stones and then we had three granite portcullises to pull up one after another and the moment we had got under them egypt signed to somebody above and down they came again behind us with a roar like thunder only louder then we got into a passage fit for nobody but rats and egypt wouldnt go any further herself but said we might go on if we liked and so we came to a hole in the pavement and then to a granite trapdoorand then we thought we had gone quite far enough and came back and egypt laughed at us  egypt you would not have had me take my crown off and stoop all the way down a passage fit only for rats  l it was not the crown egyptyou know that very well it was the flounces that would not let you go any farther i suppose however you wear them as typical of the inundation of the nile so it is all right  isabel why didnt you take me with you where rats can go mice can i wouldnt have come back  l no mousie you would have gone on by yourself and you might have waked one of pashts cats147 and it would have eaten you i was very glad you were not there but after all this i suppose the imagination of the heavy granite blocks and the underground ways had troubled me and dreams are often shaped in a strange opposition to the impressions that have caused them and from all that we had been reading in bunsen about stones that couldnt be lifted with levers i began to dream about stones that lifted themselves with wings  sibyl now you must just tell us all about it  l i dreamed that i was standing beside the lake out of whose clay the bricks were made for the great pyramid of asychis148 they had just been all finished and were lying by the lake margin in long ridges like waves it was near evening and as i looked towards the sunset i saw a thing like a dark pillar standing where the rock of the desert stoops to the nile valley i did not know there was a pillar there and wondered at it and it grew larger and glided nearer becoming like the form of a man but vast and it did not move its feet but glided like a pillar of sand and as it drew nearer i looked by chance past it towards the sun and saw a silver cloud which was of all the clouds closest to the sun and in one place crossed it draw itself back from the sun suddenly and it turned and shot towards the dark pillar leaping in an arch like an arrow out of a bow and i thought it was lightning but when it came near the shadowy pillar it sank slowly down beside it and changed into the shape of a woman very beautiful and with a strength of deep calm in her blue eyes she was robed to the feet with a white robe and above that to her knees by the cloud which i had seen across the sun but all the golden ripples of it had become plumes so that it had changed into two bright wings like those of a vulture which wrapped round her to her knees she had a weavers shuttle hanging over her shoulder by the thread of it and in her left hand arrows tipped with fire  isabel clapping her hands oh it was neith it was neith i know now  l yes it was neith herself and as the two great spirits came nearer to me i saw they were the brother and sisterthe pillared shadow was the greater pthah149 and i heard them speak and the sound of their words was like a distant singing i could not understand the words one by one yet their sense came to me and so i knew that neith had come down to see her brothers work and the work that he had put into the mind of the king to make his servants do and she was displeased at it because she saw only pieces of dark clay and no porphyry nor marble nor any fair stone that men might engrave the figures of the gods upon and she blamed her brother and said oh lord of truth is this then thy will that men should mould only foursquare pieces of clay and the forms of the gods no more then the lord of truth sighed and said oh sister in truth they do not love us why should they set up our images let them do what they may and not lielet them make their clay foursquare and labour and perish  then neiths dark blue eyes grew darker and she said oh lord of truth why should they love us their love is vain or fear us for their fear is base yet let them testify of us that they knew we lived for ever  but the lord of truth answered they know and yet they know not let them keep silence for their silence only is truth  but neith answered brother wilt thou also make league with death because death is true oh thou potter who hast cast these human things from thy wheel many to dishonour and few to honour wilt thou not let them so much as see my face but slay them in slavery  but pthah only answered let them build sister let them build  and neith answered what shall they build if i build not with them  and pthah drew with his measuring rod upon the sand and i saw suddenly drawn on the sand the outlines of great cities and of vaults and domes and aqueducts and bastions and towers greater than obelisks covered with black clouds and the wind blew ripples of sand amidst the lines that pthah drew and the moving sand was like the marching of men but i saw that wherever neith looked at the lines they faded and were effaced  oh brother she said at last what is this vanity if i who am lady of wisdom do not mock the children of men why shouldst thou mock them who art lord of truth but pthah answered they thought to bind me and they shall be bound they shall labour in the fire for vanity  and neith said looking at the sand brother there is no true labour herethere is only weary life and wasteful death  and pthah answered is it not truer labour sister than thy sculpture of dreams  then neith smiled and stopped suddenly  she looked to the sun its edge touched the horizonedge of the desert then she looked to the long heaps of pieces of clay that lay each with its blue shadow by the lake shore  brother she said how long will this pyramid of thine be in building  thoth will have sealed the scroll of the years ten times before the summit is laid  brother thou knowest not how to teach thy children to labour answered neith look i must follow phre beyond atlas shall i build your pyramid for you before he goes down and pthah answered yea sister if thou canst put thy winged shoulders to such work and neith drew herself to her height and i heard a clashing pass through the plumes of her wings and the asp stood up on her helmet and fire gathered in her eyes and she took one of the flaming arrows out of the sheaf in her left hand and stretched it out over the heaps of clay and they rose up like flights of locusts and spread themselves in the air so that it grew dark in a moment then neith designed them places with her arrow point and they drew into ranks like dark clouds laid level at morning then neith pointed with her arrow to the north and to the south and to the east and to the west and the flying motes of earth drew asunder into four great ranked crowds and stood one in the north and one in the south and one in the east and one in the westone against another then neith spread her wings wide for an instant and closed them with a sound like the sound of a rushing sea and waved her hand towards the foundation of the pyramid where it was laid on the brow of the desert and the four flocks drew together and sank down like seabirds settling to a level rock and when they met there was a sudden flame as broad as the pyramid and as high as the clouds and it dazzled me and i closed my eyes for an instant and when i looked again the pyramid stood on its rock perfect and purple with the light from the edge of the sinking sun  the younger children variously pleased im so glad how nice but what did pthah say  l neith did not wait to hear what he would say when i turned back to look at her she was gone and i only saw the level white cloud form itself again close to the arch of the sun as it sank and as the last edge of the sun disappeared the form of pthah faded into a mighty shadow and so passed away  egypt and was neiths pyramid left  l yes but you could not think egypt what a strange feeling of utter loneliness came over me when the presence of the two gods passed away it seemed as if i had never known what it was to be alone before and the unbroken line of the desert was terrible  egypt i used to feel that when i was queen sometimes i had to carve gods for company all over my palace i would fain have seen real ones if i could  l but listen a moment yet for that was not quite all my dream the twilight drew swiftly to the dark and i could hardly see the great pyramid when there came a heavy murmuring sound in the air and a horned beetle with terrible claws fell on the sand at my feet with a blow like the beat of a hammer then it stood up on its hind claws and waved its pincers at me and its fore claws became strong arms and hands one grasping real iron pincers and the other a huge hammer and it had a helmet on its head without any eyelet holes that i could see and its two hind claws became strong crooked legs with feet bent inwards and so there stood by me a dwarf in glossy black armour ribbed and embossed like a beetles back leaning on his hammer and i could not speak for wonder but he spoke with a murmur like the dying away of a beat upon a bell he said i will make neiths great pyramid small i am the lower pthah and have power over fire i can wither the strong things and strengthen the weak and everything that is great i can make small and everything that is little i can make great then he turned to the angle of the pyramid and limped towards it and the pyramid grew deep purple and then red like blood and then pale rosecolour like fire and i saw that it glowed with fire from within and the lower pthah touched it with the hand that held the pincers and it sank down like the sand in an hourglassthen drew itself together and sank still and became nothing it seemed to me but the armed dwarf stooped down and took it into his hand and brought it to me saying everything that is great i can make like this pyramid and give into mens hands to destroy and i saw that he had a little pyramid in his hand with as many courses in it as the large one and built like that only so small and because it glowed still i was afraid to touch it but pthah said touch itfor i have bound the fire within it so that it cannot burn so i touched it and took it into my own hand and it was cold only red like a ruby and pthah laughed and became like a beetle again and buried himself in the sand fiercely throwing it back over his shoulders and it seemed to me as if he would draw me down with him into the sand and i started back and woke holding the little pyramid so fast in my hand that it hurt me  egypt holding what in your hand  l the little pyramid  egypt neiths pyramid  l neiths i believe though not built for asychis i know only that it is a little rosy transparent pyramid built of more courses of bricks than i can count it being made so small you dont believe me of course egyptian infidel but there it is giving crystal of rose fluor       confused examination by crowded audience over each      others shoulders and under each others arms      disappointment begins to manifest itself  sibyl not quite knowing why she and others are disappointed but you showed us this the other day  l yes but you would not look at it the other day  sibyl but was all that fine dream only about this  l what finer thing could a dream be about than this it is small if you will but when you begin to think of things rightly the ideas of smallness and largeness pass away the making of this pyramid was in reality just as wonderful as the dream i have been telling you and just as incomprehensible it was not i suppose as swift but quite as grand things are done as swiftly when neith makes crystals of snow it needs a great deal more marshalling of the atoms by her flaming arrows than it does to make crystals like this one and that is done in a moment  egypt but how you do puzzle us why do you say neith does it you dont mean that she is a real spirit do you  l what i mean is of little consequence what the egyptians meant who called her neithor homer who called her athenaor solomon who called her by a word which the greeks render as sophia you must judge for yourselves but her testimony is always the same and all nations have received it i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth and my delights were with the sons of men  mary but is not that only a personification  l if it be what will you gain by unpersonifying it or what right have you to do so cannot you accept the image given you in its life and listen like children to the words which chiefly belong to you as children i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me       they are all quiet for a minute or two questions begin to      appear in their eyes  i cannot talk to you any more today take that rosecrystal away with you and think  footnotes  146 note i  147 note iii  148 note ii  149 note iii     lecture iii  the crystal life       a very dull lecture wilfully brought upon themselves by      the elder children some of the young ones have however      managed to get in by mistake scene the schoolroom   l so i am to stand up here merely to be asked questions today miss mary am i  mary yes and you must answer them plainly without telling us any more stories you are quite spoiling the children the poor little things heads are turning round like kaleidoscopes and they dont know in the least what you mean nor do we old ones either for that matter today you must really tell us nothing but facts  l i am sworn but you wont like it a bit  mary now first of all what do you mean by bricksare the smallest particles of minerals all of some accurate shape like bricks  l i do not know miss mary i do not even know if anybody knows the smallest atoms which are visibly and practically put together to make large crystals may better be described as limited in fixed directions than as of fixed forms but i can tell you nothing clear about ultimate atoms you will find the idea of little bricks or perhaps of little spheres available for all the uses you will have to put it to  mary well its very provoking one seems always to be stopped just when one is coming to the very thing one wants to know  l no mary for we should not wish to know anything but what is easily and assuredly knowable theres no end to it if i could show you or myself a group of ultimate atoms quite clearly in this magnifying glass we should both be presently vexed because we could not break them in two pieces and see their insides  mary well then next what do you mean by the flying of the bricks what is it the atoms do that is like flying  l when they are dissolved or uncrystallised they are really separated from each other like a swarm of gnats in the air or like a shoal of fish in the seagenerally at about equal distances in currents of solutions or at different depths of them one part may be more full of the dissolved atoms than another but on the whole you may think of them as equidistant like the spots in the print of your gown if they are separated by force of heat only the substance is said to be melted if they are separated by any other substance as particles of sugar by water they are said to be dissolved note this distinction carefully all of you  dora i will be very particular when next you tell me there isnt sugar enough in your tea i will say it is not yet dissolved sir  l i tell you what shall be dissolved miss dora and thats the present parliament if the members get too saucy       dora folds her hands and casts down her eyes  l proceeds in state now miss mary you know already i believe that nearly everything will melt under a sufficient heat like wax limestone melts under pressure sand melts granite melts the lava of a volcano is a mixed mass of many kinds of rocks melted and any melted substance nearly always if not always crystallises as it cools the more slowly the more perfectly water melts at what we call the freezing but might just as wisely though not as conveniently call the melting point and radiates as it cools into the most beautiful of all known crystals glass melts at a greater heat and will crystallise if you let it cool slowly enough in stars much like snow gold needs more heat to melt it but crystallises also exquisitely as i will presently show you arsenic and sulphur crystallise from their vapours now in any of these cases either of melted dissolved or vaporous bodies the particles are usually separated from each other either by heat or by an intermediate substance and in crystallising they are both brought nearer to each other and packed so as to fit as closely as possible the essential part of the business being not the bringing together but the packing who packed your trunk for you last holidays isabel  isabel lily does always  l and how much can you allow for lilys good packing in guessing what will go into the trunk  isabel oh i bring twice as much as the trunk holds lily always gets everything in  lily ah but isey if you only knew what a time it takes and since youve had those great hard buttons on your frocks i cant do anything with them buttons wont go anywhere you know  l yes lily it would be well if she only knew what a time it takes and i wish any of us knew what a time crystallisation takes for that is consummately fine packing the particles of the rock are thrown down just as isabel brings her thingsin a heap and innumerable lilies not of the valley but of the rock come to pack them but it takes such a time  however the bestout and out the bestway of understanding the thing is to crystallise yourselves  the audience ourselves  l yes not merely as you did the other day carelessly on the schoolroom forms but carefully and finely out in the playground you can play at crystallisation there as much as you please  kathleen and jessie oh howhow  l first you must put yourselves together as close as you can in the middle of the grass and form for first practice any figure you like  jessie any dancing figure do you mean  l no i mean a square or a cross or a diamond any figure you like standing close together you had better outline it first on the turf with sticks or pebbles so as to see that it is rightly drawn then get into it and enlarge or diminish it at one side till you are all quite in it and no empty space left  dora crinoline and all  l the crinoline may stand eventually for rough crystalline surface unless you pin it in and then you may make a polished crystal of yourselves  lily oh well pin it inwell pin it in  l then when you are all in the figure let every one note her place and who is next her on each side and let the outsiders count how many places they stand from the corners  kathleen yes yesand then  l then you must scatter all over the playgroundright over it from side to side and end to end and put yourselves all at equal distances from each other everywhere you neednt mind doing it very accurately but so as to be nearly equidistant not less than about three yards apart from each other on every side  jessie we can easily cut pieces of string of equal length to hold and then  l then at a given signal let everybody walk at the same rate towards the outlined figure in the middle you had better sing as you walk that will keep you in good time and as you close in towards it let each take her place and the next comers fit themselves in beside the first ones till you are all in the figure again  kathleen oh how we shall run against each other what fun it will be  l no no miss katie i cant allow any running against each other the atoms never do that whatever human creatures do you must all know your places and find your way to them without jostling  lily but how ever shall we do that  isabel mustnt the ones in the middle be the nearest and the outside ones farther offwhen we go away to scatter i mean  l yes you must be very careful to keep your order you will soon find out how to do it it is only like soldiers forming square except that each must stand still in her place as she reaches it and the others come round her and you will have much more complicated figures afterwards to form than squares  isabel ill put a stone at my place then i shall know it  l you might each nail a bit of paper to the turf at your place with your name upon it but it would be of no use for if you dont know your places you will make a fine piece of business of it while you are looking for your names and isabel if with a little head and eyes and a brain all of them very good and serviceable of their kind as such things go you think you cannot know your place without a stone at it after examining it wellhow do you think each atom knows its place when it never was there before and theres no stone at it  isabel but does every atom know its place  l how else could it get there  mary are they not attracted to their places  l cover a piece of paper with spots at equal intervals and then imagine any kind of attraction you choose or any law of attraction to exist between the spots and try how on that permitted supposition you can attract them into the figure of a maltese cross in the middle of the paper  mary having tried it yes i see that i cannotone would need all kinds of attractions in different ways at different places but you do not mean that the atoms are alive  l what is it to be alive  dora there now youre going to be provoking i know  l i do not see why it should be provoking to be asked what it is to be alive do you think you dont know whether you are alive or not       isabel skips to the end of the room and back  l yes isabel thats all very fine and you and i may call that being alive but a modern philosopher calls it being in a mode of motion it requires a certain quantity of heat to take you to the sideboard and exactly the same quantity to bring you back again thats all  isabel no it isnt and besides im not hot  l i am sometimes at the way they talk however you know isabel you might have been a particle of a mineral and yet have been carried round the room or anywhere else by chemical forces in the liveliest way  isabel yes but i wasnt carried i carried myself  l the fact is mousie the difficulty is not so much to say what makes a thing alive as what makes it a self as soon as you are shut off from the rest of the universe into a self you begin to be alive  violet indignant oh surelysurely that cannot be so is not all the life of the soul in communion not separation  l there can be no communion where there is no distinction but we shall be in an abyss of metaphysics presently if we dont look out and besides we must not be too grand today for the younger children well be grand some day by ourselves if we must the younger children are not pleased and prepare to remonstrate but knowing by experience that all conversations in which the word communion occurs are unintelligible think better of it meantime for broad answer about the atoms i do not think we should use the word life of any energy which does not belong to a given form a seed or an egg or a young animal are properly called alive with respect to the force belonging to those forms which consistently develops that form and no other but the force which crystallises a mineral appears to be chiefly external and it does not produce an entirely determinate and individual form limited in size but only an aggregation in which some limiting laws must be observed  mary but i do not see much difference that way between a crystal and a tree  l add then that the mode of the energy in a living thing implies a continual change in its elements and a period for its end so you may define life by its attached negative death and still more by its attached positive birth but i wont be plagued any more about this just now if you choose to think the crystals alive do and welcome rocks have always been called living in their native place  mary theres one question more then ive done  l only one  mary only one  l but if it is answered wont it turn into two  mary no i think it will remain single and be comfortable  l let me hear it  mary you know we are to crystallise ourselves out of the whole playground now what playground have the minerals where are they scattered before they are crystallised and where are the crystals generally made  l that sounds to me more like three questions than one mary if it is only one it is a wide one  mary i did not say anything about the width of it  l well i must keep it within the best compass i can when rocks either dry from a moist state or cool from a heated state they necessarily alter in bulk and cracks or open spaces form in them in all directions these cracks must be filled up with solid matter or the rock would eventually become a ruinous heap so sometimes by water sometimes by vapour sometimes nobody knows how crystallisable matter is brought from somewhere and fastens itself in these open spaces so as to bind the rock together again with crystal cement a vast quantity of hollows are formed in lavas by bubbles of gas just as the holes are left in bread well baked in process of time these cavities are generally filled with various crystals  mary but where does the crystallising substance come from  l sometimes out of the rock itself sometimes from below or above through the veins the entire substance of the contracting rock may be filled with liquid pressed into it so as to fill every poreor with mineral vapouror it may be so charged at one place and empty at another theres no end to the may bes but all that you need fancy for our present purpose is that hollows in the rocks like the caves in derbyshire are traversed by liquids or vapour containing certain elements in a more or less free or separate state which crystallise on the cave walls  sibyl there nowmary has had all her questions answered its my turn to have mine  l ah theres a conspiracy among you i see i might have guessed as much  dora im sure you ask us questions enough how can you have the heart when you dislike so to be asked them yourself  l my dear child if people do not answer questions it does not matter how many they are asked because theyve no trouble with them now when i ask you questions i never expect to be answered but when you ask me you always do and its not fair  dora very well we shall understand next time  sibyl no but seriously we all want to ask one thing more quite dreadfully  l and i dont want to be asked it quite dreadfully but youll have your own way of course  sibyl we none of us understand about the lower pthah it was not merely yesterday but in all we have read about him in wilkinson or in any book we cannot understand what the egyptians put their god into that ugly little deformed shape for  l well im glad its that sort of question because i can answer anything i like to that  egypt anything you like will do quite well for us we shall be pleased with the answer if you are  l i am not so sure of that most gracious queen for i must begin by the statement that queens seem to have disliked all sorts of work in those days as much as some queens dislike sewing today  egypt now its too bad and just when i was trying to say the civillest thing i could  l but egypt why did you tell me you disliked sewing so  egypt did not i show you how the thread cuts my fingers and i always get cramp somehow in my neck if i sew long  l well i suppose the egyptian queens thought every body got cramp in their neck if they sewed long and that thread always cut peoples fingers at all events every kind of manual labour was despised both by them and the greeks and while they owned the real good and fruit of it they yet held it a degradation to all who practised it also knowing the laws of life thoroughly they perceived that the special practice necessary to bring any manual art to perfection strengthened the body distortedly one energy or member gaining at the expense of the rest they especially dreaded and despised any kind of work that had to be done near fire yet feeling what they owed to it in metalwork as the basis of all other work they expressed this mixed reverence and scorn in the varied types of the lame heph√¶stus and the lower pthah  sibyl but what did you mean by making him say everything great i can make small and everything small great  l i had my own separate meaning in that we have seen in modern times the power of the lower pthah developed in a separate way which no greek nor egyptian could have conceived it is the character of pure and eyeless manual labour to conceive everything as subjected to it and in reality to disgrace and diminish all that is so subjected aggrandising itself and the thought of itself at the expense of all noble things i heard an orator and a good one too at the working mens college the other day make a great point in a description of our railroads saying with grandly conducted emphasis they have made man greater and the world less his working audience were mightily pleased they thought it so very fine a thing to be made bigger themselves and all the rest of the world less i should have enjoyed asking them but it would have been a pitythey were so pleased how much less they would like to have the world madeand whether at present those of them really felt the biggest men who lived in the least houses  sibyl but then why did you make pthah say that he could make weak things strong and small things great  l my dear he is a boaster and selfassertor by nature but it is so far true for instance we used to have a fair in our neighbourhooda very fine fair we thought it you never saw such an one but if you look at the engraving of turners st catherines hill you will see what it was like there were curious booths carried on poles and peepshows and music with plenty of drums and cymbals and much barleysugar and gingerbread and the like and in the alleys of this fair the london populace would enjoy themselves after their fashion very thoroughly well the little pthah set to work upon it one day he made the wooden poles into iron ones and put them across like his own crooked legs so that you always fall over them if you dont look where you are going and he turned all the canvas into panes of glass and put it up on his iron crosspoles and made all the little booths into one great booth and people said it was very fine and a new style of architecture and mr dickens said nothing was ever like it in fairyland which was very true and then the little pthah set to work to put fine fairings in it and he painted the nineveh bulls afresh with the blackest eyes he could paint because he had none himself and he got the angels down from lincoln choir and gilded their wings like his gingerbread of old times and he sent for everything else he could think of and put it in his booth there are the casts of niobe and her children and the chimpanzee and the wooden caffres and newzealanders and the shakespeare house and le grand blondin and le petit blondin and handel and mozart and no end of shops and buns and beer and all the littlepthahworshippers say never was anything so sublime  sibyl now do you mean to say you never go to these crystal palace concerts theyre as good as good can be  l i dont go to the thundering things with a million of bad voices in them when i want a song i get julia mannering and lucy bertram and counsellor pleydell to sing we be three poor mariners to me then ive no headache next morning but i do go to the smaller concerts when i can for they are very good as you say sibyl and i always get a reserved seat somewhere near the orchestra where i am sure i can see the kettledrummer drum  sibyl now do be serious for one minute  l i am seriousnever was more so you know one cant see the modulation of violinists fingers but one can see the vibration of the drummers hand and its lovely  sibyl but fancy going to a concert not to hear but to see  l yes it is very absurd the quite right thing i believe is to go there to talk i confess however that in most music when very well done the doing of it is to me the chiefly interesting part of the business im always thinking how good it would be for the fat supercilious people who care so little for their halfcrowns worth to be set to try and do a halfcrowns worth of anything like it  mary but surely that crystal palace is a great good and help to the people of london  l the fresh air of the norwood hills is or was my dear but they are spoiling that with smoke as fast as they can and the palace as they call it is a better place for them by much than the old fair and it is always there instead of for three days only and it shuts up at proper hours of night and good use may be made of the things in it if you know how but as for its teaching the people it will teach them nothing but the lowest of the lower pthahs worknothing but hammer and tongs i saw a wonderful piece of his doing in the place only the other day some unhappy metalworkeri am not sure if it was not a metalworking firmhad taken three years to make a golden eagle  sibyl of real gold  l no of bronze or copper or some of their foul patent metalit is no matter what i meant a model of our chief british eagle every feather was made separately and every filament of every feather separately and so joined on and all the quills modelled of the right length and right section and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together you know children i dont think much of my own drawing but take my proud word for once that when i go to the zoological gardens and happen to have a bit of chalk in my pocket and the gray harpy will sit without screwing his head round for thirty secondsi can do a better thing of him in that time than the three years work of this industrious firm for during the thirty seconds the eagle is my objectnot myself and during the three years the firms object in every fibre of bronze it made was itself and not the eagle that is the true meaning of the little pthahs having no eyeshe can see only himself the egyptian beetle was not quite the full type of him our northern ground beetle is a truer one it is beautiful to see it at work gathering its treasures such as they are into little round balls and pushing them home with the strong wrong end of ithead downmost all the waylike a modern political economist with his ball of capital declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues but away with you children now for im getting cross  dora im going downstairs i shall take care at any rate that there are no little pthahs in the kitchen cupboards     lecture iv  the crystal orders       a working lecture in the large schoolroom with      experimental interludes the great bell has rung      unexpectedly   kathleen entering disconsolate though first at the summons oh dear oh dear what a day was ever anything so provoking just when we wanted to crystallise ourselvesand im sure its going to rain all day long  l so am i kate the sky has quite an irish way with it but i dont see why irish girls should also look so dismal fancy that you dont want to crystallise yourselves you didnt the day before yesterday and you were not unhappy when it rained then  florrie ah but we do want today and the rains so tiresome  l that is to say children that because you are all the richer by the expectation of playing at a new game you choose to make yourselves unhappier than when you had nothing to look forward to but the old ones  isabel but then to have to waitwaitwait and before weve tried itand perhaps it will rain tomorrow too  l it may also rain the day after tomorrow we can make ourselves uncomfortable to any extent with perhapses isabel you may stick perhapses into your little minds like pins till you are as uncomfortable as the lilliputians made gulliver with their arrows when he would not lie quiet  isabel but what are we to do today  l to be quiet for one thing like gulliver when he saw there was nothing better to be done and to practise patience i can tell you children that requires nearly as much practising as music and we are continually losing our lessons when the master comes now today heres a nice little adagio lesson for us if we play it properly  isabel but i dont like that sort of lesson i cant play it properly  l can you play a mozart sonata yet isabel the more need to practise all ones life is a music if one touches the notes rightly and in time but there must be no hurry  kathleen im sure theres no music in stopping in on a rainy day  l theres no music in a rest katie that i know of but theres the making of music in it and people are always missing that part of the lifemelody and scrambling on without countingnot that its easy to count but nothing on which so much depends ever is easy people are always talking of perseverance and courage and fortitude but patience is the finest and worthiest part of fortitudeand the rarest too i know twenty persevering girls for one patient one but it is only that twentyfirst who can do her work out and out or enjoy it for patience lies at the root of all pleasures as well as of all powers hope herself ceases to be happiness when impatience companions her       isabel and lily sit down on the floor and fold their      hands the others follow their example  good children but thats not quite the way of it neither folded hands are not necessarily resigned ones the patience who really smiles at grief usually stands or walks or even runs she seldom sits though she may sometimes have to do it for many a day poor thing by monuments or like chaucers with fac√´ pale upon a hill of sand but we are not reduced to that today suppose we use this calamitous forenoon to choose the shapes we are to crystallise into we know nothing about them yet       the pictures of resignation rise from the floor not in      the patientest manner general applause  mary with one or two others the very thing we wanted to ask you about  lily we looked at the books about crystals but they are so dreadful  l well lily we must go through a little dreadfulness thats a fact no road to any good knowledge is wholly among the lilies and the grass there is rough climbing to be done always but the crystalbooks are a little too dreadful most of them i admit and we shall have to be content with very little of their help you know as you cannot stand on each others heads you can only make yourselves into the sections of crystalsthe figures they show when they are cut through and we will choose some that will be quite easy you shall make diamonds of yourselves  isabel oh no no we wont be diamonds please  l yes you shall isabel they are very pretty things if the jewellers and the kings and queens would only let them alone you shall make diamonds of yourselves and rubies of yourselves and emeralds and irish diamonds two of thosewith lily in the middle of one which will be very orderly of course and kathleen in the middle of the other for which we will hope the bestand you shall make derbyshire spar of yourselves and iceland spar and gold and silver andquicksilver theres enough of in you without any making  mary now you know the children will be getting quite wild we must really get pencils and paper and begin properly  l wait a minute miss mary i think as weve the school room clear today ill try to give you some notion of the three great orders or ranks of crystals into which all the others seem more or less to fall we shall only want one figure a day in the playground and that can be drawn in a minute but the general ideas had better be fastened first i must show you a great many minerals so let me have three tables wheeled into the three windows that we may keep our specimens separatewe will keep the three orders of crystals on separate tables       first interlude of pushing and pulling and spreading of      baize covers violet not particularly minding what she is      about gets herself jammed into a corner and bid to stand      out of the way on which she devotes herself to      meditation  violet after interval of meditation how strange it is that everything seems to divide into threes  l everything doesnt divide into threes ivy wont though shamrock will and daisies wont though lilies will  violet but all the nicest things seem to divide into threes  l violets wont  violet no i should think not indeed but i mean the great things  l ive always heard the globe had four quarters  isabel well but you know you said it hadnt any quarters at all so maynt it really be divided into three  l if it were divided into no more than three on the outside of it isabel it would be a fine world to live in and if it were divided into three in the inside of it it would soon be no world to live in at all  dora we shall never get to the crystals at this rate aside to mary he will get off into political economy before we know where we are aloud but the crystals are divided into three then  l no but there are three general notions by which we may best get hold of them then between these notions there are other notions  lily alarmed a great many and shall we have to learn them all  l more than a great manya quite infinite many so you cannot learn them all  lily greatly relieved then may we only learn the three  l certainly unless when you have got those three notions you want to have some more notionswhich would not surprise me but well try for the three first katie you broke your coral necklace this morning  kathleen oh who told you it was in jumping im so sorry  l im very glad can you fetch me the beads of it  kathleen ive lost some here are the rest in my pocket if i can only get them out  l you mean to get them out some day i suppose so try now i want them       kathleen empties her pocket on the floor the beads      disperse the school disperses also second      interludehunting piece  l after waiting patiently for a quarter of an hour to isabel who comes up from under the table with her hair all about her ears and the last findable beads in her hand mice are useful little things sometimes now mousie i want all those beads crystallised how many ways are there of putting them in order  isabel well first one would string them i suppose  l yes thats the first way you cannot string ultimate atoms but you can put them in a row and then they fasten themselves together somehow into a long rod or needle we will call these needlecrystals what would be the next way  isabel i suppose as we are to get together in the playground when it stops raining in different shapes  l yes put the beads together then in the simplest form you can to begin with put them into a square and pack them close  isabel after careful endeavour i cant get them closer  l that will do now you may see beforehand that if you try to throw yourselves into square in this confused way you will never know your places so you had better consider every square as made of rods put side by side take four beads of equal size first isabel put them into a little square that you may consider as made up of two rods of two beads each then you can make a square a size larger out of three rods of three then the next square may be a size larger how many rods lily  lily four rods of four beads each i suppose  l yes and then five rods of five and so on but now look here make another square of four beads again you see they leave a little opening in the centre  isabel pushing two opposite ones closer together now they dont  l no but now it isnt a square and by pushing the two together you have pushed the two others farther apart  isabel and yet somehow they all seem closer than they were  l yes for before each of them only touched two of the others but now each of the two in the middle touches the other three take away one of the outsiders isabel now you have three in a trianglethe smallest triangle you can make out of the beads now put a rod of three beads on at one side so you have a triangle of six beads but just the shape of the first one next a rod of four on the side of that and you have a triangle of ten beads then a rod of five on the side of that and you have a triangle of fifteen thus you have a square with five beads on the side and a triangle with five beads on the side equalsided therefore like the square so however few or many you may be you may soon learn how to crystallise quickly into these two figures which are the foundation of form in the commonest and therefore actually the most important as well as in the rarest and therefore by our esteem the most important minerals of the world look at this in my hand  violet why it is leafgold  l yes but beaten by no mans hammer or rather not beaten at all but woven besides feel the weight of it there is gold enough there to gild the walls and ceiling if it were beaten thin  violet how beautiful and it glitters like a leaf covered with frost  l you only think it so beautiful because you know it is gold it is not prettier in reality than a bit of brass for it is transylvanian gold and they say there is a foolish gnome in the mines there who is always wanting to live in the moon and so alloys all the gold with a little silver i dont know how that may be but the silver always is in the gold and if he does it its very provoking of him for no gold is woven so fine anywhere else  mary who has been looking through her magnifying glass but this is not woven this is all made of little triangles  l say patched then if you must be so particular but if you fancy all those triangles small as they are and many of them are infinitely small made up again of rods and those of grains as we built our great triangle of the beads what word will you take for the manufacture  may theres no wordit is beyond words  l yes and that would matter little were it not beyond thoughts too but at all events this yellow leaf of dead gold shed not from the ruined woodlands but the ruined rocks will help you to remember the second kind of crystals leafcrystals or foliated crystals though i show you the form in gold first only to make a strong impression on you for gold is not generally or characteristically crystallised in leaves the real type of foliated crystals is this thing mica which if you once feel well and break well you will always know again and you will often have occasion to know it for you will find it everywhere nearly in hill countries  kathleen if we break it well may we break it  l to powder if you like       surrenders plate of brown mica to public investigation      third interlude it sustains severely philosophical      treatment at all hands  florrie to whom the last fragments have descended always leaves and leaves and nothing but leaves or white dust  l that dust itself is nothing but finer leaves       shows them to florrie through magnifying glass  isabel peeping over florries shoulder but then this bit under the glass looks like that bit out of the glass if we could break this bit under the glass what would it be like  l it would be all leaves still  isabel and then if we broke those again  l all less leaves still  isabel impatient and if we broke them again and again and again and again and again  l well i suppose you would come to a limit if you could only see it notice that the little flakes already differ somewhat from the large ones because i can bend them up and down and they stay bent while the large flake though it bent easily a little way sprang back when you let it go and broke when you tried to bend it far and a large mass would not bend at all  mary would that leaf gold separate into finer leaves in the same way  l no and therefore as i told you it is not a characteristic specimen of a foliated crystallisation the little triangles are portions of solid crystals and so they are in this which looks like a black mica but you see it is made up of triangles like the gold and stands almost accurately as an intermediate link in crystals between mica and gold yet this is the commonest as gold the rarest of metals  mary is it iron i never saw iron so bright  l it is rust of iron finely crystallised from its resemblance to mica it is often called micaceous iron  kathleen may we break this too  l no for i could not easily get such another crystal besides it would not break like the mica it is much harder but take the glass again and look at the fineness of the jagged edges of the triangles where they lap over each other the gold has the same but you see them better here terrace above terrace countless and in successive angles like superb fortified bastions  may but all foliated crystals are not made of triangles  l far from it mica is occasionally so but usually of hexagons and here is a foliated crystal made of squares which will show you that the leaves of the rockland have their summer green as well as their autumnal gold  florrie oh oh oh jumps for joy  l did you never see a bit of green leaf before florrie  florrie yes but never so bright as that and not in a stone  l if you will look at the leaves of the trees in sunshine after a shower you will find they are much brighter than that and surely they are none the worse for being on stalks instead of in stones  florrie yes but then there are so many of them one never looks i suppose  l now you have it florrie  violet sighing there are so many beautiful things we never see  l you need not sigh for that violet but i will tell you what we should all sigh forthat there are so many ugly things we never see  violet but we dont want to see ugly things  l you had better say we dont want to suffer them you ought to be glad in thinking how much more beauty god has made than human eyes can ever see but not glad in thinking how much more evil man has made than his own soul can ever conceive much more than his hands can ever heal  violet i dont understandhow is that like the leaves  l the same law holds in our neglect of multiplied pain as in our neglect of multiplied beauty florrie jumps for joy at sight of half an inch of a green leaf in a brown stone and takes more notice of it than of all the green in the wood and you or i or any of us would be unhappy if any single human creature beside us were in sharp pain but we can read at breakfast day after day of men being killed and of women and children dying of hunger faster than the leaves strew the brooks in vallombrosaand then go out to play croquet as if nothing had happened  may but we do not see the people being killed or dying  l you did not see your brother when you got the telegram the other day saying he was ill may but you cried for him and played no croquet but we cannot talk of these things now and what is more you must let me talk straight on for a little while and ask no questions till ive done for we branch exfoliate i should say mineralogically always into something elsethough thats my fault more than yours but i must go straight on now you have got a distinct notion i hope of leafcrystals and you see the sort of look they have you can easily remember that folium is latin for a leaf and that the separate flakes of mica or any other such stones are called folia but because mica is the most characteristic of these stones other things that are like it in structure are called micas thus we have uranmica which is the green leaf i showed you and coppermica which is another like it made chiefly of copper and this foliated iron is called micaceous iron you have then these two great orders needlecrystals made probably of grains in rows and leafcrystals made probably of needles interwoven now lastly there are crystals of a third order in heaps or knots or masses which may be made either of leaves laid one upon another or of needles bound like roman fasces and mica itself when it is well crystallised puts itself into such masses as if to show us how others are made here is a brown sixsided crystal quite as beautifully chiselled at the sides as any castle tower but you see it is entirely built of folia of mica one laid above another which break away the moment i touch the edge with my knife now here is another hexagonal tower of just the same size and colour which i want you to compare with the mica carefully but as i cannot wait for you to do it just now i must tell you quickly what main differences to look for first you will feel it is far heavier than the mica then though its surface looks quite micaceous in the folia of it when you try them with the knife you will find you cannot break them away  kathleen may i try  l yes you mistrusting katie heres my strong knife for you experimental pause kathleen doing her best youll have that knife shutting on your finger presently kate and i dont know a girl who would like less to have her hand tied up for a week  kathleen who also does not like to be beatengiving up the knife despondently what can the nasty hard thing be  l it is nothing but indurated clay kate very hard set certainly yet not so hard as it might be if it were thoroughly well crystallised you would see none of those micaceous fractures and the stone would be quite red and clear all through  kathleen oh cannot you show us one  l egypt can if you ask her she has a beautiful one in the clasp of her favourite bracelet  kathleen why thats a ruby  l well so is that thing youve been scratching at  kathleen my goodness       takes up the stone again very delicately and drops it      general consternation  l never mind katie you might drop it from the top of the house and do it no harm but though you really are a very good girl and as goodnatured as anybody can possibly be remember you have your faults like other people and if i were you the next time i wanted to assert anything energetically i would assert it by my badness not my goodness  kathleen ah now its too bad of you  l well then ill invoke on occasion my toobadness but you may as well pick up the ruby now you have dropped it and look carefully at the beautiful hexagonal lines which gleam on its surface and here is a pretty white sapphire essentially the same stone as the ruby in which you will see the same lovely structure like the threads of the finest white cobweb i do not know what is the exact method of a rubys construction but you see by these lines what fine construction there is even in this hardest of stones after the diamond which usually appears as a massive lump or knot there is therefore no real mineralogical distinction between needle crystals and knotted crystals but practically crystallised masses throw themselves into one of the three groups we have been examining today and appear either as needles as folia or as knots when they are in needles or fibres they make the stones or rocks formed out of them fibrous when they are in folia they make them foliated when they are in knots or grains granular fibrous rocks are comparatively rare in mass but fibrous minerals are innumerable and it is often a question which really no one but a young lady could possibly settle whether one should call the fibres composing them threads or needles here is amianthus for instance which is quite as fine and soft as any cotton thread you ever sewed with and here is sulphide of bismuth with sharper points and brighter lustre than your finest needles have and fastened in white webs of quartz more delicate than your finest lace and here is sulphide of antimony which looks like mere purple wool but it is all of purple needle crystals and here is red oxide of copper you must not breathe on it as you look or you may blow some of the films of it off the stone which is simply a woven tissue of scarlet silk however these finer thread forms are comparatively rare while the bolder and needlelike crystals occur constantly so that i believe needlecrystal is the best word the grand one is acicular crystal but sibyl will tell you it is all the same only less easily understood and therefore more scientific then the leafcrystals as i said form an immense mass of foliated rocks and the granular crystals which are of many kinds form essentially granular or granitic and porphyritic rocks and it is always a point of more interest to me and i think will ultimately be to you to consider the causes which force a given mineral to take any one of these three general forms than what the peculiar geometrical limitations are belonging to its own crystals150 it is more interesting to me for instance to try and find out why the red oxide of copper usually crystallising in cubes or octahedrons makes itself exquisitely out of its cubes into this red silk in one particular cornish mine than what are the absolutely necessary angles of the octahedron which is its common form at all events that mathematical part of crystallography is quite beyond girls strength but these questions of the various tempers and manners of crystals are not only comprehensible by you but full of the most curious teaching for you for in the fulfilment to the best of their power of their adopted form under given circumstances there are conditions entirely resembling those of human virtue and indeed expressible under no term so proper as that of the virtue or courage of crystalswhich if you are not afraid of the crystals making you ashamed of yourselves we will try to get some notion of tomorrow but it will be a byelecture and more about yourselves than the minerals dont come unless you like  mary im sure the crystals will make us ashamed of ourselves but well come for all that  l meantime look well and quietly over these needle or thread crystals and those on the other two tables with magnifying glasses and see what thoughts will come into your little heads about them for the best thoughts are generally those which come without being forced one does not know how and so i hope you will get through your wet day patiently  footnotes  150 note iv     lecture v  crystal virtues       a quiet talk in the afternoon by the sunniest window of      the drawingroom present florrie isabel may lucilla      kathleen dora mary and some others who have saved time      for the byelecture   l so you have really come like good girls to be made ashamed of yourselves  dora very meekly no we neednt be made so we always are  l well i believe thats truer than most pretty speeches but you know you saucy girl some people have more reason to be so than others are you sure everybody is as well as you  the general voice yes yes everybody  l what florrie ashamed of herself       florrie hides behind the curtain  l and isabel       isabel hides under the table  l and may       may runs into the corner behind the piano  l and lucilla       lucilla hides her face in her hands  l dear dear but this will never do i shall have to tell you of the faults of the crystals instead of virtues to put you in heart again  may coming out of her corner oh have the crystals faults like us  l certainly may their best virtues are shown in fighting their faults and some have a great many faults and some are very naughty crystals indeed  florrie from behind her curtain as naughty as me  isabel peeping from under the table cloth or me  l well i dont know they never forget their syntax children when once theyve been taught it but i think some of them are on the whole worse than any of you not that its amiable of you to look so radiant all in a minute on that account  dora oh but its so much more comfortable       everybody seems to recover their spirits eclipse of      florrie and isabel terminates  l what kindly creatures girls are after all to their neighbours failings i think you may be ashamed of yourselves indeed now children i can tell you you shall hear of the highest crystalline merits that i can think of today and i wish there were more of them but crystals have a limited though a stern code of morals and their essential virtues are but twothe first is to be pure and the second to be well shaped  mary pure does that mean cleartransparent  l no unless in the case of a transparent substance you cannot have a transparent crystal of gold but you may have a perfectly pure one  isabel but you said it was the shape that made things be crystals therefore oughtnt their shape to be their first virtue not their second  l right you troublesome mousie but i call their shape only their second virtue because it depends on time and accident and things which the crystal cannot help if it is cooled too quickly or shaken it must take what shape it can but it seems as if even then it had in itself the power of rejecting impurity if it has crystalline life enough here is a crystal of quartz well enough shaped in its way but it seems to have been languid and sick at heart and some white milky substance has got into it and mixed itself up with it all through it makes the quartz quite yellow if you hold it up to the light and milky blue on the surface here is another broken into a thousand separate facets and out of all traceable shape but as pure as a mountain spring i like this one best  the audience so do iand iand i  mary would a crystallographer  l i think so he would find many more laws curiously exemplified in the irregularly grouped but pure crystal but it is a futile question this of first or second purity is in most cases a prior if not a nobler virtue at all events it is most convenient to think about it first  mary but what ought we to think about it is there much to be thoughti mean much to puzzle one  l i dont know what you call much it is a long time since i met with anything in which there was little theres not much in this perhaps the crystal must be either dirty or cleanand theres an end so it is with ones hands and with ones heartonly you can wash your hands without changing them but not hearts nor crystals on the whole while you are young it will be as well to take care that your hearts dont want much washing for they may perhaps need wringing also when they do       audience doubtful and uncomfortable lucilla at last      takes courage  lucilla oh but surely sir we cannot make our hearts clean  l not easily lucilla so you had better keep them so when they are  lucilla when they are but sir  l well  lucilla sirsurelyare we not told that they are all evil  l wait a little lucilla that is difficult ground you are getting upon and we must keep to our crystals till at least we understand what their good and evil consist in they may help us afterwards to some useful hints about our own i said that their goodness consisted chiefly in purity of substance and perfectness of form but those are rather the effects of their goodness than the goodness itself the inherent virtues of the crystals resulting in these outer conditions might really seem to be best described in the words we should use respecting living creaturesforce of heart and steadiness of purpose there seem to be in some crystals from the beginning an unconquerable purity of vital power and strength of crystal spirit whatever dead substance unacceptant of this energy comes in their way is either rejected or forced to take some beautiful subordinate form the purity of the crystal remains unsullied and every atom of it bright with coherent energy then the second condition is that from the beginning of its whole structure a fine crystal seems to have determined that it will be of a certain size and of a certain shape it persists in this plan and completes it here is a perfect crystal of quartz for you it is of an unusual form and one which it might seem very difficult to builda pyramid with convex sides composed of other minor pyramids but there is not a flaw in its contour throughout not one of its myriads of component sides but is as bright as a jewellers facetted work and far finer if you saw it close the crystal points are as sharp as javelins their edges will cut glass with a touch anything more resolute consummate determinate in form cannot be conceived here on the other hand is a crystal of the same substance in a perfectly simple type of forma plain sixsided prism but from its base to its pointand it is nine inches longit has never for one instant made up its mind what thickness it will have it seems to have begun by making itself as thick as it thought possible with the quantity of material at command still not being as thick as it would like to be it has clumsily glued on more substance at one of its sides then it has thinned itself in a panic of economy then puffed itself out again then starved one side to enlarge another then warped itself quite out of its first line opaque roughsurfaced jagged on the edge distorted in the spine it exhibits a quite human image of decrepitude and dishonour but the worst of all the signs of its decay and helplessness is that halfway up a parasite crystal smaller but just as sickly has rooted itself in the side of the larger one eating out a cavity round its root and then growing backwards or downwards contrary to the direction of the main crystal yet i cannot trace the least difference in purity of substance between the first most noble stone and this ignoble and dissolute one the impurity of the last is in its will or want of will  mary oh if we could but understand the meaning of it all  l we can understand all that is good for us it is just as true for us as for the crystal that the nobleness of life depends on its consistencyclearness of purposequiet and ceaseless energy all doubt and repenting and botching and retouching and wondering what it will be best to do next are vice as well as misery  mary much wondering but must not one repent when one does wrong and hesitate when one cant see ones way  l you have no business at all to do wrong nor to get into any way that you cannot see your intelligence should always be far in advance of your act whenever you do not know what you are about you are sure to be doing wrong  kathleen oh dear but i never know what i am about  l very true katie but it is a great deal to know if you know that and you find that you have done wrong afterwards and perhaps some day you may begin to know or at least think what you are about  isabel but surely people cant do very wrong if they dont know can they i mean they cant be very naughty they can be wrong like kathleen or me when we make mistakes but not wrong in the dreadful way i cant express what i mean but there are two sorts of wrong are there not  l yes isabel but you will find that the great difference is between kind and unkind wrongs not between meant and unmeant wrong very few people really mean to do wrongin a deep sense none they only dont know what they are about cain did not mean to do wrong when he killed abel       isabel draws a deep breath and opens her eyes very      wide  l no isabel and there are countless cains among us now who kill their brothers by the score a day not only for less provocation than cain had but for no provocationand merely for what they can make of their bonesyet do not think they are doing wrong in the least then sometimes you have the business reversed as over in america these last years where you have seen abel resolutely killing cain and not thinking he is doing wrong the great difficulty is always to open peoples eyes to touch their feelings and break their hearts is easy the difficult thing is to break their heads what does it matter as long as they remain stupid whether you change their feelings or not you cannot be always at their elbow to tell them what is right and they may just do as wrong as before or worse and their best intentions merely make the road smooth for themyou know where children for it is not the place itself that is paved with them as people say so often you cant pave the bottomless pit but you may the road to it  may well but if people do as well as they can see how surely that is the right for them isnt it  l no may not a bit of it right is right and wrong is wrong it is only the fool who does wrong and says he did it for the best and if theres one sort of person in the world that the bible speaks harder of than another it is fools their particular and chief way of saying there is no god is this of declaring that whatever their public opinion may be is right and that gods opinion is of no consequence  may but surely nobody can always know what is right  l yes you always can for today and if you do what you see of it today you will see more of it and more clearly tomorrow here for instance you children are at school and have to learn french and arithmetic and music and several other such things that is your right for the present the right for us your teachers is to see that you learn as much as you can without spoiling your dinner your sleep or your play and that what you do learn you learn well you all know when you learn with a will and when you dawdle theres no doubt of conscience about that i suppose  violet no but if one wants to read an amusing book instead of learning ones lesson  l you dont call that a question seriously violet you are then merely deciding whether you will resolutely do wrong or not  mary but in after life how many fearful difficulties may arise however one tries to know or to do what is right  l you are much too sensible a girl mary to have felt that whatever you may have seen a great many of young ladies difficulties arise from their falling in love with a wrong person but they have no business to let themselves fall in love till they know he is the right one  dora how many thousands ought he to have a year  l disdaining reply there are of course certain crises of fortune when one has to take care of oneself and mind shrewdly what one is about there is never any real doubt about the path but you may have to walk very slowly  mary and if one is forced to do a wrong thing by some one who has authority over you  l my dear no one can be forced to do a wrong thing for the guilt is in the will but you may any day be forced to do a fatal thing as you might be forced to take poison the remarkable law of nature in such cases being that it is always unfortunate you who are poisoned and not the person who gives you the dose it is a very strange law but it is a law nature merely sees to the carrying out of the normal operation of arsenic she never troubles herself to ask who gave it you so also you may be starved to death morally as well as physically by other peoples faults you are on the whole very good children sitting here todaydo you think that your goodness comes all by your own contriving or that you are gentle and kind because your dispositions are naturally more angelic than those of the poor girls who are playing with wild eyes on the dustheaps in the alleys of our great towns and who will one day fill their prisonsor better their graves heaven only knows where they and we who have cast them there shall stand at last but the main judgment question will be i suppose for all of us did you keep a good heart through it what you were others may answer forwhat you tried to be you must answer for yourself was the heart pure and truetell us that  and so we come back to your sorrowful question lucilla which i put aside a little ago you would be afraid to answer that your heart was pure and true would not you  lucilla yes indeed sir  l because you have been taught that it is all evilonly evil continually somehow often as people say that they never seem to me to believe it do you really believe it  lucilla yes sir i hope so  l that you have an entirely bad heart  lucilla a little uncomfortable at the substitution of the monosyllable for the dissyllable nevertheless persisting in her orthodoxy yes sir  l florrie i am sure you are tired i never like you to stay when you are tired but you know you must not play with the kitten while were talking  florrie oh but im not tired and im only nursing her shell be asleep in my lap directly  l stop that puts me in mind of something i had to show you about minerals that are like hair i want a hair out of titties tail  florrie quite rude in her surprise even to the point of repeating expressions out of titties tail  l yes a brown one lucilla you can get at the tip of it nicely under florries arm just pull one out for me  lucilla oh but sir it will hurt her so  l never mind she cant scratch you while florrie is holding her now that i think of it you had better pull out two  lucilla but then she may scratch florrie and it will hurt her so sir if you only want brown hairs wouldnt two of mine do  l would you really rather pull out your own than titties  lucilla oh of course if mine will do  l but thats very wicked lucilla  lucilla wicked sir  l yes if your heart was not so bad you would much rather pull all the cats hairs out than one of your own  lucilla oh but sir i didnt mean bad like that  l i believe if the truth were told lucilla you would like to tie a kettle to titties tail and hunt her round the playground  lucilla indeed i should not sir  l thats not true lucilla you know it cannot be  lucilla sir  l certainly it is nothow can you possibly speak any truth out of such a heart as you have it is wholly deceitful  lucilla oh no no i dont mean that way i dont mean that it makes me tell lies quite out  l only that it tells lies within you  lucilla yes  l then outside of it you know what is true and say so and i may trust the outside of your heart but within it is all foul and false is that the way  lucilla i suppose so i dont understand it quite  l there is no occasion for understanding it but do you feel it are you sure that your heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked  lucilla much relieved by finding herself among phrases with which she is acquainted yes sir im sure of that  l pensively im sorry for it lucilla  lucilla so am i indeed  l what are you sorry with lucilla  lucilla sorry with sir  l yes i mean where do you feel sorry in your feet  lucilla laughing a little no sir of course  l in your shoulders then  lucilla no sir  l you are sure of that because i fear sorrow in the shoulders would not be worth much  lucilla i suppose i feel it in my heart if i really am sorry  l if you really are do you mean to say that you are sure you are utterly wicked and yet do not care  lucilla no indeed i have cried about it often  l well then you are sorry in your heart  lucilla yes when the sorrow is worth anything  l even if it be not it cannot be anywhere else but there it is not the crystalline lens of your eyes which is sorry when you cry  lucilla no sir of course  l then have you two hearts one of which is wicked and the other grieved or is one side of it sorry for the other side  lucilla weary of crossexamination and a little vexed indeed sir you know i cant understand it but you know how it is writtenanother law in my members warring against the law of my mind  l yes lucilla i know how it is written but i do not see that it will help us to know that if we neither understand what is written nor feel it and you will not get nearer to the meaning of one verse if as soon as you are puzzled by it you escape to another introducing three new wordslaw members and mind not one of which you at present know the meaning of and respecting which you probably never will be much wiser since men like montesquieu and locke have spent great part of their lives in endeavouring to explain two of them  lucilla oh please sir ask somebody else  l if i thought anyone else could answer better than you lucilla i would but suppose i try instead myself to explain your feelings to you  lucilla oh yes please do  l mind i say your feelings not your belief for i cannot undertake to explain anybodys beliefs still i must try a little first to explain the belief also because i want to draw it to some issue as far as i understand what you say or any one else taught as you have been taught says on this matteryou think that there is an external goodness a whitedsepulchre kind of goodness which appears beautiful outwardly but is within full of uncleanness a deep secret guilt of which we ourselves are not sensible and which can only be seen by the maker of us all approving murmurs from audience  l is it not so with the body as well as the soul       looked notes of interrogation  l a skull for instance is not a beautiful thing       grave faces signifying certainly not and what      next  l and if you all could see in each other with clear eyes whatever god sees beneath those fair faces of yours you would not like it       murmured nos  l nor would it be good for you       silence  l the probability being that what god does not allow you to see he does not wish you to see nor even to think of       silence prolonged  l it would not at all be good for you for instance whenever you were washing your faces and braiding your hair to be thinking of the shapes of the jawbones and of the cartilage of the nose and of the jagged sutures of the scalp       resolutely whispered nos  l still less to see through a clear glass the daily processes of nourishment and decay       no  l still less if instead of merely inferior and preparatory conditions of structure as in the skeletonor inferior offices of structure as in operations of life and deaththere were actual disease in the body ghastly and dreadful you would try to cure it but having taken such measures as were necessary you would not think the cure likely to be promoted by perpetually watching the wounds or thinking of them on the contrary you would be thankful for every moment of forgetfulness as in daily health you must be thankful that your maker has veiled whatever is fearful in your frame under a sweet and manifest beauty and has made it your duty and your only safety to rejoice in that both in yourself and in othersnot indeed concealing or refusing to believe in sickness if it come but never dwelling on it  now your wisdom and duty touching soulsickness are just the same ascertain clearly what is wrong with you and so far as you know any means of mending it take those means and have done when you are examining yourself never call yourself merely a sinner that is very cheap abuse and utterly useless you may even get to like it and be proud of it but call yourself a liar a coward a sluggard a glutton or an evileyed jealous wretch if you indeed find yourself to be in any wise any of these take steady means to check yourself in whatever fault you have ascertained and justly accused yourself of and as soon as you are in active way of mending you will be no more inclined to moan over an undefined corruption for the rest you will find it less easy to uproot faults than to choke them by gaining virtues do not think of your faults still less of others faults in every person who comes near you look for what is good and strong honour that rejoice in it and as you can try to imitate it and your faults will drop off like dead leaves when their time comes if on looking back your whole life should seem rugged as a palm tree stem still never mind so long as it has been growing and has its grand green shade of leaves and weight of honied fruit at top and even if you cannot find much good in yourself at last think that it does not much matter to the universe either what you were or are think how many people are noble if you cannot be and rejoice in their nobleness an immense quantity of modern confession of sin even when honest is merely a sickly egotism which will rather gloat over its own evil than lose the centralisation of its interest in itself  mary but then if we ought to forget ourselves so much how did the old greek proverb know thyself come to be so highly esteemed  l my dear it is the proverb of proverbs apollos proverb and the sunsbut do you think you can know yourself by looking into yourself never you can know what you are only by looking out of yourself measure your own powers with those of others compare your own interests with those of others try to understand what you appear to them as well as what they appear to you and judge of yourselves in all things relatively and subordinately not positively starting always with a wholesome conviction of the probability that there is nothing particular about you for instance some of you perhaps think you can write poetry dwell on your own feelings and doingsand you will soon think yourselves tenth muses but forget your own feelings and try instead to understand a line or two of chaucer or dante and you will soon begin to feel yourselves very foolish girlswhich is much like the fact  so something which befalls you may seem a great misfortuneyou meditate over its effects on you personally and begin to think that it is a chastisement or a warning or a this or that or the other of profound significance and that all the angels in heaven have left their business for a little while that they may watch its effects on your mind but give up this egotistic indulgence of your fancy examine a little what misfortunes greater a thousandfold are happening every second to twenty times worthier persons and your selfconsciousness will change into pity and humility and you will know yourself so far as to understand that there hath nothing taken thee but what is common to man  now lucilla these are the practical conclusions which any person of sense would arrive at supposing the texts which relate to the inner evil of the heart were as many and as prominent as they are often supposed to be by careless readers but the way in which common people read their bibles is just like the way that the old monks thought hedgehogs ate grapes they rolled themselves it was said over and over where the grapes lay on the ground what fruit stuck to their spines they carried off and ate so your hedgehoggy readers roll themselves over and over their bibles and declare that whatever sticks to their own spines is scripture and that nothing else is but you can only get the skins of the texts that way if you want their juice you must press them in cluster now the clustered texts about the human heart insist as a body not on any inherent corruption in all hearts but on the terrific distinction between the bad and the good ones a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil they on the rock are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart the wicked have bent their bow that they may privily shoot at him that is upright in heart and so on they are countless to the same effect and for all of us the question is not at all to ascertain how much or how little corruption there is in human nature but to ascertain whether out of all the mass of that nature we are of the sheep or the goat breed whether we are people of upright heart being shot at or people of crooked heart shooting and of all the texts bearing on the subject this which is a quite simple and practical order is the one you have chiefly to hold in mind keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life  lucilla and yet how inconsistent the texts seem  l nonsense lucilla do you think the universe is bound to look consistent to a girl of fifteen look up at your own room windowyou can just see it from where you sit im glad that it is left open as it ought to be in so fine a day but do you see what a black spot it looks in the sunlighted wall  lucilla yes it looks as black as ink  l yet you know it is a very bright room when you are inside of it quite as bright as there is any occasion for it to be that its little lady may see to keep it tidy well it is very probable also that if you could look into your heart from the suns point of view it might appear a very black hole indeed nay the sun may sometimes think good to tell you that it looks so to him but he will come into it and make it very cheerful for you for all that if you dont put the shutters up and the one question for you remember is not dark or light but tidy or untidy look well to your sweeping and garnishing and be sure it is only the banished spirit or some of the seven wickeder ones at his back who will still whisper to you that it is all black     lecture vi  crystal quarrels       full conclave in schoolroom there has been a game at      crystallisation in the morning of which various account has      to be rendered in particular everybody has to explain why      they were always where they were not intended to be   l having received and considered the report you have got on pretty well children but you know these were easy figures you have been trying wait till i have drawn you out the plans of some crystals of snow  mary i dont think those will be the most difficultthey are so beautiful that we shall remember our places better and then they are all regular and in stars it is those twisty oblique ones we are afraid of  l read carlyles account of the battle of leuthen and learn freidrichs oblique order you will get it done for once i think provided you can march as a pair of compasses would but remember when you can construct the most difficult single figures you have only learned half the gamenothing so much as the half indeed as the crystals themselves play it  mary indeed what else is there  l it is seldom that any mineral crystallises alone usually two or three under quite different crystalline laws form together they do this absolutely without flaw or fault when they are in fine temper and observe what this signifies it signifies that the two or more minerals of different natures agree somehow between themselves how much space each will wantagree which of them shall give away to the other at their junction or in what measure each will accommodate itself to the others shape and then each takes its permitted shape and allotted share of space yielding or being yielded to as it builds till each crystal has fitted itself perfectly and gracefully to its differentlynatured neighbour so that in order to practise this in even the simplest terms you must divide into two parties wearing different colours each must choose a different figure to construct and you must form one of these figures through the other both going on at the same time  mary i think we may perhaps manage it but i cannot at all understand how the crystals do it seems to imply so much preconcerting of plan and so much giving way to each other as if they really were living  l yes it implies both concurrence and compromise regulating all wilfulness of design and more curious still the crystals do not always give way to each other they show exactly the same varieties of temper that human creatures might sometimes they yield the required place with perfect grace and courtesy forming fantastic but exquisitely finished groups and sometimes they will not yield at all but fight furiously for their places losing all shape and honour and even their own likeness in the contest  mary but is not that wholly wonderful how is it that one never sees it spoken of in books  l the scientific men are all busy in determining the constant laws under which the struggle takes place these indefinite humours of the elements are of no interest to them and unscientific people rarely give themselves the trouble of thinking at all when they look at stones not that it is of much use to think the more one thinks the more one is puzzled  mary surely it is more wonderful than anything in botany  l everything has its own wonders but given the nature of the plant it is easier to understand what a flower will do and why it does it than given anything we as yet know of stonenature to understand what a crystal will do and why it does it you at once admit a kind of volition and choice in the flower but we are not accustomed to attribute anything of the kind to the crystal yet there is in reality more likeness to some conditions of human feeling among stones than among plants there is a far greater difference between kindlytempered and illtempered crystals of the same mineral than between any two specimens of the same flower and the friendships and wars of crystals depend more definitely and curiously on their varieties of disposition than any associations of flowers here for instance is a good garnet living with good mica one rich red and the other silver white the mica leaves exactly room enough for the garnet to crystallise comfortably in and the garnet lives happily in its little white house fitted to it like a pholas in its cell but here are wicked garnets living with wicked mica see what ruin they make of each other you cannot tell which is which the garnets look like dull red stains on the crumbling stone by the way i never could understand if st gothard is a real saint why he cant keep his garnets in better order these are all under his care but i suppose there are too many of them for him to look after the streets of airolo are paved with them  may paved with garnets  l with micaslate and garnets i broke this bit out of a paving stone now garnets and mica are natural friends and generally fond of each other but you see how they quarrel when they are ill brought up so it is always good crystals are friendly with almost all other good crystals however little they chance to see of each other or however opposite their habits may be while wicked crystals quarrel with one another though they may be exactly alike in habits and see each other continually and of course the wicked crystals quarrel with the good ones  isabel then do the good ones get angry  l no never they attend to their own work and life and live it as well as they can though they are always the sufferers here for instance is a rockcrystal of the purest race and finest temper who was born unhappily for him in a bad neighbourhood near beaufort in savoy and he has had to fight with vile calcareous mud all his life see here when he was but a child it came down on him and nearly buried him a weaker crystal would have died in despair but he only gathered himself together like hercules against the serpents and threw a layer of crystal over the clay conquered itimprisoned itand lived on then when he was a little older came more clay and poured itself upon him here at the side and he has laid crystal over that and lived on in his purity then the clay came on at his angles and tried to cover them and round them away but upon that he threw out buttresscrystals at his angles all as true to his own central line as chapels round a cathedral apse and clustered them round the clay and conquered it again at last the clay came on at his summit and tried to blunt his summit but he could not endure that for an instant and left his flanks all rough but pure and fought the clay at his crest and built crest over crest and peak over peak till the clay surrendered at last and here is his summit smooth and pure terminating a pyramid of alternate clay and crystal half a foot high  lily oh how nice of him what a dear brave crystal but i cant bear to see his flanks all broken and the clay within them  l yes it was an evil chance for him the being born to such contention there are some enemies so base that even to hold them captive is a kind of dishonour but look here has been quite a different kind of struggle the adverse power has been more orderly and has fought the pure crystal in ranks as firm as its own this is not mere rage and impediment of crowded evil here is a disciplined hostility army against army  lily oh but this is much more beautiful  l yes for both the elements have true virtue in them it is a pity they are at war but they war grandly  mary but is this the same clay as in the other crystal  l i used the word clay for shortness in both the enemy is really limestone but in the first disordered and mixed with true clay while here it is nearly pure and crystallises into its own primitive form the oblique sixsided one which you know and out of these it makes regiments and then squares of the regiments and so charges the rock crystal literally in square against column  isabel please please let me see and what does the rock crystal do  l the rock crystal seems able to do nothing the calcite cuts it through at every charge look hereand here the loveliest crystal in the whole group is hewn fairly into two pieces  isabel oh dear but is the calcite harder than the crystal then  l no softer very much softer  mary but then how can it possibly cut the crystal  l it did not really cut it though it passes through it the two were formed together as i told you but no one knows how still it is strange that this hard quartz has in all cases a goodnatured way with it of yielding to everything else all sorts of soft things make nests for themselves in it and it never makes a nest for itself in anything it has all the rough outside work and every sort of cowardly and weak mineral can shelter itself within it look these are hexagonal plates of mica if they were outside of this crystal they would break like burnt paper but they are inside of itnothing can hurt themthe crystal has taken them into its very heart keeping all their delicate edges as sharp as if they were under water instead of bathed in rock here is a piece of branched silver you can bend it with a touch of your finger but the stamp of its every fibre is on the rock in which it lay as if the quartz had been as soft as wool  lily oh the good good quartz but does it never get inside of anything  l as it is a little irish girl who asks i may perhaps answer without being laughed at that it gets inside of itself sometimes but i dont remember seeing quartz make a nest for itself in anything else  isabel please there was something i heard you talking about last term with miss mary i was at my lessons but i heard something about nests and i thought it was birds nests and i couldnt help listening and then i remember it was about nests of quartz in granite i remember because i was so disappointed  l yes mousie you remember quite rightly but i cant tell you about those nests today nor perhaps tomorrow but theres no contradiction between my saying then and now i will show you that there is not some day will you trust me meanwhile  isabel wont i  l well then look lastly at this piece of courtesy in quartz it is on a small scale but wonderfully pretty here is nobly born quartz living with a green mineral called epidote and they are immense friends now you see a comparatively large and strong quartzcrystal and a very weak and slender little one of epidote have begun to grow close by each other and sloping unluckily towards each other so that they at last meet they cannot go on growing together the quartz crystal is five times as thick and more than twenty times as strong151 as the epidote but he stops at once just in the very crowning moment of his life when he is building his own summit he lets the pale little film of epidote grow right past him stopping his own summit for it and he never himself grows any more  lily after some silence of wonder but is the quartz never wicked then  l yes but the wickedest quartz seems goodnatured compared to other things here are two very characteristic examples one is good quartz living with good pearlspar and the other wicked quartz living with wicked pearlspar in both the quartz yields to the soft carbonate of iron but in the first place the iron takes only what it needs of room and is inserted into the planes of the rock crystal with such precision that you must break it away before you can tell whether it really penetrates the quartz or not while the crystals of iron are perfectly formed and have a lovely bloom on their surface besides but here when the two minerals quarrel the unhappy quartz has all its surfaces jagged and torn to pieces and there is not a single iron crystal whose shape you can completely trace but the quartz has the worst of it in both instances  violet might we look at that piece of broken quartz again with the weak little film across it it seems such a strange lovely thing like the selfsacrifice of a human being  l the selfsacrifice of a human being is not a lovely thing violet it is often a necessary and noble thing but no form nor degree of suicide can be ever lovely  violet but selfsacrifice is not suicide  l what is it then  violet giving up ones self for another  l well and what do you mean by giving up ones self  violet giving up ones tastes ones feelings ones time ones happiness and so on to make others happy  l i hope you will never marry anybody violet who expects you to make him happy in that way  violet hesitating in what way  l by giving up your tastes and sacrificing your feelings and happiness  violet no no i dont mean that but you know for other people one must  l for people who dont love you and whom you know nothing about be it so but how does this giving up differ from suicide then  violet why giving up ones pleasures is not killing ones self  l giving up wrong pleasure is not neither is it selfsacrifice but selfculture but giving up right pleasure is if you surrender the pleasure of walking your foot will wither you may as well cut it off if you surrender the pleasure of seeing your eyes will soon be unable to bear the light you may as well pluck them out and to maim yourself is partly to kill yourself do but go on maiming and you will soon slay  violet but why do you make me think of that verse then about the foot and the eye  l you are indeed commanded to cut off and to pluck out if foot or eye offend you but why should they offend you  violet i dont know i never quite understood that  l yet it is a sharp order one needing to be well understood if it is to be well obeyed when helen sprained her ancle the other day you saw how strongly it had to be bandaged that is to say prevented from all work to recover it but the bandage was not lovely  violet no indeed  l and if her foot had been crushed or diseased or snakebitten instead of sprained it might have been needful to cut it off but the amputation would not have been lovely  violet no  l well if eye and foot are dead already and betray youif the light that is in you be darkness and your feet run into mischief or are taken in the snareit is indeed time to pluck out and cut off i think but so crippled you can never be what you might have been otherwise you enter into life at best halt or maimed and the sacrifice is not beautiful though necessary  violet after a pause but when one sacrifices ones self for others  l why not rather others for you  violet oh but i couldnt bear that  l then why should they bear it  dora bursting in indignant and thermopyl√¶ and protesilaus and marcus curtius and arnold de winkelried and iphigenia and jephthahs daughter  l sustaining the indignation unmoved and the samaritan womans son  dora which samaritan womans  l read 2 kings vi 29  dora obeys how horrid as if we meant anything like that  l you dont seem to me to know in the least what you do mean children what practical difference is there between that and what you are talking about the samaritan children had no voice of their own in the business it is true but neither had iphigenia the greek girl was certainly neither boiled nor eaten but that only makes a difference in the dramatic effect not in the principle  dora biting her lip well then tell us what we ought to mean as if you didnt teach it all to us and mean it yourself at this moment more than we do if you wouldnt be tiresome  l i mean and have always meant simply this dorathat the will of god respecting us is that we shall live by each others happiness and life not by each others misery or death i made you read that verse which so shocked you just now because the relations of parent and child are typical of all beautiful human help a child may have to die for its parents but the purpose of heaven is that it shall rather live for themthat not by its sacrifice but by its strength its joy its force of being it shall be to them renewal of strength and as the arrow in the hand of the giant so it is in all other right relations men help each other by their joy not by their sorrow they are not intended to slay themselves for each other but to strengthen themselves for each other and among the many apparently beautiful things which turn through mistaken use to utter evil i am not sure but that the thoughtlessly meek and selfsacrificing spirit of good men must be named as one of the fatallest they have so often been taught that there is a virtue in mere suffering as such and foolishly to hope that good may be brought by heaven out of all on which heaven itself has set the stamp of evil that we may avoid itthat they accept pain and defeat as if these were their appointed portion never understanding that their defeat is not the less to be mourned because it is more fatal to their enemies than to them the one thing that a good man has to do and to see done is justice he is neither to slay himself nor others causelessly so far from denying himself since he is pleased by good he is to do his utmost to get his pleasure accomplished and i only wish there were strength fidelity and sense enough among the good englishmen of this day to render it possible for them to band together in a vowed brotherhood to enforce by strength of heart and hand the doing of human justice among all who came within their sphere and finally for your own teaching observe although there may be need for much selfsacrifice and selfdenial in the correction of faults of character the moment the character is formed the selfdenial ceases nothing is really well done which it costs you pain to do  violet but surely sir you are always pleased with us when we try to please others and not ourselves  l my dear child in the daily course and discipline of right life we must continually and reciprocally submit and surrender in all kind and courteous and affectionate ways and these submissions and ministries to each other of which you all know none better the practice and the preciousness are as good for the yielder as the receiver they strengthen and perfect as much as they soften and refine but the real sacrifice of all our strength or life or happiness to others though it may be needed and though all brave creatures hold their lives in their hand to be given when such need comes as frankly as a soldier gives his life in battle is yet always a mournful and momentary necessity not the fulfilment of the continuous law of being selfsacrifice which is sought after and triumphed in is usually foolish and calamitous in its issue and by the sentimental proclamation and pursuit of it good people have not only made most of their own lives useless but the whole framework of their religion so hollow that at this moment while the english nation with its lips pretends to teach every man to love his neighbour as himself with its hands and feet it clutches and tramples like a wild beast and practically lives every soul of it that can on other peoples labour briefly the constant duty of every man to his fellows is to ascertain his own powers and special gifts and to strengthen them for the help of others do you think titian would have helped the world better by denying himself and not painting or casella by denying himself and not singing the real virtue is to be ready to sing the moment people ask us as he was even in purgatory the very word virtue means not conduct but strength vital energy in the heart were not you reading about that group of words beginning with vvital virtuous vigorous and so onin max muller the other day sibyl cant you tell the others about it  sibyl no i cant will you tell us please  l not now it is too late come to me some idle time tomorrow and ill tell you about it if alls well but the gist of it is children that you should at least know two latin words recollect that mors means death and delaying and vita means life and growing and try always not to mortify yourselves but to vivify yourselves  violet but then are we not to mortify our earthly affections and surely we are to sacrifice ourselves at least in gods service if not in mans  l really violet we are getting too serious ive given you enough ethics for one talk i think do let us have a little play lily what were you so busy about at the anthill in the wood this morning  lily oh it was the ants who were busy not i i was only trying to help them a little  l and they wouldnt be helped i suppose  lily no indeed i cant think why ants are always so tiresome when one tries to help them they were carrying bits of stick as fast as they could through a piece of grass and pulling and pushing so hard and tumbling over and overit made one quite pity them so i took some of the bits of stick and carried them forward a little where i thought they wanted to put them but instead of being pleased they left them directly and ran about looking quite angry and frightened and at last ever so many of them got up my sleeves and bit me all over and i had to come away  l i couldnt think what you were about i saw your french grammar lying on the grass behind you and thought perhaps you had gone to ask the ants to hear you a french verb  isabel ah but you didnt though  l why not isabel i knew well enough lily couldnt learn that verb by herself  isabel no but the ants couldnt help her  l are you sure the ants could not have helped you lily  lily thinking i ought to have learned something from them perhaps  l but none of them left their sticks to help you through the irregular verb  lily no indeed laughing with some others  l what are you laughing at children i cannot see why the ants should not have left their tasks to help lily in herssince here is violet thinking she ought to leave her tasks to help god in his perhaps however she takes lilys more modest view and thinks only that he ought to learn something from her       tears in violets eyes  dora scarlet its too badits a shamepoor violet  l my dear children theres no reason why one should be so red and the other so pale merely because you are made for a moment to feel the absurdity of a phrase which you have been taught to use in common with half the religious world there is but one way in which man can ever help godthat is by letting god help him and there is no way in which his name is more guiltily taken in vain than by calling the abandonment of our own work the performance of his  god is a kind father he sets us all in the places where he wishes us to be employed and that employment is truly our fathers business he chooses work for every creature which will be delightful to them if they do it simply and humbly he gives us always strength enough and sense enough for what he wants us to do if we either tire ourselves or puzzle ourselves it is our own fault and we may always be sure whatever we are doing that we cannot be pleasing him if we are not happy ourselves now away with you children and be as happy as you can and when you cannot at least dont plume yourselves upon pouting  footnotes  151 quartz is not much harder than epidote the

would she not     for all the mud in egypt  you were complaining the other day of having to go out a great deal oftener than you liked  egypt yes so i was but then it isnt to dance theres no room to dance itspausing to consider what it is for  l it is only to be seen i suppose well theres no harm in that girls ought to like to be seen  dora her eyes flashing now you dont mean that and youre too provoking and we wont dance again for a month  l it will answer every purpose of revenge dora if you only banish me to the library and dance by yourselves but i dont think jessie and lily will agree to that you like me to see you dancing dont you lily  lily yes certainlywhen we do it rightly  l and besides miss dora if young ladies really do not want to be seen they should take care not to let their eyes flash when they dislike what people say and more than that it is all nonsense from beginning to end about not wanting to be seen i dont know any more tiresome flower in the borders than your especially modest snowdrop which one always has to stoop down and take all sorts of tiresome trouble with and nearly break its poor little head off before you can see it and then half of it is not worth seeing girls should be like daisies nice and white with an edge of red if you look close making the ground bright wherever they are knowing simply and quietly that they do it and are meant to do it and that it would be very wrong if they didnt do it not want to be seen indeed how long were you in doing your back hair this afternoon jessie       jessie not immediately answering dora comes to her      assistance  dora not above threequarters of an hour i think jess  jessie putting her finger up now dorothy you neednt talk you know  l i know she neednt jessie i shall ask her about those dark plaits presently dora looks round to see if there is any way open for retreat but never mind it was worth the time whatever it was and nobody will ever mistake that golden wreath for a chignon but if you dont want it to be seen you had better wear a cap  jessie ah now are you really going to do nothing but play and we all have been thinking and thinking all day and hoping you would tell us things and now  l and now i am telling you things and true things and things good for you and you wont believe me you might as well have let me go to sleep at once as i wanted to       endeavours again to make himself comfortable  isabel oh no no you shant go to sleep you naughtykathleen come here  l knowing what he has to expect if kathleen comes get away isabel youre too heavy sitting up what have i been saying  dora i do believe he has been asleep all the time you never heard anything like the things youve been saying  l perhaps not if you have heard them and anything like them it is all i want  egypt yes but we dont understand and you know we dont and we want to  l what did i say first  dora that the first virtue of girls was wanting to go to balls  l i said nothing of the kind  jessie always wanting to dance you said  l yes and thats true their first virtue is to be intensely happyso happy that they dont know what to do with themselves for happinessand dance instead of walking dont you recollect louisa      no fountain from a rocky cave       eer tripped with foot so free     she seemed as happy as a wave       that dances on the sea  a girl is always like that when everythings right with her  violet but surely one must be sad sometimes  l yes violet and dull sometimes and stupid sometimes and cross sometimes what must be must but it is always either our own fault or somebody elses the last and worst thing that can be said of a nation is that it has made its young girls sad and weary  may but i am sure i have heard a great many good people speak against dancing  l yes may but it does not follow they were wise as well as good i suppose they think jeremiah liked better to have to write lamentations for his people than to have to write that promise for them which everybody seems to hurry past that they may get on quickly to the verse about rachel weeping for her children though the verse they pass is the counterblessing to that one then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance and both young men and old together and i will turn their mourning into joy       the children get very serious but look at each other as      if pleased  mary they understand now but do you know what you said next  l yes i was not more than half asleep i said their second virtue was dressing  mary well what did you mean by that  l what do you mean by dressing  mary wearing fine clothes  l ah theres the mistake i mean wearing plain ones  mary yes i daresay but thats not what girls understand by dressing you know  l i cant help that if they understand by dressing buying dresses perhaps they also understand by drawing buying pictures but when i hear them say they can draw i understand that they can make a drawing and when i hear them say they can dress i understand that they can make a dress andwhich is quite as difficultwear one  dora im not sure about the making for the wearing we can all wear themout before anybody expects it  egypt aside to l piteously indeed i have mended that torn flounce quite neatly look if i havent  l aside to egypt all right dont be afraid aloud to dora yes doubtless but you know that is only a slow way of undressing  dora then we are all to learn dressmaking are we  l yes and always to dress yourselves beautifullynot finely unless on occasion but then very finely and beautifully too also you are to dress as many other people as you can and to teach them how to dress if they dont know and to consider every illdressed woman or child whom you see anywhere as a personal disgrace and to get at them somehow until everybody is as beautifully dressed as birds       silence the children drawing their breaths hard as if      they had come from under a shower bath  l seeing objections begin to express themselves in the eyes now you neednt say you cant for you can and its what you were meant to do always and to dress your houses and your gardens too and to do very little else i believe except singing and dancing as we said of course andone thing more  dora our third and last virtue i suppose  l yes on violets system of triplicities  dora well we are prepared for anything now what is it  l cooking  dora cardinal indeed if only beatrice were here with her seven handmaids that she might see what a fine eighth we had found for her  mary and the interpretation what does cooking mean  l it means the knowledge of medea and of circe and of calypso and of helen and of rebekah and of the queen of sheba it means the knowledge of all herbs and fruits and balms and spices and of all that is healing and sweet in fields and groves and savoury in meats it means carefulness and inventiveness and watchfulness and willingness and readiness of appliance it means the economy of your greatgrandmothers and the science of modern chemists it means much tasting and no wasting it means english thoroughness and french art and arabian hospitality and it means in fine that you are to be perfectly and always ladiesloafgivers and as you are to see imperatively that everybody has something pretty to put onso you are to see yet more imperatively that everybody has something nice to eat       another pause and long drawn breath  dora slowly recovering herself to egypt we had better have let him go to sleep i think after all  l you had better let the younger ones go to sleep now for i havent half done  isabel panicstruck oh please please just one quarter of an hour  l no isabel i cannot say what ive got to say in a quarter of an hour and it is too hard for you besidesyou would be lying awake and trying to make it out half the night that will never do  isabel oh please  l it would please me exceedingly mousie but there are times when we must both be displeased mores the pity lily may stay for half an hour if she likes  lily i cant because isey never goes to sleep if she is waiting for me to come  isabel oh yes lily ill go to sleep tonight i will indeed  lily yes its very likely isey with those fine round eyes to l youll tell me something of what youve been saying tomorrow wont you  l no i wont lily you must choose its only in miss edgeworths novels that one can do right and have ones cake and sugar afterwards as well not that i consider the dilemma tonight so grave       lily sighing takes isabels hand  yes lily dear it will be better in the outcome of it so than if you were to hear all the talks that ever were talked and all the stories that ever were told good night       the door leading to the condemned cells of the dormitory      closes on lily isabel florrie and other diminutive and      submissive victims  jessie after a pause why i thought you were so fond of miss edgeworth  l so i am and so you ought all to be i can read her over and over again without ever tiring theres no one whose every page is so full and so delightful no one who brings you into the company of pleasanter or wiser people no one who tells you more truly how to do right and it is very nice in the midst of a wild world to have the very ideal of poetical justice done always to ones handto have everybody found out who tells lies and everybody decorated with a red riband who doesnt and to see the good laura who gave away her half sovereign receiving a grand ovation from an entire dinner party disturbed for the purpose and poor dear little rosamond who chooses purple jars instead of new shoes left at last without either her shoes or her bottle but it isnt life and in the way children might easily understand it it isnt morals  jessie how do you mean we might understand it  l you might think miss edgeworth meant that the right was to be done mainly because one was always rewarded for doing it it is an injustice to her to say that her heroines always do right simply for its own sake as they should and her examples of conduct and motive are wholly admirable but her representation of events is false and misleading her good characters never are brought into the deadly trial of goodnessthe doing right and suffering for it quite finally and that is life as god arranges it taking up ones cross does not at all mean having ovations at dinner parties and being put over everybody elses head  dora but what does it mean then that is just what we couldnt understand when you were telling us about not sacrificing ourselves yesterday  l my dear it means simply that you are to go the road which you see to be the straight one carrying whatever you find is given you to carry as well and stoutly as you can without making faces or calling people to come and look at you above all you are neither to load nor unload yourself nor cut your cross to your own liking some people think it would be better for them to have it large and many that they could carry it much faster if it were small and even those who like it largest are usually very particular about its being ornamental and made of the best ebony but all that you have really to do is to keep your back as straight as you can and not think about what is upon itabove all not to boast of what is upon it the real and essential meaning of virtue is in that straightness of back yes you may laugh children but it is you know i was to tell about the words that began with v sibyl what does virtue mean literally  sibyl does it mean courage  l yes but a particular kind of courage it means courage of the nerve vital courage that first syllable of it if you look in max m√ºller you will find really means nerve and from it come vis and vir and virgin through vireo and the connected word virgaa rodthe green rod or springing bough of a tree being the type of perfect human strength both in the use of it in the mosaic story when it becomes a serpent or strikes the rock or when aarons bears its almonds and in the metaphorical expressions the rod out of the stem of jesse and the man whose name is the branch and so on and the essential idea of real virtue is that of a vital human strength which instinctively constantly and without motive does what is right you must train men to this by habit as you would the branch of a tree and give them instincts and manners or morals of purity justice kindness and courage once rightly trained they act as they should irrespectively of all motive of fear or of reward it is the blackest sign of putrescence in a national religion when men speak as if it were the only safeguard of conduct and assume that but for the fear of being burned or for the hope of being rewarded everybody would pass their lives in lying stealing and murdering i think quite one of the notablest historical events of this century perhaps the very notablest was that council of clergymen horrorstruck at the idea of any diminution in our dread of hell at which the last of english clergymen whom one would have expected to see in such a function rose as the devils advocate to tell us how impossible it was we could get on without him  violet after a pause but surely if people werent afraidhesitates again  l they should be afraid of doing wrong and of that only my dear otherwise if they only dont do wrong for fear of being punished they have done wrong in their hearts already  violet well but surely at least one ought to be afraid of displeasing god and ones desire to please him should be ones first motive  l he never would be pleased with us if it were my dear when a father sends his son out into the worldsuppose as an apprenticefancy the boys coming home at night and saying father i could have robbed the till today but i didnt because i thought you wouldnt like it do you think the father would be particularly pleased       violet is silent  he would answer would he not if he were wise and good my boy though you had no father you must not rob tills and nothing is ever done so as really to please our great father unless we would also have done it though we had had no father to know of it  violet after long pause but then what continual threatenings and promises of reward there are  l and how vain both with the jews and with all of us but the fact is that the threat and promise are simply statements of the divine law and of its consequences the fact is truly told youmake what use you may of it and as collateral warning or encouragement or comfort the knowledge of future consequences may often be helpful to us but helpful chiefly to the better state when we can act without reference to them and theres no measuring the poisoned influence of that notion of future reward on the mind of christian europe in the early ages half the monastic system rose out of that acting on the occult pride and ambition of good people as the other half of it came of their follies and misfortunes there is always a considerable quantity of pride to begin with in what is called giving ones self to god as if one had ever belonged to anybody else  dora but surely great good has come out of the monastic systemour booksour sciencesall saved by the monks  l saved from what my dear from the abyss of misery and ruin which that false christianity allowed the whole active world to live in when it had become the principal amusement and the most admired art of christian men to cut one anothers throats and burn one anothers towns of course the few feeble or reasonable persons left who desired quiet safety and kind fellowship got into cloisters and the gentlest thoughtfullest noblest men and women shut themselves up precisely where they could be of least use they are very fine things for us painters nowthe towers and white arches upon the tops of the rocks always in places where it takes a days climbing to get at them but the intense tragicomedy of the thing when one thinks of it is unspeakable all the good people of the world getting themselves hung up out of the way of mischief like bailie nicol jarviepoor little lambs as it were dangling there for the sign of the golden fleece or like socrates in his basket in the clouds i must read you that bit of aristophanes again by the way and believe me children i am no warped witness as far as regards monasteries or if i am it is in their favour i have always had a strong leaning that way and have pensively shivered with augustines at st bernard and happily made hay with franciscans at fesol√© and sat silent with carthusians in their little gardens south of florence and mourned through many a daydream at melrose and bolton but the wonder is always to me not how much but how little the monks have on the whole done with all that leisure and all that goodwill what nonsense monks characteristically wrotewhat little progress they made in the sciences to which they devoted themselves as a dutymedicine especiallyand last and worst what depths of degradation they can sometimes see one another and the population round them sink into without either doubting their system or reforming it  seeing questions rising to lips hold your little tongues children its very late and youll make me forget what ive to say fancy yourselves in pews for five minutes theres one point of possible good in the conventual system which is always attractive to young girls and the idea is a very dangerous onethe notion of a merit or exalting virtue consisting in a habit of meditation on the things above or things of the next world now it is quite true that a person of beautiful mind dwelling on whatever appears to them most desirable and lovely in a possible future will not only pass their time pleasantly but will even acquire at last a vague and wildly gentle charm of manner and feature which will give them an air of peculiar sanctity in the eyes of others whatever real or apparent good there may be in this result i want you to observe children that we have no real authority for the reveries to which it is owing we are told nothing distinctly of the heavenly world except that it will be free from sorrow and pure from sin what is said of pearl gates golden floors and the like is accepted as merely figurative by religious enthusiasts themselves and whatever they pass their time in conceiving whether of the happiness of risen souls of their intercourse or of the appearance and employment of the heavenly powers is entirely the product of their own imagination and as completely and distinctly a work of fiction or romantic invention as any novel of sir walter scotts that the romance is founded on religious theory or doctrinethat no disagreeable or wicked persons are admitted into the storyand that the inventor fervently hopes that some portion of it may hereafter come true does not in the least alter the real nature of the effort or enjoyment  now whatever indulgence may be granted to amiable people for pleasing themselves in this innocent way it is beyond question that to seclude themselves from the rough duties of life merely to write religious romances or as in most cases merely to dream them without taking so much trouble as is implied in writing ought not to be received as an act of heroic virtue but observe even in admitting thus much i have assumed that the fancies are just and beautiful though fictitious now what right have any of us to assume that our own fancies will assuredly be either the one or the other that they delight us and appear lovely to us is no real proof of its not being wasted time to form them and we may surely be led somewhat to distrust our judgment of them by observing what ignoble imaginations have sometimes sufficiently or even enthusiastically occupied the hearts of others the principal source of the spirit of religious contemplation is the east now i have here in my hand a byzantine image of christ which if you will look at it seriously may i think at once and for ever render you cautious in the indulgence of a merely contemplative habit of mind observe it is the fashion to look at such a thing only as a piece of barbarous art that is the smallest part of its interest what i want you to see is the baseness and falseness of a religious state of enthusiasm in which such a work could be dwelt upon with pious pleasure that a figure with two small round black beads for eyes a gilded face deep cut into horrible wrinkles an open gash for a mouth and a distorted skeleton for a body wrapped about to make it fine with striped enamel of blue and goldthat such a figure i say should ever have been thought helpful towards the conception of a redeeming deity may make you i think very doubtful even of the divine approvalmuch more of the divine inspirationof religious reverie in general you feel doubtless that your own idea of christ would be something very different from this but in what does the difference consist not in any more divine authority in your imagination but in the intellectual work of six intervening centuries which simply by artistic discipline has refined this crude conception for you and filled you partly with an innate sensation partly with an acquired knowledge of higher formswhich render this byzantine crucifix as horrible to you as it was pleasing to its maker more is required to excite your fancy but your fancy is of no more authority than his was and a point of national artskill is quite conceivable in which the best we can do now will be as offensive to the religious dreamers of the more highly cultivated time as this byzantine crucifix is to you  mary but surely angelico will always retain his power over everybody  l yes i should think always as the gentle words of a child will but you would be much surprised mary if you thoroughly took the pains to analyse and had the perfect means of analysing that power of angelicoto discover its real sources of course it is natural at first to attribute it to the pure religious fervour by which he was inspired but do you suppose angelico was really the only monk in all the christian world of the middle ages who laboured in art with a sincere religious enthusiasm  mary no certainly not  l anything more frightful more destructive of all religious faith whatever than such a supposition could not be and yet what other monk ever produced such work i have myself examined carefully upwards of two thousand illuminated missals with especial view to the discovery of any evidence of a similar result upon the art from the monkish devotion and utterly in vain  mary but then was not fra angelico a man of entirely separate and exalted genius  l unquestionably and granting him to be that the peculiar phenomenon in his art is to me not its loveliness but its weakness the effect of inspiration had it been real on a man of consummate genius should have been one would have thought to make everything that he did faultless and strong no less than lovely but of all men deserving to be called great fra angelico permits to himself the least pardonable faults and the most palpable follies there is evidently within him a sense of grace and power of invention as great as ghibertiswe are in the habit of attributing those high qualities to his religious enthusiasm but if they were produced by that enthusiasm in him they ought to be produced by the same feelings in others and we see they are not whereas comparing him with contemporary great artists of equal grace and invention one peculiar character remains notable in himwhich logically we ought therefore to attribute to the religious fervourand that distinctive character is the contented indulgence of his own weaknesses and perseverance in his own ignorances  mary but thats dreadful and what is the source of the peculiar charm which we all feel in his work  l there are many sources of it mary united and seeming like one you would never feel that charm but in the work of an entirely good man be sure of that but the goodness is only the recipient and modifying element not the creative one consider carefully what delights you in any original picture of angelicos you will find for one minor thing an exquisite variety and brightness of ornamental work that is not angelicos inspiration it is the final result of the labour and thought of millions of artists of all nations from the earliest egyptian potters downwardsgreeks byzantines hindoos arabs gauls and northmenall joining in the toil and consummating it in florence in that century with such embroidery of robe and inlaying of armour as had never been seen till then nor probably ever will be seen more angelico merely takes his share of this inheritance and applies it in the tenderest way to subjects which are peculiarly acceptant of it but the inspiration if it exist anywhere flashes on the knights shield quite as radiantly as on the monks picture examining farther into the sources of your emotion in the angelico work you will find much of the impression of sanctity dependent on a singular repose and grace of gesture consummating itself in the floating flying and above all in the dancing groups that is not angelicos inspiration it is only a peculiarly tender use of systems of grouping which had been long before developed by giotto memmi and orcagna and the real root of it all is simplywhat do you think children the beautiful dancing of the florentine maidens  dora indignant again now i wonder what next why not say it all depended on herodias daughter at once  l yes it is certainly a great argument against singing that there were once sirens  dora well it may be all very fine and philosophical but shouldnt i just like to read you the end of the second volume of modern painters  l my dear do you think any teacher could be worth your listening to or anybody elses listening to who had learned nothing and altered his mind in nothing from seven and twenty to seven and forty but that second volume is very good for you as far as it goes it is a great advance and a thoroughly straight and swift one to be led as it is the main business of that second volume to lead you from dutch cattle pieces and ruffianpieces to fra angelico and it is right for you also as you grow older to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of what you love else you might come to love both alike or even the weaknesses without the virtues you might end by liking overbeck and cornelius as well as angelico however i have perhaps been leaning a little too much to the merely practical side of things in tonights talk and you are always to remember children that i do not deny though i cannot affirm the spiritual advantages resulting in certain cases from enthusiastic religious reverie and from the other practices of saints and anchorites the evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected much less dispassionately examined but assuredly there is in that direction a probability and more than a probability of dangerous error while there is none whatever in the practice of an active cheerful and benevolent life the hope of attaining a higher religious position which induces us to encounter for its exalted alternative the risk of unhealthy error is often as i said founded more on pride than piety and those who in modest usefulness have accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their father are not i believe the least likely to receive hereafter the command then unmistakable friend go up higher     lecture viii  crystal caprice  formal lecture in schoolroom after some practical examination of minerals   l we have seen enough children though very little of what might be seen if we had more time of mineral structures produced by visible opposition or contest among elements structures of which the variety however great need not surprise us for we quarrel ourselves for many and slight causesmuch more one should think may crystals who can only feel the antagonism not argue about it but there is a yet more singular mimicry of our human ways in the varieties of form which appear owing to no antagonistic force but merely to the variable humour and caprice of the crystals themselves and i have asked you all to come into the schoolroom today because of course this is a part of the crystal mind which must be peculiarly interesting to a feminine audience great symptoms of disapproval on the part of said audience now you need not pretend that it will not interest you why should it not it is true that we men are never capricious but that only makes us the more dull and disagreeable you who are crystalline in brightness as well as in caprice charm infinitely by infinitude of change audible murmurs of worse and worse as if we could be got over that way c the lecturer however observing the expression of the features to be more complacent proceeds and the most curious mimicry if not of your changes of fashion at least of your various modes in healthy periods of national costume takes place among the crystals of different countries with a little experience it is quite possible to say at a glance in what districts certain crystals have been found and although if we had knowledge extended and accurate enough we might of course ascertain the laws and circumstances which have necessarily produced the form peculiar to each locality this would be just as true of the fancies of the human mind if we could know the exact circumstances which affect it we could foretell what now seems to us only caprice of thought as well as what now seems to us only caprice of crystal nay so far as our knowledge reaches it is on the whole easier to find some reason why the peasant girls of berne should wear their caps in the shape of butterflies and the peasant girls of munich theirs in the shape of shells than to say why the rockcrystals of dauphin√© should all have their summits of the shape of lippieces of flageolets while those of st gothard are symmetrical or why the fluor of chamouni is rosecoloured and in octahedrons while the fluor of weardale is green and in cubes still farther removed is the hope at present of accounting for minor differences in modes of grouping and construction take for instance the caprices of this single mineral quartzvariations upon a single theme it has many forms but see what it will make out of this one the sixsided prism for shortness sake i shall call the body of the prism its column and the pyramid at the extremities its cap now here first you have a straight column as long and thin as a stalk of asparagus with two little caps at the ends and here you have a short thick column as solid as a haystack with two fat caps at the ends and here you have two caps fastened together and no column at all between them then here is a crystal with its column fat in the middle and tapering to a little cap and here is one stalked like a mushroom with a huge cap put on the top of a slender column then here is a column built wholly out of little caps with a large smooth cap at the top and here is a column built of columns and caps the caps all truncated about half way to their points and in both these last the little crystals are set anyhow and build the large one in a disorderly way but here is a crystal made of columns and truncated caps set in regular terraces all the way up  mary but are not these groups of crystals rather than one crystal  l what do you mean by a group and what by one crystal  dora audibly aside to mary who is brought to pause you know you are never expected to answer mary  l im sure this is easy enough what do you mean by a group of people  mary three or four together or a good many together like the caps in these crystals  l but when a great many persons get together they dont take the shape of one person       mary still at pause  isabel no because they cant but you know the crystals can so why shouldnt they  l well they dont that is to say they dont always nor even often look here isabel  isabel what a nasty ugly thing  l im glad you think it so ugly yet it is made of beautiful crystals they are a little grey and cold in colour but most of them are clear  isabel but theyre in such horrid horrid disorder  l yes all disorder is horrid when it is among things that are naturally orderly some little girls rooms are naturally disorderly i suppose or i dont know how they could live in them if they cry out so when they only see quartz crystals in confusion  isabel oh but how come they to be like that  l you may well ask and yet you will always hear people talking as if they thought order more wonderful than disorder it is wonderfulas we have seen but to me as to you child the supremely wonderful thing is that nature should ever be ruinous or wasteful or deathful i look at this wild piece of crystallisation with endless astonishment  mary where does it come from  l the t√™te noire of chamonix what makes it more strange is that it should be in a vein of fine quartz rock if it were in a mouldering rock it would be natural enough but in the midst of so fine substance here are the crystals tossed in a heap some large myriads small almost as small as dust tumbling over each other like a terrified crowd and glued together by the sides and edges and backs and heads some warped and some pushed out and in and all spoiled and each spoiling the rest  mary and how flat they all are  l yes thats the fashion at the t√™te noire  mary but surely this is ruin not caprice  l i believe it is in great part misfortune and we will examine these crystal troubles in next lecture but if you want to see the gracefullest and happiest caprices of which dust is capable you must go to the hartz not that i ever mean to go there myself for i want to retain the romantic feeling about the name and i have done myself some harm already by seeing the monotonous and heavy form of the brocken from the suburbs of brunswick but whether the mountains be picturesque or not the tricks which the goblins as i am told teach the crystals in them are incomparably pretty they work chiefly on the mind of a docile bluish coloured carbonate of lime which comes out of a grey limestone the goblins take the greatest possible care of its education and see that nothing happens to it to hurt its temper and when it may be supposed to have arrived at the crisis which is to a well brought up mineral what presentation at court is to a young ladyafter which it is expected to set fashionstheres no end to its pretty ways of behaving first it will make itself into pointed darts as fine as hoarfrost here it is changed into a white fur as fine as silk here into little crowns and circlets as bright as silver as if for the gnome princesses to wear here it is in beautiful little plates for them to eat off presently it is in towers which they might be imprisoned in presently in caves and cells where they may make nungnomes of themselves and no gnome ever hear of them more here is some of it in sheaves like corn here some in drifts like snow here some in rays like stars and though these are all of them necessarily shapes that the mineral takes in other places they are all taken here with such a grace that you recognise the high caste and breeding of the crystals wherever you meet them and know at once they are hartzborn  of course such fine things as these are only done by crystals which are perfectly good and goodhumoured and of course also there are illhumoured crystals who torment each other and annoy quieter crystals yet without coming to anything like serious war here for once is some illdisposed quartz tormenting a peaceable octahedron of fluor in mere caprice i looked at it the other night so long and so wonderingly just before putting my candle out that i fell into another strange dream but you dont care about dreams  dora no we didnt yesterday but you know we are made up of caprice so we do today and you must tell it us directly  l well you see neith and her work were still much in my mind and then i had been looking over these hartz things for you and thinking of the sort of grotesque sympathy there seemed to be in them with the beautiful fringe and pinnacle work of northern architecture so when i fell asleep i thought i saw neith and st barbara talking together  dora but what had st barbara to do with it152  l my dear i am quite sure st barbara is the patroness of good architects not st thomas whatever the old builders thought it might be very fine according to the monks notions in st thomas to give all his employers money away to the poor but breaches of contract are bad foundations and i believe it was not he but st barbara who overlooked the work in all the buildings you and i care about however that may be it was certainly she whom i saw in my dream with neith neith was sitting weaving and i thought she looked sad and threw her shuttle slowly and st barbara was standing at her side in a stiff little gown all ins and outs and angles but so bright with embroidery that it dazzled me whenever she moved the train of it was just like a heap of broken jewels it was so stiff and full of corners and so manycoloured and bright her hair fell over her shoulders in long delicate waves from under a little three pinnacled crown like a tower she was asking neith about the laws of architecture in egypt and greece and when neith told her the measures of the pyramids st barbara said she thought they would have been better threecornered and when neith told her the measures of the parthenon st barbara said she thought it ought to have had two transepts but she was pleased when neith told her of the temple of the dew and of the caryan maidens bearing its frieze and then she thought that perhaps neith would like to hear what sort of temples she was building herself in the french valleys and on the crags of the rhine so she began gossiping just as one of you might to an old lady and certainly she talked in the sweetest way in the world to neith and explained to her all about crockets and pinnacles and neith sat looking very grave and always graver as st barbara went on till at last im sorry to say st barbara lost her temper a little  may very grave herself st barbara  l yes may why shouldnt she it was very tiresome of neith to sit looking like that  may but then st barbara was a saint  l whats that may  may a saint a saint isi am sure you know  l if i did it would not make me sure that you knew too may but i dont  violet expressing the incredulity of the audience ohsir  l that is to say i know that people are called saints who are supposed to be better than others but i dont know how much better they must be in order to be saints nor how nearly anybody may be a saint and yet not be quite one nor whether everybody who is called a saint was one nor whether everybody who isnt called a saint isnt one       general silence the audience feeling themselves on the      verge of the infinitiesand a little shockedand much      puzzled by so many questions at once  l besides did you never hear that verse about being called to be saints  may repeats rom i 7  l quite right may well then who are called to be that people in rome only  may everybody i suppose whom god loves  l what little girls as well as other people  may all grownup people i mean  l why not little girls are they wickeder when they are little  may oh i hope not  l why not little girls then       pause  lily because you know we cant be worth anything if were ever so goodi mean if we try to be ever so good and we cant do difficult thingslike saints  l i am afraid my dear that old people are not more able or willing for their difficulties than you children are for yours all i can say is that if ever i see any of you when you are seven or eight and twenty knitting your brows over any work you want to do or to understand as i saw you lily knitting your brows over your slate this morning i should think you very noble women butto come back to my dreamst barbara did lose her temper a little and i was not surprised for you cant think how provoking neith looked sitting there just like a statue of sandstone only going on weaving like a machine and never quickening the cast of her shuttle while st barbara was telling her so eagerly all about the most beautiful things and chattering away as fast as bells ring on christmas eve till she saw that neith didnt care and then st barbara got as red as a rose and stopped just in timeor i think she would really have said something naughty  isabel oh please but didnt neith say anything then  l yes she said quite quietly it may be very pretty my love but it is all nonsense  isabel oh dear oh dear and then  l well then i was a little angry myself and hoped st barbara would be quite angry but she wasnt she bit her lips first and then gave a great sighsuch a wild sweet sighand then she knelt down and hid her face on neiths knees then neith smiled a little and was moved  isabel oh i am so glad  l and she touched st barbaras forehead with a flower of white lotus and st barbara sobbed once or twice and then said if you only could see how beautiful it is and how much it makes people feel what is good and lovely and if you could only hear the children singing in the lady chapels and neith smiledbut still sadlyand said how do you know what i have seen or heard my love do you think all those vaults and towers of yours have been built without me there was not a pillar in your giottos santa maria del fiore which i did not set true by my spearshaft as it rose but this pinnacle and flame work which has set your little heart on fire is all vanity and you will see what it will come to and that soon and none will grieve for it more than i and then every one will disbelieve your pretty symbols and types men must be spoken simply to my dear if you would guide them kindly and long but st barbara answered that indeed she thought every one liked her work and that the people of different towns were as eager about their cathedral towers as about their privileges or their markets and then she asked neith to come and build something with her wall against tower and see whether the people will be as much pleased with your building as with mine but neith answered i will not contend with you my dear i strive not with those who love me and for those who hate me it is not well to strive with me as weaver arachne knows and remember child that nothing is ever done beautifully which is done in rivalship nor nobly which is done in pride  then st barbara hung her head quite down and said she was very sorry she had been so foolish and kissed neith and stood thinking a minute and then her eyes got bright again and she said she would go directly and build a chapel with five windows in it four for the four cardinal virtues and one for humility in the middle bigger than the rest and neith very nearly laughed quite out i thought certainly her beautiful lips lost all their sternness for an instant then she said well love build it but do not put so many colours into your windows as you usually do else no one will be able to see to read inside and when it is built let a poor village priest consecrate it and not an archbishop st barbara started a little i thought and turned as if to say something but changed her mind and gathered up her train and went out and neith bent herself again to her loom in which she was weaving a web of strange dark colours i thought but perhaps it was only after the glittering of st barbaras embroidered train and i tried to make out the figures in neiths web and confused myself among them as one always does in dreams and then the dream changed altogether and i found myself all at once among a crowd of little gothic and egyptian spirits who were quarrelling at least the gothic ones were trying to quarrel for the egyptian ones only sat with their hands on their knees and their aprons sticking out very stiffly and stared and after a while i began to understand what the matter was it seemed that some of the troublesome building imps who meddle and make continually even in the best gothic work had been listening to st barbaras talk with neith and had made up their minds that neith had no workpeople who could build against them they were but dull imps as you may fancy by their thinking that and never had done much except disturbing the great gothic building angels at their work and playing tricks to each other indeed of late they had been living years and years like bats up under the cornices of strasbourg and cologne cathedrals with nothing to do but to make mouths at the people below however they thought they knew everything about tower building and those who had heard what neith said told the rest and they all flew down directly chattering in german like jackdaws to show neiths people what they could do and they had found some of neiths old workpeople somewhere near sais sitting in the sun with their hands on their knees and abused them heartily and neiths people did not mind at first but after a while they seemed to get tired of the noise and one or two rose up slowly and laid hold of their measuring rods and said if st barbaras people liked to build with them tower against pyramid they would show them how to lay stones then the little gothic spirits threw a great many double somersaults for joy and put the tips of their tongues out slily to each other on one side and i heard the egyptians say they must be some new kind of frogthey didnt think there was much building in them however the stiff old workers took their rods as i said and measured out a square space of sand but as soon as the german spirits saw that they declared they wanted exactly that bit of ground to build on themselves then the egyptian builders offered to go farther off and the germans ones said ja wohl but as soon as the egyptians had measured out another square the little germans said they must have some of that too then neiths people laughed and said they might take as much as they liked but they would not move the plan of their pyramid again then the little germans took three pieces and began to build three spires directly one large and two little and when the egyptians saw they had fairly begun they laid their foundation all round of large square stones and began to build so steadily that they had like to have swallowed up the three little german spires so when the gothic spirits saw that they built their spires leaning like the tower of pisa that they might stick out at the side of the pyramid and neiths people stared at them and thought it very clever but very wrong and on they went in their own way and said nothing then the little gothic spirits were terribly provoked because they could not spoil the shape of the pyramid and they sat down all along the ledges of it to make faces but that did no good then they ran to the corners and put their elbows on their knees and stuck themselves out as far as they could and made more faces but that did no good neither then they looked up to the sky and opened their mouths wide and gobbled and said it was too hot for work and wondered when it would rain but that did no good neither and all the while the egyptian spirits were laying step above step patiently but when the gothic ones looked and saw how high they had got they said ach himmel and flew down in a great black cluster to the bottom and swept out a level spot in the sand with their wings in no time and began building a tower straight up as fast as they could and the egyptians stood still again to stare at them for the gothic spirits had got quite into a passion and were really working very wonderfully they cut the sandstone into strips as fine as reeds and put one reed on the top of another so that you could not see where they fitted and they twisted them in and out like basket work and knotted them into likenesses of ugly faces and of strange beasts biting each other and up they went and up still and they made spiral staircases at the corners for the loaded workers to come up by for i saw they were but weak imps and could not fly with stones on their backs and then they made traceried galleries for them to run round by and so up again with finer and finer work till the egyptians wondered whether they meant the thing for a tower or a pillar and i heard them saying to one another it was nearly as pretty as lotus stalks and if it were not for the ugly faces there would be a fine temple if they were going to build it all with pillars as big as that but in a minute afterwardsjust as the gothic spirits had carried their work as high as the upper course but three or four of the pyramidthe egyptians called out to them to mind what they were about for the sand was running away from under one of their tower corners but it was too late to mind what they were about for in another instant the whole tower sloped aside and the gothic imps rose out of it like a flight of puffins in a single cloud but screaming worse than any puffins you ever heard and down came the tower all in a piece like a falling poplar with its head right on the flank of the pyramid against which it snapped short off and of course that waked me  mary what a shame of you to have such a dream after all you have told us about gothic architecture  l if you have understood anything i ever told you about it you know that no architecture was ever corrupted more miserably or abolished more justly by the accomplishment of its own follies besides even in its days of power it was subject to catastrophes of this kind i have stood too often mourning by the grand fragment of the apse of beauvais not to have that fact well burnt into me still you must have seen surely that these imps were of the flamboyant school or at least of the german schools correspondent with it in extravagance  mary but then where is the crystal about which you dreamed all this  l here but i suppose little pthah has touched it again for it is very small but you see here is the pyramid built of great square stones of fluor spar straight up and here are the three little pinnacles of mischievous quartz which have set themselves at the same time on the same foundation only they lean like the tower of pisa and come out obliquely at the side and here is one great spire of quartz which seems as if it had been meant to stand straight up a little way off and then had fallen down against the pyramid base breaking its pinnacle away in reality it has crystallised horizontally and terminated imperfectly but then by what caprice does one crystal form horizontally when all the rest stand upright but this is nothing to the phantasies of fluor and quartz and some other such companions when they get leave to do anything they like i could show you fifty specimens about every one of which you might fancy a new fairy tale not that in truth any crystals get leave to do quite what they like and many of them are sadly tried and have little time for capricespoor things  mary i thought they always looked as if they were either in play or in mischief what trials have they  l trials much like our own sickness and starvation fevers and agues and palsy oppression and old age and the necessity of passing away in their time like all else if theres any pity in you you must come tomorrow and take some part in these crystal griefs  dora i am sure we shall cry till our eyes are red  l ah you may laugh dora but ive been made grave not once nor twice to see that even crystals cannot choose but be old at last it may be but a shallow proverb of the justices but it is a shrewdly wide one  dora pensive for once i suppose it is very dreadful to be old but then brightening again what should we do without our dear old friends and our nice old lecturers  l if all nice old lecturers were minded as little as one i know of  dora and if they all meant as little what they say would they not deserve it but well comewell come and cry  footnotes  152 note v     lecture ix  crystal sorrows  working lecture in schoolroom   l we have been hitherto talking children as if crystals might live and play and quarrel and behave ill or well according to their characters without interruption from anything else but so far from this being so nearly all crystals whatever their characters have to live a hard life of it and meet with many misfortunes if we could see far enough we should find indeed that at the root all their vices were misfortunes but today i want you to see what sort of troubles the best crystals have to go through occasionally by no fault of their own  this black thing which is one of the prettiest of the very few pretty black things in the world is called tourmaline it may be transparent and green or red as well as black and then no stone can be prettier only all the light that gets into it i believe comes out a good deal the worse and is not itself again for a long while but this is the commonest state of itopaque and as black as jet  mary what does tourmaline mean  l they say it is ceylanese and i dont know ceylanese but we may always be thankful for a graceful word whatever it means  mary and what is it made of  l a little of everything theres always flint and clay and magnesia in it and the black is iron according to its fancy and theres boracic acid if you know what that is and if you dont i cannot tell you today and it doesnt signify and theres potash and soda and on the whole the chemistry of it is more like a medi√¶val doctors prescription than the making of a respectable mineral but it may perhaps be owing to the strange complexity of its make that it has a notable habit which makes it to me one of the most interesting of minerals you see these two crystals are broken right across in many places just as if they had been shafts of black marble fallen from a ruinous temple and here they lie imbedded in white quartz fragment succeeding fragment keeping the line of the original crystal while the quartz fills up the intervening spaces now tourmaline has a trick of doing this more than any other mineral i know here is another bit which i picked up on the glacier of macugnaga it is broken like a pillar built of very flat broad stones into about thirty joints and all these are heaved and warped away from each other sideways almost into a line of steps and then all is filled up with quartz paste and here lastly is a green indian piece in which the pillar is first disjointed and then wrung round into the shape of an s  mary how can this have been done  l there are a thousand ways in which it may have been done the difficulty is not to account for the doing of it but for the showing of it in some crystals and not in others you never by any chance get a quartz crystal broken or twisted in this way if it break or twist at all which it does sometimes like the spire of dijon it is by its own will or fault it never seems to have been passively crushed but for the forces which cause this passive ruin of the tourmalinehere is a stone which will show you multitudes of them in operation at once it is known as brecciated agate beautiful as you see and highly valued as a pebble yet so far as i can read or hear no one has ever looked at it with the least attention at the first glance you see it is made of very fine red striped agates which have been broken into small pieces and fastened together again by paste also of agate there would be nothing wonderful in this if this were all it is well known that by the movements of strata portions of rock are often shattered to pieceswell known also that agate is a deposit of flint by water under certain conditions of heat and pressure there is therefore nothing wonderful in an agates being broken and nothing wonderful in its being mended with the solution out of which it was itself originally congealed and with this explanation most people looking at a brecciated agate or brecciated anything seem to be satisfied i was so myself for twenty years but lately happening to stay for some time at the swiss baden where the beach of the limmat is almost wholly composed of brecciated limestones i began to examine them thoughtfully and perceived in the end that they were one and all knots of as rich mystery as any poor little human brain was ever lost in that piece of agate in your hand mary will show you many of the common phenomena of breccias but you need not knit your brows over it in that way depend upon it neither you nor i shall ever know anything about the way it was made as long as we live  dora that does not seem much to depend upon  l pardon me puss when once we gain some real notion of the extent and the unconquerableness of our ignorance it is a very broad and restful thing to depend upon you can throw yourself upon it at ease as on a cloud to feast with the gods you do not thenceforward trouble yourselfnor any one elsewith theories or the contradiction of theories you neither get headache nor heartburning and you never more waste your poor little store of strength or allowance of time  however there are certain facts about this agatemaking which i can tell you and then you may look at it in a pleasant wonder as long as you like pleasant wonder is no loss of time  first then it is not broken freely by a blow it is slowly wrung or ground to pieces you can only with extreme dimness conceive the force exerted on mountains in transitional states of movement you have all read a little geology and you know how coolly geologists talk of mountains being raised or depressed they talk coolly of it because they are accustomed to the fact but the very universality of the fact prevents us from ever conceiving distinctly the conditions of force involved you know i was living last year in savoy my house was on the back of a sloping mountain which rose gradually for two miles behind it and then fell at once in a great precipice towards geneva going down three thousand feet in four or five cliffs or steps now that whole group of cliffs had simply been torn away by sheer strength from the rocks below as if the whole mass had been as soft as biscuit put four or five captains biscuits on the floor on the top of one another and try to break them all in half not by bending but by holding one half down and tearing the other halves straight upof course you will not be able to do it but you will feel and comprehend the sort of force needed then fancy each captains biscuit a bed of rock six or seven hundred feet thick and the whole mass torn straight through and one half heaved up three thousand feet grinding against the other as it roseand you will have some idea of the making of the mont sal√©ve  may but it must crush the rocks all to dust  l no for there is no room for dust the pressure is too great probably the heat developed also so great that the rock is made partly ductile but the worst of it is that we never can see these parts of mountains in the state they were left in at the time of their elevation for it is precisely in these rents and dislocations that the crystalline power principally exerts itself it is essentially a styptic power and wherever the earth is torn it heals and binds nay the torture and grieving of the earth seem necessary to bring out its full energy for you only find the crystalline living power fully in action where the rents and faults are deep and many  dora if you please sirwould you tell uswhat are faults  l you never heard of such things  dora never in all our lives  l when a vein of rock which is going on smoothly is interrupted by another troublesome little vein which stops it and puts it out so that it has to begin again in another placethat is called a fault i always think it ought to be called the fault of the vein that interrupts it but the miners always call it the fault of the vein that is interrupted  dora so it is if it does not begin again where it left off  l well that is certainly the gist of the business but whatever goodnatured old lecturers may do the rocks have a bad habit when they are once interrupted of never asking where was i  dora when the two halves of the dining table came separate yesterday was that a fault  l yes but not the tables however it is not a bad illustration dora when beds of rock are only interrupted by a fissure but remain at the same level like the two halves of the table it is not called a fault but only a fissure but if one half of the table be either tilted higher than the other or pushed to the side so that the two parts will not fit it is a fault you had better read the chapter on faults in jukess geology then you will know all about it and this rent that i am telling you of in the sal√©ve is one only of myriads to which are owing the forms of the alps as i believe of all great mountain chains wherever you see a precipice on any scale of real magnificence you will nearly always find it owing to some dislocation of this kind but the point of chief wonder to me is the delicacy of the touch by which these gigantic rents have been apparently accomplished note however that we have no clear evidence hitherto of the time taken to produce any of them we know that a change of temperature alters the position and the angles of the atoms of crystals and also the entire bulk of rocks we know that in all volcanic and the greater part of all subterranean action temperatures are continually changing and therefore masses of rock must be expanding or contracting with infinite slowness but with infinite force this pressure must result in mechanical strain somewhere both in their own substance and in that of the rocks surrounding them and we can form no conception of the result of irresistible pressure applied so as to rend and raise with imperceptible slowness of gradation masses thousands of feet in thickness we want some experiments tried on masses of iron and stone and we cant get them tried because christian creatures never will seriously and sufficiently spend money except to find out the shortest ways of killing each other but besides this slow kind of pressure there is evidence of more or less sudden violence on the same terrific scale and through it all the wonder as i said is always to me the delicacy of touch i cut a block of the sal√©ve limestone from the edge of one of the principal faults which have formed the precipice it is a lovely compact limestone and the fault itself is filled up with a red breccia formed of the crushed fragments of the torn rock cemented by a rich red crystalline paste i have had the piece i cut from it smoothed and polished across the junction here it is and you may now pass your soft little fingers over the surface without so much as feeling the place where a rock which all the hills of england might have been sunk in the body of and not a summit seen was torn asunder through that whole thickness as a thin dress is torn when you tread upon it       the audience examine the stone and touch it timidly but      the matter remains inconceivable to them  mary struck by the beauty of the stone but this is almost marble  l it is quite marble and another singular point in the business to my mind is that these stones which men have been cutting into slabs for thousands of years to ornament their principal buildings withand which under the general name of marble have been the delight of the eyes and the wealth of architecture among all civilised nationsare precisely those on which the signs and brands of these earth agonies have been chiefly struck and there is not a purple vein nor flaming zone in them which is not the record of their ancient torture what a boundless capacity for sleep and for serene stupidity there is in the human mind fancy reflective beings who cut and polish stones for three thousand years for the sake of the pretty stains upon them and educate themselves to an art at last such as it is of imitating these veins by dexterous painting and never a curious soul of them all that while asks what painted the rocks       the audience look dejected and ashamed of themselves  the fact is we are all and always asleep through our lives and it is only by pinching ourselves very hard that we ever come to see or understand anything at least it is not always we who pinch ourselves sometimes other people pinch us which i suppose is very good of themor other things which i suppose is very proper of them but it is a sad life made up chiefly of naps and pinches       some of the audience on this appearing to think that the      others require pinching the lecturer changes the      subject  now however for once look at a piece of marble carefully and think about it you see this is one side of the fault the other side is down or up nobody knows where but on this side you can trace the evidence of the dragging and tearing action all along the edge of this marble the ends of the fibres of the rock are torn here an inch and there half an inch away from each other and you see the exact places where they fitted before they were torn separate and you see the rents are now all filled up with the sanguine paste full of the broken pieces of the rock the paste itself seems to have been half melted and partly to have also melted the edge of the fragments it contains and then to have crystallised with them and round them and the brecciated agate i first showed you contains exactly the same phenomena a zoned crystallisation going on amidst the cemented fragments partly altering the structure of those fragments themselves and subject to continual change either in the intensity of its own power or in the nature of the materials submitted to itso that at one time gravity acts upon them and disposes them in horizontal layers or causes them to droop in stalactites and at another gravity is entirely defied and the substances in solution are crystallised in bands of equal thickness on every side of the cell it would require a course of lectures longer than these i have a great mindyou have behaved so saucilyto stay and give them to describe to you the phenomena of this kind in agates and chalcedonies onlynay there is a single sarcophagus in the british museum covered with grand sculpture of the 18th dynasty which contains in the magnificent breccia agates and jaspers imbedded in porphyry out of which it is hewn material for the thought of years and record of the earthsorrow of ages in comparison with the duration of which the egyptian letters tell us but the history of the evening and morning of a day  agates i think of all stones confess most of their past history but all crystallisation goes on under and partly records circumstances of this kindcircumstances of infinite variety but always involving difficulty interruption and change of condition at different times observe first you have the whole mass of the rock in motion either contracting itself and so gradually widening the cracks or being compressed and thereby closing them and crushing their edgesand if one part of its substance be softer at the given temperature than another probably squeezing that softer substance out into the veins then the veins themselves when the rock leaves them open by its contraction act with various power of suction upon its substanceby capillary attraction when they are fineby that of pure vacuity when they are larger or by changes in the constitution and condensation of the mixed gases with which they have been originally filled those gases themselves may be supplied in all variation of volume and power from below or slowly by the decomposition of the rocks themselves and at changing temperatures must exert relatively changing forces of decomposition and combination on the walls of the veins they fill while water at every degree of heat and pressure from beds of everlasting ice alternate with cliffs of native rock to volumes of red hot or white hot steam congeals and drips and throbs and thrills from crag to crag and breathes from pulse to pulse of foaming or fiery arteries whose beating is felt through chains of the great islands of the indian seas as your own pulses lift your bracelets and makes whole kingdoms of the world quiver in deadly earthquake as if they were light as aspen leaves and remember the poor little crystals have to live their lives and mind their own affairs in the midst of all this as best they may they are wonderfully like human creaturesforget all that is going on if they dont see it however dreadful and never think what is to happen tomorrow they are spiteful or loving and indolent or painstaking and orderly or licentious with no thought whatever of the lava or the flood which may break over them any day and evaporate them into airbubbles or wash them into a solution of salts and you may look at them once understanding the surrounding conditions of their fate with an endless interest you will see crowds of unfortunate little crystals who have been forced to constitute themselves in a hurry their dissolving element being fiercely scorched away you will see them doing their best bright and numberless but tiny then you will find indulged crystals who have had centuries to form themselves in and have changed their mind and ways continually and have been tired and taken heart again and have been sick and got well again and thought they would try a different diet and then thought better of it and made but a poor use of their advantages after all and others you will see who have begun life as wicked crystals and then have been impressed by alarming circumstances and have become converted crystals and behaved amazingly for a little while and fallen away again and ended but discreditably perhaps even in decomposition so that one doesnt know what will become of them and sometimes you will see deceitful crystals that look as soft as velvet and are deadly to all near them and sometimes you will see deceitful crystals that seem flintedged like our little quartzcrystal of a housekeeper here hush dora and are endlessly gentle and true wherever gentleness and truth are needed and sometimes you will see little childcrystals put to school like schoolgirls and made to stand in rows and taken the greatest care of and taught how to hold themselves up and behave and sometimes you will see unhappy little childcrystals left to lie about in the dirt and pick up their living and learn manners where they can and sometimes you will see fat crystals eating up thin ones like great capitalists and little labourers and politicoeconomic crystals teaching the stupid ones how to eat each other and cheat each other and foolish crystals getting in the way of wise ones and impatient crystals spoiling the plans of patient ones irreparably just as things go on in the world and sometimes you may see hypocritical crystals taking the shape of others though they are nothing like in their minds and vampire crystals eating out the hearts of others and hermitcrab crystals living in the shells of others and parasite crystals living on the means of others and courtier crystals glittering in attendance upon others and all these besides the two great companies of war and peace who ally themselves resolutely to attack or resolutely to defend and for the close you see the broad shadow and deadly force of inevitable fate above all this you see the multitudes of crystals whose time has come not a set time as with us but yet a time sooner or later when they all must give up their crystal ghostswhen the strength by which they grew and the breath given them to breathe pass away from them and they fail and are consumed and vanish away and another generation is brought to life framed out of their ashes  mary it is very terrible is it not the complete fulfilment down into the very dust of that verse the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain  l i do not know that it is in pain mary at least the evidence tends to show that there is much more pleasure than pain as soon as sensation becomes possible  lucilla but then surely if we are told that it is pain it must be pain  l yes if we are told and told in the way you mean lucilla but nothing is said of the proportion to pleasure unmitigated pain would kill any of us in a few hours pain equal to our pleasures would make us loathe life the word itself cannot be applied to the lower conditions of matter in its ordinary sense but wait till tomorrow to ask me about this tomorrow is to be kept for questions and difficulties let us keep to the plain facts today there is yet one group of facts connected with this rending of the rocks which i especially want you to notice you know when you have mended a very old dress quite meritoriously till it wont mend any more  egypt interrupting could not you sometimes take gentlemens work to illustrate by  l gentlemens work is rarely so useful as yours egypt and when it is useful girls cannot easily understand it  dora i am sure we should understand it better than gentlemen understand about sewing  l my dear i hope i always speak modestly and under correction when i touch upon matters of the kind too high for me and besides i never intend to speak otherwise than respectfully of sewingthough you always seem to think i am laughing at you in all seriousness illustrations from sewing are those which neith likes me best to use and which young ladies ought to like everybody to use what do you think the beautiful word wife comes from  dora tossing her head i dont think it is a particularly beautiful word  l perhaps not at your ages you may think bride sounds better but wifes the word for wear depend upon it it is the great word in which the english and latin languages conquer the french and the greek i hope the french will some day get a word for it yet instead of their dreadful femme but what do you think it comes from  dora i never did think about it  l nor you sibyl  sibyl no i thought it was saxon and stopped there  l yes but the great good of saxon words is that they usually do mean something wife means weaver you have all the right to call yourselves little housewives when you sew neatly  dora but i dont think we want to call ourselves little housewives  l you must either be housewives or housemoths remember that in the deep sense you must either weave mens fortunes and embroider them or feed upon and bring them to decay you had better let me keep my sewing illustration and help me out with it  dora well well hear it under protest  l you have heard it before but with reference to other matters when it is said no man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else it taketh from the old does it not mean that the new piece tears the old one away at the sewn edge  dora yes certainly  l and when you mend a decayed stuff with strong thread does not the whole edge come away sometimes when it tears again  dora yes and then it is of no use to mend it any more  l well the rocks dont seem to think that but the same thing happens to them continually i told you they were full of rents or veins large masses of mountain are sometimes as full of veins as your hand is and of veins nearly as fine only you know a rock vein does not mean a tube but a crack or cleft now these clefts are mended usually with the strongest material the rock can find and often literally with threads for the gradually opening rent seems to draw the substance it is filled with into fibres which cross from one side of it to the other and are partly crystalline so that when the crystals become distinct the fissure has often exactly the look of a tear brought together with strong cross stitches now when this is completely done and all has been fastened and made firm perhaps some new change of temperature may occur and the rock begin to contract again then the old vein must open wider or else another open elsewhere if the old vein widen it may do so at its centre but it constantly happens with well filled veins that the cross stitches are too strong to break the walls of the vein instead are torn away by them and another little supplementary veinoften three or four successivelywill be thus formed at the side of the first  mary that is really very much like our work but what do the mountains use to sew with  l quartz whenever they can get it pure limestones are obliged to be content with carbonate of lime but most mixed rocks can find some quartz for themselves here is a piece of black slate from the buet it looks merely like dry dark mudyou could not think there was any quartz in it but you see its rents are all stitched together with beautiful white thread which is the purest quartz so close drawn that you can break it like flint in the mass but where it has been exposed to the weather the fine fibrous structure is shown and more than that you see the threads have been all twisted and pulled aside this way and the other by the warpings and shifting of the sides of the vein as it widened  mary it is wonderful but is that going on still are the mountains being torn and sewn together again at this moment  l yes certainly my dear but i think just as certainly though geologists differ on this matter not with the violence or on the scale of their ancient ruin and renewal all things seem to be tending towards a condition of at least temporary rest and that groaning and travailing of the creation as assuredly not wholly in pain is not in the full sense until now  mary i want so much to ask you about that  sibyl yes and we all want to ask you about a great many other things besides  l it seems to me that you have got quite as many new ideas as are good for any of you at present and i should not like to burden you with more but i must see that those you have are clear if i can make them so so we will have one more talk for answer of questions mainly think over all the ground and make your difficulties thoroughly presentable then well see what we can make of them  dora they shall all be dressed in their very best and curtsey as they come in  l no no dora no curtseys if you please i had enough of them the day you all took a fit of reverence and curtsied me out of the room  dora but you know we cured ourselves of the fault at once by that fit we have never been the least respectful since and the difficulties will only curtsey themselves out of the room i hopecome in at one doorvanish at the other  l what a pleasant world it would be if all its difficulties were taught to behave so however one can generally make something or better still nothing or at least less of them if they thoroughly know their own minds and your difficultiesi must say that for you childrengenerally do know their own minds as you do yourselves  dora that is very kindly said for us some people would not allow so much as that girls had any minds to know  l they will at least admit that you have minds to change dora  mary you might have left us the last speech without a retouch but well put our little minds such as they are in the best trim we can for tomorrow     lecture x  the crystal rest       evening the fireside ls armchair in the comfortablest      corner   l perceiving various arrangements being made of footstool cushion screen and the like yes yes its all very fine and i am to sit here to be asked questions till suppertime am i  dora i dont think you can have any supper tonightweve got so much to ask  lily oh miss dora we can fetch it him here you know so nicely  l yes lily that will be pleasant with competitive examination going on over ones plate the competition being among the examiners really now that i know what teasing things girls are i dont so much wonder that people used to put up patiently with the dragons who took them for supper but i cant help myself i supposeno thanks to st george ask away children and ill answer as civilly as may be  dora we dont so much care about being answered civilly as about not being asked things back again  l ayez seulement la patience que je le parle there shall be no requitals  dora well then first of allwhat shall we ask first mary  mary it does not matter i think all the questions come into one at last nearly  dora you know you always talk as if the crystals were alive and we never understand how much you are in play and how much in earnest thats the first thing  l neither do i understand myself my dear how much i am in earnest the stones puzzle me as much as i puzzle you they look as if they were alive and make me speak as if they were and i do not in the least know how much truth there is in the appearance im not to ask things back again tonight but all questions of this sort lead necessarily to the one main question which we asked before in vain what is it to be alive  dora yes but we want to come back to that for weve been reading scientific books about the conservation of forces and it seems all so grand and wonderful and the experiments are so pretty and i suppose it must be all right but then the books never speak as if there were any such thing as life  l they mostly omit that part of the subject certainly dora but they are beautifully right as far as they go and life is not a convenient element to deal with they seem to have been getting some of it into and out of bottles in their ozone and antizone lately but they still know little of it and certainly i know less  dora you promised not to be provoking tonight  l wait a minute though quite truly i know less of the secrets of life than the philosophers do i yet know one corner of ground on which we artists can stand literally as life guards at bay as steadily as the guards at inkermann however hard the philosophers push and you may stand with us if once you learn to draw nicely  dora im sure we are all trying but tell us where we may stand  l you may always stand by form against force to a painter the essential character of anything is the form of it and the philosophers cannot touch that they come and tell you for instance that there is as much heat or motion or calorific energy or whatever else they like to call it in a teakettle as in a giereagle very good that is so and it is very interesting it requires just as much heat as will boil the kettle to take the giereagle up to his nest and as much more to bring him down again on a hare or a partridge but we painters acknowledging the equality and similarity of the kettle and the bird in all scientific respects attach for our part our principal interest to the difference in their forms for us the primarily cognisable facts in the two things are that the kettle has a spout and the eagle a beak the one a lid on its back the other a pair of wingsnot to speak of the distinction also of volition which the philosophers may properly call merely a form or mode of forcebut then to an artist the form or mode is the gist of the business the kettle chooses to sit still on the hob the eagle to recline on the air it is the fact of the choice not the equal degree of temperature in the fulfilment of it which appears to us the more interesting circumstancethough the other is very interesting too exceedingly so dont laugh children the philosophers have been doing quite splendid work lately in their own way especially the transformation of force into light is a great piece of systematised discovery and this notion about the suns being supplied with his flame by ceaseless meteoric hail is grand and looks very likely to be true of course it is only the old gunlockflint and steelon a large scale but the order and majesty of it are sublime still we sculptors and painters care little about it it is very fine we say and very useful this knocking the light out of the sun or into it by an eternal cataract of planets but you may hail away so for ever and you will not knock out what we can here is a bit of silver not the size of halfacrown on which with a single hammer stroke one of us two thousand and odd years ago hit out the head of the apollo of clazomen√¶ it is merely a matter of form but if any of you philosophers with your whole planetary system to hammer with can hit out such another bit of silver as thiswe will take off our hats to you for the present we keep them on  mary yes i understand and that is nice but i dont think we shall any of us like having only form to depend upon  l it was not neglected in the making of eve my dear  mary it does not seem to separate us from the dust of the ground it is that breathing of the life which we want to understand  l so you should but hold fast to the form and defend that first as distinguished from the mere transition of forces discern the moulding hand of the potter commanding the clay from his merely beating foot as it turns the wheel if you can find incense in the vase afterwardswell but it is curious how far mere form will carry you ahead of the philosophers for instance with regard to the most interesting of all their modes of forcelightthey never consider how far the existence of it depends on the putting of certain vitreous and nervous substances into the formal arrangement which we call an eye the german philosophers began the attack long ago on the other side by telling us there was no such thing as light at all unless we chose to see it now german and english both have reversed their engines and insist that light would be exactly the same light that it is though nobody could ever see it the fact being that the force must be there and the eyes there and light means the effect of the one on the otherand perhaps alsoplato saw farther into that mystery than any one has since that i know ofon something a little way within the eyes but we may stand quite safe close behind the retina and defy the philosophers  sibyl but i dont care so much about defying the philosophers if only one could get a clear idea of life or soul for ones self  l well sibyl you used to know more about it in that cave of yours than any of us i was just going to ask you about inspiration and the golden bough and the like only i remembered i was not to ask anything but will not you at least tell us whether the ideas of life as the power of putting things together or making them and of death as the power of pushing things separate or unmaking them may not be very simply held in balance against each other  sibyl no i am not in my cave tonight and cannot tell you anything  l i think they may modern philosophy is a great separator it is little more than the expansion of moli√®res great sentence il sensuit de l√† que tout ce quil y a de beau est dans les dictionnaires il ny a que les mots qui sont transpos√©s but when you used to be in your cave sibyl and to be inspired there was and there remains still in some small measure beyond the merely formative and sustaining power another which we painters call passioni dont know what the philosophers call it we know it makes people red or white and therefore it must be something itself and perhaps it is the most truly poetic or making force of all creating a world of its own out of a glance or a sigh and the want of passion is perhaps the truest death or unmaking of everythingeven of stones by the way you were all reading about that ascent of the aiguille verte the other day  sibyl because you had told us it was so difficult you thought it could not be ascended  l yes i believed the aiguille verte would have held its own but do you recollect what one of the climbers exclaimed when he first felt sure of reaching the summit  sibyl yes it was oh aiguille verte vous √™tes morte vous √™tes morte  l that was true instinct real philosophic joy now can you at all fancy the difference between that feeling of triumph in a mountains death and the exultation of your beloved poet in its life      quantus athos aut quantus eryx aut ipse coruscis     quum fremit ilicibus quantus gandetque nivali     vertice se attollens pater apenninus ad auras  dora you must translate for us mere housekeepers pleasewhatever the cavekeepers may know about it  mary will dryden do  l no dryden is a far way worse than nothing and nobody will do you cant translate it but this is all you need know that the lines are full of a passionate sense of the apennines fatherhood or protecting power over italy and of sympathy with their joy in their snowy strength in heaven and with the same joy shuddering through all the leaves of their forests  mary yes that is a difference indeed but then you know one cant help feeling that it is fanciful it is very delightful to imagine the mountains to be alive but thenare they alive  l it seems to me on the whole mary that the feelings of the purest and most mightily passioned human souls are likely to be the truest not indeed if they do not desire to know the truth or blind themselves to it that they may please themselves with passion for then they are no longer pure but if continually seeking and accepting the truth as far as it is discernible they trust their maker for the integrity of the instincts he has gifted them with and rest in the sense of a higher truth which they cannot demonstrate i think they will be most in the right so  dora and jessie clapping their hands then we really may believe that the mountains are living  l you may at least earnestly believe that the presence of the spirit which culminates in your own life shows itself in dawning wherever the dust of the earth begins to assume any orderly and lovely state you will find it impossible to separate this idea of gradated manifestation from that of the vital power things are not either wholly alive or wholly dead they are less or more alive take the nearest most easily examined instancethe life of a flower notice what a different degree and kind of life there is in the calyx and the corolla the calyx is nothing but the swaddling clothes of the flower the childblossom is bound up in it hand and foot guarded in it restrained by it till the time of birth the shell is hardly more subordinate to the germ in the egg than the calyx to the blossom it bursts at last but it never lives as the corolla does it may fall at the moment its task is fulfilled as in the poppy or wither gradually as in the buttercup or persist in a ligneous apathy after the flower is dead as in the rose or harmonise itself so as to share in the aspect of the real flower as in the lily but it never shares in the corollas bright passion of life and the gradations which thus exist between the different members of organic creatures exist no less between the different ranges of organism we know no higher or more energetic life than our own but there seems to me this great good in the idea of gradation of lifeit admits the idea of a life above us in other creatures as much nobler than ours as ours is nobler than that of the dust  mary i am glad you have said that for i know violet and lucilla and may want to ask you something indeed we all do only you frightened violet so about the anthill that she cant say a word and may is afraid of your teasing her too but i know they are wondering why you are always telling them about heathen gods and goddesses as if you half believed in them and you represent them as good and then we see there is really a kind of truth in the stories about them and we are all puzzled and in this we cannot even make our difficulty quite clear to ourselvesit would be such a long confused question if we could ask you all we should like to know  l nor is it any wonder mary for this is indeed the longest and the most wildly confused question that reason can deal with but i will try to give you quickly a few clear ideas about the heathen gods which you may follow out afterwards as your knowledge increases  every heathen conception of deity in which you are likely to be interested has three distinct characters  i it has a physical character it represents some of the great powers or objects of naturesun or moon or heaven or the winds or the sea and the fables first related about each deity represent figuratively the action of the natural power which it represents such as the rising and setting of the sun the tides of the sea and so on  ii it has an ethical character and represents in its history the moral dealings of god with man thus apollo is first physically the sun contending with darkness but morally the power of divine life contending with corruption athena is physically the air morally the breathing of the divine spirit of wisdom neptune is physically the sea morally the supreme power of agitating passion and so on  iii it has at last a personal character and is realised in the minds of its worshippers as a living spirit with whom men may speak face to face as a man speaks to his friend  now it is impossible to define exactly how far at any period of a national religion these three ideas are mingled or how far one prevails over the other each enquirer usually takes up one of these ideas and pursues it to the exclusion of the others no impartial effort seems to have been made to discern the real state of the heathen imagination in its successive phases for the question is not at all what a mythological figure meant in its origin but what it became in each subsequent mental development of the nation inheriting the thought exactly in proportion to the mental and moral insight of any race its mythological figures mean more to it and become more real an early and savage race means nothing more because it has nothing more to mean by its apollo than the sun while a cultivated greek means every operation of divine intellect and justice the neith of egypt meant physically little more than the blue of the air but the greek in a climate of alternate storm and calm represented the wild fringes of the stormcloud by the serpents of her √¶gis and the lightning and cold of the highest thunderclouds by the gorgon on her shield while morally the same types represented to him the mystery and changeful terror of knowledge as her spear and helm its ruling and defensive power and no study can be more interesting or more useful to you than that of the different meanings which have been created by great nations and great poets out of mythological figures given them at first in utter simplicity but when we approach them in their third or personal character and for its power over the whole national mind this is far the leading one we are met at once by questions which may well put all of you at pause were they idly imagined to be real beings and did they so usurp the place of the true god or were they actually real beingsevil spiritsleading men away from the true god or is it conceivable that they might have been real beingsgood spiritsentrusted with some message from the true god these were the questions you wanted to ask were they not lucilla  lucilla yes indeed  l well lucilla the answer will much depend upon the clearness of your faith in the personality of the spirits which are described in the book of your own religiontheir personality observe as distinguished from merely symbolical visions for instance when jeremiah has the vision of the seething pot with its mouth to the north you know that this which he sees is not a real thing but merely a significant dream also when zechariah sees the speckled horses among the myrtle trees in the bottom you still may suppose the vision symbolicalyou do not think of them as real spirits like pegasus seen in the form of horses but when you are told of the four riders in the apocalypse a distinct sense of personality begins to force itself upon you and though you might in a dull temper think that for one instance of all the fourth rider on the pale horse was merely a symbol of the power of deathin your stronger and more earnest moods you will rather conceive of him as a real and living angel and when you look back from the vision of the apocalypse to the account of the destruction of the egyptian firstborn and of the army of sennacherib and again to davids vision at the threshing floor of araunah the idea of personality in this deathangel becomes entirely defined just as in the appearance of the angels to abraham manoah or mary  now when you have once consented to this idea of a personal spirit must not the question instantly follow does this spirit exercise its functions towards one race of men only or towards all men was it an angel of death to the jew only or to the gentile also you find a certain divine agency made visible to a king of israel as an armed angel executing vengeance of which one special purpose was to lower his kingly pride you find another or perhaps the same agency made visible to a christian prophet as an angel standing in the sun calling to the birds that fly under heaven to come that they may eat the flesh of kings is there anything impious in the thought that the same agency might have been expressed to a greek king or greek seer by similar visionsthat this figure standing in the sun and armed with the sword or the bow whose arrows were drunk with blood and exercising especially its power in the humiliation of the proud might at first have been called only destroyer and afterwards as the light or sun of justice was recognised in the chastisement called also physician or healer if you feel hesitation in admitting the possibility of such a manifestation i believe you will find it is caused partly indeed by such trivial things as the difference to your ear between greek and english terms but far more by uncertainty in your own mind respecting the nature and truth of the visions spoken of in the bible have any of you intently examined the nature of your belief in them you for instance lucilla who think often and seriously of such things  lucilla no i never could tell what to believe about them i know they must be true in some way or other and i like reading about them  l yes and i like reading about them too lucilla as i like reading other grand poetry but surely we ought both to do more than like it will god be satisfied with us think you if we read his words merely for the sake of an entirely meaningless poetical sensation  lucilla but do not the people who give themselves to seek out the meaning of these things often get very strange and extravagant  l more than that lucilla they often go mad that abandonment of the mind to religious theory or contemplation is the very thing i have been pleading with you against i never said you should set yourself to discover the meanings but you should take careful pains to understand them so far as they are clear and you should always accurately ascertain the state of your mind about them i want you never to read merely for the pleasure of fancy still less as a formal religious duty else you might as well take to repeating paters at once for it is surely wiser to repeat one thing we understand than read a thousand which we cannot either therefore acknowledge the passages to be for the present unintelligible to you or else determine the sense in which you at present receive them or at all events the different senses between which you clearly see that you must choose make either your belief or your difficulty definite but do not go on all through your life believing nothing intelligently and yet supposing that your having read the words of a divine book must give you the right to despise every religion but your own i assure you strange as it may seem our scorn of greek tradition depends not on our belief but our disbelief of our own traditions we have as yet no sufficient clue to the meaning of either but you will always find that in proportion to the earnestness of our own faith its tendency to accept a spiritual personality increases and that the most vital and beautiful christian temper rests joyfully in its conviction of the multitudinous ministry of living angels infinitely varied in rank and power you all know one expression of the purest and happiest form of such faith as it exists in modern times in richters lovely illustrations of the lords prayer the real and living deathangel girt as a pilgrim for journey and softly crowned with flowers beckons at the dying mothers door childangels sit talking face to face with mortal children among the flowershold them by their little coats lest they fall on the stairswhisper dreams of heaven to them leaning over their pillows carry the sound of the church bells for them far through the air and even descending lower in service fill little cups with honey to hold out to the weary bee by the way lily did you tell the other children that story about your little sister and alice and the sea  lily i told it to alice and to miss dora i dont think i did to anybody else i thought it wasnt worth  l we shall think it worth a great deal now lily if you will tell it us how old is dotty again i forget  lily she is not quite three but she has such odd little old ways sometimes  l and she was very fond of alice  lily yes alice was so good to her always  l and so when alice went away  lily oh it was nothing you know to tell about only it was strange at the time  l well but i want you to tell it  lily the morning after alice had gone dotty was very sad and restless when she got up and went about looking into all the corners as if she could find alice in them and at last she came to me and said is alie gone over the great sea and i said yes she is gone over the great deep sea but she will come back again some day then dotty looked round the room and i had just poured some water out into the basin and dotty ran to it and got up on a chair and dashed her hands through the water again and again and cried oh deep deep sea send little alie back to me  l isnt that pretty children theres a dear little heathen for you the whole heart of greek mythology is in that the idea of a personal being in the elemental powerof its being moved by prayerand of its presence everywhere making the broken diffusion of the element sacred  now remember the measure in which we may permit ourselves to think of this trusted and adored personality in greek or in any other mythology as conceivably a shadow of truth will depend on the degree in which we hold the greeks or other great nations equal or inferior in privilege and character to the jews or to ourselves if we believe that the great father would use the imagination of the jew as an instrument by which to exalt and lead him but the imagination of the greek only to degrade and mislead him if we can suppose that real angels were sent to minister to the jews and to punish them but no angels or only mocking spectra of angels or even devils in the shapes of angels to lead lycurgus and leonidas from desolate cradle to hopeless graveand if we can think that it was only the influence of spectres or the teaching of demons which issued in the making of mothers like cornelia and of sons like cleobis and bito we may of course reject the heathen mythology in our privileged scorn but at least we are bound to examine strictly by what faults of our own it has come to pass that the ministry of real angels among ourselves is occasionally so ineffectual as to end in the production of cornelias who entrust their childjewels to charlotte winsors for the better keeping of them and of sons like that one who the other day in france beat his mother to death with a stick and was brought in by the jury guilty with extenuating circumstances  may was that really possible  l yes my dear i am not sure that i can lay my hand on the reference to it and i should not have said the other dayit was a year or two ago but you may depend on the fact and i could give you many like it if i chose there was a murder done in russia very lately on a traveller the murderesss little daughter was in the way and found it out somehow her mother killed her too and put her into the oven there is a peculiar horror about the relations between parent and child which are being now brought about by our variously degraded forms of european white slavery here is one reference i see in my notes on that story of cleobis and bito though i suppose i marked this chiefly for its quaintness and the beautifully christian names of the sons but it is a good instance of the power of the king of the valley of diamonds153 among us  in galignani of july 2122 1862 is reported a trial of a farmers son in the department of the yonne the father two years ago at malay le grand gave up his property to his two sons on condition of being maintained by them simon fulfilled his agreement but pierre would not the tribunal of sens condemns pierre to pay eightyfour francs a year to his father pierre replies he would rather die than pay it actually returning home he throws himself into the river and the body is not found till next day  mary butbuti cant tell what you would have us think do you seriously mean that the greeks were better than we are and that their gods were real angels  l no my dear i mean only that we know in reality less than nothing of the dealings of our maker with our fellowmen and can only reason or conjecture safely about them when we have sincerely humble thoughts of ourselves and our creeds  we owe to the greeks every noble discipline in literature every radical principle of art and every form of convenient beauty in our household furniture and daily occupations of life we are unable ourselves to make rational use of half that we have received from them and of our own we have nothing but discoveries in science and fine mechanical adaptations of the discovered physical powers on the other hand the vice existing among certain classes both of the rich and poor in london paris and vienna could have been conceived by a spartan or roman of the heroic ages only as possible in a tartarus where fiends were employed to teach but not to punish crime it little becomes us to speak contemptuously of the religion of races to whom we stand in such relations nor do i think any man of modesty or thoughtfulness will ever speak so of any religion in which god has allowed one good man to die trusting  the more readily we admit the possibility of our own cherished convictions being mixed with error the more vital and helpful whatever is right in them will become and no error is so conclusively fatal as the idea that god will not allow us to err though he has allowed all other men to do so there may be doubt of the meaning of other visions but there is none respecting that of the dream of st peter and you may trust the rock of the churchs foundation for true interpreting when he learned from it that in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted with him see that you understand what that righteousness means and set hand to it stoutly you will always measure your neighbors creed kindly in proportion to the substantial fruits of your own do not think you will ever get harm by striving to enter into the faith of others and to sympathise in imagination with the guiding principles of their lives so only can you justly love them or pity them or praise by the gracious effort you will double treblenay indefinitely multiply at once the pleasure the reverence and the intelligence with which you read and believe me it is wiser and holier by the fire of your own faith to kindle the ashes of expired religions than to let your soul shiver and stumble among their graves through the gathering darkness and communicable cold  mary after some pause we shall all like reading greek history so much better after this but it has put everything else out of our heads that we wanted to ask  l i can tell you one of the things and i might take credit for generosity in telling you but i have a personal reasonlucillas verse about the creation  dora oh yesyes and its pain together until now  l i call you back to that because i must warn you against an old error of my own somewhere in the fourth volume of modern painters i said that the earth seemed to have passed through its highest state and that after ascending by a series of phases culminating in its habitation by man it seems to be now gradually becoming less fit for that habitation  mary yes i remember  l i wrote those passages under a very bitter impression of the gradual perishing of beauty from the loveliest scenes which i knew in the physical worldnot in any doubtful way such as i might have attributed to loss of sensation in myselfbut by violent and definite physical action such as the filling up of the lac de ch√™de by landslips from the rochers des fizthe narrowing of the lake lucerne by the gaining delta of the stream of the muottathal which in the course of years will cut the lake into two as that of brientz has been divided from that of thunthe steady diminishing of the glaciers north of the alps and still more of the sheets of snow on their southern slopes which supply the refreshing streams of lombardythe equally steady increase of deadly maremma round pisa and venice and other such phenomena quite measurably traceable within the limits even of short life and unaccompanied as it seemed by redeeming or compensatory agencies i am still under the same impression respecting the existing phenomena but i feel more strongly every day that no evidence to be collected within historical periods can be accepted as any clue to the great tendencies of geological change but that the great laws which never fail and to which all change is subordinate appear such as to accomplish a gradual advance to lovelier order and more calmly yet more deeply animated rest nor has this conviction ever fastened itself upon me more distinctly than during my endeavour to trace the laws which govern the lowly framework of the dust for through all the phases of its transition and dissolution there seems to be a continual effort to raise itself into a higher state and a measured gain through the fierce revulsion and slow renewal of the earths frame in beauty and order and permanence the soft white sediments of the sea draw themselves in process of time into smooth knots of sphered symmetry burdened and strained under increase of pressure they pass into a nascent marble scorched by fervent heat they brighten and blanch into the snowy rock of paros and carrara the dark drift of the inland river or stagnant slime of inland pool and lake divides or resolves itself as it dries into layers of its several elements slowly purifying each by the patient withdrawal of it from the anarchy of the mass in which it was mingled contracted by increasing drought till it must shatter into fragments it infuses continually a finer ichor into the opening veins and finds in its weakness the first rudiments of a perfect strength bent at last rock from rock nay atom from atom and tormented in lambent fire it knits through the fusion the fibres of a perennial endurance and during countless subsequent centuries declining or rather let me say rising to repose finishes the infallible lustre of its crystalline beauty under harmonies of law which are wholly beneficent because wholly inexorable       the children seem pleased but more inclined to think over      these matters than to talk  l after giving them a little time mary i seldom ask you to read anything out of books of mine but there is a passage about the law of help which i want you to read to the children now because it is of no use merely to put it in other words for them you know the place i mean do not you  mary yes presently finding it where shall i begin  l here but the elder ones had better look afterwards at the piece which comes just before this  mary reads                                       a pure or holy state of anything is that in which all its parts are helpful or consistent the highest and first law of the universe and the other name of life is therefore help the other name of death is separation government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life anarchy and competition eternally and in all things the laws of death  perhaps the best though the most familiar example we could take of the nature and power of consistence will be that of the possible changes in the dust we tread on  exclusive of animal decay we can hardly arrive at a more absolute type of impurity than the mud or slime of a damp overtrodden path in the outskirts of a manufacturing town i do not say mud of the road because that is mixed with animal refuse but take merely an ounce or two of the blackest slime of a beaten footpath on a rainy day near a manufacturing town that slime we shall find in most cases composed of clay or brickdust which is burnt clay mixed with soot a little sand and water all these elements are at helpless war with each other and destroy reciprocally each others nature and power competing and fighting for place at every tread of your foot sand squeezing out clay and clay squeezing out water and soot meddling everywhere and defiling the whole let us suppose that this ounce of mud is left in perfect rest and that its elements gather together like to like so that their atoms may get into the closest relations possible  let the clay begin ridding itself of all foreign substance it gradually becomes a white earth already very beautiful and fit with help of congealing fire to be made into finest porcelain and painted on and be kept in kings palaces but such artificial consistence is not its best leave it still quiet to follow its own instinct of unity and it becomes not only white but clear not only clear but hard nor only clear and hard but so set that it can deal with light in a wonderful way and gather out of it the loveliest blue rays only refusing the rest we call it then a sapphire  such being the consummation of the clay we give similar permission of quiet to the sand it also becomes first a white earth then proceeds to grow clear and hard and at last arranges itself in mysterious infinitely fine parallel lines which have the power of reflecting not merely the blue rays but the blue green purple and red rays in the greatest beauty in which they can be seen through any hard material whatsoever we call it then an opal  in next order the soot sets to work it cannot make itself white at first but instead of being discouraged tries harder and harder and comes out clear at last and the hardest thing in the world and for the blackness that it had obtains in exchange the power of reflecting all the rays of the sun at once in the vividest blaze that any solid thing can shoot we call it then a diamond  last of all the water purifies or unites itself contented enough if it only reach the form of a dewdrop but if we insist on its proceeding to a more perfect

throughout the dialogues it must be observed that sibyl is addressed when in play as having once been the cum√¶an sibyl and egypt as having been queen nitocristhe cinderella and the greatest heroine and beauty of egyptian story the egyptians called her neith the victorious nitocris and the greeks face of the rose rhodope chaucers beautiful conception of cleopatra in the legend of good women is much more founded on the traditions of her than on those of cleopatra and especially in its close modified by herodotuss terrible story of the death of nitocris which however is mythologically nothing more than a part of the deep monotonous ancient dirge for the fulfilment of the earthly destiny of beauty she cast herself into a chamber full of ashes  i believe this queen is now sufficiently ascertained to have either built or increased to double its former size the third pyramid of gizeh and the passage following in the text refers to an imaginary endeavour by the old lecturer and the children together to make out the description of that pyramid in the 167th page of the second volume of bunsens egypts place in universal historyideal endeavourwhich ideally terminates as the old lecturers real endeavours to the same end always have terminated there are however valuable notes respecting nitocris at page 210 of the same volume but the early egyptian history for the young by the author of sidney gray contains in a pleasant form as much information as young readers will usually need   note ii  page 25  pyramid of asychis  this pyramid in mythology divides with the tower of babel the shame or vain glory of being presumptuously and first among great edifices built with brick for stone this was the inscription on it according to herodotus       despise me not in comparing me with the pyramids of stone      for i have the preeminence over them as far as jupiter has      preeminence over the gods for striking with staves into      the pool men gathered the clay which fastened itself to the      staff and kneaded bricks out of it and so made me  the word i have translated kneaded is literally drew in the sense of drawing for which the latins used duco and thus gave us our ductile in speaking of dead clay and duke doge or leader in speaking of living clay as the asserted preeminence of the edifice is made in this inscription to rest merely on the quantity of labour consumed in it this pyramid is considered in the text as the type at once of the base building and of the lost labour of future ages so far at least as the spirits of measured and mechanical effort deal with it but neith exercising her power upon it makes it a type of the work of wise and inspired builders   note iii  page 25  the greater pthah  it is impossible as yet to define with distinctness the personal agencies of the egyptian deities they are continually associated in function or hold derivative powers or are related to each other in mysterious triads uniting always symbolism of physical phenomena with real spiritual power i have endeavoured partly to explain this in the text of the tenth lecture here it is only necessary for the reader to know that the greater pthah more or less represents the formative power of order and measurement he always stands on a foursquare pedestal the egyptian cubit metaphorically used as the hieroglyphic for truth his limbs are bound together to signify fixed stability as of a pillar he has a measuringrod in his hand and at phil√¶ is represented as holding an egg on a potters wheel but i do not know if this symbol occurs in older sculptures his usual title is the lord of truth others very beautiful king of the two worlds of gracious countenance superintendent of the great abode c are given by mr birch in arundales gallery of antiquities which i suppose is the book of best authority easily accessible for the full titles and utterances of the gods rosellini is as yet the onlyand i believe still a very questionableauthority and arundales little book excellent in the text has this great defect that its drawings give the statues invariably a ludicrous or ignoble character readers who have not access to the originals must be warned against this frequent fault in modern illustration especially existing also in some of the painted casts of gothic and norman work at the crystal palace it is not owing to any wilful want of veracity the plates in arundales book are laboriously faithful but the expressions of both face and body in a figure depend merely on emphasis of touch and in barbaric art most draughtsmen emphasise what they plainly seethe barbarism and miss conditions of nobleness which they must approach the monument in a different temper before they will discover and draw with great subtlety before they can express  the character of the lower pthah or perhaps i ought rather to say of pthah in his lower office is sufficiently explained in the text of the third lecture only the reader must be warned that the egyptian symbolism of him by the beetle was not a scornful one it expressed only the idea of his presence in the first elements of life but it may not unjustly be used in another sense by us who have seen his power in new development and even as it was i cannot conceive that the egyptians should have regarded their beetleheaded image of him champollion pantheon pl 12 without some occult scorn it is the most painful of all their types of any beneficent power and even among those of evil influences none can be compared with it except its opposite the tortoiseheaded demon of indolence  pasht p 24 line 32 is connected with the greek artemis especially in her offices of judgment and vengeance she is usually lionessheaded sometimes catheaded her attributes seeming often trivial or ludicrous unless their full meaning is known but the enquiry is much too wide to be followed here the cat was sacred to her or rather to the sun and secondarily to her she is alluded to in the text because she is always the companion of pthah called the beloved of pthah it may be as judgment demanded and longed for by truth and it may be well for young readers to have this fixed in their minds even by chance association there are more statues of pasht in the british museum than of any other egyptian deity several of them fine in workmanship nearly all in dark stone which may be presumably to connect her as the moon with the night and in her office of avenger with grief  thoth p 27 line 17 is the recording angel of judgment and the greek hermes phre line 20 is the sun  neith is the egyptian spirit of divine wisdom and the athena of the greeks no sufficient statement of her many attributes still less of their meanings can be shortly given but this should be noted respecting the veiling of the egyptian image of her by vulture wingsthat as she is physically the goddess of the air this bird the most powerful creature of the air known to the egyptians naturally became her symbol it had other significations but certainly this when in connection with neith as representing her it was the most important sign next to the winged sphere in egyptian sculpture and just as in homer athena herself guides her heroes into battle this symbol of wisdom giving victory floats over the heads of the egyptian kings the greeks representing the goddess herself in human form yet would not lose the power of the egyptian symbol and changed it into an angel of victory first seen in loveliness on the early coins of syracuse and leontium it gradually became the received sign of all conquest and the socalled victory of later times which little by little loses its truth and is accepted by the moderns only as a personification of victory itselfnot as an actual picture of the living angel who led to victory there is a wide difference between these two conceptionsall the difference between insincere poetry and sincere religion this i have also endeavoured farther to illustrate in the tenth lecture there is however one part of athenas character which it would have been irrelevant to dwell upon there yet which i must not wholly leave unnoticed  as the goddess of the air she physically represents both its beneficent calm and necessary tempest other stormdeities as chrysaor and √Üolus being invested with a subordinate and more or less malignant function which is exclusively their own and is related to that of athena as the power of mars is related to hers in war so also virgil makes her able to wield the lightning herself while juno cannot but must pray for the intervention of √Üolus she has precisely the correspondent moral authority over calmness of mind and just anger she soothes achilles as she incites tydides her physical power over the air being always hinted correlatively she grasps achilles by his hairas the wind would lift itsoftly      it fanned his cheek it raised his hair     like a meadow gale in spring  she does not merely turn the lance of mars from diomed but seizes it in both her hands and casts it aside with a sense of making it vain like chaff in the windto the shout of achilles she adds her own voice of storm in heavenbut in all cases the moral power is still the principal onemost beautifully in that seizing of achilles by the hair which was the talisman of his life because he had vowed it to the sperchius if he returned in safety and which in giving at patroclus tomb he knowingly yields up the hope of return to his country and signifies that he will die with his friend achilles and tydides are above all other heroes aided by her in war because their prevailing characters are the desire of justice united in both with deep affections and in achilles with a passionate tenderness which is the real root of his passionate anger ulysses is her favourite chiefly in her office as the goddess of conduct and design   note iv  page 54  geometrical limitations  it is difficult without a tedious accuracy or without full illustration to express the complete relations of crystalline structure which dispose minerals to take at different times fibrous massive or foliated forms and i am afraid this chapter will be generally skipped by the reader yet the arrangement itself will be found useful if kept broadly in mind and the transitions of state are of the highest interest if the subject is entered upon with any earnestness it would have been vain to add to the scheme of this little volume any account of the geometrical forms of crystals an available one though still far too difficult and too copious has been arranged by the rev mr mitchell for orrs circle of the sciences and i believe the nets of crystals which are therein given to be cut out with scissors and put prettily together will be found more conquerable by young ladies than by other students they should also when an opportunity occurs be shown at any public library the diagram of the crystallisation of quartz referred to poles at p 8 of cloizauxs manuel de min√©ralogie that they may know what work is and what the subject is  with a view to more careful examination of the nascent states of silica i have made no allusion in this volume to the influence of mere segregation as connected with the crystalline power it has only been recently during the study of the breccias alluded to in page 113 that i have fully seen the extent to which this singular force often modifies rocks in which at first its influence might hardly have been suspected many apparent conglomerates being in reality formed chiefly by segregation combined with mysterious brokenlyzoned structures like those of some malachites i hope some day to know more of these and several other mineral phenomena especially of those connected with the relative sizes of crystals which otherwise i should have endeavoured to describe in this volume   note v  page 102  st barbara  i would have given the legends of st barbara and st thomas if i had thought it always well for young readers to have everything at once told them which they may wish to know they will remember the stories better after taking some trouble to find them and the text is intelligible enough as it stands the idea of st barbara as there given is founded partly on her legend in peter de natalibus partly on the beautiful photograph of van eycks picture of her at antwerp which was some time since published at lille   note vi  page 137  king of the valley of diamonds  isabel interrupted the lecturer here and was briefly bid to hold her tongue which gave rise to some talk apart afterwards between l and sibyl of which a word or two may be perhaps advisably set down  sibyl we shall spoil isabel certainly if we dont mind i was glad you stopped her and yet sorry for she wanted so much to ask about the valley of diamonds again and she has worked so hard at it and made it nearly all out by herself she recollected elishas throwing in the meal which nobody else did  l but what did she want to ask  sibyl about the mulberry trees and the serpents we are all stopped by that wont you tell us what it means  l now sibyl i am sure you who never explained yourself should be the last to expect others to do so i hate explaining myself  sibyl and yet how often you complain of other people for not saying what they meant how i have heard you growl over the three stone steps to purgatory for instance  l yes because dantes meaning is worth getting at but mine matters nothing at least if ever i think it is of any consequence i speak it as clearly as may be but you may make anything you like of the serpent forests i could have helped you to find out what they were by giving a little more detail but it would have been tiresome  sibyl it is much more tiresome not to find out tell us please as isabel says because we feel so stupid  l there is no stupidity you could not possibly do more than guess at anything so vague but i think you sibyl at least might have recollected what first dyed the mulberry  sibyl so i did but that helped little i thought of dantes forest of suicides too but you would not simply have borrowed that  l no if i had had strength to use it i should have stolen it to beat into another shape not borrowed it but that idea of souls in trees is as old as the world or at least as the world of man and i did mean that there were souls in those dark branches the souls of all those who had perished in misery through the pursuit of riches and that the river was of their blood gathering gradually and flowing out of the valley that i meant the serpents for the souls of those who had lived carelessly and wantonly in their riches and who have all their sins forgiven by the world because they are rich and therefore they have seven crimson crested heads for the seven mortal sins of which they are proud and these and the memory and report of them are the chief causes of temptation to others as showing the pleasantness and absolving power of riches so that thus they are singing serpents and the worms are the souls of the common moneygetters and traffickers who do nothing but eat and spin and who gain habitually by the distress or foolishness of others as you see the butchers have been gaining out of the panic at the cattle plague among the poorso they are made to eat the dark leaves and spin and perish  sibyl and the souls of the great cruel rich people who oppress the poor and lend money to government to make unjust war where are they  l they change into the ice i believe and are knit with the gold and make the grave dust of the valley i believe so at least for no one ever sees those souls anywhere       sibyl ceases questioning  isabel who has crept up to her side without any ones seeing oh sibyl please ask him about the fireflies  l what you there mousie no i wont tell either sibyl or you about the fireflies nor a word more about anything else you ought to be little fireflies yourselves and find your way in twilight by your own wits  isabel but you said they burned you know  l yes and you may be fireflies that way too some of you before long though i did not mean that away with you children you have thought enough for today     note to second edition   sentence out of letter from may who is staying with isabel just now at cassel dated 15th june 1877  i am reading the ethics with a nice irish girl who is staying here and shes just as puzzled as ive always been about the fireflies and we both want to know so muchplease be a very nice old lecturer and tell us wont you  well may you never were a vain girl so could scarcely guess that i meant them for the light unpursued vanities which yet blind us confused among the stars one evening as i came late into siena the fireflies were flying high on a stormy sirocco windthe stars themselves no brighter and all their host seeming at moments to fade as the insects faded     fictionfair and foul   on the first mildor at least the first brightday of march in this year i walked through what was once a country lane between the hostelry of the halfmoon at the bottom of herne hill and the secluded college of dulwich  in my young days croxsted lane was a green byeroad traversable for some distance by carts but rarely so traversed and for the most part little else than a narrow strip of untilled field separated by blackberry hedges from the better caredfor meadows on each side of it growing more weeds therefore than they and perhaps in spring a primrose or twowhite archangeldaisies plenty and purple thistles in autumn a slender rivulet boasting little of its brightness for there are no springs at dulwich yet fed purely enough by the rain and morning dew here trickledthere loiteredthrough the long grass beneath the hedges and expanded itself where it might into moderately clear and deep pools in which under their veils of duckweed a freshwater shell or two sundry curious little skipping shrimps any quantity of tadpoles in their time and even sometimes a tittlebat offered themselves to my boyhoods pleased and not inaccurate observation there my mother and i used to gather the first buds of the hawthorn and there in after years i used to walk in the summer shadows as in a place wilder and sweeter than our garden to think over any passage i wanted to make better than usual in modern painters  so as aforesaid on the first kindly day of this year being thoughtful more than usual of those old times i went to look again at the place  often both in those days and since i have put myself hard to it vainly to find words wherewith to tell of beautiful things but beauty has been in the world since the world was made and human language can make a shift somehow to give account of it whereas the peculiar forces of devastation induced by modern city life have only entered the world lately and no existing terms of language known to me are enough to describe the forms of filth and modes of ruin that varied themselves along the course of croxsted lane the fields on each side of it are now mostly dug up for building or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground by the wild crossings and concurrencies of three railroads half a dozen handfuls of new cottages with doric doors are dropped about here and there among the gashed ground the lane itself now entirely grassless is a deeprutted heavyhillocked cartroad diverging gatelessly into various brickfields or pieces of waste and bordered on each side by heaps ofhades only knows whatmixed dust of every unclean thing that can crumble in drought and mildew of every unclean thing that can rot or rust in damp ashes and rags beerbottles and old shoes battered pans smashed crockery shreds of nameless clothes doorsweepings floorsweepings kitchen garbage backgarden sewage old iron rotten timber jagged with outtorn nails cigarends pipebowls cinders bones and ordure indescribable and variously kneaded into sticking to or fluttering foully here and there over all theseremnants broadcast of every manner of newspaper advertisement or biglettered bill festering and flaunting out their last publicity in the pits of stinking dust and mortal slime  the lane ends now where its prettiest windings once began being cut off by a crossroad leading out of dulwich to a minor railway station and on the other side of this road what was of old the daintiest intricacy of its solitude is changed into a straight and evenly macadamised carriage drive between new houses of extreme respectability with good attached gardens and officesmost of these tenements being largerall more pretentious and many i imagine held at greatly higher rent than my fathers tenanted for twenty years at herne hill and it became matter of curious meditation to me what must here become of children resembling my poor little dreamy quondam self in temper and thus brought up at the same distance from london and in the same or better circumstances of worldly fortune but with only croxsted lane in its present condition for their country walk the trimly kept road before their doors such as one used to see in the fashionable suburbs of cheltenham or leamington presents nothing to their study but gravel and gaslamp posts the modern addition of a vermilion letterpillar contributing indeed to the splendour but scarcely to the interest of the scene and a child of any sense or fancy would hastily contrive escape from such a barren desert of politeness and betake itself to investigation such as might be feasible of the natural history of croxsted lane  but for its sense or fancy what food or stimulus can it find in that foul causeway of its youthful pilgrimage what would have happened to myself so directed i cannot clearly imagine possibly i might have got interested in the old iron and woodshavings and become an engineer or a carpenter but for the children of today accustomed from the instant they are out of their cradles to the sight of this infinite nastiness prevailing as a fixed condition of the universe over the face of nature and accompanying all the operations of industrious man what is to be the scholastic issue unless indeed the thrill of scientific vanity in the primary analysis of some unheardof process of corruptionor the reward of microscopic research in the sight of worms with more legs and acari of more curious generation than ever vivified the more simply smelling plasma of antiquity  one result of such elementary education is however already certain namely that the pleasure which we may conceive taken by the children of the coming time in the analysis of physical corruption guides into fields more dangerous and desolate the expatiation of imaginative literature and that the reactions of moral disease upon itself and the conditions of languidly monstrous character developed in an atmosphere of low vitality have become the most valued material of modern fiction and the most eagerly discussed texts of modern philosophy  the many concurrent reasons for this mischief may i believe be massed under a few general heads  i there is first the hot fermentation and unwholesome secrecy of the population crowded into large cities each mote in the misery lighter as an individual soul than a dead leaf but becoming oppressive and infectious each to his neighbour in the smoking mass of decay the resulting modes of mental ruin and distress are continually new and in a certain sense worth study in their monstrosity they have accordingly developed a corresponding science of fiction concerned mainly with the description of such forms of disease like the botany of leaflichens  in de balzacs story of father goriot a grocer makes a large fortune of which he spends on himself as much as may keep him alive and on his two daughters all that can promote their pleasures or their pride he marries them to men of rank supplies their secret expenses and provides for his favourite a separate and clandestine establishment with her lover on his deathbed he sends for this favourite daughter who wishes to come and hesitates for a quarter of an hour between doing so and going to a ball at which it has been for the last month her chief ambition to be seen she finally goes to the ball  this story is of course one of which the violent contrasts and spectral catastrophe could only take place or be conceived in a large city a village grocer cannot make a large fortune cannot marry his daughters to titled squires and cannot die without having his children brought to him if in the neighbourhood by fear of village gossip if for no better cause  ii but a much more profound feeling than this mere curiosity of science in morbid phenomena is concerned in the production of the carefullest forms of modern fiction the disgrace and grief resulting from the mere trampling pressure and electric friction of town life become to the sufferers peculiarly mysterious in their undeservedness and frightful in their inevitableness the power of all surroundings over them for evil the incapacity of their own minds to refuse the pollution and of their own wills to oppose the weight of the staggering mass that chokes and crushes them into perdition brings every law of healthy existence into question with them and every alleged method of help and hope into doubt indignation without any calming faith in justice and selfcontempt without any curative selfreproach dull the intelligence and degrade the conscience into sullen incredulity of all sunshine outside the dunghill or breeze beyond the wafting of its impurity and at last a philosophy develops itself partly satiric partly consolatory concerned only with the regenerative vigour of manure and the necessary obscurities of fimetic providence showing how everybodys fault is somebody elses how infection has no law digestion no will and profitable dirt no dishonour  and thus an elaborate and ingenious scholasticism in what may be called the divinity of decomposition has established itself in connection with the more recent forms of romance giving them at once a complacent tone of clerical dignity and an agreeable dash of heretical impudence while the inculcated doctrine has the double advantage of needing no laborious scholarship for its foundation and no painful selfdenial for its practice  iii the monotony of life in the central streets of any great modern city but especially in those of london where every emotion intended to be derived by men from the sight of nature or the sense of art is forbidden for ever leaves the craving of the heart for a sincere yet changeful interest to be fed from one source only under natural conditions the degree of mental excitement necessary to bodily health is provided by the course of the seasons and the various skill and fortune of agriculture in the country every morning of the year brings with it a new aspect of springing or fading nature a new duty to be fulfilled upon earth and a new promise or warning in heaven no day is without its innocent hope its special prudence its kindly gift and its sublime danger and in every process of wise husbandry and every effort of contending or remedial courage the wholesome passions pride and bodily power of the labourer are excited and exerted in happiest unison the companionship of domestic the care of serviceable animals soften and enlarge his life with lowly charities and discipline him in familiar wisdoms and unboastful fortitudes while the divine laws of seedtime which cannot be recalled harvest which cannot be hastened and winter in which no man can work compel the impatiences and coveting of his heart into labour too submissive to be anxious and rest too sweet to be wanton what thought can enough comprehend the contrast between such life and that in streets where summer and winter are only alternations of heat and cold where snow never fell white nor sunshine clear where the ground is only a pavement and the sky no more than the glass roof of an arcade where the utmost power of a storm is to choke the gutters and the finest magic of spring to change mud into dust wherechief and most fatal difference in state there is no interest of occupation for any of the inhabitants but the routine of counter or desk within doors and the effort to pass each other without collision outside so that from morning to evening the only possible variation of the monotony of the hours and lightening of the penalty of existence must be some kind of mischief limited unless by more than ordinary godsend of fatality to the fall of a horse or the slitting of a pocket  i said that under these laws of inanition the craving of the human heart for some kind of excitement could be supplied from one source only it might have been thought by any other than a sternly tentative philosopher that the denial of their natural food to human feelings would have provoked a reactionary desire for it and that the dreariness of the street would have been gilded by dreams of pastoral felicity experience has shown the fact to be otherwise the thoroughly trained londoner can enjoy no other excitement than that to which he has been accustomed but asks for that in continually more ardent or more virulent concentration and the ultimate power of fiction to entertain him is by varying to his fancy the modes and defining for his dulness the horrors of death in the single novel of bleak house there are nine deaths or left for deaths in the drop scene carefully wrought out or led up to either by way of pleasing surprise as the babys at the brickmakers or finished in their threatenings and sufferings with as much enjoyment as can be contrived in the anticipation and as much pathology as can be concentrated in the description under the following varieties of method      one by assassination                  mr tulkinghorn     one by starvation with phthisis      joe     one by chagrin                        richard     one by spontaneous combustion         mr krook     one by sorrow                         lady dedlocks lover     one by remorse                        lady dedlock     one by insanity                       miss flite     one by paralysis                      sir leicester  besides the baby by fever and a lively young frenchwoman left to be hanged  and all this observe not in a tragic adventurous or military story but merely as the further enlivenment of a narrative intended to be amusing and as a properly representative average of the statistics of civilian mortality in the centre of london  observe further and chiefly it is not the mere number of deaths which if we count the odd troopers in the last scene is exceeded in old mortality and reached within one or two both in waverley and guy mannering that marks the peculiar tone of the modern novel it is the fact that all these deaths but one are of inoffensive or at least in the worlds estimate respectable persons and that they are all grotesquely either violent or miserable purporting thus to illustrate the modern theology that the appointed destiny of a large average of our population is to die like rats in a drain either by trap or poison not indeed that a lawyer in full practice can be usually supposed as faultless in the eye of heaven as a dove or a woodcock but it is not in former divinities thought the will of providence that he should be dropped by a shot from a client behind his firescreen and retrieved in the morning by his housemaid under the chandelier neither is lady dedlock less reprehensible in her conduct than many women of fashion have been and will be but it would not therefore have been thought poetically just in oldfashioned morality that she should be found by her daughter lying dead with her face in the mud of a st giless churchyard  in the work of the great masters death is always either heroic deserved or quiet and natural unless their purpose be totally and deeply tragic when collateral meaner death is permitted like that of polonius or roderigo in old mortality four of the deaths bothwells ensign grahames macbriars and evandales are magnificently heroic burleys and oliphants long deserved and swift the troopers met in the discharge of their military duty and the old misers as gentle as the

unpremeditated of a single person himself not entirely innocent but at least by heartlessness in a cruel function earning his fate is avenged to the uttermost on all the men conscious of the crime mr bertrams death like that of his wife brief in pain and each told in the space of halfadozen lines and that of the heroine of the tale selfdevoted heroic in the highest and happy  nor is it ever to be forgotten in the comparison of scotts with inferior work that his own splendid powers were even in early life tainted and in his latter years destroyed by modern conditions of commercial excitement then first but rapidly developing themselves there are parts even in his best novels coloured to meet tastes which he despised and many pages written in his later ones to lengthen his article for the indiscriminate market  but there was one weakness of which his healthy mind remained incapable to the last in modern stories prepared for more refined or fastidious audiences than those of dickens the funereal excitement is obtained for the most part not by the infliction of violent or disgusting death but in the suspense the pathos and the more or less by all felt and recognised mortal phenomena of the sickroom the temptation to weak writers of this order of subject is especially great because the study of it from the livingor dyingmodel is so easy and to many has been the most impressive part of their own personal experience while if the description be given even with mediocre accuracy a very large section of readers will admire its truth and cherish its melancholy few authors of second or third rate genius can either record or invent a probable conversation in ordinary life but few on the other hand are so destitute of observant faculty as to be unable to chronicle the broken syllables and languid movements of an invalid the easily rendered and too surely recognised image of familiar suffering is felt at once to be real where all else had been false and the historian of the gestures of fever and words of delirium can count on the applause of a gratified audience as surely as the dramatist who introduces on the stage of his flagging action a carriage that can be driven or a fountain that will flow but the masters of strong imagination disdain such work and those of deep sensibility shrink from it154 only under conditions of personal weakness presently to be noted would scott comply with the cravings of his lower audience in scenes of terror like the death of frontdeboeuf but he never once withdrew the sacred curtain of the sickchamber nor permitted the disgrace of wanton tears round the humiliation of strength or the wreck of beauty  iv no exception to this law of reverence will be found in the scenes in coeur de lions illness introductory to the principal incident in the talisman an inferior writer would have made the king charge in imagination at the head of his chivalry or wander in dreams by the brooks of aquitaine but scott allows us to learn no more startling symptoms of the kings malady than that he was restless and impatient and could not wear his armour nor is any bodily weakness or crisis of danger permitted to disturb for an instant the royalty of intelligence and heart in which he examines trusts and obeys the physician whom his attendants fear  yet the choice of the main subject in this story and its companionthe trial to a point of utter torture of knightly faith and several passages in the conduct of both more especially the exaggerated scenes in the house of baldringham and hermitage of engedi are signs of the gradual decline in force of intellect and soul which those who love scott best have done him the worst injustice in their endeavours to disguise or deny the mean anxieties moral humiliations and mercilessly demanded braintoil which killed him show their sepulchral grasp for many and many a year before their final victory and the states of more or less dulled distorted and polluted imagination which culminate in castle dangerous cast a stygian hue over st ronans well the fair maid of perth and anne of geierstein which lowers them the first altogether the other two at frequent intervals into fellowship with the normal disease which festers throughout the whole body of our lower fictitious literature  fictitious i use the ambiguous word deliberately for it is impossible to distinguish in these tales of the prisonhouse how far their vice and gloom are thrown into their manufacture only to meet a vile demand and how far they are an integral condition of thought in the minds of men trained from their youth up in the knowledge of londinian and parisian misery the speciality of the plague is a delight in the exposition of the relations between guilt and decrepitude and i call the results of it literature of the prisonhouse because the thwarted habits of body and mind which are the punishment of reckless crowding in cities become in the issue of that punishment frightful subjects of exclusive interest to themselves and the art of fiction in which they finally delight is only the more studied arrangement and illustration by coloured firelights of the daily bulletins of their own wretchedness in the prison calendar the police news and the hospital report  the reader will perhaps be surprised at my separating the greatest work of dickens oliver twist with honour from the loathsome mass to which it typically belongs that book is an earnest and uncaricatured record of states of criminal life written with didactic purpose full of the gravest instruction nor destitute of pathetic studies of noble passion even the mysteries of paris and gaboriaus crime daugival are raised by their definiteness of historical intention and forewarning anxiety far above the level of their order and may be accepted as photographic evidence of an otherwise incredible civilisation corrupted in the infernal fact of it down to the genesis of such figures as the vicomte daugival the stabber155 the skeleton and the shewolf but the effectual head of the whole cretinous school is the renowned novel in which the hunchbacked lover watches the execution of his mistress from the tower of notredame and its strength passes gradually away into the anatomical preparations for the general market of novels like poor miss finch in which the heroine is blind the hero epileptic and the obnoxious brother is found dead with his hands dropped off in the arctic regions156  this literature of the prisonhouse understanding by the word not only the cell of newgate but also and even more definitely the cell of the h√¥teldieu the h√¥pital des fous and the grated corridor with the dripping slabs of the morgue having its central root thus in the ile de parisor historically and preeminently the cit√© de parisis when understood deeply the precise countercorruption of the religion of the sainte chapelle just as the worst forms of bodily and mental ruin are the corruption of love i have therefore called it fiction m√©croyante with literal accuracy and precision according to the explanation of the word which the reader may find in any good french dictionary157 and round its arctic pole in the morgue he may gather into one caina of gelid putrescence the entire product of modern infidel imagination amusing itself with destruction of the body and busying itself with aberration of the mind  aberration palsy or plague observe as distinguished from normal evil just as the venom of rabies or cholera differs from that of a wasp or a viper the life of the insect and serpent deserves or at least permits our thoughts not so the stages of agony in the furydriven hound there is some excuse indeed for the pathologic labour of the modern novelist in the fact that he cannot easily in a city population find a healthy mind to vivisect but the greater part of such amateur surgery is the struggle in an epoch of wild literary competition to obtain novelty of material the varieties of aspect and colour in healthy fruit be it sweet or sour may be within certain limits described exhaustively not so the blotches of its conceivable blight and while the symmetries of integral human character can only be traced by harmonious and tender skill like the branches of a living tree the faults and gaps of one gnawed away by corroding accident can be shuffled into senseless change like the wards of a chubb lock  v it is needless to insist on the vast field for this dicecast or carddealt calamity which opens itself in the ignorance moneyinterest and mean passion of city marriage peasants know each other as childrenmeet as they grow up in testing labour and if a stout farmers son marries a handless girl it is his own fault also in the patrician families of the field the young people know what they are doing and marry a neighbouring estate or a covetable title with some conception of the responsibilities they undertake but even among these their season in the confused metropolis creates licentious and fortuitous temptation before unknown and in the lower middle orders an entirely new kingdom of discomfort and disgrace has been preached to them in the doctrines of unbridled pleasure which are merely an apology for their peculiar forms of illbreeding it is quite curious how often the catastrophe or the leading interest of a modern novel turns upon the want both in maid and bachelor of the common selfcommand which was taught to their grandmothers and grandfathers as the first element of ordinarily decent behaviour rashly inquiring the other day the plot of a modern story from a female friend i elicited after some hesitation that it hinged mainly on the young peoples forgetting themselves in a boat and i perceive it to be accepted as nearly an axiom in the code of modern civic chivalry that the strength of amiable sentiment is proved by our incapacity on proper occasions to express and on improper ones to control it the pride of a gentleman of the old school used to be in his power of saying what he meant and being silent when he ought not to speak of the higher nobleness which bestowed love where it was honourable and reverence where it was due but the automatic amours and involuntary proposals of recent romance acknowledge little further law of morality than the instinct of an insect or the effervescence of a chemical mixture  there is a pretty little story of alfred de mussetsla mouche which if the reader cares to glance at it will save me further trouble in explaining the disciplinarian authority of mere oldfashioned politeness as in some sort protective of higher things it describes with much grace and precision a state of society by no means preeminently virtuous or enthusiastically heroic in which many people do extremely wrong and none sublimely right but as there are heights of which the achievement is unattempted there are abysses to which fall is barred neither accident nor temptation will make any of the principal personages swerve from an adopted resolution or violate an accepted principle of honour people are expected as a matter of course to speak with propriety on occasion and to wait with patience when they are bid those who do wrong admit it those who do right dont boast of it everybody knows his own mind and everybody has good manners  nor must it be forgotten that in the worst days of the selfindulgence which destroyed the aristocracies of europe their vices however licentious were never in the fatal modern sense unprincipled the vainest believed in virtue the vilest respected it chaque chose avait son nom158 and the severest of english moralists recognises the accurate wit the lofty intellect and the unfretted benevolence which redeemed from vitiated surroundings the circle of dalembert and marmontel159  i have said with too slight praise that the vainest in those days believed in virtue beautiful and heroic examples of it were always before them nor was it without the secret significance attaching to what may seem the least accidents in the work of a master that scott gave to both his heroines of the age of revolution in england the name of the queen of the highest order of english chivalry160  it is to say little for the types of youth and maid which alone scott felt it a joy to imagine or thought it honourable to portray that they act and feel in a sphere where they are never for an instant liable to any of the weaknesses which disturb the calm or shake the resolution of chastity and courage in a modern novel scott lived in a country and time when from highest to lowest but chiefly in that dignified and nobly severe161 middle class to which he himself belonged a habit of serene and stainless thought was as natural to the people as their mountain air women like rose bradwardine and ailie dinmont were the grace and guard of almost every household god be praised that the race of them is not yet extinct for all that mall or boulevard can do and it has perhaps escaped the notice of even attentive readers that the comparatively uninteresting character of sir walters heroes had always been studied among a class of youths who were simply incapable of doing anything seriously wrong and could only be embarrassed by the consequences of their levity or imprudence  but there is another difference in the woof of a waverley novel from the cobweb of a modern one which depends on scotts larger view of human life marriage is by no means in his conception of man and woman the most important business of their existence162 nor love the only reward to be proposed to their virtue or exertion it is not in his reading of the laws of providence a necessity that virtue should either by love or any other external blessing be rewarded at all163 and marriage is in all cases thought of as a constituent of the happiness of life but not as its only interest still less its only aim and upon analysing with some care the motives of his principal stories we shall often find that the love in them is merely a light by which the sterner features of character are to be irradiated and that the marriage of the hero is as subordinate to the main bent of the story as henry the fifths courtship of katherine is to the battle of agincourt nay the fortunes of the person who is nominally the subject of the tale are often little more than a background on which grander figures are to be drawn and deeper fates forthshadowed the judgments between the faith and chivalry of scotland at drumclog and bothwell bridge owe little of their interest in the mind of a sensible reader to the fact that the captain of the popinjay is carried a prisoner to one battle and returns a prisoner from the other and scott himself while he watches the white sail that bears queen mary for the last time from her native land very nearly forgets to finish his novel or to tell usand with small sense of any consolation to be had out of that minor circumstancethat roland and catherine were united spite of their differing faiths  neither let it be thought for an instant that the slight and sometimes scornful glance with which scott passes over scenes which a novelist of our own day would have analysed with the airs of a philosopher and painted with the curiosity of a gossip indicate any absence in his heart of sympathy with the great and sacred elements of personal happiness an era like ours which has with diligence and ostentation swept its heart clear of all the passions once known as loyalty patriotism and piety necessarily magnifies the apparent force of the one remaining sentiment which sighs through the barren chambers or clings inextricably round the chasms of ruin nor can it but regard with awe the unconquerable spirit which still tempts or betrays the sagacities of selfishness into error or frenzy which is believed to be love  that scott was never himself in the sense of the phrase as employed by lovers of the parisian school ivre damour may be admitted without prejudice to his sensibility164 and that he never knew lamor che move l sol e laltre stelle was the chief though unrecognised calamity of his deeply chequered life but the reader of honour and feeling will not therefore suppose that the love which miss vernon sacrifices stooping for an instant from her horse is of less noble stamp or less enduring faith than that which troubles and degrades the whole existence of consuelo or that the affection of jeanie deans for the companion of her childhood drawn like a field of soft blue heaven beyond the cloudy wrack of her sorrow is less fully in possession of her soul than the hesitating and selfreproachful impulses under which a modern heroine forgets herself in a boat or compromises herself in the cool of the evening  i do not wish to return over the waste ground we have traversed comparing point by point scotts manner with those of bermondsey and the faubourgs but it may be perhaps interesting at this moment to examine with illustration from those waverley novels which have so lately retracted the attention of a fair and gentle public the universal conditions of style rightly so called which are in all ages and above all local currents or wavering tides of temporary manners pillars of what is for ever strong and models of what is for ever fair  but i must first define and that within strict horizon the works of scott in which his perfect mind may be known and his chosen ways understood  his great works of prose fiction excepting only the first halfvolume of waverley were all written in twelve years 181426 of his own age fortythree to fiftyfive the actual time employed in their composition being not more than a couple of months out of each year and during that time only the morning hours and spare minutes during the professional day though the first volume of waverley was begun long ago and actually lost for a time yet the other two were begun and finished between the 4th of june and the first of july during all which i attended my duty in court and proceeded without loss of time or hindrance of business165  few of the maxims for the enforcement of which in modern painters long ago i got the general character of a lover of paradox are more singular or more sure than the statement apparently so encouraging to the idle that if a great thing can be done at all it can be done easily but it is in that kind of ease with which a tree blossoms after long years of gathered strength and all scotts great writings were the recreations of a mind confirmed in dutiful labour and rich with organic gathering of boundless resource  omitting from our count the two minor and illfinished sketches of the black dwarf and legend of montrose and for a reason presently to be noticed the unhappy st ronans the memorable romances of scott are eighteen falling into three distinct groups containing six each  the first group is distinguished from the other two by characters of strength and felicity which never more appeared after scott was struck down by his terrific illness in 1819 it includes waverley guy mannering the antiquary rob roy old mortality and the heart of midlothian  the composition of these occupied the mornings of his happiest days between the ages of 43 and 48 on the 8th of april 1819 he was 48 on the preceding 15th of august he began for the first time to dictatebeing unable for the exertion of writingthe bride of lammermuir the affectionate laidlaw beseeching him to stop dictating when his audible suffering filled every pause nay willie he answered only see that the doors are fast i would fain keep all the cry as well as all the wool to ourselves but as for giving over work that can only be when i am in woollen166 from this time forward the brightness of joy and sincerity of inevitable humour which perfected the imagery of the earlier novels are wholly absent except in the two short intervals of health unaccountably restored in which he wrote redgauntlet and nigel  it is strange but only a part of the general simplicity of scotts genius that these revivals of earlier power were unconscious and that the time of extreme weakness in which he wrote st ronans well was that in which he first asserted his own restoration  it is also a deeply interesting characteristic of his noble nature that he never gains anything by sickness the whole man breathes or faints as one creature the ache that stiffens a limb chills his heart and every pang of the stomach paralyses the brain it is not so with inferior minds in the workings of which it is often impossible to distinguish native from narcotic fancy and throbs of conscience from those of indigestion whether in exaltation or languor the colours of mind are always morbid which gleam on the sea for the ancient mariner and through the casements on st agnes eve but scott is at once blinded and stultified by sickness never has a fit of the cramp without spoiling a chapter and is perhaps the only author of vivid imagination who never wrote a foolish word but when he was ill  it remains only to be noticed on this point that any strong natural excitement affecting the deeper springs of his heart would at once restore his intellectual powers in all their fullness and that far towards their sunset but that the strong will on which he prided himself though it could trample upon pain silence grief and compel industry never could warm his imagination or clear the judgment in his darker hours  i believe that this power of the heart over the intellect is common to all great men but what the special character of emotion was that alone could lift scott above the power of death i am about to ask the reader in a little while to observe with joyful care  the first series of romances then above named are all that exhibit the emphasis of his unharmed faculties the second group composed in the three years subsequent to illness all but mortal bear every one of them more or less the seal of it  they consist of the bride of lammermuir ivanhoe the monastery the abbot kenilworth and the pirate167 the marks of broken health on all these are essentially twofoldprevailing melancholy and fantastic improbability three of the tales are agonizingly tragic the abbot scarcely less so in its main event and ivanhoe deeply wounded through all its bright panoply while even in that most powerful of the series the impossible archeries and axestrokes the incredibly opportune appearances of locksley the death of ulrica and the resuscitation of athelstane are partly boyish partly feverish caleb in the bride triptolemus and halcro in the pirate are all laborious and the first incongruous half a volume of the abbot is spent in extremely dull detail of rolands relations with his fellowservants and his mistress which have nothing whatever to do with the future story and the lady of avenel herself disappears after the first volume like a snaw wreath when its thaw jeanie the public has for itself pronounced on the monastery though as much too harshly as it has foolishly praised the horrors of ravenswood and the nonsense of ivanhoe because the modern public finds in the torture and adventure of these the kind of excitement which it seeks at an opera while it has no sympathy whatever with the pastoral happiness of glendearg or with the lingering simplicities of superstition which give historical likelihood to the legend of the white lady  but both this despised tale and its sequel have scotts heart in them the first was begun to refresh himself in the intervals of artificial labour on ivanhoe it was a relief he said to interlay the scenery most familiar to me168 with the strange world for which i had to draw so much on imagination169 through all the closing scenes of the second he is raised to his own true level by his love for the queen and within the code of scotts work to which i am about to appeal for illustration of his essential powers i accept the monastery and abbot and reject from it the remaining four of this group  the last series contains two quite noble ones redgauntlet and nigel two of very high value durward and woodstock the slovenly and diffuse peveril written for the trade the sickly tales of the crusaders and the entirely broken and diseased st ronans well this last i throw out of count altogether and of the rest accept only the four first named as sound work so that the list of the novels in which i propose to examine his methods and ideal standards reduces itself to these following twelve named in order of production waverley guy mannering the antiquary rob roy old mortality the heart of midlothian the monastery the abbot the fortunes of nigel quentin durward and woodstock170  it is however too late to enter on my subject in this article which i may fitly close by pointing out some of the merely verbal characteristics of his style illustrative in little ways of the questions we have been examining and chiefly of the one which may be most embarrassing to many readers the difference namely between character and disease  one quite distinctive charm in the waverleys is their modified use of the scottish dialect but it has not generally been observed either by their imitators or the authors of different taste who have written for a later public that there is a difference between the dialect of a language and its corruption  a dialect is formed in any district where there are persons of intelligence enough to use the language itself in all its fineness and force but under the particular conditions of life climate and temper which introduce words peculiar to the scenery forms of word and idioms of sentence peculiar to the race and pronunciations indicative of their character and disposition  thus burn of a streamlet is a word possible only in a country where there are brightly running waters lassie a word possible only where girls are as free as the rivulets and auld a form of the southern old adopted by a race of finer musical ear than the english  on the contrary mere deteriorations or coarse stridulent and in the ordinary sense of the phrase broad forms of utterance are not dialects at all having nothing dialectic in them and all phrases developed in states of rude employment and restricted intercourse are injurious to the tone and narrowing to the power of the language they affect mere breadth of accent does not spoil a dialect as long as the speakers are men of varied idea and good intelligence but the moment the life is contracted by mining millwork or any oppressive and monotonous labour the accents and phrases become debased it is part of the popular folly of the day to find pleasure in trying to write and spell these abortive crippled and more or less brutal forms of human speech  abortive crippled or brutal are however not necessarily corrupted dialects corrupt language is that gathered by ignorance invented by vice misused by insensibility or minced and mouthed by affectation especially in the attempt to deal with words of which only half the meaning is understood or half the sound heard mrs gamps aperiently soand the undermined with primal sense of undermine ofi forget which gossip in the mill on the floss are master and mistresspieces in this latter kind mrs malaprops allegories on the banks of the nile are in a somewhat higher order of mistake miss tabitha brambles ignorance is vulgarised by her selfishness and winifred jenkins by her conceit the wot of noah claypole and the other degradations of cockneyism sam weller and his father are in nothing more admirable than in the power of heart and sense that can purify even these the trewth of mr chadband and natur of mr squeers are examples of the corruption of words by insensibility the use of the word bloody in modern low english is a deeper corruption not altering the form of the word but defiling the thought in it  thus much being understood i shall proceed to examine thoroughly a fragment of scotts lowland scottish dialect not choosing it of the most beautiful kind on the contrary it shall be a piece reaching as low down as he ever allows scotch to goit is perhaps the only unfair patriotism in him that if ever he wants a word or two of really villainous slang he gives it in english or dutchnot scotch  i had intended in the close of this paper to analyse and compare the characters of andrew fairservice and richie moniplies for examples the former of innate evil unaffected by external influences and undiseased but distinct from natural goodness as a nettle is distinct from balm or lavender and the latter of innate goodness contracted and pinched by circumstance but still undiseased as an oakleaf crisped by frost not by the worm this with much else in my mind i must put off but the careful study of one sentence of andrews will give us a good deal to think of  i take his account of the rescue of glasgow cathedral at the time of the reformation       ah its a brave kirknane o yere whigmaleeries and      curliewurlies and opensteek hems about ita solid      weeljointed masonwark that will stand as lang

    warrant and flung into the molendinar burn and the auld      kirk stood as crouse as a cat when the flaes are kaimed aff      her and abody was alike pleased and i hae heard wise folk      say that if the same had been done in ilka kirk in      scotland the reform wad just hae been as pure as it is een      now and we wad hae mair christianlike kirks for i hae      been sae lang in england that naething will drived out o      my head that the dogkennel at osbaldistonehall is better      than mony a house o god in scotland  now this sentence is in the first place a piece of scottish history of quite inestimable and concentrated value andrews temperament is the type of a vast class of scottishshall we call it sowthistlianmind which necessarily takes the view of either pope or saint that the thistle in lebanon took of the cedar or lilies in lebanon and the entire force of the passions which in the scottish revolution foretold and forearmed the french one is told in this one paragraph the coarseness of it observe being admitted not for the sake of the laugh any more than an onion in broth merely for its flavour but for the meat of it the inherent constancy of that coarseness being a fact in this order of mind and an essential part of the history to be told  secondly observe that this speech in the religious passion of it such as there may be is entirely sincere andrew is a thief a liar a coward and in the fair service from which he takes his name a hypocrite but in the form of prejudice which is all that his mind is capable of in the place of religion he is entirely sincere he does not in the least pretend detestation of image worship to please his master or any one else he honestly scorns the carnal morality171 as dowd and fusionless as rueleaves at yule of the sermon in the upper cathedral and when wrapt in critical attention to the real savour o doctrine in the crypt so completely forgets the hypocrisy of his fair service as to return his masters attempt to disturb him with hard punches of the elbow  thirdly he is a man of no mean sagacity quite up to the average standard of scottish common sense not a low one and though incapable of understanding any manner of lofty thought or passion is a shrewd measurer of weaknesses and not without a spark or two of kindly feeling see first his sketch of his masters character to mr hammorgaw beginning hes no athegither sae void o sense neither and then the close of the dialogue but the lads no a bad lad after a and he needs some carefu body to look after him  fourthly he is a good workman knows his own business well and can judge of other craft if sound or otherwise  all these four qualities of him must be known before we can understand this single speech keeping them in mind i take it up word by word  you observe in the outset scott makes no attempt whatever to indicate accents or modes of pronunciation by changed spelling unless the word becomes a quite definitely new and scarcely writeable one the scottish way of pronouncing james for instance is entirely peculiar and extremely pleasant to the ear but it is so just because it does not change the word into jeems nor into jims nor into jawms a modern writer of dialects would think it amusing to use one or other of these ugly spellings but scott writes the name in pure english knowing that a scots reader will speak it rightly and an english one be wise in letting it alone on the other hand he writes weel for well because that word is complete in its change and may be very closely expressed by the double e the ambiguous us in gude and sune are admitted because far liker the sound than the double o would be and that in hure for grace sake to soften the wordso also flaes for fleas mony for many is again positively right in sound and neuk differs from our nook in sense and is not the same word at all as we shall presently see  secondly observe not a word is corrupted in any indecent haste slowness slovenliness or incapacity of pronunciation there is no lisping drawling slobbering or snuffling the speech is as clear as a bell and as keen as an arrow and its elisions and contractions are either melodious na for notpud for pulled or as normal as in a latin verse the long words are delivered without the slightest bungling and bigging finished to its last g  i take the important words now in their places  brave the old english sense of the word in to go brave retained expressing andrews sincere and respectful admiration had he meant to insinuate a hint of the churchs being too fine he would have said braw  kirk this is of course just as pure and unprovincial a word as kirche or √©glise  whigmaleerie i cannot get at the root of this word but it is one showing that the speaker is not bound by classic rules but will use any syllables that enrich his meaning nippertytipperty of his masters poetrynonsense is another word of the same class curlieurlie is of course just as pure as shakespeares hurlyburly but see first suggestion of the idea to scott at blairadam l vi 264  opensteek hems more description or better of the later gothic cannot be put into four syllables steek melodious for stitch has a combined sense of closing or fastening and note that the later gothic being precisely what scott knew best in melrose and liked best it is here as elsewhere quite as much himself172 as frank that he is laughing at when he laughs with andrew whose opensteek hems are only a ruder metaphor for his own willowwreaths changed to stone  gunpowther ther is a lingering vestige of the french dre  syne one of the melodious and mysterious scottish words which have partly the sound of wind and stream in them and partly the range of softened idea which is like a distance of blue hills over border land far in the distant cheviots blue perhaps even the least sympathetic englisher might recognise this if he heard old long since vocally substituted for the scottish words to the air i do not know the root but the words proper meaning is not since but before or after an interval of some duration as weel sune as syne but first on sawnie gies a ca syne bauldly in she enters  behoved to come a rich word with peculiar idiom always used more or less ironically of anything done under a partly mistaken and partly pretended notion of duty  siccan far prettier and fuller in meaning than such it contains an added sense of wonder and means properly so great or so unusual  took o drum classical tuck from italian toccata the preluding touch or flourish on any instrument but see johnson under word tucket quoting othello the deeper scottish vowels are used here to mark the deeper sound of the bass drum as in more solemn warning  bigging the only word in all the sentence of which the scottish form is less melodious than the english and what for no seeing that scottish architecture is mostly little beyond bessie bells and mary grays they biggit a bowre by yon burnside and theekit it owre wi rashes but it is pure anglosaxon in roots see glossary to fairbairns edition of the douglas virgil 1710  coup another of the muchembracing words short for upset but with a sense of

actually the local name173 or scotts invention compare sir piercies molinaras but at all events used here with byesense of degradation of the formerly idle saints to grind at the mill  crouse courageous softened with a sense of comfort  ilka again a word with azure distance including the whole sense of each and every the reader must carefully and reverently distinguish these comprehensive words which gather two or more perfectly understood meanings into one chord of meaning and are harmonies more than words from the abovenoted blunders between two halfhit meanings struck as a bad pianoplayer strikes the edge of another note in english we have fewer of these combined thoughts so that shakespeare rather plays with the distinct lights of his words than melts them into one so again bishop douglas spells and doubtless spoke the word rose differently according to his purpose if as the chief or governing ruler of flowers rois but if only in her own beauty rose  christianlike the sense of the decency and order proper to christianity is stronger in scotland than in any other country and the word christian more distinctly opposed to beast hence the backhanded cut at the english for their overpious care of dogs  i am a little surprised myself at the length to which this examination of one small piece of sir walters firstrate work has carried us but here i must end for this time trusting if the editor of the nineteenth century permit me yet to trespass perhaps more than once on his readers patience but at all events to examine in a following paper the technical characteristics of scotts own style both in prose and verse together with byrons as opposed to our fashionably recent dialects and rhythms the essential virtues of language in both the masters of the old school hinging ultimately little as it might be thought on certain unalterable views of theirs concerning the code called of the ten commandments wholly at variance with the dogmas of automatic morality which summed again by the witches line fair is foul and foul is fair hover through the fog and filthy air of our prosperous england      john ruskin                                       he hated greetings in the marketplace and there were generally loiterers in the streets to persecute him either about the events of the day or about some petty pieces of business  these lines which the reader will find near the beginning of the sixteenth chapter of the first volume of the antiquary contain two indications of the old mans character which receiving the ideal of him as a portrait of scott himself are of extreme interest to me they mean essentially that neither monkbarns nor scott had any mind to be called of men rabbi in mere hearing of the mob and especially that they hated to be drawn back out of their faraway thoughts or forward out of their longago thoughts by any manner of daily news whether printed or gabbled of which two vital characteristics deeper in both the men for i must always speak of scotts creations as if they were as real as himself than any of their superficial vanities or passing enthusiasms i have to speak more at another time i quote the passage just now because there was one piece of the daily news of the year 1815 which did extremely interest scott and materially direct the labour of the latter part of his life nor is there any piece of history in this whole nineteenth century quite so pregnant with various instruction as the study of the reasons which influenced scott and byron in their opposite views of the glories of the battle of waterloo  but i quote it for another reason also the principal greeting which mr oldbuck on this occasion receives in the marketplace being compared with the speech of andrew fairservice examined in my first paper will furnish me with the text of what i have mainly to say in the present one  mr oldbuck said the townclerk a more important person who came in front and ventured to stop the old gentleman the provost understanding you were in town begs on no account that youll quit it without seeing him he wants to speak to ye about bringing the water frae the fairwell spring through a part o your lands  what the deucehave they nobodys land but mine to cut and carve oni wont consent tell them  and the provost said the clerk going on without noticing the rebuff and the council wad be agreeable that you should hae the auld stanes at donagilds chapel that ye was wussing to hae  ehwhatoho thats another storywell well ill call upon the provost and well talk about it  but ye maun speak your mind ont forthwith monkbarns if ye want the stanes for deacon harlewalls thinks the carved throughstanes might be put with advantage on the front of the new councilhousethat is the twa crosslegged figures that the callants used to ca robbin and bobbin ane on ilka doorcheek and the other stane that they cad ailie dailie abune the door it will be very tastefu the deacon says and just in the style of modern gothic  good lord deliver me from this gothic generation exclaimed the antiquarya monument of a knighttemplar on each side of a grecian porch and a madonna on the top of ito criminiwell tell the provost i wish to have the stones and well not differ about the watercourseits lucky i happened to come this way today  they parted mutually satisfied but the wily clerk had most reason to exult in the dexterity he had displayed since the whole proposal of an exchange between the monuments which the council had determined to remove as a nuisance because they encroached three feet upon the public road and the privilege of conveying the water to the burgh through the estate of monkbarns was an idea which had originated with himself upon the pressure of the moment  in this single page of scott will the reader please note the kind of prophetic instinct with which the great men of every age mark and forecast its destinies the water from the fairwell is the future thirlmere carried to manchester the auld stanes174 at donagilds chapel removed as a nuisance foretell the necessary view taken by modern cockneyism liberalism and progress of all things that remind them of the noble dead of their fathers fame or of their own duty and the public road becomes their idol instead of the saints shrine finally the roguery of the entire transactionthe mean man seeing the weakness of the honourable and besting himin modern slang in the manner and at the pace of modern tradeon the pressure of the moment  but neither are these things what i have at present quoted the passage for  i quote it that we may consider how much wonderful and various history is gathered in the fact recorded for us in this piece of entirely fair fiction that in the scottish borough of fairport montrose really in the year 17 of christ the knowledge given by the pastors and teachers provided for its children by enlightened scottish protestantism of their fathers history and the origin of their religion had resulted in this substance and sumthat the statues of two crusading knights had become to their children robin and bobbin and the statue of the madonna ailie dailie  a marvellous piece of history truly and far too comprehensive for general comment here only one small piece of it i must carry forward the readers thoughts upon  the pastors and teachers aforesaid represented typically in another part of this errorless book by mr blattergowl are not whatever else they may have to answer for answerable for these names the names are of the childrens own choosing and bestowing but not of the childrens own inventing robin is a classically endearing cognomen recording the errant heroism of old daysthe name of the bruce and of rob roy bobbin is a poetical and symmetrical fulfilment and adornment of the original phrase ailie is the last echo of ave changed into the softest scottish christian name familiar to the children itself the beautiful feminine form of royal louis the dailie again symmetrically added for kinder and more musical endearment the last vestiges you see of honour for the heroism and religion of their ancestors lingering on the lips of babes and sucklings  but what is the meaning of this necessity the children find themselves under of completing the nomenclature rhythmically and rhymingly note first the difference carefully and the attainment of both qualities by the couplets in question rhythm is the syllabic and quantitative measure of the words in which robin both in weight and time balances bobbin and dailie holds level scale with ailie but rhyme is the added correspondence of sound unknown and undesired so far as we can learn by the greek orpheus but absolutely essential to and as special virtue becoming titular of the scottish thomas  the ryme175 you may at first fancy is the especially childish part of the work not so it is the especially chivalric and christian part of it it characterises the christian chant or canticle as a higher thing than a greek ode melos or hymnos or than a latin carmen  think of it for this again is wonderful that these children of montrose should have an element of music in their souls which homer had notwhich a melos of david the prophet and king had notwhich orpheus and amphion had notwhich apollos unrymed oracles became mute at the sound of  a strange new equity thismelodious justice and judgment as it werein all words spoken solemnly and ritualistically by christian human creaturesrobin and bobbinby the crusaders tomb up to dies ir√¶ dies illa at judgment of the crusading soul  you have to understand this most deeply of all christian minstrels from first to last that they are more musical because more joyful than any others on earth ethereal minstrels pilgrims of the sky true to the kindred points of heaven and home their joy essentially the skylarks in light in purity but with their human eyes looking for the glorious appearing of something in the sky which the bird cannot  this it is that changes etruscan murmur into terza rimahoratian latin into proven√ßal troubadours melody not because less artful less wise  here is a little bit for instance of french ryming just before chaucers timenear enough to our own french to be intelligible to us yet      o quant tr√®sglorieuse vie     quant cil quit out peut et maistrie     veult esprouver pour n√©cessaire     ne pour quant il ne blasma mie     la vie de marthe sa mie     mais il lui donna exemplaire     dautrement vivre et de bien plaire     a dieu et plut de bien √† faire     pour se

belle     qui j√† ne luy sera ost√©e     car par v√©rit√© se fut celle     qui fut tousjours fresche et nouvelle     daymer dieu et den estre aym√©e     car jusquau cueur fut entam√©e     et si ardamment enflamm√©e     que tousjours ardoit lestincelle     par quoi elle fut visit√©e     et de dieu premier comfort√©e     car charit√© est trop ysnelle  the only law of metre observed in this song is that each line shall be octosyllabic      qui fut  tousjours  fresche et  nouvelle     dautre  ment vi  vret de  bien ben plaire     et pen   soit den  tendret  de taire  but the reader must note that words which were twosyllabled in latin mostly remain yet so in the french      la vi  e de  marthe  sa mie  although mie which is pet language loving abbreviation of amica through amie remains monosyllabic but vie elides its e before a vowel      car mar  the me  nait vie  active     et ma  rie  contemp  lative  and custom endures many exceptions thus marie may be threesyllabled as above or answer to mie as a dissyllable but vierge is always i think dissyllabic vierge with even stronger accent on the ge for the latin go  then secondly of quantity there is scarcely any fixed law the metres may be timed as the minstrel choosesfast or slowand the iambic current checked in reverted eddy as the words chance to come  but thirdly there is to be rich ryming and chiming no matter how simply got so only that the words jingle and tingle together with due art of interlacing and answering in different parts of the stanza correspondent to the involutions of tracery and illumination the whole twelveline stanza is thus constructed with two rymes only six of each thus arranged      aab  aab  bba  bba   dividing the verse thus into four measures reversed in ascent and descent or descant more properly and doubtless with correspondent phases in the voicegiven and duly accompanying or following music thomas the rymers own precept that tong is chefe in mynstrelsye being always kept faithfully in mind176  here then you have a sufficient example of the pure chant of the christian ages which is always at heart joyful and divides itself into the four great forms song of praise song of prayer song of love and song of battle praise however being the keynote of passion through all the four forms according to the first law which i have already given in the laws of fesol√© all great art is praise of which the contrary is also true all foul or miscreant art is accusation greek diabol√™ she gave me of the tree and i did eat being an entirely museless expression on adams part the briefly essential contrary of lovesong  with these four perfect forms of christian chant of which we may take for pure examples the te deum the te lucis ante the amor che nella mente177 and the chant de roland are mingled songs of mourning of pagan origin whether greek or danish holding grasp still of the races that have once learned them in times of suffering and sorrow and songs of christian humiliation or grief regarding chiefly the sufferings of christ or the conditions of our own sin while through the entire system of these musical complaints are interwoven moralities instructions and related histories in illustration of both passing into epic and romantic verse which gradually as the forms and learnings of society increase becomes less joyful and more didactic or satiric until the last echoes of christian joy and melody vanish in the vanity of human wishes  and here i must pause for a minute or two to separate the different branches of our inquiry clearly from one another for one thing the reader must please put for the present out of his head all thought of the progress of civilisationthat is to say broadly of the substitution of wigs for hair gas for candles and steam for legs this is an entirely distinct matter from the phases of policy and religion it has nothing to do with the british constitution or the french revolution or the unification of italy there are indeed certain subtle relations between the state of mind for instance in venice which makes her prefer a steamer to a gondola and that which makes her prefer a gazetteer to a duke but these relations are not at all to be dealt with until we solemnly understand that whether men shall be christians and poets or infidels and dunces does not depend on the way they cut their hair tie their breeches or light their fires dr johnson might have worn his wig in fulness conforming to his dignity without therefore coming to the conclusion that human wishes were vain nor is queen antoinettes civilised hairpowder as opposed to queen berthas savagely loose hair the cause of antoinettes laying her head at last in scaffold dust but bertha in a pilgrimhaunted tomb  again i have just now used the words poet and dunce meaning the degree of each quality possible to average human nature men are eternally divided into the two classes of poet believer maker and praiser and dunce or unbeliever unmaker and dispraiser and in process of ages they have the power of making faithful and formative creatures of themselves or unfaithful and deformative and this distinction between the creatures who blessing are blessed and evermore benedicti and the creatures who cursing are cursed and evermore maledicti is one going through all humanity antediluvian in cain and abel diluvian in ham and shem and the question for the public of any given period is not whether they are a constitutional or unconstitutional vulgus but whether they are a benignant or malignant vulgus so also whether it is indeed the gods who have given any gentleman the grace to despise the rabble depends wholly on whether it is indeed the rabble or he who are the malignant persons  but yet again this difference between the persons to whom heaven according to orpheus has granted the hour of delight178 and those whom it has condemned to the hour of detestableness being as i have just said of all times and nationsit is an interior and more delicate difference which we are examining in the gift of christian as distinguished from unchristian song orpheus pindar and horace are indeed distinct from the prosaic rabble as the bird from the snake but between orpheus and palestrina horace and sidney there is another division and a new power of music and song given to the humanity which has hope of the resurrection  this is the root of all life and all rightness in christian harmony whether of word or instrument and so literally that in precise manner as this hope disappears the power of song is taken away and taken away utterly when the christian falls back out of the bright hope of the resurrection even the orpheus song is forbidden him not to have known the hope is blameless one may sing unknowing as the swan or philomela but to have known and fall away from it and to declare that the human wishes which are summed in that onethy kingdom comeare vain the fates ordain there shall be no singing after that denial  for observe this and earnestly the old orphic song with its dim hope of yet once more eurydicethe philomela songgranted after the cruel silencethe halcyon songwith its fifteen days of peace were all sad or joyful only in some vague vision of conquest over death but the johnsonian vanity of wishes is on the whole satisfactory to johnsonaccepted with gentlemanly resignation by popetriumphantly and with bray of penny trumpets and blowing of steamwhistles proclaimed for the glorious discovery of the civilised ages by mrs barbauld miss edgeworth adam smith and co there is no god but have we not invented gunpowderwho wants a god with that in his pocket179 there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but have we not paper and pens and cannot every blockhead print his opinions and the day of judgment become republican with everybody for a judge and the flat of the universe for the throne there is no law but only gravitation and congelation and we are stuck together in an everlasting hail and melted together in everlasting mud and great was the day in which our worships were born and there is no gospel but only whatever weve got to get more and wherever we are to go somewhere else and are not these discoveries to be sung of and drummed of and fiddled of and generally made melodiously indubitable in the eighteenth century song of praise  the fates will not have it so no word of song is possible in that century to mortal lips only polished versification sententious pentameter and hexameter until having turned out its toes long enough without dancing and pattered with its lips long enough without piping suddenly astr√¶a returns to the earth and a day of judgment of a sort and there bursts out a song at last again a most curtly melodious triplet of amphisb√¶nic ryme √áa ira

beginningin what unthoughtof antistrophe returning to that council chamber in sedan  while these two great songs were thus being composed and sung and danced to in cometary cycle by the french nation here in our less giddy island there rose amidst hours of business in scotland and of idleness in england three troubadours of quite different temper different also themselves but not opponent forming a perfect chord and adverse all the three of them alike to the french musicians in this main pointthat while the √áa ira and marseillaise were essentially songs of blame and wrath the british bards wrote virtually always songs of praise though by no means psalmody in the ancient keys on the contrary all the three are alike moved by a singular antipathy to the priests and are pointed at with fear and indignation by the pietists of their daynot without latent cause for they are all of them with the most loving service servants of that world which the puritan and monk alike despised and in the triple chord of their song could not but appear to the religious persons around them as respectively and specifically the praisersscott of the world burns of the flesh and byron of the devil  to contend with this carnal orchestra the religious world having long ago rejected its catholic psalms as antiquated and unscientific and finding its puritan melodies sunk into faint jar and twangle from their native trumpettone had nothing to oppose but the innocent rather than religious verses of the school recognised as that of the english lakes very creditable to them domestic at once and refined observing the errors of the world outside of the lakes with a pitying and tender indignation and arriving in lacustrine seclusion at many valuable principles of philosophy as pure as the tarns of their mountains and of corresponding depth183  i have lately seen and with extreme pleasure mr matthew arnolds arrangement of wordsworths poems and read with sincere interest his high estimate of them but a great poets work never needs arrangement by other hands and though it is very proper that silver how should clearly understand and brightly praise its fraternal rydal mount we must not forget that over yonder are the andes all the while  wordsworths rank and scale among poets were determined by himself in a single exclamation      what was the great parnassus self to thee     mount skiddaw  answer his question faithfully and you have the relation between the great masters of the muses teaching and the pleasant fingerer of his pastoral flute among the reeds of rydal  wordsworth is simply a westmoreland peasant with considerably less shrewdness than most border englishmen or scotsmen inherit and no sense of humour but gifted in this singularly with vivid sense of natural beauty and a pretty turn for reflections not always acute but as far as they reach medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around him water to parched lips may be better than samian wine but do not let us therefore confuse the qualities of wine and water i much doubt there being many inglorious miltons in our country churchyards but i am very sure there are many wordsworths resting there who were inferior to the renowned one only in caring less to hear themselves talk  with an honest and kindly heart a stimulating egoism a wholesome contentment in modest circumstances and such sufficient ease in that accepted state as permitted the passing of a good deal of time in wishing that daisies could see the beauty of their own shadows and other such profitable mental exercises wordsworth has left us a series of studies of the graceful and happy shepherd life of our lake country which to me personally for one are entirely sweet and precious but they are only so as the mirror of an existent reality in many ways more beautiful than its picture  but the other day i went for an afternoons rest into the cottage of one of our country people of old statesman class cottage lying nearly midway between two village churches but more conveniently for downhill walk towards one than the other i found as the good housewife made tea for me that nevertheless she went up the hill to church why do not you go to the nearer church i asked dont you like the clergyman oh no sir she answered it isnt that but you know i couldnt leave my mother your mother she is buried at h then yes sir and you know i couldnt go to church anywhere else  that feelings such as these existed among the peasants not of cumberland only but of all the tender earth that gives forth her fruit for the living and receives her dead to peace might perhaps have been to our great and endless comfort discovered before now if wordsworth had been content to tell us what he knew of his own villages and people not as the leader of a new and only correct school of poetry but simply as a country gentleman of sense and feeling fond of primroses kind to the parish children and reverent of the spade with which wilkinson had tilled his lands and i am by no means sure that his influence on the stronger minds of his time was anywise hastened or extended by the spirit of tunefulness under whose guidance he discovered that heaven rhymed to seven and foy to boy  tuneful nevertheless at heart and of the heavenly choir i gladly and frankly acknowledge him and our english literature enriched with a new and a singular virtue in the a√´rial purity and healthful rightness of his quiet songbut a√´rial onlynot ethereal and lowly in its privacy of light  a measured mind and calm innocent unrepentant helpful to sinless creatures and scatheless such of the flock as do not stray hopeful at least if not faithful content with intimations of immortality such as may be in skipping of lambs and laughter of childrenincurious to see in the hands the print of the nails  a gracious and constant mind as the herbage of its native hills fragrant and pureyet to the sweep and the shadow the stress and distress of the greater souls of men as the tufted thyme to the laurel wilderness of tempeas the gleaming euphrasy to the dark branches of dodona                                       i am obliged to defer the main body of this paper to next monthrevises penetrating all too late into my lacustrine seclusion as chanced also unluckily with the preceding paper in which the reader will perhaps kindly correct the consequent misprints p 29 l 20 of scarcely to securely and p 31 l 34 full with comma to fall without one noticing besides that redgauntlet has been omitted in the italicised list p 25 l 16 and

the map of meaner research whose shadings shall content themselves in the task of showing the depth or droughtthe calm or trouble of human compassion  for this is indeed all that is noble in the life of man and the source of all that is noble in the speech of man had it narrowed itself then in those days out of all the world into this peninsula between cockermouth and shap  not altogether so but indeed the vocal piety seemed conclusively to have retired or excursed into that mossy hermitage above little langdale the unvocal piety with the uncomplaining sorrow of man may have had a somewhat wider range for aught we know but history disregards those items and of firmly proclaimed and sweetly canorous religion there really seemed at that juncture none to be reckoned upon east of ingleborough or north of criffel only under furness fells or by bolton priory it seems we can still write ecclesiastical sonnets stanzas on the force of prayer odes to duty and complimentary addresses to the deity upon his endurance for adoration far otherwise over yonder by spezzia bay and ravenna pineta and in ravines of hartz there the softest voices speak the wildest words and keats discourses of endymion shelley of demogorgon goethe of lucifer and b√ºrger of the resurrection of death unto deathwhile even puritan scotland and episcopal anglia produce for us only these three minstrels of doubtful tone who show but small respect for the unco guid put but limited faith in gifted gilfillan and translate with unflinching frankness the morgante maggiore184  dismal the aspect of the spiritual world or at least the sound of it might well seem to the eyes and ears of saints such as we had of the perioddismal in angels eyes also assuredly yet is it possible that the dismalness in angelic sight may be otherwise quartered as it were from the way of mortal heraldry and that seen and heard of angelsagain i sayhesitatinglyis it possible that the goodness of the unco guid and the gift of gilfillan and the word of mr blattergowl may severally not have been the goodness of god the gift of god nor the word of god but that in the much blotted and broken efforts at goodness and in the careless gift which they themselves despised185 and in the sweet ryme and murmur of their unpurposed words the spirit of the lord had indeed wandering as in chaos days on lightless waters gone forth in the hearts and from the lips of those other three strange prophets even though they ate forbidden bread by the altar of the pouredout ashes and even though the wild beast of the desert found them and slew  this at least i know that it had been well for england though all her other prophets of the press the parliament the doctors chair and the bishops throne had fallen silent so only that she had been able to understand with her heart here and there the simplest line of these her despised  i take one at mere chance      who thinks of self when gazing on the sky186  well i dont know mr wordsworth certainly did and observed with truth that its clouds took a sober colouring in consequence of his experiences it is much if indeed this sadness be unselfish and our eyes have kept loving watch oer mans mortality i have found it difficult to make any one nowadays believe that such sobriety can be and that turner saw deeper crimson than others in the clouds of goldau but that any should yet think the clouds brightened by mans immortality instead of dulled by his deathand gazing on the sky look for the day when every eye must gaze alsofor behold he cometh with the cloudsthis it is no more possible for christian england to apprehend however exhorted by her gifted and guid  but byron was not thinking of such thingshe the reprobate how should such as he think of christ  perhaps not wholly as you or i think of him take at chance another line or two to try      carnage so wordsworth tells you is gods daughter187     if he speak truth she is christs sister and     just now behaved as in the holy land  blasphemy cry you good reader are you sure you understand it the first line i gave you was easy byronalmost shallow byronthese are of the man in his depth and you will not fathom them like a tarnnor in a hurry  just now behaved as in the holy land how did carnage behave in the holy land then you have all been greatly questioning of late whether the sun which you find to be now going out ever stood still did you in any lagging minute on those scientific occasions chance to reflect what he was bid stand still for or if notwill you please lookand what also going forth again as a strong man to run his course he saw rejoicing  then joshua passed from makkedah unto libnahand fought against libnah and the lord delivered it and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein and from lachish to eglon and from eglon to kirjatharba and sarahs grave in the amorites land and joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the southand of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathedas the lord god of israel commanded  thus it is written though you perhaps do not so often hear these texts preached from as certain others about taking away the sins of the world i wonder how the world would like to part with them hitherto it has always preferred parting first with its lifeand god has taken it at its word but death is not his begotten son for all that nor is the death of the innocent in battle carnage his instrument for working out a pure intent as mr wordsworth puts it but mans instrument for working out an impure one as byron would have you to know theology perhaps less orthodox but certainly more reverentneither is the woolwich infant a child of god neither does the ironclad thunderer utter thunders of godwhich facts if you had had the grace or sense to learn from byron instead of accusing him of blasphemy it had been better at this day for you and for many a savage soul also by euxine shore and in zulu and afghan lands  it was neither however for the theology nor the use of these lines that i quoted them but to note this main point of byrons own character he was the first great englishman who felt the cruelty of war and in its cruelty the shame its guilt had been known to george foxits folly shown practically by penn but the compassion of the pious world had still for the most part been shown only in keeping its stock of barabbases unhanged if possible and till byron came neither kunersdorf eylau nor waterloo had taught the pity and the pride of men that      the drying up a single tear has more     of honest fame than shedding seas of gore188  such pacific verse would not indeed have been acceptable to the edinburgh volunteers on portobello sands but byron can write a battle song too when it is his cue to fight if you look at the introduction to the isles of greece namely the 85th and 86th stanzas of the 3rd canto of don juanyou will findwhat will you not find if only you understand them he in the first line remember means the typical modern poet      thus usually when he was asked to sing       he gave the different nations something national     twas all the same to himgod save the king       or √áa ira according to the fashion all     his muse made increment of anything       from the high lyric down to the low rational     if pindar sang horse races what should hinder     himself from being as pliable as pindar      in france for instance he would write a chanson       in england a sixcanto quarto tale     in spain hed make a ballad or romance on       the last warmuch the same in portugal     in germany the pegasus hed prance on       would be old goethessee what says de sta√´l     in italy hed ape the trecentisti     in greece hed sing some sort of hymn like this t ye  note first here as we did in scott the concentrating and foretelling power the god save the queen in england fallen hollow now as the √áa ira in francenot a man in france knowing where either france or that whatever that may be is going to nor the queen of england daring for her life to ask the tiniest englishman to do a single thing he doesnt likenor any salvation either of queen or realm being any more possible to god unless under the direction of the royal society then note the estimate of height and depth in poetry swept in an instant high lyric to low rational pindar to pope knowing popes height too all the while no man better then the poetic power of franceresumed in a wordb√©ranger then the cut at marmion entirely deserved as we shall see yet kindly given for everything he names in these two stanzas is the best of its kind then romance in spain onthe last war present war not being to spanish poetical taste then goethe the real heart of all germany and last the aping of the trecentisti which has since consummated itself in preraphaelitism that also being the best thing italy has done through england whether in rossettis blessed damozels or burne joness days of creation lastly comes the mock at himselfthe modern english greekfollowed up by the degenerate into hands like mine in the song itself and thento amazement forth he thunders in his achilles voice we have had one line of him in his clearnessfive of him in his depthsixteen of

of byron was in this passage first its compassion then its indignation and the third element not yet examined that love of the beauty of this world in which the threeunholychildren of its fiery furnace were like to each other but byron the widesthearted scott and burns love scotland more than nature itself for burns the moon must rise over cumnock hillsfor scott the rymers glen divide the eildons but for byron lochnagar with ida looks oer troy and the soft murmurs of the dee and the bruar change into voices of the dead on distant marathon  yet take the parallel from scott by a field of

passion no less than in their sound different specifically from that of parching summer hath no warrant is it more profane think youor more tendernay perhaps in the core of it more true  for instance when we are told that                wharfe as he moved along     to matins joined a mournful voice  is this disposition of the rivers mind to pensive psalmody quite logically accounted for by the previous statement itself by no means rhythmically dulcet that      the boy is in the arms of wharfe     and strangled by a merciless force  or when we are led into the improving reflection      how

looked at a waterfall or two in my time and not unfrequently at a wave to assure the reader that here is entirely firstrate literary work though lucifer himself had written it the thing is itself good and not only so but unsurpassably good the closing line being probably the best concerning the sea yet written by the race of the seakings  but lucifer himself could not have written it neither any servant of lucifer i do not doubt but that most readers were surprised at my saying in the close of my first paper that byrons style depended in any wise on his views respecting the ten commandments that so allimportant a thing as style should depend in the least upon so ridiculous a thing as moral sense or that allegras father watching her drive by in count gs coach and six had any remnant of so ridiculous a thing to guideor checkhis poetical passion may alike seem more than questionable to the liberal and chaste philosophy of the existing british public but first of all putting the question of who writes or speaks aside do you good reader know good style when you get it can you say of halfadozen given lines taken anywhere out of a novel or poem or play that is good essentially in style or bad essentially and can you say why such halfdozen lines are good or bad  i imagine that in most cases the reply would be given with hesitation yet if you will give me a little patience and take some accurate pains i can show you the main tests of style in the space of a couple of pages  i take two examples of absolutely perfect and in manner highest i e kingly and heroic style the first example in expression of anger the second of love      1   we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us           his present and your pains we thank you for           when we have matchd our rackets to these balls           we will in france by gods grace play a set           shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard      2   my gracious silence hail           wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffind home           that weepst to see me triumph ah my dear           such eyes the widows in corioli wear           and mothers that lack sons  let us note point by point the conditions of greatness common to both these passages so opposite in temper  a absolute command over all passion however intense this the firstoffirst conditions see the kings own sentence just before we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fettered in our prisons and with this selfcommand the supremely surveying grasp of every thought that is to be uttered before its utterance so that each may come in its exact place time and connection the slightest hurry the misplacing of a word or the unnecessary accent on a syllable would destroy the style in an instant  b choice of the fewest and simplest words that can be found in the compass of the language to express the thing meant these few words being also arranged in the most straightforward and intelligible way allowing inversion only when the subject can be made primary without obscurity thus his present and your pains we thank you for is better than we thank you for his present and your pains because the dauphins gift is by courtesy put before the ambassadors pains but when to these balls our rackets we have matched would have spoiled the style in a moment becausei was going to have said ball and racket are of equal rank and therefore only the natural order proper but also here the natural order is the desired one the english racket to have precedence of the french ball in the fourth line the in france comes first as announcing the most important resolution of action the by gods grace next as the only condition rendering resolution possible the detail of issue follows with the strictest limit in the final word the king does not say danger far less dishonour but hazard only of that he is humanly speaking sure  c perfectly emphatic and clear utterance of the chosen words slowly in the degree of their importance with omission however of every word not absolutely required and natural use of the familiar contractions of final dissyllable thus play a set shall strike is better than play a set that shall strike and matchd is kingly shortno necessity could have excused matched instead on the contrary the three first words we are glad would have been spoken by the king more slowly and fully than any other syllables in the whole passage first pronouncing the kingly we at its proudest and then the are as a continuous state and then the glad as the exact contrary of what the ambassadors expected him to be190  d absolute spontaneity in doing all this easily and necessarily as the heart beats the king cannot speak otherwise than he doesnor the hero the words not merely come to them but are compelled to them even lisping numbers come but mighty numbers are ordained and inspired  e melody in the words changeable with their passion fitted to it exactly and the utmost of which the language is capablethe melody in prose being eolian and variablein verse nobler by submitting itself to stricter law i will enlarge upon this point presently  f utmost spiritual contents in the words so that each carries not only its instant meaning but a cloudy companionship of higher or darker meaning according to the passionnearly always indicated by metaphor play a setsometimes by abstractionthus in the second passage silence for silent one sometimes by description instead of direct epithet coffined for dead but always indicative of there being more in the speakers mind than he has said or than he can say full though his saying be on the quantity of this attendant fulness depends the majesty of style that is to say virtually on the quantity of contained thought in briefest words such thought being primarily loving and true and this the sum of allthat nothing can be well said but with truth nor beautifully but by love  these are the essential conditions of noble speech in prose and verse alike but the adoption of the form of verse and especially rymed verse means the addition to all these qualities of one more of music that is to say not eolian merely but apolline a construction or architecture of words fitted and befitting under external laws of time and harmony  when byron says rhyme is of the rude191 he means that burns needs itwhile henry the fifth does not nor plato nor isaiahyet in this need of it by the simple it becomes all the more religious and thus the loveliest pieces of christian language are all in rymethe best of dante chaucer douglas shakespeare spenser and sidney  i am not now able to keep abreast with the tide of modern scholarship nor to say the truth do i make the effort the first edge of its waves being mostly muddy and apt to make a shallow sweep of the shore refuse so that i have no better book of reference by me than the confused essay on the antiquity of ryme at the end of turners anglosaxons i cannot however conceive a more interesting piece of work if not yet done than the collection of sifted earliest fragments known of rymed song in european languages of eastern i know nothing but this side hellespont the substance of the matter is all given in king canutes impromptu      gaily or is it sweetlyi forget which and its no matter         sang the monks of ely     as knut the king came sailing by  much to be noted by any who make their religion lugubrious and their sunday the eclipse of the week and observe further that if milton does not ryme it is because his faculty of song was concerning loss chiefly and he has little more than faculty of croak concerning gain while dante though modern readers never go further with him than into the pit is stayed only by casella in the ascent to the rose of heaven so gibbon can write in his manner the fall of rome but virgil in his manner the rise of it and finally douglas in his manner bursts into such rymed passion of praise both of rome and virgil as befits a christian bishop and a good subject of the holy see      master of masterssweet source and springing well     wide where over all ringes thy heavenly bell                          why should i then with dull forehead and vain     with rude ingene and barane emptive brain     with bad harsh speech and lewit barbare tongue     presume to write where thy sweet bell is rung     or counterfeit thy precious wordis dear     na nanot so but kneel when i them hear     but farther moreand lower to descend     forgive me virgil if i thee offend     pardon thy scolar suffer him to ryme     since thou wast but ane mortal man sometime  before honour is humility does not clearer light come for you on that law after reading these nobly pious words and note you whose humility how is it that the sound of the bell comes so instinctively into his chiming verse this gentle singer is the son ofarchibald bellthecat  and now perhaps you can read with right sympathy the scene in marmion between his father and king james      his hand the monarch sudden took     now by the bruces soul     angus my hasty speech forgive     for sure as doth his spirit live     as he said of the douglas old     i well may say of you     that never king did subject hold     in speech more free in war more bold     more tender and more true     and while the king his hand did strain     the old mans tears fell down like rain  i believe the most infidel of scholastic readers can scarcely but perceive the relation between the sweetness simplicity and melody of expression in these passages and the gentleness of the passions they express while men who are not scholastic and yet are true scholars will recognise further in them that the simplicity of the educated is lovelier than the simplicity of the rude hear next a piece of spensers teaching how rudeness itself may become more beautiful even by its mistakes if the mistakes are made lovingly      ye shepherds daughters that

but cannot be         beauty brag but tis not she         truth and beauty buried be194  if now with the echo of these perfect verses in your mind you turn to byron and glance over or recall to memory enough of him to give means of exact comparison you will or should recognise these following kinds of mischief in him first if any one offends himas for instance mr southey or lord elginhis manners have not that repose that marks the caste c this defect in his lordships style being myself scrupulously and even painfully reserved in the use of vituperative language i need not say how deeply i deplore195  secondly in the best and most violetbedded bits of his work there is yet as compared with elizabethan and earlier verse a strange taint and indefinableevening flavour of covent garden as it werenot to say escape of gas in the strand that is simply what it proclaims itselflondon air if he had lived all his life in greenhead ghyll things would of course have been different but it was his fate to come to townmodern townlike michaels son and modern london and venice are answerable for the state of their drains not byron  thirdly his melancholy is without any relief whatsoever his jest sadder than his earnest while in elizabethan work all lament is full of hope and all pain of balsam  of this evil he has himself told you the cause in a single line prophetic of all things since and now where he gazed a gloom pervaded space196  so that for instance while mr wordsworth on a visit to town being an exemplary early riser could walk felicitous on westminster bridge remarking how the city now did like a garment wear the beauty of the morning byron rising somewhat later contemplated only the garment which the beauty of the morning had by that time received for wear from the city and again while mr wordsworth in irrepressible religious rapture calls god to witness that the houses seem asleep byron lame demon as he was flying smokedrifted unroofs the houses at a glance and sees what the mighty cockney heart of them contains in the still lying of it and will stir up to purpose in the waking business of it      the sordor of civilisation mixed     with all the passions which mans fall hath fixed197  fourthly with this steadiness of bitter melancholy there is joined a sense of the material beauty both of inanimate nature the lower animals and human beings which in the iridescence colourdepth and morbid i use the word deliberately mystery and softness of itwith other qualities indescribable by any single words and only to be analysed by extreme careis found to the full only in five men that i know of in modern times namely rousseau shelley byron turner and myselfdiffering totally and throughout the entire group of us from the delight in clearstruck beauty of angelico and the trecentisti and separated much more singularly from the cheerful joys of chaucer shakespeare and scott by its unaccountable affection for rokkes blak and other forms of terror and power such as those of the iceoceans which to shakespeare were only alpine rheum and the via malas and diabolic bridges which dante would have condemned none but lost souls to climb or crossall this love of impending mountains coiled thunderclouds and dangerous sea being joined in us with a sulky almost ferine love of retreat in valleys of charmettes gulphs of spezzia ravines of olympus low lodgings in chelsea and close brushwood at coniston  and lastly also in the whole group of us glows volcanic instinct of astr√¶an justice returning not to but up out of the earth which will not at all suffer us to rest any more in popes serene whatever is is right but holds on the contrary profound conviction that about ninetynine hundredths of whatever at present is is wrong conviction making four of us according to our several manners leaders of revolution for the poor and declarers of political doctrine monstrous to the ears of mercenary mankind and driving the fifth less sanguine into mere paintedmelody of lament over the fallacy of hope and the implacableness of fate  in byron the indignation the sorrow and the effort are joined to the death and they are the parts of his nature as of mine also in its feebler terms which the selfishly comfortable public have literally no conception of whatever and from which the piously sentimental public offering up daily the pure emotion of divine tranquillity shrink with anathema not unembittered by alarm  concerning which matters i hope to speak further and with more precise illustration in my next paper but seeing that this present one has been hitherto somewhat sombre and perhaps to gentle readers not a little discomposing i will conclude it with a piece of light biographic study necessary to my plan and as conveniently admissible in this place as afterwardsnamely the account of the manner in which scottwhom we shall always find as aforesaid to be in salient and palpable elements of character of the world worldly as burns is of the flesh fleshly and byron of the deuce damnablespent his sunday  as usual from lockharts farrago we cannot find out the first thing we want to knowwhether scott worked after his weekday custom on the sunday morning but i gather not at all events his household and his cattle rested l iii 108 i imagine he walked out into his woods or read quietly in his study immediately after breakfast whoever was in the house ladies and gentlemen i shall read prayers at eleven when i expect you all to attend vii 306 question of college and other externally unanimous prayers settled for us very briefly if you have no faith have at least manners he read the church of england service lessons and all the latter if interesting eloquently ibid after the service one of jeremy taylors sermons vi 188 after the sermon if the weather was fine walk with his family dogs included and guests to cold picnic iii 109 followed by short extempore biblical novelettes for he had his bible the old testament especially by heart it having been his mothers last gift to him vi 174 these lessons to his children in bible history were always given whether there was picnic or not for the rest of the afternoon he took his pleasure in the woods with tom purdie who also always appeared at his masters elbow on sunday after dinner was over and drank long life to the laird and his lady and all the good company in a quaigh of whiskey or a tumbler of wine according to his fancy vi 195 whatever might happen on the other evenings of the week scott always dined at home on sunday and with old friends never unless inevitably receiving any person with whom he stood on ceremony v 335 he came into the room rubbing his hands like a boy arriving at home for the holidays his peppers and mustards gambolling about him and even the stately maida grinning and wagging his tail with sympathy for the usquebaugh of the less honoured weekdays at the sunday board he circulated the champagne briskly during dinner and considered a pint of claret each mans fair share afterwards v 339 in the evening music being to the scottish worldly mind indecorous he read aloud some favourite author for the amusement or edification of his little circle shakespeare it might be or drydenjohnson or joanna bailliecrabbe or wordsworth but in those days byron was pouring out his spirit fresh and full and if a new piece from his hand had appeared it was sure to be read by scott the sunday evening afterwards and that with such delighted emphasis as showed how completely the elder bard had kept up his enthusiasm for poetry at pitch of youth and all his admiration of genius free pure and unstained by the least drop of literary jealousy v 341  with such necessary and easily imaginable varieties as chanced in having dandy dinmont or captain brown for guests at abbotsford or colonel mannering counsellor pleydell and dr robertson in castle street such was scotts habitual sabbath a day we perceive of eating the fat dinner presumably not cold being a work of necessity and mercythou also even thou saint thomas of trumbull hast thine and drinking the sweet abundant in the manner of mr southeys cataract of lodorehere it comes sparkling a day bestrewn with coronati√∂ns and sops in wine deep in libations to good hope and fond memory a day of rest to beast and mirth to man as also to sympathetic beasts that can be merry and concluding itself in an orphic hour of delight signifying peace on tweedside and goodwill to men there or far awayalways excepting the french and boney  yes and see what it all came to in the end  not so darkvirulent minosmucklewrath the end came of quite other things of these came such length of days and peace as scott had in his fatherland and such immortality as he has in all lands  nathless firm though deeply courteous rebuke for his sometimes overmuch lightmindedness was administered to him by the more grave and thoughtful byron for the lord abbot of newstead knew his bible by heart as well as scott though it had never been given him by his mother as her dearest possession knew it and what was more had thought of it and sought in it what scott had never cared to think nor been fain to seek  and loving scott well and always doing him every possible pleasure in the way he sees to be most agreeable to himas for instance remembering with precision and writing down the very next morning every blessed word that the prince regent had been pleased to say of him before courtly audiencehe yet conceived that such cheap ryming as his own bride of abydos for instance which he had written from beginning to end in four days or even the travelling reflections of harold and juan on men and women were scarcely steady enough sunday afternoons reading for a patriarchmerlin like scott so he dedicates to him a work of a truly religious tendency on which for his own part he has done his bestthe drama of cain of which dedication the virtual significance to sir walter might be translated thus dearest and last of border soothsayers thou hast indeed told us of black dwarfs and of white maidens also of grey friars and green fairies also of sacred hollies by the well and haunted crooks in the glen but of the bushes that the black dogs rend in the woods of phlegethon and of the crooks in the glen and the bickerings of the burnie where ghosts meet the mightiest of us and of the black misanthrope who is by no means yet a dwarfed one and concerning whom wiser creatures than hobbie elliot may tremblingly ask gude guide us whats yon hast thou yet known seeing that thou hast yet told nothing  scott may perhaps have his answer we shall in good time hear      john ruskin  footnotes  154 nell in the old curiosity shop was simply

contempt for the human heart but with deeper than evangelical humility acknowledging also what is sordid in its civilisation     the  elements of drawing  in  three letters to beginners  with illustrations drawn by the author     preface   it may perhaps be thought that in prefacing a manual of drawing i ought to expatiate on the reasons why drawing should be learned but those reasons appear to me so many and so weighty that i cannot quickly state or enforce them with the readers permission as this volume is too large already i will waive all discussion respecting the importance of the subject and touch only on those points which may appear questionable in the method of its treatment  in the first place the book is not calculated for the use of children under the age of twelve or fourteen i do not think it advisable to engage a child in any but the most voluntary practice of art if it has talent for drawing it will be continually scrawling on what paper it can get and should be allowed to scrawl at its own free will due praise being given for every appearance of care or truth in its efforts it should be allowed to amuse itself with cheap colours almost as soon as it has sense enough to wish for them if it merely daubs the paper with shapeless stains the colourbox may be taken away till it knows better but as soon as it begins painting red coats on soldiers striped flags to ships etc it should have colours at command and without restraining its choice of subject in that imaginative and historical art of a military tendency which children delight in generally quite as valuable by the way as any historical art delighted in by their elders it should be gently led by the parents to try to draw in such childish fashion as may be the things it can see and likesbirds or butterflies or flowers or fruit in later years the indulgence of using the colour should only be granted as a reward after it has shown care and progress in its drawings with pencil a limited number of good and amusing prints should always be within a boys reach in these days of cheap illustration he can hardly possess a volume of nursery tales without good woodcuts in it and should be encouraged to copy what he likes best of this kind but should be firmly restricted to a few prints and to a few books if a child has many toys it will get tired of them and break them if a boy has many prints he will merely dawdle and scrawl over them it is by the limitation of the number of his possessions that his pleasure in them is perfected and his attention concentrated the parents need give themselves no trouble in instructing him as far as drawing is concerned beyond insisting upon economical and neat habits with his colours and paper showing him the best way of holding pencil and rule and so far as they take notice of his work pointing out where a line is too short or too long or too crooked when compared with the copy accuracy being the first and last thing they look for if the child shows talent for inventing or grouping figures the parents should neither check nor praise it they may laugh with it frankly or show pleasure in what it has done just as they show pleasure in seeing it well or cheerful but they must not praise it for being clever any more than they would praise it for being stout they should praise it only for what costs it selfdenial namely attention and hard work otherwise they will make it work for vanitys sake and always badly the best books to put into its hands are those illustrated by george cruikshank or by richter see appendix at about the age of twelve or fourteen it is quite time enough to set youth or girl to serious work and then this book will i think be useful to them and i have good hope it may be so likewise to persons of more advanced age wishing to know something of the first principles of art  yet observe that the method of study recommended is not brought forward as absolutely the best but only as the best which i can at present devise for an isolated student it is very likely that farther experience in teaching may enable me to modify it with advantage in several important respects but i am sure the main principles of it are sound and most of the exercises as useful as they can be rendered without a masters superintendence the method differs however so materially from that generally adopted by drawingmasters that a word or two of explanation may be needed to justify what might otherwise be thought wilful eccentricity  the manuals at present published on the subject of drawing are all directed as far as i know to one or other of two objects either they propose to give the student a power of dexterous sketching with pencil or watercolour so as to emulate at considerable distance the slighter work of our secondrate artists or they propose to give him such accurate command of mathematical forms as may afterwards enable him to design rapidly and cheaply for manufactures when drawing is taught as an accomplishment the first is the aim usually proposed while the second is the object kept chiefly in view at marlborough house and in the branch government schools of design  of the fitness of the modes of study adopted in those schools to the end specially intended judgment is hardly yet possible only it seems to me that we are all too much in the habit of confusing art as applied to manufacture with manufacture itself for instance the skill by which an inventive workman designs and moulds a beautiful cup is skill of true art but the skill by which that cup is copied and afterwards multiplied a thousandfold is skill of manufacture and the faculties which enable one workman to design and elaborate his original piece are not to be developed by the same system of instruction as those which enable another to produce a maximum number of approximate copies of it in a given time farther it is surely inexpedient that any reference to purposes of manufacture should interfere with the education of the artist himself try first to manufacture a raphael then let raphael direct your manufacture he will design you a plate or cup or a house or a palace whenever you want it and design them in the most convenient and rational way but do not let your anxiety to reach the platter and the cup interfere with your education of the raphael obtain first the best work you can and the ablest hands irrespective of any consideration of economy or facility of production then leave your trained artist to determine how far art can be popularised or manufacture ennobled  now i believe that irrespective of differences in individual temper and character the excellence of an artist as such depends wholly on refinement of perception and that it is this mainly which a master or a school can teach so that while powers of invention distinguish man from man powers of perception distinguish school from school all great schools enforce delicacy of drawing and subtlety of sight and the only rule which i have as yet found to be without exception respecting art is that all great art is delicate  therefore the chief aim and bent of the following system is to obtain first a perfectly patient and to the utmost of the pupils power a delicate method of work such as may ensure his seeing truly for i am nearly convinced that when once we see keenly enough there is very little difficulty in drawing what we see but even supposing that this difficulty be still great i believe that the sight is a more important thing than the drawing and i would rather teach drawing that my pupils may learn to love nature than teach the looking at nature that they may learn to draw it is surely also a more important thing for young people and unprofessional students to know how to appreciate the art of others than to gain much power in art themselves now the modes of sketching ordinarily taught are inconsistent with this power of judgment no person trained to the superficial execution of modern watercolour painting can understand the work of titian or leonardo they must for ever remain blind to the refinement of such mens pencilling and the precision of their thinking but however slight a degree of manipulative power the student may reach by pursuing the mode recommended to him in these letters i will answer for it that he cannot go once through the advised exercises without beginning to understand what masterly work means and by the time he has gained some proficiency in them he will have a pleasure in looking at the painting of the great schools and a new perception of the exquisiteness of natural scenery such as would repay him for much more labour than i have asked him to undergo  that labour is nevertheless sufficiently irksome nor is it possible that it should be otherwise so long as the pupil works unassisted by a master for the smooth and straight road which admits unembarrassed progress must i fear be dull as well as smooth and the hedges need to be close and trim when there is no guide to warn or bring back the erring traveller the system followed in this work will therefore at first surprise somewhat sorrowfully those who are familiar with the practice of our class at the working mens college for there the pupil having the master at his side to extricate him from such embarrassments as his first efforts may lead into is at once set to draw from a solid object and soon finds entertainment in his efforts and interest in his difficulties of course the simplest object which it is possible to set before the eye is a sphere and practically i find a childs toy a white leather ball better than anything else as the gradations on balls of plaster of paris which i use sometimes to try the strength of pupils who have had previous practice are a little too delicate for a beginner to perceive it has been objected that a circle or the outline of a sphere is one of the most difficult of all lines to draw it is so but i do not want it to be drawn all that his study of the ball is to teach the pupil is the way in which shade gives the appearance of projection this he learns most satisfactorily from a sphere because any solid form terminated by straight lines or flat surfaces owes some of its appearance of projection to its perspective but in the sphere what without shade was a flat circle becomes merely by the added shade the image of a solid ball and this fact is just as striking to the learner whether his circular outline be true or false he is therefore never allowed to trouble himself about it if he makes the ball look as oval as an egg the degree of error is simply pointed out to him and he does better next time and better still the next but his mind is always fixed on the gradation of shade and the outline left to take in due time care of itself i call it outline for the sake of immediate intelligibilitystrictly speaking it is merely the edge of the shade no pupil in my class being ever allowed to draw an outline in the ordinary sense it is pointed out to him from the first that nature relieves one mass or one tint against another but outlines none the outline exercise the second suggested in this letter is recommended not to enable the pupil to draw outlines but as the only means by which unassisted he can test his accuracy of eye and discipline his hand when the master is by errors in the form and extent of shadows can be pointed out as easily as in outline and the handling can be gradually corrected in details of the work but the solitary student can only find out his own mistakes by help of the traced limit and can only test the firmness of his hand by an exercise in which nothing but firmness is required and during which all other considerations as of softness complexity c are entirely excluded  both the system adopted at the working mens college and that recommended here agree however in one principle which i consider the most important and special of all that are involved in my teaching namely the attaching its full importance from the first to local colour i believe that the endeavour to separate in the course of instruction the observation of light and shade from that of local colour has always been and must always be destructive of the students power of accurate sight and that it corrupts his taste as much as it retards his progress i will not occupy the readers time by any discussion of the principle here but i wish him to note it as the only distinctive one in my system so far as it is a system for the recommendation to the pupil to copy faithfully and without alteration whatever natural object he chooses to study is serviceable among other reasons just because it gets rid of systematic rules altogether and teaches people to draw as country lads learn to ride without saddle or stirrups my main object being at first not to get my pupils to hold their reins prettily but to sit like a jackanapes never off  in these written instructions therefore it has always been with regret that i have seen myself forced to advise anything like monotonous or formal discipline but to the unassisted student such formalities are indispensable and i am not without hope that the sense of secure advancement and the pleasure of independent effort may render the following out of even the more tedious exercises here proposed possible to the solitary learner without weariness but if it should be otherwise and he finds the first steps painfully irksome i can only desire him to consider whether the acquirement of so great a power as that of pictorial expression of thought be not worth some toil or whether it is likely in the natural order of matters in this working world that so great a gift should be attainable by those who will give no price for it  one task however of some difficulty the student will find i have not imposed upon him namely learning the laws of perspective it would be worth while to learn them if he could do so easily but without a masters help and in the way perspective is at present explained in treatises the difficulty is greater than the gain for perspective is not of the slightest use except in rudimentary work you can draw the rounding line of a table in perspective but you cannot draw the sweep of a sea bay you can foreshorten a log of wood by it but you cannot foreshorten an arm its laws are too gross and few to be applied to any subtle form therefore as you must learn to draw the subtle forms by the eye certainly you may draw the simple ones no great painters ever trouble themselves about perspective and very few of them know its laws they draw everything by the eye and naturally enough disdain in the easy parts of their work rules which cannot help them in difficult ones it would take about a months labour to draw imperfectly by laws of perspective what any great venetian will draw perfectly in five minutes when he is throwing a wreath of leaves round a head or bending the curves of a pattern in and out among the folds of drapery it is true that when perspective was first discovered everybody amused themselves with it and all the great painters put fine saloons and arcades behind their madonnas merely to show that they could draw in perspective but even this was generally done by them only to catch the public eye and they disdained the perspective so much that though they took the greatest pains with the circlet of a crown or the rim of a crystal cup in the heart of their picture they would twist their capitals of columns and towers of churches about in the background in the most wanton way wherever they liked the lines to go provided only they left just perspective enough to please the public in modern days i doubt if any artist among us except david roberts knows so much perspective as would enable him to draw a gothic arch to scale at a given angle and distance turner though he was professor of perspective to the royal academy did not know what he professed and never as far as i remember drew a single building in true perspective in his life he drew them only with as much perspective as suited him prout also knew nothing of perspective and twisted his buildings as turner did into whatever shapes he liked i do not justify this and would recommend the student at least to treat perspective with common civility but to pay no court to it the best way he can learn it by himself is by taking a pane of glass fixed in a frame so that it can be set upright before the eye at the distance at which the proposed sketch is intended to be seen let the eye be placed at some fixed point opposite the middle of the pane of glass but as high or as low as the student likes then with a brush at the end of a stick and a little bodycolour that will adhere to the glass the lines of the landscape may be traced on the glass as you see them through it when so traced they are all in true perspective if the glass be sloped in any direction the lines are still in true perspective only it is perspective calculated for a sloping plane while common perspective always supposes the plane of the picture to be vertical it is good in early practice to accustom yourself to enclose your subject before sketching it with a light frame of wood held upright before you it will show you what you may legitimately take into your picture and what choice there is between a narrow foreground near you and a wide one farther off also what height of tree or building you can properly take in c198  of figure drawing nothing is said in the following pages because i do not think figures as chief subjects can be drawn to any good purpose by an amateur as accessaries in landscape they are just to be drawn on the same principles as anything else  lastly if any of the directions given subsequently to the student should be found obscure by him or if at any stage of the recommended practice he finds himself in difficulties which i have not provided enough against he may apply by letter to mr ward who is my under drawingmaster at the working mens college 45 great ormond street and who will give any required assistance on the lowest terms that can remunerate him for the occupation of his time i have not leisure myself in general to answer letters of inquiry however much i may desire to do so but mr ward has always the power of referring any question to me when he thinks it necessary i have good hope however that enough guidance is given in this work to prevent the occurrence of any serious embarrassment and i believe that the student who obeys its directions will find on the whole that the best answer of questions is perseverance and the best drawingmasters are the woods and hills  footnotes  198 if the student is fond of architecture and wishes to know more of perspective than he can learn in this rough way mr runciman of 40 accacia road st johns wood who was my first drawingmaster and to whom i owe many happy hours can teach it him quickly easily and rightly     the  elements of drawing     letter i  on first practice   my dear reader  whether this book is to be of use to you or not depends wholly on your reason for wishing to learn to draw if you desire only to possess a graceful accomplishment to be able to converse in a fluent manner about drawing or to amuse yourself listlessly in listless hours i cannot help you but if you wish to learn drawing that you may be able to set down clearly and usefully records of such things as cannot be described in words either to assist your own memory of them or to convey distinct ideas of them to other people if you wish to obtain quicker perceptions of the beauty of the natural world and to preserve something like a true image of beautiful things that pass away or which you must yourself leave if also you wish to understand the minds of great painters and to be able to appreciate their work sincerely seeing it for yourself and loving it not merely taking up the thoughts of other people about it then i can help you or which is better show you how to help yourself  only you must understand first of all that these powers which indeed are noble and desirable cannot be got without work it is much easier to learn to draw well than it is to learn to play well on any musical instrument but you know that it takes three or four years of practice giving three or four hours a day to acquire even ordinary command over the keys of a piano and you must not think that a masterly command of your pencil and the knowledge of what may be done with it can be acquired without painstaking or in a very short time the kind of drawing which is taught or supposed to be taught in our schools in a term or two perhaps at the rate of an hours practice a week is not drawing at all it is only the performance of a few dexterous not always even that evolutions on paper with a blacklead pencil profitless alike to performer and beholder unless as a matter of vanity and that the smallest possible vanity if any young person after being taught what is in polite circles called drawing will try to copy the commonest piece of real worksuppose a lithograph on the titlepage of a new opera air or a woodcut in the cheapest illustrated newspaper of the daythey will find themselves entirely beaten and yet that common lithograph was drawn with coarse chalk much more difficult to manage than the pencil of which an accomplished young lady is supposed to have command and that woodcut was drawn in urgent haste and half spoiled in the cutting afterwards and both were done by people whom nobody thinks of as artists or praises for their power both were done for daily bread with no more artists pride than any simple handicraftsmen feel in the work they live by  do not therefore think that you can learn drawing any more than a new language without some hard and disagreeable labour but do not on the other hand if you are ready and willing to pay this price fear that you may be unable to get on for want of special talent it is indeed true that the persons who have peculiar talent for art draw instinctively and get on almost without teaching though never without toil it is true also that of inferior talent for drawing there are many degrees it will take one person a much longer time than another to attain the same results and the results thus painfully attained are never quite so satisfactory as those got with greater ease when the faculties are naturally adapted to the study but i have never yet in the experiments i have made met with a person who could not learn to draw at all and in general there is a satisfactory and available power in every one to learn drawing if he wishes just as nearly all persons have the power of learning french latin or arithmetic in a decent and useful degree if their lot in life requires them to possess such knowledge  supposing then that you are ready to take a certain amount of pains and to bear a little irksomeness and a few disappointments bravely i can promise you that an hours practice a day for six months or an hours practice every other day for twelve months or disposed in whatever way you find convenient some hundred and fifty hours practice will give you sufficient power of drawing faithfully whatever you want to draw and a good judgment up to a certain point of other peoples work of which hours if you have one to spare at present we may as well begin at once   exercise i  everything that you can see in the world around you presents itself to your eyes only as an arrangement of patches of different colours variously shaded199 some of these patches of colour have an appearance of lines or texture within them as a piece of cloth or silk has of threads or an animals skin shows texture of hairs but whether this be the case or not the first broad aspect of the thing is that of a patch of some definite colour and the first thing to be learned is how to produce extents of smooth colour without texture  this can only be done properly with a brush but a brush being soft at the point causes so much uncertainty in the touch of an unpractised hand that it is hardly possible to learn to draw first with it and it is better to take in early practice some instrument with a hard and fine point both that we may give some support to the hand and that by working over the subject with so delicate a point the attention may be properly directed to all the most minute parts of it even the best artists need occasionally to study subjects with a pointed instrument in order thus to discipline their attention and a beginner must be content to do so for a considerable period  also observe that before we trouble ourselves about differences of colour we must be able to lay on one colour properly in whatever gradations of depth and whatever shapes we want we will try therefore first to lay on tints or patches of grey of whatever depth we want with a pointed instrument take any finelypointed steel pen one of gillotts lithographic crowquills is best and a piece of quite smooth but not shining notepaper creamlaid and get some ink that has stood already some time in the inkstand so as to be quite black and as thick as it can be without clogging the pen take a rule and draw four straight lines so as to enclose a square or nearly a square about as large as a fig 1 i say nearly a square because it does not in the least matter whether it is quite square or not the object being merely to get a space enclosed by straight lines  illustration fig 1  now try to fill in that square space with crossed lines so completely and evenly that it shall look like a square patch of grey silk or cloth cut out and laid on the white paper as at b cover it quickly first with straightish lines in any direction you like not troubling yourself to draw them much closer or neater than those in the square a let them quite dry before retouching them if you draw three or four squares side by side you may always be going on with one while the others are drying then cover these lines with others in a different direction and let those dry then in another direction still and let those dry always wait long enough to run no risk of blotting and then draw the lines as quickly as you can each ought to be laid on as swiftly as the dash of the pen of a good writer but if you try to reach this great speed at first you will go over the edge of the square which is a fault in this exercise yet it is better to do so now and then than to draw the lines very slowly for if you do the pen leaves a little dot of ink at the end of each line and these dots spoil your work so draw each line quickly stopping always as nearly as you can at the edge of the square the ends of lines which go over the edge are afterwards to be removed with the penknife but not till you have done the whole work otherwise you roughen the paper and the next line that goes over the edge makes a blot  when you have gone over the whole three or four times you will find some parts of the square look darker than other parts now try to make the lighter parts as dark as the rest so that the whole may be of equal depth or darkness you will find on examining the work that where it looks darkest the lines are closest or there are some much darker lines than elsewhere therefore you must put in other lines or little scratches and dots between the lines in the paler parts and where there are very conspicuous dark lines scratch them out lightly with the penknife for the eye must not be attracted by any line in particular the more carefully and delicately you fill in the little gaps and holes the better you will get on faster by doing two or three squares perfectly than a great many badly as the tint gets closer and begins to look even work with very little ink in your pen so as hardly to make any mark on the paper and at last where it is too dark use the edge of your penknife very lightly and for some time to wear it softly into an even tone you will find that the greatest difficulty consists in getting evenness one bit will always look darker than another bit of your square or there will be a granulated and sandy look over the whole when you find your paper quite rough and in a mess give it up and begin another square but do not rest satisfied till you have done your best with every square the tint at last ought at least to be as close and even as that in b fig 1 you will find however that it is very difficult to get a pale tint because naturally the ink lines necessary to produce a close tint at all blacken the paper more than you want you must get over this difficulty not so much by leaving the lines wide apart as by trying to draw them excessively fine lightly and swiftly being very cautious in filling in and at last passing the penknife over the whole by keeping several squares in progress at one time and reserving your pen for the light one just when the ink is nearly exhausted you may get on better the paper ought at last to look lightly and evenly toned all over with no lines distinctly visible   exercise ii  as this exercise in shading is very tiresome it will be well to vary it by proceeding with another at the same time the power of shading rightly depends mainly on lightness of hand and keenness of sight but there are other qualities required in drawing dependent not merely on lightness but steadiness of hand and the eye to be perfect in its power must be made accurate as well as keen and not only see shrewdly but measure justly  possess yourself therefore of any cheap work on botany containing outline plates of leaves and flowers it does not matter whether bad or good baxters british flowering plants is quite good enough copy any of the simplest outlines first with a soft pencil following it by the eye as nearly as you can if it does not look right in proportions rub out and correct it always by the eye till you think it is right when you have got it to your mind lay tracingpaper on the book on this paper trace the outline you have been copying and apply it to your own and having thus ascertained the faults correct them all patiently till you have got it as nearly accurate as may be work with a very soft pencil and do not rub out so hard200 as to spoil the surface of your paper never mind how dirty the paper gets but do not roughen it and let the false outlines alone where they do not really interfere with the true one it is a good thing to accustom yourself to hew and shape your drawing out of a dirty piece of paper when you have got it as right as you can take a quill pen not very fine at the point rest your hand on a book about an inch and a half thick so as to hold the pen long and go over your pencil outline with ink raising your pen point as seldom as possible and never leaning more heavily on one part of the line than on another in most outline drawings of the present day parts of the curves are thickened to give an effect of shade all such outlines are bad but they will serve well enough for your exercises provided you do not imitate this character it is better however if you can to choose a book of pure outlines it does not in the least matter whether your pen outline be thin or thick but it matters greatly that it should be equal not heavier in one place than in another the power to be obtained is that of drawing an even line slowly and in any direction all dashing lines or approximations to penmanship are bad the pen should as it were walk slowly over the ground and you should be able at any moment to stop it or to turn it in any other direction like a wellmanaged horse  as soon as you can copy every curve slowly and accurately you have made satisfactory progress but you will find the difficulty is in the slowness it is easy to draw what appears to be a good line with a sweep of the hand or with what is called freedom201 the real difficulty and masterliness is in never letting the hand be free but keeping it under entire control at every part of the line   exercise iii  meantime you are always to be going on with your shaded squares and chiefly with these the outline exercises being taken up only for rest  illustration fig 2  as soon as you find you have some command of the pen as a shading instrument and can lay a pale or dark tint as you choose try to produce gradated spaces like fig 2 the dark tint passing gradually into the lighter ones nearly all expression of form in drawing depends on your power of gradating delicately and the gradation is always most skilful which passes from one tint into another very little paler draw therefore two parallel lines for limits to your work as in fig 2 and try to gradate the shade evenly from white to black passing over the greatest possible distance yet so that every part of the band may have visible change in it the perception of gradation is very deficient in all beginners not to say in many artists and you will probably for some time think your gradation skilful enough when it is quite patchy and imperfect by getting a piece of grey shaded riband and comparing it with your drawing you may arrive in early stages of your work at a wholesome dissatisfaction with it widen your band little by little as you get more skilful so as to give the gradation more lateral space and accustom yourself at the same time to look for gradated spaces in nature the sky is the largest and the most beautiful watch it at twilight after the sun is down and try to consider each pane of glass in the window you look through as a piece of paper coloured blue or grey or purple as it happens to be and observe how quietly and continuously the gradation extends over the space in the window of one or two feet square observe the shades on the outside and inside of a common white cup or bowl which make it look round and hollow202 and then on folds of white drapery and thus gradually you will be led to observe the more subtle transitions of the light as it increases or declines on flat surfaces at last when your eye gets keen and true you will see gradation on everything in nature  but it will not be in your power yet awhile to draw from any objects in which the gradations are varied and complicated nor will it be a bad omen for your future progress and for the use that art is to be made of by you if the first thing at which you aim should be a little bit of sky so take any narrow space of evening sky that you can usually see between the boughs of a tree or between two chimneys or through the corner of a pane in the window you like best to sit at and try to gradate a little space of white paper as evenly as that is gradatedas tenderly you cannot gradate it without colour no nor with colour either but you may do it as evenly or if you get impatient with your spots and lines of ink when you look at the beauty of the sky the sense you will have gained of that beauty is something to be thankful for but you ought not to be impatient with your pen and ink for all great painters however delicate their perception of colour are fond of the peculiar effect of light which may be got in a penandink sketch and in a woodcut by the gleaming of the white paper between the black lines and if you cannot gradate well with pure black lines you will never gradate well with pale ones by looking at any common woodcuts in the cheap publications of the day you may see how gradation is given to the sky by leaving the lines farther and farther apart but you must make your lines as fine as you can as well as far apart towards the light and do not try to make them long or straight but let them cross irregularly in any direction easy to your hand depending on nothing but their gradation for your effect on this point of direction of lines however i shall have to tell you more presently in the meantime do not trouble yourself about it   exercise iv  as soon as you find you can gradate tolerably with the pen take an h or hh pencil using its point to produce shade from the darkest possible to the palest in exactly the same manner as the pen lightening however now with indiarubber instead of the penknife you will find that all pale tints of shade are thus easily producible with great precision and tenderness but that you cannot get the same dark power as with the pen and ink and that the surface of the shade is apt to become glossy and metallic or dirtylooking or sandy persevere however in trying to bring it to evenness with the fine point removing any single speck or line that may be too black with the point of the knife you must not scratch the whole with the knife as you do the ink if you find the texture very speckledlooking lighten it all over with indiarubber and recover it again with sharp and excessively fine touches of the pencil point bringing the parts that are too pale to perfect evenness with the darker spots  you cannot use the point too delicately or cunningly in doing this work with it as if you were drawing the down on a butterflys wing  at this stage of your progress if not before you may be assured that some clever friend will come in and hold up his hands in mocking amazement and ask you who could set you to that niggling and if you persevere in it you will have to sustain considerable persecution from your artistical acquaintances generally who will tell you that all good drawing depends on boldness but never mind them you do not hear them tell a child beginning music to lay its little hand with a crash among the keys in imitation of the great masters yet they might as reasonably as they may tell you to be bold in the present state of your knowledge bold in the sense of being undaunted yes but bold in the sense of being careless confident or exhibitorynono and a thousand times no for even if you were not a beginner it would be bad advice that made you bold mischief may easily be done quickly but good and beautiful work is generally done slowly you will find no boldness in the way a flower or a birds wing is painted and if nature is not bold at her work do you think you ought to be at yours so never mind what people say but work with your pencil point very patiently and if you can trust me in anything trust me when i tell you that though there are all kinds and ways of artlarge work for large places small work for narrow places slow work for people who can wait and quick work for people who cannotthere is one quality and i think only one in which all great and good art agreesit is all delicate art coarse art is always bad art you cannot understand this at present because you do not know yet how much tender thought and subtle care the great painters put into touches that at first look coarse but believe me it is true and you will find it is so in due time  you will be perhaps also troubled in these first essays at pencil drawing by noticing that more delicate gradations are got in an instant by a chance touch of the indiarubber than by an hours labour with the point and you may wonder why i tell you to produce tints so painfully which might it appears be obtained with ease but there are two reasons the first that when you come to draw forms you must be able to gradate with absolute precision in whatever place and direction you wish not in any wise vaguely as the indiarubber does it and secondly that all natural shadows are more or less mingled with gleams of light in the darkness of ground there is the light of the little pebbles or dust in the darkness of foliage the glitter of the leaves in the darkness of flesh transparency in that of a stone granulation in every case there is some mingling of light which cannot be represented by the leaden tone which you get by rubbing or by an instrument known to artists as the stump when you can manage the point properly you will indeed be able to do much also with this instrument or with your fingers but then you will have to retouch the flat tints afterwards so as to put life and light into them and that can only be done with the point labour on therefore courageously with that only   exercise v  illustration fig 3  when you can manage to tint and gradate tenderly with the pencil point get a good large alphabet and try to tint the letters into shape with the pencil point do not outline them first but measure their height and extreme breadth with the compasses as a b a c fig 3 and then scratch in their shapes gradually the letter a enclosed within the lines being in what turner would have called a state of forwardness  then when you are satisfied with the shape of the letter draw pen and ink lines firmly round the tint as at d and remove any touches outside the limit first with the indiarubber and then with the penknife so that all may look clear and right if you rub out any of the pencil inside the outline of the letter retouch it closing it up to the inked line the straight lines of the outline are all to be ruled203 but the curved lines are to be drawn by the eye and hand and you will soon find what good practice there is in getting the curved letters such as bs cs c to stand quite straight and come into accurate form  all these exercises are very irksome and they are not to be persisted in alone neither is it necessary to acquire perfect power in any of them an entire master of the pencil or brush ought indeed to be able to draw any form at once as giotto his circle but such skill as this is only to be expected of the consummate master having pencil in hand all his life and all day long hence the force of giottos proof of his skill and it is quite possible to draw very beautifully without attaining even an approximation to such a power the main point being not that every line should be precisely what we intend or wish but that the line which we intended or wished to draw should be right if we always see rightly and mean rightly we shall get on though the hand may stagger a little but if we mean wrongly or mean nothing it does not matter how firm the hand is do not therefore torment yourself because you cannot do as well as you would like but work patiently sure that every square and letter will give you a certain increase of power and as soon as you can draw your letters pretty well here is a more amusing exercise for you   exercise vi  choose any tree that you think pretty which is nearly bare of leaves and which you can see against the sky or against a pale wall or other light ground it must not be against strong light or you will find the looking at it hurts your eyes nor must it be in sunshine or you will be puzzled by the lights on the boughs but the tree must be in shade and the sky blue or grey or dull white a wholly grey or rainy day is the best for this practice  you will see that all the boughs of the tree are dark against the sky consider them as so many dark rivers to be laid down in a map with absolute accuracy and without the least thought about the roundness of the stems map them all out in flat shade scrawling them in with pencil just as you did the limbs of your letters then correct and alter them rubbing out and out again never minding how much your paper is dirtied only not destroying its surface until every bough is exactly or as near as your utmost power can bring it right in curvature and in thickness look at the white interstices between them with as much scrupulousness as if they were little estates which you had to survey and draw maps of for some important lawsuit involving heavy penalties if you cut the least bit of a corner off any of them or gave the hedge anywhere too deep a curve and try continually to fancy the whole tree nothing but a flat ramification on a white ground do not take any trouble about the little twigs which look like a confused network or mist leave them all out204 drawing only the main branches as far as you can see them distinctly your object at present being not to draw a tree but to learn how to do so when you have got the thing as nearly right as you canand it is better to make one good study than twenty left unnecessarily inaccuratetake your pen and put a fine outline to all the boughs as you did to your letter taking care as far as possible to put the outline within the edge of the shade so as not to make the boughs thicker the main use of the outline is to affirm the whole more clearly to do away with little accidental roughnesses and excrescences and especially to mark where boughs cross or come in front of each other as at such points their arrangement in this kind of sketch is unintelligible without the outline it may perfectly well happen that in nature it should be less distinct than your outline will make it but it is better in this kind of sketch to mark the facts clearly the temptation is always to be slovenly and careless and the outline is like a bridle and forces our indolence into attention and precision the outline should be about the thickness of that in fig 4 which represents the ramification of a small stone pine only i have not endeavoured to represent the pencil shading within the outline as i could not easily express it in a woodcut and you have nothing to do at present with the indication of the foliage above of which in another place you may also draw your trees as much larger than this figure as you like only however large they may be keep the outline as delicate and draw the branches far enough into their outer sprays to give quite as slender ramification as you have in this figure otherwise you do not get good enough practice out of them  illustration fig 4  you cannot do too many studies of this kind every one will give you some new notion about trees but when you are tired of tree boughs take any forms whatever which are drawn in flat colour one upon another as patterns on any kind of cloth or flat china tiles for instance executed in two colours only and practice drawing them of the right shape and size by the eye and filling them in with shade of the depth required  in doing this you will first have to meet the difficulty of representing depth of colour by depth of shade thus a pattern of ultramarine blue will have to be represented by a darker tint of grey than a pattern of yellow  and now it is both time for you to begin to learn the mechanical use of the brush and necessary for you to do so in order to provide yourself with the gradated scale of colour which you will want if you can by any means get acquainted with any ordinarily skilful watercolour painter and prevail on him to show you how to lay on tints with a brush by all means do so not that you are yet nor for a long while yet to begin to colour but because the brush is often more convenient than the pencil for laying on masses or tints of shade and the sooner you know how to manage it as an instrument the better if however you have no opportunity of seeing how watercolour is laid on by a workman of any kind the following directions will help you   exercise vii  get a shilling cake of prussian blue dip the end of it in water so as to take up a drop and rub it in a white saucer till you cannot rub much more and the colour gets dark thick and oilylooking put two teaspoonfuls of water to the colour you have rubbed down and mix it well up with a camelshair brush about three quarters of an inch long  then take a piece of smooth but not glossy bristol board or pasteboard divide it with your pencil and rule into squares as large as those of the very largest chessboard they need not be perfect squares only as nearly so as you can quickly guess rest the pasteboard on something sloping as much as an ordinary desk then dipping your brush into the colour you have mixed and taking up as much of the liquid as it will carry begin at the top of one of the squares and lay a pond or runlet of colour along the top edge lead this pond of colour gradually downwards not faster at one place than another but as if you were adding a row of bricks to a building all along only building down instead of up dipping the brush frequently so as to keep the colour as full in that and in as great quantity on the paper as you can so only that it does not run down anywhere in a little stream but if it should never mind go on quietly with your square till you have covered it all in when you get to the bottom the colour will lodge there in a great wave have ready a piece of blottingpaper dry your brush on it and with the dry brush take up the superfluous colour as you would with a sponge till it all looks even  in leading the colour down you will find your brush continually go over the edge of the square or leave little gaps within it do not endeavour to retouch these nor take much care about them the great thing is to get the colour to lie smoothly where it reaches not in alternate blots and pale patches try therefore to lead it over the square as fast as possible with such attention to your limit as you are able to give the use of the exercise is indeed to enable you finally to strike the colour up to the limit with perfect accuracy but the first thing is to get it even the power of rightly striking the edge comes only by time and practice even the greatest artists rarely can do this quite perfectly  when you have done one square proceed to do another which does not communicate with it when you have thus done all the alternate squares as on a chessboard turn the pasteboard upside down begin again with the first and put another coat over it and so on over all the others the use of turning the paper upside down is to neutralise the increase of darkness towards the bottom of the squares which would otherwise take place from the ponding of the colour  be resolved to use blottingpaper or a piece of rag instead of your lips to dry the brush the habit of doing so once acquired will save you from much partial poisoning take care however always to draw the brush from root to point otherwise you will spoil it you may even wipe it as you would a pen when you want it very dry without doing harm provided you do not crush it upwards get a good brush at first and cherish it it will serve you longer and better than many bad ones  when you have done the squares all over again do them a third time always trying to keep your edges as neat as possible when your colour is exhausted mix more in the same proportions two teaspoonfuls to as much as you can grind with a drop and when you have done the alternate squares three times over as the paper will be getting very damp and dry more slowly begin on the white squares and bring them up to the same tint in the same way the amount of jagged dark line which then will mark the limits of the squares will be the exact measure of your unskilfulness  as soon as you tire of squares draw circles with compasses and then draw straight lines irregularly across circles and fill up the spaces so produced between the straight line and the circumference and then draw any simple shapes of leaves according to the exercise no 2 and fill up those until you can lay on colour quite evenly in any shape you want  you will find in the course of this practice as you cannot always put exactly the same quantity of water to the colour that the darker the colour is the more difficult it becomes to lay it on evenly therefore when you have gained some definite degree of power try to fill in the forms required with a full brush and a dark tint at once instead of laying several coats one over another always taking care that the tint however dark be quite liquid and that after being laid on so much of it is absorbed as to prevent its forming a black line at the edge as it dries a little experience will teach you how apt the colour is to do this and how to prevent it not that it needs always to be prevented for a great master in watercolours will sometimes draw a firm outline when he wants one simply by letting the colour dry in this way at the edge  when however you begin to cover complicated forms with the darker colour no rapidity will prevent the tint from drying irregularly as it is led on from part to part you will then find the following method useful lay in the colour very pale and liquid so pale indeed that you can only just see where it is on the paper lead it up to all the outlines and make it precise in form keeping it thoroughly wet everywhere then when it is all in shape take the darker colour and lay some of it into the middle of the liquid colour it will spread gradually in a branchy kind of way and you may now lead it up to the outlines already determined and play it with the brush till it fills its place well then let it dry and it will be as flat and pure as a single dash yet defining all the complicated forms accurately  having thus obtained the power of laying on a tolerably flat tint you must try to lay on a gradated one prepare the colour with three or four teaspoonfuls of water then when it is mixed pour away about twothirds of it keeping a teaspoonful of pale colour sloping your paper as before draw two pencil lines all the way down leaving a space between them of the width of a square on your chessboard begin at the top of your paper between the lines and having struck on the first brushful of colour and led it down a little dip your brush deep in water and mix up the colour on the plate quickly with as much more water as the brush takes up at that one dip then with this paler colour lead the tint farther down dip in water again mix the colour again and thus lead down the tint always dipping in water once between each replenishing of the brush and stirring the colour on the plate well but as quickly as you can go on until the colour has become so pale that you cannot see it then wash your brush thoroughly in water and carry the wave down a little farther with that and then absorb it with the dry brush and leave it to dry  if you get to the bottom of your paper before your colour gets pale you may either take longer paper or begin with the tint as it was when you left off on another sheet but be sure to exhaust it to pure whiteness at last when all is quite dry recommence at the top with another similar mixture of colour and go down in the same way then again and then again and so continually until the colour at the top of the paper is as dark as your cake of prussian blue and passes down into pure white paper at the end of your column with a perfectly smooth gradation from one into the other  you will find at first that the paper gets mottled or wavy instead of evenly gradated this is because at some places you have taken up more water in your brush than at others or not mixed it thoroughly on the plate or led one tint too far before replenishing with the next practice only will enable you to do it well the best artists cannot always get gradations of this kind quite to their minds nor do they ever leave them on their pictures without after touching  as you get more power and can strike the colour more quickly down you will be able to gradate in less compass205 beginning with a small quantity of colour and adding a drop of water instead of a brushful with finer brushes also you may gradate to a less scale but slight skill will enable you to test the relations of colour to shade as far as is necessary for your immediate progress which is to be done thus  take cakes of lake of gamboge of sepia of blueblack of cobalt and vermilion and prepare gradated columns exactly as you have done with the prussian blue of the lake and blueblack206 cut a narrow slip all the way down of each gradated colour and set the three slips side by side fasten them down and rule lines at equal distances across all the three so as to divide them into fifty degrees and number the degrees of each from light to dark 1 2 3 c if you have gradated them rightly the darkest part either of the red or blue will be nearly equal in power to the darkest part of the blueblack and any degree of the black slip will also accurately enough for our purpose balance in weight the degree similarly numbered in the red or the blue slip then when you are drawing from objects of a crimson or blue colour if you can match their colour by any compartment of the crimson or blue in your scales the grey in the compartment of the grey scale marked with the same number is the grey which must represent that crimson or blue in your light and shade drawing  next prepare scales with gamboge cobalt and vermilion you will find that you cannot darken these beyond a certain point207 for yellow and scarlet so long as they remain yellow and scarlet cannot approach to black we cannot have properly speaking a dark yellow or dark scarlet make your scales of full yellow blue and scarlet halfway down passing then gradually to white afterwards use lake to darken the upper half of the vermilion and gamboge and prussian blue to darken the cobalt you will thus have three more scales passing from white nearly to black through yellow and orange through skyblue and through scarlet by mixing the gamboge and prussian blue you may make another with green mixing the cobalt and lake another with violet the sepia alone will make a forcible brown one and so on until you have as many scales as you like passing from black to white through different colours then supposing your scales properly gradated and equally divided the compartment or degree no 1 of the grey will represent in chiaroscuro the no 1 of all the other colours no 2 of grey the no 2 of the other colours and so on  it is only necessary however in this matter that you should understand the principle for it would never be possible for you to gradate your scales so truly as to make them practically accurate and serviceable and even if you could unless you had about ten thousand scales and were able to change them faster than ever juggler changed cards you could not in a day measure the tints on so much as one side of a frostbitten apple but when once you fully understand the principle and see how all colours contain as it were a certain quantity of darkness or power of dark relief from whitesome more some less and how this pitch or power of each may be represented by equivalent values of grey you will soon be able to arrive shrewdly at an approximation by a glance of the eye without any measuring scale at all  you must now go on again with the pen drawing patterns and any shapes of shade that you think pretty as veinings in marble or tortoiseshell spots in surfaces of shells c as tenderly as you can in the darknesses that correspond to their colours and when you find you can do this successfully it is time to begin rounding   exercise viii  go out into your garden or into the road and pick up the first round or oval stone you can find not very white nor very dark and the smoother it is the better only it must not shine draw your table near the window and put the stone which i will suppose is about the size of a in fig 5 it had better not be much larger on a piece of not very white paper on the table in front of you sit so that the light may come from your left else the shadow of the pencil point interferes with your sight of your work you must not let the sun fall on the stone but only ordinary light therefore choose a window which the sun does not come in at if you can shut the shutters of the other windows in the room it will be all the better but this is not of much consequence  now if you can draw that stone you can draw anything i mean anything that is drawable many things sea foam for instance cannot be drawn at all only the idea of them more or less suggested but if you can draw the stone rightly every thing within reach of art is also within yours  for all drawing depends primarily on your power of representing roundness if you can once do that all the rest is easy and straightforward if you cannot do that nothing else that you may be able to do will be of any use for nature is all made up of roundnesses not the roundness of perfect globes but of variously curved surfaces boughs are rounded leaves are rounded stones are rounded clouds are rounded cheeks are rounded and curls are rounded there is no more flatness in the natural world than there is vacancy the world itself is round and so is all that is in it more or less except human work which is often very flat indeed  therefore set yourself steadily to conquer that round stone and you have won the battle  look your stone antagonist boldly in the face you will see that the side of it next the window is lighter than most of the paper that the side of it farthest from the window is darker than the paper and that the light passes into the dark gradually while a shadow is thrown to the right on the paper itself by the stone the general appearance of things being more or less as in a fig 5 the spots on the stone excepted of which more presently  now remember always what was stated in the outset that every thing you can see in nature is seen only so far as it is lighter or darker than the things about it or of a different colour from them it is either seen as a patch of one colour on a ground of another or as a pale thing relieved from a dark thing or a dark thing from a pale thing and if you can put on patches of colour or shade of exactly the same size shape and gradations as those on the object and its ground you will produce the appearance of the object and its ground the best draughtsmantitian and paul veronese themselvescould do no more than this and you will soon be able to get some power of doing it in an inferior way if you once understand the exceeding simplicity of what is to be done suppose you have a brown book on a white sheet of paper on a red tablecloth you have nothing to do but to put on spaces of red white and brown in the same shape and gradated from dark to light in the same degrees and your drawing is done if you will not look at what you see if you try to put on brighter or duller colours than are there if you try to put them on with a dash or a blot or to cover your paper with vigorous lines or to produce anything in fact but the plain unaffected and finished tranquillity of the thing before you you need not hope to get on nature will show you nothing if you set yourself up for her master but forget yourself and try to obey her and you will find obedience easier and happier than you think  the real difficulties are to get the refinement of the forms and the evenness of the gradations you may depend upon it when you are dissatisfied with your work it is always too coarse or too uneven it may not be wrongin all probability is not wrong in any socalled great point but its edges are not true enough in outline and its shades are in blotches or scratches or full of white holes get it more tender and more true and you will find it is more powerful  illustration fig 5  do not therefore think your drawing must be weak because you have a finely pointed pen in your hand till you can draw with that you can draw with nothing when you can draw with that you can draw with a log of wood charred at the end true boldness and power are only to be gained by care even in fencing and dancing all ultimate ease depends on early precision in the commencement much more in singing or drawing  now i do not want you to copy fig 5 but to copy the stone before you in the way that fig 5 is done to which end first measure the extreme length of the stone with compasses and mark that length on your paper then between the points marked leave something like the form of the stone in light scrawling the paper all over round it as at b fig 5 you cannot rightly see what the form of the stone really is till you begin finishing so sketch it in quite rudely only rather leave too much room for the high light than too little and then more cautiously fill in the shade shutting the light gradually up and putting in the dark cautiously on the dark side you need not plague yourself about accuracy of shape because till you have practised a great deal it is impossible for you to draw that shape quite truly and you must gradually gain correctness by means of these various exercises what you have mainly to do at present is to get the stone to look solid and round not much minding what its exact contour isonly draw it as nearly right as you can without vexation and you will get it more right by thus feeling your way to it in shade than if you tried to draw the outline at first for you can see no outline what you see is only a certain space of gradated shade with other such spaces about it and those pieces of shade you are to imitate as nearly as you can by scrawling the paper over till you get them to the right shape with the same gradations which they have in nature and this is really more likely to be done well if you have to fight your way through a little confusion in the sketch than if you have an accurately traced outline for instance i was going to draw beside a another effect on the stone reflected light bringing its dark side out from the background but when i had laid on the first few touches i thought it would be better to stop and let you see how i had begun it at b in which beginning it will be observed that nothing is so determined but that i can more or less modify and add to or diminish the contour as i work on the lines which suggest the outline being blended with the others if i do not want them and the having to fill up the vacancies and conquer the irregularities of such a sketch will probably secure a higher completion at last than if half an hour had been spent in getting a true outline before beginning  in doing this however take care not to get the drawing too dark in order to ascertain what the shades of it really are cut a round hole about half the size of a pea in a piece of white paper the colour of that you use to draw on hold this bit of paper with the hole in it between you and your stone and pass the paper backwards and forwards so as to see the different portions of the stone or other subject through the hole you will find that thus the circular hole looks like one of the patches of colour you have been accustomed to match only changing in depth as it lets different pieces of the stone be seen through it you will be able thus actually to match the colour of the stone at any part of it by tinting the paper beside the circular opening and you will find that this opening never looks quite black but that all the roundings of the stone are given by subdued greys208  you will probably find also that some parts of the stone or of the paper it lies on look luminous through the opening so that the little circle then tells as a light spot instead of a dark spot when this is so you cannot imitate it for you have no means of getting light brighter than white paper but by holding the paper more sloped towards the light you will find that many parts of the stone which before looked light through the hole then look dark through it and if you can place the paper in such a position that every part of the stone looks slightly dark the little hole will tell always as a spot of shade and if your drawing is put in the same light you can imitate or match every gradation you will be amazed to find under these circumstances how slight the differences of tint are by which through infinite delicacy of gradation nature can express form  if any part of your subject will obstinately show itself as a light through the hole that part you need not hope to imitate leave it white you can do no more  when you have done the best you can to get the general form proceed to finish by imitating the texture and all the cracks and stains of the stone as closely as you can and note in doing this that cracks or fissures of any kind whether between stones in walls or in the grain of timber or rocks or in any of the thousand other conditions they present are never expressible by single black lines or lines of simple shadow a crack must always have its complete system of light and shade however small its scale it is in reality a little ravine with a dark or shady side and light or sunny side and usually shadow in the bottom this is one of the instances in which it may be as well to understand the reason of the appearance it is not often so in drawing for the aspects of things are so subtle and confused that they cannot in general be explained and in the endeavour to explain some we are sure to lose sight of others while the natural overestimate of the importance of those on which the attention is fixed causes us to exaggerate them so that merely scientific draughtsmen caricature a third part of nature and miss twothirds the best scholar is he whose eye is so keen as to see at once how the thing looks and who need not therefore trouble himself with any reasons why it looks so but few people have this acuteness of perception and to those who are destitute of it a little pointing out of rule and reason will be a help especially when a master is not near them i never allow my own pupils to ask the reason of anything because as i watch their work i can always show them how the thing is and what appearance they are missing in it but when a master is not by to direct the sight science may here and there be allowed to do so in his stead  generally then every solid illumined objectfor instance the stone you are drawinghas a light side turned towards the light a dark side turned away from the light and a shadow which is cast on something else as by the stone on the paper it is set upon you may sometimes be placed so as to see only the light side and shadow and sometimes only the dark side and shadow and sometimes both or either without the shadow but in most positions solid objects will show all the three as the stone does here  hold up your hand with the edge of it towards you as you sit now with your side to the window so that the flat of your hand is turned to the window you will see one side of your hand distinctly lighted the other distinctly in shade here are light side and dark side with no seen shadow the shadow being detached perhaps on the table perhaps on the other side of the room you need not look for it at present  take a sheet of notepaper and holding it edgeways as you hold your hand wave it up and down past the side of your hand which is turned from the light the paper being of course farther from the window you will see as it passes a strong gleam of light strike on your hand and light it considerably on its dark side this light is reflected light it is thrown back from the paper on which it strikes first in coming from the window to the surface of your hand just as a ball would be if somebody threw it through the window at the wall and you caught it at the rebound  next instead of the notepaper take a red book or a piece of scarlet cloth you will see that the gleam of light falling on your hand as you wave the book is now reddened take a blue book and you will find the gleam is blue thus every object will cast some of its own colour back in the light that it reflects  now it is not only these books or papers that reflect light to your hand every object in the room on that side of it reflects some but more feebly and the colours mixing all together form a neutral209 light which lets the colour of your hand itself be more distinctly seen than that of any object which reflects light to it but if there were no reflected light that side of your hand would look as black as a coal  objects are seen therefore in general partly by direct light and partly by light reflected from the objects around them or from the atmosphere and clouds the colour of their light sides depends much on that of the direct light and that of the dark sides on the colours of the objects near them it is therefore impossible to say beforehand what colour an object will have at any point of its surface that colour depending partly on its own tint and partly on infinite combinations of rays reflected from other things the only certain fact about dark sides is that their colour will be changeful and that a picture which gives them merely darker shades of the colour of the light sides must assuredly be bad  now lay your hand flat on the white paper you are drawing on you will see one side of each finger lighted one side dark and the shadow of your hand on the paper here therefore are the three divisions of shade seen at once and although the paper is white and your hand of a rosy colour somewhat darker than white yet you will see that the shadow all along just under the finger which casts it is darker than the flesh and is of a very deep grey the reason of this is that much light is reflected from the paper to the dark side of your finger but very little is reflected from other things to the paper itself in that chink under your finger  in general for this reason a shadow or at any rate the part of the shadow nearest the object is darker than the dark side of the object i say in general because a thousand accidents may interfere to prevent its being so take a little bit of glass as a wineglass or the inkbottle and play it about a little on the side of your hand farthest from the window you will presently find you are throwing gleams of light all over the dark side of your hand and in some positions of the glass the reflection from it will annihilate the shadow altogether and you will see your hand dark on the white paper now a stupid painter would represent for instance a drinkingglass beside the hand of one of his figures and because he had been taught by rule that shadow was darker than the dark side he would never think of the reflection from the glass but paint a dark grey under the hand just as if no glass were there but a great painter would be sure to think of the true effect and paint it and then comes the stupid critic and wonders why the hand is so light on its dark side  thus it is always dangerous to assert anything as a rule in matters of art yet it is useful for you to remember that in a general way a shadow is darker than the dark side of the thing that casts it supposing the colours otherwise the same that is to say when a white object casts a shadow on a white surface or a dark object on a dark surface the rule will not hold if the colours are different the shadow of a black object on a white surface being of course not so dark usually as the black thing casting it the only way to ascertain the ultimate truth in such matters is to look for it but in the meantime you will be helped by noticing that the cracks in the stone are little ravines on one side of which the light strikes sharply while the other is in shade this dark side usually casts a little darker shadow at the bottom of the crack and the general tone of the stone surface is not so bright as the light bank of the ravine and therefore if you get the surface of the object of a uniform tint more or less indicative of shade and then scratch out a white spot or streak in it of any shape by putting a dark touch beside this white one you may turn it as you choose into either a ridge or an incision into either a boss or a cavity if you put the dark touch on the side of it nearest the sun or rather nearest the place that the light comes from you will make it a cut or cavity if you put it on the opposite side you will make it a ridge or mound and the complete success of the effect depends less on depth of shade than on the rightness of the drawing that is to say on the evident correspondence of the form of the shadow with the form that casts it in drawing rocks or wood or anything irregularly shaped you will gain far more by a little patience in following the forms carefully though with slight touches than by laboured finishing of textures of surface and transparencies of shadow  when you have got the whole well into shape proceed to lay on the stains and spots with great care quite as much as you gave to the forms very often spots or bars of local colour do more to express form than even the light and shade and they are always interesting as the means by which nature carries light into her shadows and shade into her lights an art of which we shall have more to say hereafter in speaking of composition fig 5 is a rough sketch of a fossil seaurchin in which the projections of the shell are of black flint coming through a chalky surface these projections form dark spots in the light and their sides rising out of the shadow form smaller whitish spots in the dark you may take such scattered lights as these out with the penknife provided you are just as careful to place them rightly as if you got them by a more laborious process  when you have once got the feeling of the way in which gradation expresses roundness and projection you may try your strength on anything natural or artificial that happens to take your fancy provided it be not too complicated in form i have asked you to draw a stone first because any irregularities and failures in your shading will be less offensive to you as being partly characteristic of the rough stone surface than they would be in a more delicate subject and you may as well go on drawing rounded stones of different shapes for a little while till you find you can really shade delicately you may then take up folds of thick white drapery a napkin or towel thrown carelessly on the table is as good as anything and try to express them in the same way only now you will find that your shades must be wrought with perfect unity and tenderness or you will lose the flow of the folds always remember that a little bit perfected is worth more than many scrawls whenever you feel yourself inclined to scrawl give up work resolutely and do not go back to it till next day of course your towel or napkin must be put on something that may be locked up so that its folds shall not be disturbed till you have finished if you find that the folds will not look right get a photograph of a piece of drapery there are plenty now to be bought taken from the sculpture of the cathedrals of rheims amiens and chartres which will at once educate your hand and your taste and copy some piece of that you will then ascertain what it is that is wanting in your studies from nature whether more gradation or greater watchfulness of the disposition of the folds probably for some time you will find yourself failing painfully in both for drapery is very difficult to follow in its sweeps but do not lose courage for the greater the difficulty the greater the gain in the effort if your eye is more just in measurement of form than delicate in perception of tint a pattern on the folded surface will help you try whether it does or not and if the patterned drapery confuses you keep for a time to the simple white one but if it helps you continue to choose patterned stuffs tartans and simple chequered designs are better at first than flowered ones and even though it should confuse you begin pretty soon to use a pattern occasionally copying all the distortions and perspective modifications of it among the folds with scrupulous care  neither must you suppose yourself condescending in doing this the greatest masters are always fond of drawing patterns and the greater they are the more pains they take to do it truly210 nor can there be better practice at any time as introductory to the nobler complication of natural detail for when you can draw the spots which follow the folds of a printed stuff you will have some chance of following the spots which fall into the folds of the skin of a leopard as he leaps but if you cannot draw the manufacture assuredly you will never be able to draw the creature so the cloudings on a piece of wood carefully drawn will be the best introduction to the drawing of the clouds of the sky or the waves of the sea and the dead leafpatterns on a damask drapery well rendered will enable you to disentangle masterfully the living leafpatterns of a thorn thicket or a violet bank  observe however in drawing any stuffs or bindings of books or other finely textured substances do not trouble yourself as yet much about the woolliness or gauziness of the thing but get it right in shade and fold and true in pattern we shall see in the course of afterpractice how the penned lines may be made indicative of texture but at present attend only to the light and shade and pattern you will be puzzled at first by lustrous surfaces but a little attention will show you that the expression of these depends merely on the right drawing of their light and shade and reflections put a small black japanned tray on the table in front of some books and you will see it reflects the objects beyond it as in a little black rippled pond its own colour mingling always with that of the reflected objects draw these reflections of the books properly making them dark and distorted as you will see that they are and you will find that this gives the lustre to your tray it is not well however to draw polished objects in general practice only you should do one or two in order to understand the aspect of any lustrous portion of other things such as you cannot avoid the gold for instance on the edges of books or the shining of silk and damask in which lies a great part of the expression of their folds observe also that there are very few things which are totally without lustre you will frequently find a light which puzzles you on some apparently dull surface to be the dim image of another object  and now as soon as you can conscientiously assure me that with the point of the pen or pencil you can lay on any form and shade you like i give you leave to use the brush with one coloursepia or blueblack or mixed cobalt and blueblack or neutral tint and this will much facilitate your study and refresh you but preliminarily you must do one or two more exercises in tinting   exercise ix  prepare your colour as before directed take a brush full of it and strike it on the paper in any irregular shape as the brush gets dry sweep the surface of the paper with it as if you were dusting the paper very lightly every such sweep of the brush will leave a number of more or less minute interstices in the colour the lighter and faster every dash the better then leave the whole to dry and as soon as it is dry with little colour in your brush so that you can bring it to a fine point fill up all the little interstices one by one so as to make the whole as even as you can and fill in the larger gaps with more colour always trying to let the edges of the first and of the newly applied colour exactly meet and not lap over each other when your new colour dries you will find it in places a little paler than the first retouch it therefore trying to get the whole to look quite one piece a very small bit of colour thus filled up with your very best care and brought to look as if it had been quite even from the first will give you better practice and more skill than a great deal filled in carelessly so do it with your best patience not leaving the most minute spot of white and do not fill in the large pieces first and then go to the small but quietly and steadily cover in the whole up to a marked limit then advance a little farther and so on thus always seeing distinctly what is done and what undone   exercise x  lay a coat of the blue prepared as usual over a whole square of paper let it dry then another coat over fourfifths of the square or thereabouts leaving the edge rather irregular than straight and let it dry then another coat over threefifths another over twofifths and the last over onefifth so that the square may present the appearance of gradual increase in darkness in five bands each darker than the one beyond it then with the brush rather dry as in the former exercise when filling up the interstices try with small touches like those used in the pen etching only a little broader to add shade delicately beyond each edge so as to lead the darker tints into the paler ones imperceptibly by touching the paper very lightly and putting a multitude of little touches crossing and recrossing in every direction you will gradually be able to work up to the darker tints outside of each so as quite to efface their edges and unite them tenderly with the next tint the whole square when done should look evenly shaded from dark to pale with no bars only a crossing texture of touches something like chopped straw over the whole211  next take your rounded pebble arrange it in any light and shade you like outline it very loosely with the pencil put on a wash of colour prepared very pale quite flat over all of it except the highest light leaving the edge of your colour quite sharp then another wash extending only over the darker parts leaving the edge of that sharp also as in tinting the square then another wash over the still darker parts and another over the darkest leaving each edge to dry sharp then with the small touches efface the edges reinforce the darks and work the whole delicately together as you would with the pen till you have got it to the likeness of the true light and shade you will find that the tint underneath is a great help and that you can now get effects much more subtle and complete than with the pen merely  the use of leaving the edges always sharp is that you may not trouble or vex the colour but let it lie as it falls suddenly on the paper colour looks much more lovely when it has been laid on with a dash of the brush and left to dry in its own way than when it has been dragged about and disturbed so that it is always better to let the edges and forms be a little wrong even if one cannot correct them afterwards than to lose this fresh quality of the tint very great masters in watercolour can lay on the true forms at once with a dash and bad masters in watercolour lay on grossly false forms with a dash and leave them false for people in general not knowing false from true are as much pleased with the appearance of power in the irregular blot as with the presence of power in the determined one but we in our beginnings must do as much as we can with the broad dash and then correct with the point till we are quite right we must take care to be right at whatever cost of pains and then gradually we shall find we can be right with freedom  i have hitherto limited you to colour mixed with two or three teaspoonfuls of water but in finishing your light and shade from the stone you may as you efface the edge of the palest coat towards the light use the colour for the small touches with more and more water till it is so pale as not to be perceptible thus you may obtain a perfect gradation to the light and in reinforcing the darks when they are very dark you may use less and less water if you take the colour tolerably dark on your brush only always liquid not pasty and dash away the superfluous colour on blottingpaper you will find that touching the paper very lightly with the dry brush you can by repeated touches produce a dusty kind of bloom very valuable in giving depth to shadow but it requires great patience and delicacy of hand to do this properly you will find much of this kind of work in the grounds and shadows of william hunts drawings212  as you get used to the brush and colour you will gradually find out their ways for yourself and get the management of them nothing but practice will do this perfectly but you will often save yourself much discouragement by remembering what i have so often assertedthat if anything goes wrong it is nearly sure to be refinement that is wanting not force and connexion not alteration if you dislike the state your drawing is in do not lose patience with it nor dash at it nor alter its plan nor rub it desperately out at the place you think wrong but look if there are no shadows you can gradate more perfectly no little gaps and rents you can fill no forms you can more delicately define and do not rush at any of the errors or incompletions thus discerned but efface or supply slowly and you will soon find your drawing take another look a very useful expedient in producing some effects is to wet the paper and then lay the colour on it more or less wet according to the effect you want you will soon see how prettily it gradates itself as it dries when dry you can reinforce it with delicate stippling when you want it darker also while the colour is still damp on the paper by drying your brush thoroughly and touching the colour with the brush so dried you may take out soft lights with great tenderness and precision try all sorts of experiments of this kind noticing how the colour behaves but remembering always that your final results must be obtained and can only be obtained by pure work with the point as much as in the pen drawing  you will find also as you deal with more and more complicated subjects that natures resources in light and shade are so much richer than yours that you cannot possibly get all or anything like all the gradations of shadow in any given group when this is the case determine first to keep the broad masses of things distinct if for instance there is a green book and a white piece of paper and a black inkstand in the group be sure to keep the white paper as a light mass the green book as a middle tint mass the black inkstand as a dark mass and do not shade the folds in the paper or corners of the book so as to equal in depth the darkness of the inkstand the great difference between the masters of light and shade and imperfect artists is the power of the former to draw so delicately as to express form in a darkcoloured object with little light and in a lightcoloured object with little darkness and it is better even to leave the forms here and there unsatisfactorily rendered than to lose the general relations of the great masses and this observe not because masses are grand or desirable things in your composition for with composition at present you have nothing whatever to do but because it is a fact that things do so present themselves to the eyes of men and that we see paper book and inkstand as three separate things before we see the wrinkles or chinks or corners of any of the three understand therefore at once that no detail can be as strongly expressed in drawing as it is in the reality and strive to keep all your shadows and marks and minor markings on the masses lighter than they appear to be in nature you are sure otherwise to get them too dark you will in doing this find that you cannot get the projection of things sufficiently shown but never mind that there is no need that they should appear to project but great need that their relations of shade to each other should be preserved all deceptive projection is obtained by partial exaggeration of shadow and whenever you see it you may be sure the drawing is more or less bad a thoroughly fine drawing or painting will always show a slight tendency towards flatness  observe on the other hand that however white an object may be there is always some small point of it whiter than the rest you must therefore have a slight tone of grey over everything in your picture except on the extreme high lights even the piece of white paper in your subject must be toned slightly down unless and there are a thousand chances to one against its being so it should all be turned so as fully to front the light by examining the treatment of the white objects in any pictures accessible to you by paul veronese or titian you will soon understand this213  as soon as you feel yourself capable of expressing with the brush the undulations of surfaces and the relations of masses you may proceed to draw more complicated and beautiful things214 and first the boughs of trees now not in mere dark relief but in full rounding take the first bit of branch or stump that comes to hand with a fork in it cut off the ends of the forking branches so as to leave the whole only about a foot in length get a piece of paper the same size fix your bit of branch in some place where its position will not be altered and draw it thoroughly in all its light and shade full size striving above all things to get an accurate expression of its structure at the fork of the branch when once you have mastered the tree at its armpits you will have little more trouble with it  always draw whatever the background happens to be exactly as you see it wherever you have fastened the bough you must draw whatever is behind it ugly or not else you will never know whether the light and shade are right they may appear quite wrong to you only for want of the background and this general law is to be observed in all your studies whatever you draw draw completely and unalteringly else you never know if what you have done is right or whether you could have done it rightly had you tried there is nothing visible out of which you may not get useful practice  next to put the leaves on your boughs gather a small twig with four or five leaves on it put it into water put a sheet of lightcoloured or white paper behind it so that all the leaves may be relieved in dark from the white field then sketch in their dark shape carefully with pencil as you did the complicated boughs in order to be sure that all their masses and interstices are right in shape before you begin shading and complete as far as you can with pen and ink in the manner of fig 6 which is a young shoot of lilac  illustration fig 6  you will probably in spite of all your pattern drawings be at first puzzled by leaf foreshortening especially because the look of retirement or projection depends not so much on the perspective of the leaves themselves as on the double sight of the two eyes now there are certain artifices by which good painters can partly conquer this difficulty as slight exaggerations of force or colour in the nearer parts and of obscurity in the more distant ones but you must not attempt anything of this kind when you are first sketching the leaves shut one of your eyes fix a point in the background to bring the point of one of the leaves against and so sketch the whole bough as you see it in a fixed position looking with one eye only your drawing never can be made to look like the object itself as you see that object with both eyes215 but it can be made perfectly like the object seen with one and you must be content when you have got a resemblance on these terms  in order to get clearly at the notion of the thing to be done take a single long leaf hold it with its point towards you and as flat as you can so as to see nothing of it but its thinness as if you wanted to know how thin it was outline it so then slope it down gradually towards you and watch it as it lengthens out to its full length held perpendicularly down before you draw it in three or four different positions between these extremes with its ribs as they appear in each position and you will soon find out how it must be  draw first only two or three of the leaves then larger clusters and practise in this way more and more complicated pieces of bough and leafage till you find you can master the most difficult arrangements not consisting of more than ten or twelve leaves you will find as you do this if you have an opportunity of visiting any gallery of pictures that you take a much more lively interest than before in the work of the great masters you will see that very often their best backgrounds are composed of little more than a few sprays of leafage carefully studied brought against the distant sky and that another wreath or two form the chief interest of their foregrounds if you live in london you may test your progress accurately by the degree of admiration you feel for the leaves of vine round the head of the bacchus in titians bacchus and ariadne all this however will not enable you to draw a mass of foliage you will find on looking at any rich piece of vegetation that it is only one or two of the nearer clusters that you can by any possibility draw in this complete manner the mass is too vast and too intricate to be thus dealt with  illustration fig 7 a b c  you must now therefore have recourse to some confused mode of execution capable of expressing the confusion of nature and first you must understand what the character of that confusion is if you look carefully at the outer sprays of any tree at twenty or thirty yards distance you will see them defined against the sky in masses which at first look quite definite but if you examine them you will see mingled with the real shapes of leaves many indistinct lines which are some of them stalks of leaves and some leaves seen with the edge turned towards you and coming into sight in a broken way for supposing the real leaf shape to be as at a fig 7 this when removed some yards from the eye will appear dark against the sky as at b then when removed some yards farther still the stalk and point disappear altogether the middle of the leaf becomes little more than a line and the result is the condition at c only with this farther subtlety in the look of it inexpressible in the woodcut that the stalk and point of the leaf though they have disappeared to the eye have yet some influence in checking the light at the places where they exist and cause a slight dimness about the part of the leaf which remains visible so that its perfect effect could only be rendered by two layers of colour one subduing the sky tone a little the next drawing the broken portions of the leaf as at c and carefully indicating the greater darkness of the spot in the middle where the under side of the leaf is  this is the perfect theory of the matter in practice we cannot reach such accuracy but we shall be able to render the general look of the foliage satisfactorily by the following mode of practice  gather a spray of any tree about a foot or eighteen inches long fix it firmly by the stem in anything that will support it steadily put it about eight feet away from you or ten if you are farsighted put a sheet of not very white paper behind it as usual then draw very carefully first placing them with pencil and then filling them up with ink every leaf mass and stalk of it in simple black profile as you see them against the paper fig 8 is a bough of phillyrea so drawn do not be afraid of running the leaves into a black mass when they come together this exercise is only to teach you what the actual shapes of such masses are when seen against the sky  illustration fig 8  make two careful studies of this kind of one bough of every common treeoak ash elm birch beech c in fact if you are good and industrious you will make one such study carefully at least three times a week until you have examples of every sort of tree and shrub you can get branches of you are to make two studies of each bough for this reasonall masses of foliage have an upper and under surface and the side view of them or profile shows a wholly different organisation of branches from that seen in the view from above they are generally seen more or less in profile as you look at the whole tree and nature puts her best composition into the profile arrangement but the view from above or below occurs not unfrequently also and it is quite necessary you should draw it if you wish to understand the anatomy of the tree the difference between the two views is often far greater than you could easily conceive for instance in fig 9 a is the upper view and b the profile of a single spray of phillyrea fig 8 is an intermediate view of a larger bough seen from beneath but at some lateral distance also  illustration fig 9  when you have done a few branches in this manner take one of the drawings and put it first a yard away from you then a yard and a half then two yards observe how the thinner stalks and leaves gradually disappear leaving only a vague and slight darkness where they were and make another study of the effect at each distance taking care to draw nothing more than you really see for in this consists all the difference between what would be merely a miniature drawing of the leaves seen near and a fullsize drawing of the same leaves at a distance by full size i mean the size which they would really appear of if their outline were traced through a pane of glass held at the same distance from the eye at which you mean to hold your drawing you can always ascertain this full size of any object by holding your paper upright before you at the distance from your eye at which you wish your drawing to be seen bring its edge across the object you have to draw and mark upon this edge the points where the outline of the object crosses or goes behind the edge of the paper you will always find it thus measured smaller than you supposed  when you have made a few careful experiments of this kind on your own drawings which are better for practice at first than the real trees because the black profile in the drawing is quite stable and does not shake and is not confused by sparkles of lustre on the leaves you may try the extremities of the real trees only not doing much at a time for the brightness of the sky will dazzle and perplex your sight and this brightness causes i believe some loss of the outline itself at least the chemical action of the light in a photograph extends much within the edges of the leaves and as it were eats them away so that no tree extremity stand it ever so still nor any other form coming against bright sky is truly drawn by a photograph and if you once succeed in drawing a few sprays rightly you will find the result much more lovely and interesting than any photograph can be  all this difficulty however attaches to the rendering merely the dark form of the sprays as they come against the sky within those sprays and in the heart of the tree there is a complexity of a much more embarrassing kind for nearly all leaves have some lustre and all are more or less translucent letting light through them therefore in any given leaf besides the intricacies of its own proper shadows and foreshortenings there are three series of circumstances which alter or hide its forms first shadows cast on it by other leavesoften very forcibly secondly light reflected from its lustrous surface sometimes the blue of the sky sometimes the white of clouds or the sun itself flashing like a star thirdly forms and shadows of other leaves seen as darkness through the translucent parts of the leaf a most important element of foliage effect but wholly neglected by landscape artists in general  the consequence of all this is that except now and then by chance the form of a complete leaf is never seen but a marvellous and quaint confusion very definite indeed in its evidence of direction of growth and unity of action but wholly indefinable and inextricable part by part by any amount of patience you cannot possibly work it out in fac simile though you took a twelvemonths time to a tree and you must therefore try to discover some mode of execution which will more or less imitate by its own variety and mystery the variety and mystery of nature without absolute delineation of detail  now i have led you to this conclusion by observation of tree form only because in that the thing to be proved is clearest but no natural object exists which does not involve in some part or parts of it this inimitableness this mystery of quantity which needs peculiarity of handling and trick of touch to express it completely if leaves are intricate so is moss so is foam so is rock cleavage so are fur and hair and texture of drapery and of clouds and although methods and dexterities of handling are wholly useless if you have not gained first the thorough knowledge of the form of the thing so that if you cannot draw a branch perfectly then much less a tree and if not a wreath of mist perfectly much less a flock of clouds and if not a single grass blade perfectly much less a grass bank yet having once got this power over decisive form you may safelyand must in order to perfection of workcarry out your knowledge by every aid of method and dexterity of hand  but in order to find out what method can do you must now look at art as well as at nature and see what means painters and engravers have actually employed for the expression of these subtleties whereupon arises the question what opportunity have you to obtain engravings you ought if it is at all in your power to possess yourself of a certain number of good examples of turners engraved works if this be not in your power you must just make the best use you can of the shop windows or of any plates of which you can obtain a loan very possibly the difficulty of getting sight of them may stimulate you to put them to better use but supposing your means admit of your doing so possess yourself first of the illustrated edition either of rogerss italy or rogerss poems and then of about a dozen of the plates named in the annexed lists the prefixed letters indicate the particular points deserving your study in each engraving216 be sure therefore that your selection includes at all events one plate marked with each letterof course the plates marked with two or three letters are for the most part the best do not get more than twelve of these plates nor even all the twelve at first for the more engravings you have the less attention you will pay to them it is a general truth that the enjoyment derivable from art cannot be increased in quantity beyond a certain point by quantity of possession it is only spread as it were over a larger surface and very often dulled by finding ideas repeated in different works now for a beginner it is always better that his attention should be concentrated on one or two good things and all his enjoyment founded on them than that he should look at many with divided thoughts he has much to discover and his best way of discovering it is to think long over few things and watch them earnestly it is one of the worst errors of this age to try to know and to see too much the men who seem to know everything never in reality know anything rightly beware of handbook knowledge  these engravings are in general more for you to look at than to copy and they will be of more use to you when we come to talk of composition than they are at present still it will do you a great deal of good sometimes to try how far you can get their delicate texture or gradations of tone as your penandink drawing will be apt to incline too much to a scratchy and broken kind of shade for instance the texture of the white convent wall and the drawing of its tiled roof in the vignette at p 227 of rogerss poems is as exquisite as work can possibly be and it will be a great and profitable achievement if you can at all approach it in like manner if you can at all imitate the dark distant country at p 7 or the sky at p 80 of the same volume or the foliage at pp 12 and 144 it will be good gain and if you can once draw the rolling clouds and running river at p 9 of the italy or the city in the vignette of aosta at p 25 or the moonlight at p 223 you will find that even nature herself cannot afterwards very terribly puzzle you with her torrents or towers or moonlight  you need not copy touch for touch but try to get the same effect and if you feel discouraged by the delicacy required and begin to think that engraving is not drawing and that copying it cannot help you to draw remember that it differs from common drawing only by the difficulties it has to encounter you perhaps have got into a careless habit of thinking that engraving is a mere business easy enough when one has got into the knack of it on the contrary it is a form of drawing more difficult than common drawing by exactly so much as it is more difficult to cut steel than to move the pencil over paper it is true that there are certain mechanical aids and methods which reduce it at certain stages either to pure machine work or to more or less a habit of hand and arm but this is not so in the foliage you are trying to copy of which the best and prettiest parts are always etchedthat is drawn with a fine steel point and free hand only the line made is white instead of black which renders it much more difficult to judge of what you are about and the trying to copy these plates will be good for you because it will awaken you to the real labour and skill of the engraver and make you understand a little how people must work in this world who have really to do anything in it  do not however suppose that i give you the engraving as a modelfar from it but it is necessary you should be able to do as well217 before you think of doing better and you will find many little helps and hints in the various work of it only remember that all engravers foregrounds are bad whenever you see the peculiar wriggling parallel lines of modern engravings become distinct you must not copy nor admire it is only the softer masses and distances and portions of the foliage in the plates marked f which you may copy the best for this purpose if you can get it is the chain bridge over the tees of the england series the thicket on the right is very beautiful and instructive and very like turner the foliage in the ludlow and powis is also remarkably good  besides these line engravings and to protect you from what harm there is in their influence you are to provide yourself if possible with a rembrandt etching or a photograph of one of figures not landscape it does not matter of what subject or whether a sketchy or finished one but the sketchy ones are generally cheapest and will teach you most copy it as well as you can noticing especially that rembrandts most rapid lines have steady purpose and that they are laid with almost inconceivable precision when the object becomes at all interesting the prodigal son death of the virgin abraham and isaac and such others containing incident and character rather than chiaroscuro will be the most instructive you can buy one copy it well then exchange it at little loss for another and so gradually obtain a good knowledge of his system whenever you have an opportunity of examining his work at museums c do so with the greatest care not looking at many things but a long time at each you must also provide yourself if possible with an engraving of albert durers this you will not be able to copy but you must keep it beside you and refer to it as a standard of precision in line if you can get one with a wing in it it will be best the crest with the cock that with the skull and satyr and the melancholy are the best you could have but any will do perfection in chiaroscuro drawing lies between these two masters rembrandt and durer rembrandt is often too loose and vague and durer has little or no effect of mist or uncertainty if you can see anywhere a drawing by leonardo you will find it balanced between the two characters but there are no engravings which present this perfection and your style will be best formed therefore by alternate study of rembrandt and durer lean rather to durer it is better for amateurs to err on the side of precision than on that of vagueness and though as i have just said you cannot copy a durer yet try every now and then a quarter of an inch square or so and see how much nearer you can come you cannot possibly try to draw the leafly crown of the melancholia too often  if you cannot get either a rembrandt or a durer you may still learn much by carefully studying any of george cruikshanks etchings or leechs woodcuts in punch on the free side with alfred rethels and richters218 on the severe side but in so doing you will need to notice the following points  when either the material as the copper or wood or the time of an artist does not permit him to make a perfect drawingthat is to say one in which no lines shall be prominently visibleand he is reduced to show the black lines either drawn by the pen or on the wood it is better to make these lines help as far as may be the expression of texture and form you will thus find many textures as of cloth or grass or flesh and many subtle effects of light expressed by leech with zigzag or crossed or curiously broken lines and you will see that alfred rethel and richter constantly express the direction and rounding of surfaces by the direction of the lines which shade them all these various means of expression will be useful to you as far as you can learn them provided you remember that they are merely a kind of shorthand telling certain facts not in quite the right way but in the only possible way under the conditions and provided in any after use of such means you never try to show your own dexterity but only to get as much record of the object as you can in a given time and that you continually make efforts to go beyond shorthand and draw portions of the objects rightly  and touching this question of direction of lines as indicating that of surface observe these few points  illustration fig 10  if lines are to be distinctly shown it is better that so far as they can indicate any thing by their direction they should explain rather than oppose the general character of the object thus in the piece of woodcut from titian fig 10 the lines are serviceable by expressing not only the shade of the trunk but partly also its roundness and the flow of its grain and albert durer whose work was chiefly engraving sets himself always thus to make his lines as valuable as possible telling much by them both of shade and direction of surface and if you were always to be limited to engraving on copper and did not want to express effects of mist or darkness as well as delicate forms albert durers way of work would be the best example for you but inasmuch as the perfect way of drawing is by shade without lines and the great painters always conceive their subject as complete even when they are sketching it most rapidly you will find that when they are not limited in means they do not much trust to direction of line but will often scratch in the shade of a rounded surface with nearly straight lines that is to say with the easiest and quickest lines possible to themselves when the hand is free the easiest line for it to draw is one inclining from the left upward to the right or vice vers√¢ from the right downwards to the left and when done very quickly the line is hooked a little at the end by the effort at return to the next hence you will always find the pencil chalk or pen sketch of a very great master full of these kind of lines and even if he draws carefully you will find him using simple straight lines from left to right when an inferior master will have used curved ones fig 11 is a fair facsimile of part of a sketch of raphaels which exhibits these characters very distinctly even the careful drawings of leonardo da vinci are shaded most commonly with straight lines and you may always assume it as a point increasing the probability of a drawing being by a great master if you find rounded surfaces such as those of cheeks or lips shaded with straight lines  illustration fig 11  but you will also now understand how easy it must be for dishonest dealers to forge or imitate scrawled sketches like figure 11 and pass them for the work of great masters and how the power of determining the genuineness of a drawing depends entirely on your knowing the facts of the object drawn and perceiving whether the hasty handling is all conducive to the expression of those truths in a great mans work at its fastest no line is thrown away and it is not by the rapidity but the economy of the execution that you know him to be great now to judge of this economy you must know exactly what he meant to do otherwise you cannot of course discern how far he has done it that is you must know the beauty and nature of the thing he was drawing all judgment of art thus finally founds itself on knowledge of nature  but farther observe that this scrawled or economic or impetuous execution is never affectedly impetuous if a great man is not in a hurry he never pretends to be if he has no eagerness in his heart he puts none into his hand if he thinks his effect would be better got with two lines he never to show his dexterity tries to do it with one be assured therefore and this is a matter of great importance that you will never produce a great drawing by imitating the execution of a great master acquire his knowledge and share his feelings and the easy execution will fall from your hand as it did from his but if you merely scrawl because he scrawled or blot because he blotted you will not only never advance in power but every able draughtsman and every judge whose opinion is worth having will know you for a cheat and despise you accordingly  again observe respecting the use of outline  all merely outlined drawings are bad for the simple reason that an artist of any power can always do more and tell more by quitting his outlines occasionally and scratching in a few lines for shade than he can by restricting himself to outline only hence the fact of his so restricting himself whatever may be the occasion shows him to be a bad draughtsman and not to know how to apply his power economically this hard law however bears only on drawings meant to remain in the state in which you see them not on those which were meant to be proceeded with or for some mechanical use it is sometimes necessary to draw pure outlines as an incipient arrangement of a composition to be filled up afterwards with colour or to be pricked through and used as patterns or tracings but if with no such ultimate object making the drawing wholly for its own sake and meaning it to remain in the state he leaves it an artist restricts himself to outline he is a bad draughtsman and his work is bad there is no exception to this law a good artist habitually sees masses not edges and can in every case make his drawing more expressive with any given quantity of work by rapid shade than by contours so that all good work whatever is more or less touched with shade and more or less interrupted as outline  illustration fig 12  hence the published works of retsch and all the english imitations of them and all outline engravings from pictures are bad work and only serve to corrupt the public taste and of such outlines the worst are those which are darkened in some part of their course by way of expressing the dark side as flaxmans from dante and such others because an outline can only be true so long as it accurately represents the form of the given object with one of its edges thus the outline a and the outline b fig 12 are both true outlines of a ball because however thick the line may be whether we take the interior or exterior edge of it that edge of it always draws a true circle but c is a false outline of a ball because either the inner or outer edge of the black line must be an untrue circle else the line could not be thicker in one place than another hence all force as it is called is gained by falsification of the contours so that no artist whose eye is true and fine could endure to look at it it does indeed often happen that a painter sketching rapidly and trying again and again for some line which he cannot quite strike blackens or loads the first line by setting others beside and across it and then a careless observer supposes it has been thickened on purpose or sometimes also at a place where shade is afterwards to enclose the form the painter will strike a broad dash of this shade beside his outline at once looking as if he meant to thicken the outline whereas this broad line is only the first instalment of the future shadow and the outline is really drawn with its inner edge and thus far from good draughtsmen darkening the lines which turn away from the light the tendency with them is rather to darken them towards the light for it is there in general that shade will ultimately enclose them the best example of this treatment that i know is raphaels sketch in the louvre of the head of the angel pursuing heliodorus the one that shows part of the left eye where the dark strong lines which terminate the nose and forehead towards the light are opposed to tender and light ones behind the ear and in other places towards the shade you will see in fig 11 the same principle variously exemplified the principal dark lines in the head and drapery of the arms being on the side turned to the light  all these refinements and ultimate principles however do not affect your drawing for the present you must try to make your outlines as equal as possible and employ pure outline only for the two following purposes either 1 to steady your hand as in exercise ii for if you cannot draw the line itself you will never be able to terminate your shadow in the precise shape required when the line is absent or 2 to give you shorthand memoranda of forms when you are pressed for time thus the forms of distant trees in groups are defined for the most part by the light edge of the rounded mass of the nearer one being shown against the darker part of the rounded mass of a more distant one and to draw this properly nearly as much work is required to round each tree as to round the stone in fig 5 of course you cannot often get time to do this but if you mark the terminal line of each tree as is done by durer in fig 13 you will get a most useful memorandum of their arrangement and a very interesting drawing only observe in doing this you must not because the procedure is a quick one hurry that procedure itself you will find on copying that bit of durer that every one of his lines is firm deliberate and accurately descriptive as far as it goes it means a bush of such a size and such a shape definitely observed and set down it contains a true signalement of every nuttree and appletree and higher bit of hedge all round that village if you have not time to draw thus carefully do not draw at allyou are merely wasting your work and spoiling your taste when you have had four or five years practice you may be able to make useful memoranda at a rapid rate but not yet except sometimes of light and shade in a way of which i will tell you presently and this use of outline note farther is wholly confined to objects which have edges or limits you can outline line a tree or a stone when it rises against another tree or stone but you cannot outline folds in drapery or waves in water if these are to be expressed at all it must be by some sort of shade and therefore the rule that no good drawing can consist throughout of pure outline remains absolute you see in that woodcut of durers his reason for even limiting himself so much to outline as he has in those distant woods and plains is that he may leave them in bright light to be thrown out still more by the dark sky and the dark village spire and the scene becomes real and sunny only by the addition of these shades  illustration fig 13  understanding then thus much of the use of outline we will go back to our question about tree drawing left unanswered at page 60  illustration fig 14  illustration fig 15  we were you remember in pursuit of mystery among the leaves now it is quite easy to obtain mystery and disorder to any extent but the difficulty is to keep organisation in the midst of mystery and you will never succeed in doing this unless you lean always to the definite side and allow yourself rarely to become quite vague at least through all your early practice so after your single groups of leaves your first step must be to conditions like figs 14 and 15 which are careful facsimiles of two portions of a beautiful woodcut of durers the flight into egypt copy these carefullynever mind how little at a time but thoroughly then trace the durer and apply it to your drawing and do not be content till the one fits the other else your eye is not true enough to carry you safely through meshes of real leaves and in the course of doing this you will find that not a line nor dot of durers can be displaced without harm that all add to the effect and either express something or illumine something or relieve something if afterwards you copy any of the pieces of modern tree drawing of which so many rich examples are given constantly in our cheap illustrated periodicals any of the christmas numbers of last years illustrated news or times are full of them you will see that though good and forcible general effect is produced the lines are thrown in by thousands without special intention and might just as well go one way as another so only that there be enough of them to produce all together a wellshaped effect of intricacy and you will find that a little careless scratching about with your pen will bring you very near the same result without an effort but that no scratching of pen nor any fortunate chance nor anything but downright skill and thought will imitate so much as one leaf of durers yet there is considerable intricacy and glittering confusion in the interstices of those vine leaves of his as well as of the grass  illustration fig 16  when you have got familiarised to this firm manner you may draw from nature as much as you like in the same way and when you are tired of the intense care required for this you may fall into a little more easy massing of the leaves as in fig 10 p 66 this is facsimiled from an engraving after titian but an engraving not quite firstrate in manner the leaves being a little too formal still it is a good enough model for your times of rest and when you cannot carry the thing even so far as this you may sketch the forms of the masses as in fig 16219 taking care always to have thorough command over your hand that is not to let the mass take a free shape because your hand ran glibly over the paper but because in nature it has actually a free and noble shape and you have faithfully followed the same  and now that we have come to questions of noble shape as well as true shape and that we are going to draw from nature at our pleasure other considerations enter into the business which are by no means confined to first practice but extend to all practice these as this letter is long enough i should think to satisfy even the most exacting of correspondents i will arrange in a second letter praying you only to excuse the tiresomeness of this first onetiresomeness inseparable from directions touching the beginning of any artand to believe me even though i am trying to set you to dull and hard work      very faithfully yours     j ruskin  footnotes  199 n b this note is only for the satisfaction of incredulous or curious readers you may miss it if you are in a hurry or are willing to take the statement in the text on trust  the perception of solid form is entirely a matter of experience we see nothing but flat colours and it is only by a series of experiments that we find out that a stain of black or grey indicates the dark side of a solid substance or that a faint hue indicates that the object in which it appears is far away the whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what may be called the innocence of the eye that is to say a sort of childish perception of these flat stains of colour merely as such without consciousness of what they signify as a blind man would see them if suddenly gifted with sight  for instance when grass is lighted strongly by the sun in certain directions it is turned from green into a peculiar and somewhat dustylooking yellow if we had been born blind and were suddenly endowed with sight on a piece of grass thus lighted in some parts by the sun it would appear to us that part of the grass was green and part a dusty yellow very nearly of the colour of primroses and if there were primroses near we should think that the sunlighted grass was another mass of plants of the same sulphuryellow colour we should try to gather some of them and then find that the colour went away from the grass when we stood between it and the sun but not from the primroses and by a series of experiments we should find out that the sun was really the cause of the colour in the onenot in the other we go through such processes of experiment unconsciously in childhood and having once come to conclusions touching the signification of certain colours we always suppose that we see what we only know and have hardly any consciousness of the real aspect of the signs we have learned to interpret very few people have any idea that sunlighted grass is yellow  now a highly accomplished artist has always reduced himself as nearly as possible to this condition of infantine sight he sees the colours of nature exactly as they are and therefore perceives at once in the sunlighted grass the precise relation between the two colours that form its shade and light to him it does not seem shade and light but bluish green barred with gold  strive therefore first of all to convince yourself of this great fact about sight this in your hand which you know by experience and touch to be a book is to your eye nothing but a patch of white variously gradated and spotted this other thing near you which by experience you know to be a table is to your eye only a patch of brown variously darkened and veined and so on and the whole art of painting consists merely in perceiving the shape and depth of these patches of colour and putting patches of the same size depth and shape on canvas the only obstacle to the success of painting is that many of the real colours are brighter and paler than it is possible to put on canvas we must put darker ones to represent them  200 stale crumb of bread is better if you are making a delicate drawing than indiarubber for it disturbs the surface of the paper less but it crumbles about the room and makes a mess and besides you waste the good bread which is wrong and your drawing will not for a long while be worth the crumbs so use indiarubber very lightly or if heavily pressing it only not passing it over the paper and leave what pencil marks that will not come away so without minding them in a finished drawing the uneffaced penciling is often serviceable helping the general tone and enabling you to take out little bright lights  201 what is usually so much sought after under the term freedom is the character of the drawing of a great master in a hurry whose hand is so thoroughly disciplined that when pressed for time he can let it fly as it will and it will not go far wrong but the hand of a great master at real work is never free its swiftest dash is under perfect government paul veronese or tintoret could pause within a hairs breadth of any appointed mark in their fastest touches and follow within a hairs breadth the previously intended curve you must never therefore aim at freedom it is not required of your drawing that it should be free but that it should be right in time you will be able to do right easily and then your work will be free in the best sense but there is no merit in doing wrong easily  these remarks however do not apply to the lines used in shading which it will be remembered are to be made as quickly as possible the reason of this is that the quicker a line is drawn the lighter it is at the ends and therefore the more easily joined with other lines and concealed by them the object in perfect shading being to conceal the lines as much as possible  and observe in this exercise the object is more to get firmness of hand than accuracy of eye for outline for there are no outlines in nature and the ordinary student is sure to draw them falsely if he draws them at all do not therefore be discouraged if you find mistakes continue to occur in your outlines be content at present if you find your hand gaining command over the curves  202 if you can get any pieces of dead white porcelain not glazed they will be useful models  203 artists who glance at this book may be surprised at this permission my chief reason is that i think it more necessary that the pupils eye should be trained to accurate perception of the relations of curve and right lines by having the latter absolutely true than that he should practice drawing straight lines but also i believe though i am not quite sure of this that he never ought to be able to draw a straight line i do not believe a perfectly trained hand ever can draw a line without some curvature in it or some variety of direction prout could draw a straight line but i do not believe raphael could nor tintoret a great draughtsman can as far as i have observed draw every line but a straight one  204 or if you feel able to do so scratch them in with confused quick touches indicating the general shape of the cloud or mist of twigs round the main branches but do not take much trouble about them  205 it is more difficult at first to get in colour a narrow gradation than an extended one but the ultimate difficulty is as with the pen to make the gradation go far  206 of course all the columns of colour are to be of equal length  207 the degree of darkness you can reach with the given colour is always indicated by the colour of the solid cake in the box  208 the figure a fig 5 is very dark but this is to give an example of all kinds of depth of tint without repeated figures  209 nearly neutral in ordinary circumstances but yet with quite different tones in its neutrality according to the colours of the various reflected rays that compose it  210 if we had any business with the reasons of this i might perhaps be able to show you some metaphysical ones for the enjoyment by truly artistical minds of the changes wrought by light and shade and perspective in patterned surfaces but this is at present not to the point and all that you need to know is that the drawing of such things is good exercise and moreover a kind of exercise which titian veronese tintoret giorgione and turner all enjoyed and strove to excel in  211 the use of acquiring this habit of execution is that you may be able when you begin to colour to let one hue be seen in minute portions gleaming between the touches of another  212 william hunt of the old watercolour society  213 at marlborough house among the four principal examples of turners later watercolour drawing perhaps the most neglected is that of fishingboats and fish at sunset it is one of his most wonderful works though unfinished if you examine the larger white fishingboat sail you will find it has a little spark of pure white in its righthand upper corner about as large as a minute pins head and that all the surface of the sail is gradated to that focus try to copy this sail once or twice and you will begin to understand turners work similarly the wing of the cupid in correggios large picture in the national gallery is focussed to two little grains of white at the top of it the points of light on the white flower in the wreath round the head of the dancing childfaun in titians bacchus and ariadne exemplify the same thing  214 i shall not henceforward number the exercises recommended as they are distinguished only by increasing difficulty of subject not by difference of method  215 if you understand the principle of the stereoscope you will know why if not it does not matter trust me for the truth of the statement as i cannot explain the principle without diagrams and much loss of

paper with your pen but you must be able to get tones as even and touches as firm  218 see for account of these plates the appendix on works to be studied  219 this sketch is not of a tree standing on its head though it looks like it you will find it explained presently     letter ii  sketching from nature   my dear reader  the work we have already gone through together has i hope enabled you to draw with fair success either rounded and simple masses like stones or complicated arrangements of form like those of leaves provided only these masses or complexities will stay quiet for you to copy and do not extend into quantity so great as to baffle your patience but if we are now to go out to the fields and to draw anything like a complete landscape neither of these conditions will any more be observed for us the clouds will not wait while we copy their heaps or clefts the shadows will escape from us as we try to shape them each in its stealthy minute march still leaving light where its tremulous edge had rested the moment before and involving in eclipse objects that had seemed safe from its influence and instead of the small clusters of leaves which we could reckon point by point embarrassing enough even though numerable we have now leaves as little to be counted as the sands of the sea and restless perhaps as its foam  in all that we have to do now therefore direct imitation becomes more or less impossible it is always to be aimed at so far as it is possible and when you have time and opportunity some portions of a landscape may as you gain greater skill be rendered with an approximation almost to mirrored portraiture still whatever skill you may reach there will always be need of judgment to choose and of speed to seize certain things that are principal or fugitive and you must give more and more effort daily to the observance of characteristic points and the attainment of concise methods  i have directed your attention early to foliage for two reasons first that it is always accessible as a study and secondly that its modes of growth present simple examples of the importance of leading or governing lines it is by seizing these leading lines when we cannot seize all that likeness and expression are given to a portrait and grace and a kind of vital truth to the rendering of every natural form i call it vital truth because these chief lines are always expressive of the past history and present action of the thing they show in a mountain first how it was built or heaped up and secondly how it is now being worn away and from what quarter the wildest storms strike it in a tree they show what kind of fortune it has had to endure from its childhood how troublesome trees have come in its way and pushed it aside and tried to strangle or starve it where and when kind trees have sheltered it and grown up lovingly together with it bending as it bent what winds torment it most what boughs of it behave best and bear most fruit and so on in a wave or cloud these leading lines show the run of the tide and of the wind and the sort of change which the water or vapour is at any moment enduring in its form as it meets shore or counterwave or melting sunshine now remember nothing distinguishes great men from inferior men more than their always whether in life or in art knowing the way things are going your dunce thinks they are standing still and draws them all fixed your wise man sees the change or changing in them and draws them sothe animal in its motion the tree in its growth the cloud in its course the mountain in its wearing away try always whenever you look at a form to see the lines in it which have had power over its past fate and will have power over its futurity those are its awful lines see that you seize on those whatever else you miss thus the leafage in fig 16 p 291 grew round the root of a stone pine on the brow of a crag at sestri near genoa and all the sprays of it are thrust away in their first budding by the great rude root and spring out in every direction round it as water splashes when a heavy stone is thrown into it then when they have got clear of the root they begin to bend up again some of them being little stone pines themselves have a great notion of growing upright if they can and this struggle of theirs to recover their straight road towards the sky after being obliged to grow sideways in their early years is the effort that will mainly influence their future destiny and determine if they are to be crabbed forky pines striking from that rock of sestri whose clefts nourish them with bared red lightning of angry arms towards the sea or if they are to be goodly and solemn pines with trunks like pillars of temples and the purple burning of their branches sheathed in deep globes of cloudy green those then are their fateful lines see that you give that spring and resilience whatever you leave ungiven depend upon it their chief beauty is in these  illustration fig 17  illustration fig 18  illustration fig 19  so in trees in general and bushes large or small you will notice that though the boughs spring irregularly and at various angles there is a tendency in all to stoop less and less as they near the top of the tree this structure typified in the simplest possible terms at c fig 17 is common to all trees that i know of and it gives them a certain plumy character and aspect of unity in the hearts of their branches which are essential to their beauty the stem does not merely send off a wild branch here and there to take its own way but all the branches share in one great fountainlike impulse each has a curve and a path to take which fills a definite place and each terminates all its minor branches at its outer extremity so as to form a great outer curve whose character and proportion are peculiar for each species that is to say the general type or idea of a tree is not as a fig 17 but as b in which observe the boughs all carry their minor divisions right out to the bounding curve not but that smaller branches by thousands terminate in the heart of the tree but the idea and main purpose in every branch are to carry all its child branches well out to the air and light and let each of them however small take its part in filling the united flow of the bounding curve so that the type of each separate bough is again not a but b fig 18 approximating that is to say so far to the structure of a plant of broccoli as to throw the great mass of spray and leafage out to a rounded surface therefore beware of getting into a careless habit of drawing boughs with successive sweeps of the pen or brush one hanging to the other as in fig 19 if you look at the treeboughs in any painting of wilsons you will see this structure and nearly every other that is to be avoided in their intensest types you will also notice that wilson never conceives a tree as a round mass but flat as if it had been pressed and dried most people in drawing pines seem to fancy in the same way that the boughs come out only on two sides of the trunk instead of all round it always therefore take more pains in trying to draw the boughs of trees that grow towards you than those that go off to the sides anybody can draw the latter but the foreshortened ones are not so easy it will help you in drawing them to observe that in most trees the ramification of each branch though not of the tree itself is more or less flattened and approximates in its position to the look of a hand held out to receive something or shelter something if you take a lookingglass and hold your hand before it slightly hollowed with the palm upwards and the fingers open as if you were going to support the base of some great bowl larger than you could easily hold and sketch your hand as you see it in the glass with the points of the fingers towards you it will materially help you in understanding the way trees generally hold out their hands and if then you will turn yours with its palm downwards as if you were going to try to hide something but with the fingers expanded you will get a good type of the action of the lower boughs in cedars and such other spreading trees  illustration fig 20  fig 20 will give you a good idea of the simplest way in which these and other such facts can be rapidly expressed if you copy it carefully you will be surprised to find how the touches all group together in expressing the plumy toss of the tree branches and the springing of the bushes out of the bank and the undulation of the ground note the careful drawing of the footsteps made by the climbers of the little mound on the left220 it is facsimiled from an etching of turners and is as good an example as you can have of the use of pure and firm lines it will also show you how the particular action in foliage or anything else to which you wish to direct attention may be intensified by the adjuncts the tall and upright trees are made to look more tall and upright still because their line is continued below by the figure of the farmer with his stick and the rounded bushes on the bank are made to look more rounded because their line is continued in one broad sweep by the black dog and the boy climbing the wall these figures are placed entirely with this object as we shall see more fully hereafter when we come to talk about composition but if you please we will not talk about that yet awhile what i have been telling you about the beautiful lines and action of foliage has nothing to do with composition but only with fact and the brief and expressive representation of fact but there will be no harm in your looking forward if you like to do so to the account in letter iii of the law of radiation and reading what it said there about tree growth indeed it would in some respects have been better to have said it here than there only it would have broken up the account of the principles of composition somewhat awkwardly  now although the lines indicative of action are not always quite so manifest in other things as in trees a little attention will soon enable you to see that there are such lines in everything in an old house roof a bad observer and bad draughtsman will only see and draw the spotty irregularity of tiles or slates all over but a good draughtsman will see all the bends of the under timbers where they are weakest and the weight is telling on them most and the tracks of the run of the water in time of rain where it runs off fastest and where it lies long and feeds the moss and he will be careful however few slates he draws to mark the way they bend together towards those hollows which have the future fate of the roof in them and crowd gradually together at the top of the gable partly diminishing in perspective partly perhaps diminished on purpose they are so in most english old houses by the slatelayer so in ground there is always the direction of the run of the water to be noticed which rounds the earth and cuts it into hollows and generally in any bank or height worth drawing a trace of bedded or other internal structure besides the figure 20 will give you some idea of the way in which such facts may be expressed by a few lines do you not feel the depression in the ground all down the hill where the footsteps are and how the people always turn to the left at the top losing breath a little and then how the water runs down in that other hollow towards the valley behind the roots of the trees  now i want you in your first sketches from nature to aim exclusively at understanding and representing these vital facts of form using the pennot now the steel but the quillfirmly and steadily never scrawling with it but saying to yourself before you lay on a single touchthat leaf is the main one that bough is the guiding one and this touch so long so broad means that part of itpoint or side or knot as the case may be resolve always as you look at the thing what you will take and what miss of it and never let your hand run away with you or get into any habit or method of touch if you want a continuous line your hand should pass calmly from one end of it to the other without a tremor if you want a shaking and broken line your hand should shake or break off as easily as a musicians finger shakes or stops on a note only remember this that there is no general way of doing any thing no recipe can be given you for so much as the drawing of a cluster of grass the grass may be ragged and stiff or tender and flowing sunburnt and sheepbitten or rank and languid fresh or dry lustrous or dull look at it and try to draw it as it is and dont think how somebody told you to do grass so a stone may be round and angular polished or rough cracked all over like an illglazed teacup or as united and broad as the breast of hercules it may be as flaky as a wafer as powdery as a field puffball it may be knotted like a ships hawser or kneaded like hammered iron or knit like a damascus sabre or fused like a glass bottle or crystallised like a hoarfrost or veined like a forest leaf look at it and dont try to remember how anybody told you to do a stone  as soon as you find that your hand obeys you thoroughly and that you can render any form with a firmness and truth approaching that of turners and durers work221 you must add a simple but equally careful light and shade to your pen drawing so as to make each study as complete as possible for which you must prepare yourself thus get if you have the means a good impression of one plate of turners liber studiorum if possible one of the subjects named in the note below222  if you cannot obtain or even borrow for a little while any of these engravings you must use a photograph instead how i will tell you presently but if you can get the turner it will be best you will see that it is composed of a firm etching in line with mezzotint shadow laid over it you must first copy the etched part of it accurately to which end put the print against the window and trace slowly with the greatest care every black line retrace this on smooth drawingpaper and finally go over the whole with your pen looking at the original plate always so that if you err at all it may be on the right side not making a line which is too curved or too straight already in the tracing more curved or more straight as you go over it and in doing this never work after you are tired nor to get the thing done for if it is badly done it will be of no use to you the true zeal and patience of a quarter of an hour are better than the sulky and inattentive labour of a whole day if you have not made the touches right at the first going over with the pen retouch them delicately with little ink in your pen thickening or reinforcing them as they need you cannot give too much care to the facsimile then keep this etched outline by you in order to study at your ease the way in which turner uses his line as preparatory for the subsequent shadow223 it is only in getting the two separate that you will be able to reason on this next copy once more though for the fourth time any part of this etching which you like and put on the light and shade with the brush and any brown colour that matches that of the plate224 working it with the point of the brush as delicately as if you were drawing with pencil and dotting and crosshatching as lightly as you can touch the paper till you get the gradations of turners engraving in this exercise as in the former one a quarter of an inch worked to close resemblance of the copy is worth more than the whole subject carelessly done not that in drawing afterwards from nature you are to be obliged to finish every gradation in this way but that once having fully accomplished the drawing something rightly you will thenceforward feel and aim at a higher perfection than you could otherwise have conceived and the brush will obey you and bring out quickly and clearly the loveliest results with a submissiveness which it would have wholly refused if you had not put it to severest work nothing is more strange in art than the way that chance and materials seem to favour you when once you have thoroughly conquered them make yourself quite independent of chance get your result in spite of it and from that day forward all things will somehow fall as you would have them show the camelshair and the colour in it that no bending nor blotting are of any use to escape your will that the touch and the shade shall finally be right if it cost you a years toil and from that hour of corrective conviction said camelshair will bend itself to all your wishes and no blot will dare to transgress its appointed border if you cannot obtain a print from the liber studiorum get a photograph225 of some general landscape subject with high hills and a village or picturesque town in the middle distance and some calm water of varied character a stream with stones in it if possible and copy any part of it you like in this same brown colour working as i have just directed you to do from the liber a great deal with the point of the brush you are under a twofold disadvantage here however first there are portions in every photograph too delicately done for you at present to be at all able to copy and secondly there are portions always more obscure or dark than there would be in the real scene and involved in a mystery which you will not be able as yet to decipher both these characters will be advantageous to you for future study after you have gained experience but they are a little against you in early attempts at tinting still you must fight through the difficulty and get the power of producing delicate gradations with brown or grey like those of the photograph  now observe the perfection of work would be tinted shadow like photography without any obscurity or exaggerated darkness and as long as your effect depends in anywise on visible lines your art is not perfect though it may be firstrate of its kind but to get complete results in tints merely requires both long time and consummate skill and you will find that a few wellput pen lines with a tint dashed over or under them get more expression of facts than you could reach in any other way by the same expenditure of time the use of the liber studiorum print to you is chiefly as an example of the simplest shorthand of this kind a shorthand which is yet capable of dealing with the most subtle natural effects for the firm etching gets at the expression of complicated details as leaves masonry textures of ground c while the overlaid tint enables you to express the most tender distances of sky and forms of playing light mist or cloud most of the best drawings by the old masters are executed on this principle the touches of the pen being useful also to give a look of transparency to shadows which could not otherwise be attained but by great finish of tinting and if you have access to any ordinarily good public gallery or can make friends of any printsellers who have folios of old drawings or facsimiles of them you will not be at a loss to find some example of this unity of pen with tinting multitudes of photographs also are now taken from the best drawings by the old masters and i hope that our mechanics institutes and other societies organized with a view to public instruction will not fail to possess themselves of examples of these and to make them accessible to students of drawing in the vicinity a single print from turners liber to show the unison of tint with pen etching and the st catherine lately photographed by thurston thompson from raphaels drawing in the louvre to show the unity of the soft tinting of the stump with chalk would be all that is necessary and would i believe be in many cases more serviceable than a larger collection and certainly than a whole gallery of secondrate prints two such examples are peculiarly desirable because all other modes of drawing with pen separately or chalk separately or colour separately may be seen by the poorest student in any cheap illustrated book or in shop windows but this unity of tinting with line he cannot generally see but by some especial enquiry and in some out of the way places he could not find a single example of it supposing that this should be so in your own case and that you cannot meet with any example of this kind try to make the matter out alone thus  take a small and simple photograph allow yourself half an hour to express its subjects with the pen only using some permanent liquid colour instead of ink outlining its buildings or trees firmly and laying in the deeper shadows as you have been accustomed to do in your bolder pen drawings then when this etching is dry take your sepia or grey and tint it over getting now the finer gradations of the photograph and finally taking out the higher lights with penknife or blottingpaper you will soon find what can be done in this way and by a series of experiments you may ascertain for yourself how far the pen may be made serviceable to reinforce shadows mark characters of texture outline unintelligible masses and so on the more time you have the more delicate you may make the pen drawing blending it with the tint the less you have the more distinct you must keep the two practice in this way from one photograph allowing yourself sometimes only a quarter of an hour for the whole thing sometimes an hour sometimes two or three hours in each case drawing the whole subject in full depth of light and shade but with such degree of finish in the parts as is possible in the given time and this exercise observe you will do well to repeat frequently whether you can get prints and drawings as well as photographs or not  and now at last when you can copy a piece of liber studiorum or its photographic substitute faithfully you have the complete means in your power of working from nature on all subjects that interest you which you should do in four different ways  first when you have full time and your subject is one that will stay quiet for you make perfect light and shade studies or as nearly perfect as you can with grey or brown colour of any kind reinforced and defined with the pen  secondly when your time is short or the subject is so rich in detail that you feel you cannot complete it intelligibly in light and shade make a hasty study of the effect and give the rest of the time to a dureresque expression of the details if the subject seems to you interesting and there are points about it which you cannot understand try to get five spare minutes to go close up to it and make a nearer memorandum not that you are ever to bring the details of this nearer sketch into the farther one but that you may thus perfect your experience of the aspect of things and know that such and such a look of a tower or cottage at five hundred yards off means that sort of tower or cottage near while also this nearer sketch will be useful to prevent any future misinterpretation of your own work if you have time however far your light and shade study in the distance may have been carried it is always well for these reasons to make also your dureresque and your near memoranda for if your light and shade drawing be good much of the interesting detail must be lost in it or disguised  your hasty study of effect may be made most easily and quickly with a soft pencil dashed over when done with one tolerably deep tone of grey which will fix the pencil while this fixing colour is wet take out the higher lights with the dry brush and when it is quite dry scratch out the highest lights with the penknife five minutes carefully applied will do much by these means of course the paper is to be white i do not like studies on grey paper so well for you can get more gradation by the taking off your wet tint and laying it on cunningly a little darker here and there than you can with bodycolour white unless you are consummately skilful there is no objection to your making your dureresque memoranda on grey or yellow paper and touching or relieving them with white only do not depend much on your white touches nor make the sketch for their sake  thirdly when you have neither time for careful study nor for dureresque detail sketch the outline with pencil then dash in the shadows with the brush boldly trying to do as much as you possibly can at once and to get a habit of expedition and decision laying more colour again and again into the tints as they dry using every expedient which your practice has suggested to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material taking the colour off here with the dry brush scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the brush rubbing it in with your fingers drying it off with your sponge c then when the colour is in take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously in the manner of the liber studiorum this kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which depend not so much on refinement as on complexity strange shapes of involved shadows sudden effects of sky c and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits which the minute copying may induce in you for although the endeavour to obtain velocity merely for velocitys sake and dash for displays sake is as baneful as it is despicable there are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing but obtain certain results which cannot be had otherwise and it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally for speed and decision while your continual course of practice is such as to ensure your retaining an accurate judgment and a tender touch speed under such circumstances is rather fatiguing than tempting and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence  illustration fig 21  fourthly you will find it of great use whatever kind of landscape scenery you are passing through to get into the habit of making memoranda of the shapes of shadows you will find that many objects of no essential interest in themselves and neither deserving a finished study nor a dureresque one may yet become of singular value in consequence of the fantastic shapes of their shadows for it happens often in distant effect that the shadow is by much a more important element than the substance thus in the alpine bridge fig 21 seen within a few yards of it as in the figure the arrangement of timbers to which the shadows are owing is perceptible but at half a miles distance in bright sunlight the timbers would not be seen and a good painters expression of the bridge would be merely the large spot and the crossed bars of pure grey wholly without indication of their cause as in fig 22 a and if we saw it at still greater distances it would appear as in fig 22 b and c diminishing at last to a strange unintelligible spiderlike spot of grey on the light hillside a perfectly great painter throughout his distances continually reduces his objects to these shadow abstracts and the singular and to many persons unaccountable effect of the confused touches in turners distances is owing chiefly to this thorough accuracy and intense meaning of the shadow abstracts  illustration fig 22  studies of this kind are easily made when you are in haste with an f or hb pencil it requires some hardness of the point to ensure your drawing delicately enough when the forms of the shadows are very subtle they are sure to be so somewhere and are generally so everywhere the pencil is indeed a very precious instrument after you are master of the pen and brush for the pencil cunningly used is both and will draw a line with the precision of the one and the gradation of the other nevertheless it is so unsatisfactory to see the sharp touches on which the best of the detail depends getting gradually deadened by time or to find the places where force was wanted look shiny and like a firegrate that i should recommend rather the steady use of the pen or brush and colour whenever time admits of it keeping only a small memorandumbook in the breastpocket with its wellcut sheathed pencil ready for notes on passing opportunities but never being without this  thus much then respecting the manner in which you are at first to draw from nature but it may perhaps be serviceable to you if i also note one or two points respecting your choice of subjects for study and the best special methods of treating some of them for one of by no means the least difficulties which you have at first to encounter is a peculiar instinct common as far as i have noticed to all beginners to fix on exactly the most unmanageable feature in the given scene there are many things in every landscape which can be drawn if at all only by the most accomplished artists and i have noticed that it is nearly always these which a beginner will dash at or if not these it will be something which though pleasing to him in itself is unfit for a picture and in which when he has drawn it he will have little pleasure as some slight protection against this evil genius of beginners the following general warnings may be useful  1 do not draw things that you love on account of their associations or at least do not draw them because you love them but merely when you cannot get anything else to draw if you try to draw places that you love you are sure to be always entangled amongst neat brick walls iron railings gravel walks greenhouses and quickset hedges besides that you will be continually led into some endeavour to make your drawing pretty or complete which will be fatal to your progress you need never hope to get on if you are the least anxious that the drawing you are actually at work upon should look nice when it is done all you have to care about is to make it right and to learn as much in doing it as possible so then though when you are sitting in your friends parlour or in your own and have nothing else to do you may draw any thing that is there for practice even the fireirons or the pattern on the carpet be sure that it is for practice and not because it is a beloved carpet nor a friendly poker and tongs nor because you wish to please your friend by drawing her room  also never make presents of your drawings of course i am addressing you as a beginnera time may come when your work will be precious to everybody but be resolute not to give it away till you know that it is worth something as soon as it is worth anything you will know that it is so if any one asks you for a present of a drawing send them a couple of cakes of colour and a piece of bristol board those materials are for the present of more value in that form than if you had spread the one over the other  the main reason for this rule is however that its observance will much protect you from the great danger of trying to make your drawings pretty  2 never by choice draw anything polished especially if complicated in form avoid all brass rods and curtain ornaments chandeliers plate glass and fine steel a shining knob of a piece of furniture does not matter if it comes in your way but do not fret yourself if it will not look right and choose only things that do not shine  3 avoid all very neat things they are exceedingly difficult to draw and very ugly when drawn choose rough worn and clumsylooking things as much as possible for instance you cannot have a more difficult or profitless study than a newlypainted thames wherry nor a better study than an old empty coalbarge lying ashore at lowtide in general everything that you think very ugly will be good for you to draw  4 avoid as much as possible studies in which one thing is seen through another you will constantly find a thin tree standing before your chosen cottage or between you and the turn of the river its near branches all entangled with the distance it is intensely difficult to represent this and though when the tree is there you must not imaginarily cut it down but do it as well as you can yet always look for subjects that fall into definite masses not into network that is rather for a cottage with a dark tree beside it than for one with a thin tree in front of it rather for a mass of wood soft blue and rounded than for a ragged copse or confusion of intricate stems  5 avoid as far as possible country divided by hedges perhaps nothing in the whole compass of landscape is so utterly unpicturesque and unmanageable as the ordinary english patchwork of field and hedge with trees dotted over it in independent spots gnawed straight at the cattle line  still do not be discouraged if you find you have chosen ill and that the subject overmasters you it is much better that it should than that you should think you had entirely mastered it but at first and even for some time you must be prepared for very discomfortable failure which nevertheless will not be without some wholesome result  as however i have told you what most definitely to avoid i may perhaps help you a little by saying what to seek in general all banks are beautiful things and will reward work better than large landscapes if you live in a lowland country you must look for places where the ground is broken to the rivers edges with decayed posts or roots of trees or if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach for remnants of stone quays or steps mossy milldams c nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides better in form and colour than high chalk cliffs in woods one or two trunks with the flowery ground below are at once the richest and easiest kind of study a not very thick trunk say nine inches or a foot in diameter with ivy running up it sparingly is an easy and always a rewarding subject  large nests of buildings in the middle distance are always beautiful when drawn carefully provided they are not modern rows of pattern cottages or villas with ionic and doric porticos any old english village or cluster of farmhouses drawn with all its ins and outs and haystacks and palings is sure to be lovely much more a french one french landscape is generally as much superior to english as swiss landscape is to french in some respects the french is incomparable such scenes as that avenue on the seine which i have recommended you to buy the engraving of admit no rivalship in their expression of graceful rusticity and cheerful peace and in the beauty of component lines  in drawing villages take great pains with the gardens a rustic garden is in every way beautiful if you have time draw all the rows of cabbages and hollyhocks and broken fences and wandering eglantines and bossy roses you cannot have better practice nor be kept by anything in purer thoughts  make intimate friends of all the brooks in your neighbourhood and study them ripple by ripple  village churches in england are not often good subjects there is a peculiar meanness about most of them and awkwardness of line old manorhouses are often pretty ruins are usually with us too prim and cathedrals too orderly i do not think there is a single cathedral in england from which it is possible to obtain one subject for an impressive drawing there is always some discordant civility or jarring vergerism about them  if you live in a mountain or hill country your only danger is redundance of subject be resolved in the first place to draw a piece of rounded rock with its variegated lichens quite rightly getting its complete roundings and all the patterns of the lichen in true local colour till you can do this it is of no use your thinking of sketching among hills but when once you have done this the forms of distant hills will be comparatively easy  when you have practised for a little time from such of these subjects as may be accessible to you you will certainly find difficulties arising which will make you wish more than ever for a masters help these difficulties will vary according to the character of your own mind one question occurring to one person and one to another so that it is impossible to anticipate them all and it would make this too large a book if i answered all that i can anticipate you must be content to work on in good hope that nature will in her own time interpret to you much for herself that farther experience on your own part will make some difficulties disappear and that others will be removed by the occasional observation of such artists work as may come in your way nevertheless i will not close this letter without a few general remarks such as may be useful to you after you are somewhat advanced in power and these remarks may i think be conveniently arranged under three heads having reference to the drawing of vegetation water and skies  and first of vegetation you may think perhaps we have said enough about trees already yet if you have done as you were bid and tried to draw them frequently enough and carefully enough you will be ready by this time to hear a little more of them you will also recollect that we left our question respecting the mode of expressing intricacy of leafage partly unsettled in the first letter i left it so because i wanted you to learn the real structure of leaves by drawing them for yourself before i troubled you with the most subtle considerations as to method in drawing them and by this time i imagine you must have found out two principal things universal facts about leaves namely that they always in the main tendencies of their lines indicate a beautiful divergence of growth according to the law of radiation already referred to226 and the second that this divergence is never formal but carried out with endless variety of individual line i must now press both these facts on your attention a little farther  you may perhaps have been surprised that i have not yet spoken of the works of j d harding especially if you happen to have met with the passages referring to them in modern painters in which they are highly praised they are deservedly praised for they are the only works by a modern draughtsman which express in any wise the energy of trees and the laws of growth of which we have been speaking there are no lithographic sketches which for truth of general character obtained with little cost of time at all rival hardings calame robert and the other lithographic landscape sketchers are altogether inferior in power though sometimes a little deeper in meaning but you must not take even harding for a model though you may use his works for occasional reference and if you can afford to buy his lessons on trees227 it will be serviceable to you in various ways and will at present help me to explain the point under consideration and it is well that i should illustrate this point by reference to hardings works because their great influence on young students renders it desirable that their real character should be thoroughly understood  you will find first in the titlepage of the lessons on trees a pretty woodcut in which the tree stems are drawn with great truth and in a very interesting arrangement of lines plate 1 is not quite worthy of mr harding tending too much to make his pupil at starting think everything depends on black dots still the main lines are good and very characteristic of tree growth then in plate 2 we come to the point at issue the first examples in that plate are given to the pupil that he may practise from them till his hand gets into the habit of arranging lines freely in a similar manner and they are stated by mr harding to be universal in application all outlines expressive of foliage he says are but modifications of them they consist of groups of lines more or less resembling our fig 23 and the characters especially insisted upon are that they tend at their inner ends to a common centre that their ends terminate in are enclosed by ovoid curves and that the outer ends are most emphatic  illustration fig 23  now as thus expressive of the great laws of radiation and enclosure the main principle of this method of execution confirms in a very interesting way our conclusions respecting foliage composition the reason of the last rule that the outer end of the line is to be most emphatic does not indeed at first appear for the line at one end of a natural leaf is not more emphatic than the line at the other but ultimately in hardings method this darker part of the touch stands more or less for the shade at the outer extremity of the leaf mass and as harding uses these touches they express as much of tree character as any mere habit of touch can express but unfortunately there is another law of tree growth quite as fixed as the law of radiation which this and all other conventional modes of execution wholly lose sight of this second law is that the radiating tendency shall be carried out only as a ruling spirit in reconcilement with perpetual individual caprice on the part of the separate leaves so that the moment a touch is monotonous it must be also false the liberty of the leaf individually being just as essential a truth as its unity of growth with its companions in the radiating group  illustration fig 24  it does not matter how small or apparently symmetrical the cluster may be nor how large or vague you can hardly have a more formal one than b in fig 9 p 276 nor a less formal one than this shoot of spanish chestnut shedding its leaves fig 24 but in either of them even the general reader unpractised in any of the previously recommended exercises must see that there are wandering lines mixed with the radiating ones and radiating lines with the wild ones and if he takes the pen and tries to copy either of these examples he will find that neither play of hand to left nor to right neither a free touch nor a firm touch nor any learnable or describable touch whatsoever will enable him to produce currently a resemblance of it but that he must either draw it slowly or give it up and which makes the matter worse still though gathering the bough and putting it close to you or seeing a piece of near foliage against the sky you may draw the entire outline of the leaves yet if the spray has light upon it and is ever so little a way off you will miss as we have seen a point of a leaf here and an edge there some of the surfaces will be confused by glitter and some spotted with shade and if you look carefully through this confusion for the edges or dark stems which you really can see and put only those down the result will be neither like fig 9 nor fig 24 but such an interrupted and puzzling piece of work as fig 25228  now it is in the perfect acknowledgment and expression of these three laws that all good drawing of landscape consists there is first the organic unity the law whether of radiation or parallelism or concurrent action which rules the masses of herbs and trees of rocks and clouds and waves secondly the individual liberty of the members subjected to these laws of unity and lastly the mystery under which the separate character of each is more or less concealed  i say first there must be observance of the ruling organic law this is the first distinction between good artists and bad artists your common sketcher or bad painter puts his leaves on the trees as if they were moss tied to sticks he cannot see the lines of action or growth he scatters the shapeless clouds over his sky not perceiving the sweeps of associated curves which the real clouds are following as they fly and he breaks his mountain side into rugged fragments wholly unconscious of the lines of force with which the real rocks have risen or of the lines of couch in which they repose on the contrary it is the main delight of the great draughtsman to trace these laws of government and his tendency to error is always in the exaggeration of their authority rather than in its denial  illustration fig 25  secondly i say we have to show the individual character and liberty of the separate leaves clouds or rocks and herein the great masters separate themselves finally from the inferior ones for if the men of inferior genius ever express law at all it is by the sacrifice of individuality thus salvator rosa has great perception of the sweep of foliage and rolling of clouds but never draws a single leaflet or mist wreath accurately similarly gainsborough in his landscape has great feeling for masses of form and harmony of colour but in the detail gives nothing but meaningless touches not even so much as the species of tree much less the variety of its leafage being ever discernable now although both these expressions of government and individuality are essential to masterly work the individuality is the more essential and the more difficult of attainment and therefore that attainment separates the great masters finally from the inferior ones it is the more essential because in these matters of beautiful arrangement in visible things the same rules hold that hold in moral things it is a lamentable and unnatural thing to see a number of men subject to no government actuated by no ruling principle and associated by no common affection but it would be a more lamentable thing still were it possible to see a number of men so oppressed into assimilation as to have no more any individual hope or character no differences in aim no dissimilarities of passion no irregularities of judgment a society in which no man could help another since none would be feebler than himself no man admire another since none would be stronger than himself no man be grateful to another since by none he could be relieved no man reverence another since by none he could be instructed a society in which every soul would be as the syllable of a stammerer instead of the word of a speaker in which every man would walk as in a frightful dream seeing spectres of himself in everlasting multiplication gliding helplessly around him in a speechless darkness therefore it is that perpetual difference play and change in groups of form are more essential to them even than their being subdued by some great gathering law the law is needful to them for their perfection and their power but the difference is needful to them for their life  and here it may be noted in passing that if you enjoy the pursuit of analogies and types and have any ingenuity of judgment in discerning them you may always accurately ascertain what are the noble characters in a piece of painting by merely considering what are the noble characters of man in his association with his fellows what grace of manner and refinement of habit are in society grace of line and refinement of form are in the association of visible objects what advantage or harm there may be in sharpness ruggedness or quaintness in the dealings or conversations of men precisely that relative degree of advantage or harm there is in them as elements of pictorial composition what power is in liberty or relaxation to strengthen or relieve human souls that power precisely in the same relative degree play and laxity of line have to strengthen or refresh the expression of a picture and what goodness or greatness we can conceive to arise in companies of men from chastity of thought regularity of life simplicity of custom and balance of authority precisely that kind of goodness and greatness may be given to a picture by the purity of its colour the severity of its forms and the symmetry of its masses  you need not be in the least afraid of pushing these analogies too far they cannot be pushed too far they are so precise and complete that the farther you pursue them the clearer the more certain the more useful you will find them they will not fail you in one particular or in any direction of enquiry there is no moral vice no moral virtue which has not its precise prototype in the art of painting so that you may at your will illustrate the moral habit by the art or the art by the moral habit affection and discord fretfulness and quietness feebleness and firmness luxury and purity pride and modesty and all other such habits and every conceivable modification and mingling of them may be illustrated with mathematical exactness by conditions of line and colour and not merely these definable vices and virtues but also every conceivable shade of human character and passion from the righteous or unrighteous majesty of the king to the innocent or faultful simplicity of the shepherd boy  the pursuit of this subject belongs properly however to the investigation of the higher branches of composition matters which it would be quite useless to treat of in this book and i only allude to them here in order that you may understand how the utmost nobleness of art are concerned in this minute work to which i have set you in your beginning of it for it is only by the closest attention and the most noble execution that it is possible to express these varieties of individual character on which all excellence of portraiture depends whether of masses of mankind or of groups of leaves  now you will be able to understand among other matters wherein consists the excellence and wherein the shortcoming of the treedrawing of harding it is excellent in so far as it fondly observes with more truth than any other work of the kind the great laws of growth and action in trees it failsand observe not in a minor but in a principal pointbecause it cannot rightly render any one individual detail or incident of foliage and in this it fails not from mere carelessness or incompletion but of necessity the true drawing of detail being for evermore impossible to a hand which has contracted a habit of execution the noble draughtsman draws a leaf and stops and says calmlythat leaf is of such and such a character i will give him a friend who will entirely suit him then he considers what his friend ought to be and having determined he draws his friend this process may be as quick as lightning when the master is greatone of the sons of the giants or it may be slow and timid but the process is always gone through no touch or form is ever added to another by a good painter without a mental determination and affirmation but when the hand has got into a habit leaf no 1 necessitates leaf no 2 you cannot stop your hand is as a horse with the bit in its teeth or rather is for the time a machine throwing out leaves to order and pattern all alike you must stop that hand of yours however painfully make it understand that it is not to have its own way any more that it shall never more slip from one touch to another without orders otherwise it is not you who are the master but your fingers you may therefore study hardings drawing and take pleasure in it229 and you may properly admire the dexterity which applies the habit of the hand so well and produces results on the whole so satisfactory but you must never copy it otherwise your progress will be at once arrested the utmost you can ever hope to do would be a sketch in hardings manner but of far inferior dexterity for he has given his lifes toil to gain his dexterity and you i suppose have other things to work at besides drawing you would also incapacitate yourself from ever understanding what truly great work was or what nature was but by the earnest and complete study of facts you will gradually come to understand the one and love the other more and more whether you can draw well yourself or not  i have yet to say a few words respecting the third law above stated that of mystery the law namely that nothing is ever seen perfectly but only by fragments and under various conditions of obscurity230 this last fact renders the visible objects of nature complete as a type of the human nature we have observe first subordination secondly individuality lastly and this not the least essential character incomprehensibility a perpetual lesson in every serrated point and shining vein which escape or deceive our sight among the forest leaves how little we may hope to discern clearly or judge justly the rents and veins of the human heart how much of all that is round us in mens actions or spirits which we at first think we understand a closer and more loving watchfulness would show to be full of mystery never to be either fathomed or withdrawn  illustration fig 26  illustration fig 27  the expression of this final character in landscape has never been completely reached by any except turner nor can you hope to reach it at all until you have given much time to the practice of art only try always when you are sketching any object with a view to completion in light and shade to draw only those parts of it which you really see definitely preparing for the after development of the forms by chiaroscuro it is this preparation by isolated touches for a future arrangement of superimposed light and shade which renders the etchings of the liber studiorum so inestimable as examples and so peculiar the character exists more or less in them exactly in proportion to the pains that turner has taken thus the √Üsacus and hesp√©rie was wrought out with the greatest possible care and the principal branch on the near tree is etched as in fig 26 the work looks at first like a scholars instead of a masters but when the light and shade are added every touch falls into its place and a perfect expression of grace and complexity results nay even before the light and shade are added you ought to be able to see that these irregular and broken lines especially where the expression is given of the way the stem loses itself in the leaves are more true than the monotonous though graceful leafdrawing which before turners time had been employed even by the best masters in their distant masses fig 27 is sufficiently characteristic of the manner of the old woodcuts after titian in which you see the leaves are too much of one shape like bunches of fruit and the boughs too completely seen besides being somewhat soft and leathery in aspect owing to the want of angles in their outline by great men like titian this somewhat conventional structure was only given in haste to distant masses and their exquisite delineation of the foreground kept their conventionalism from degeneracy but in the drawing of the caracci and other derivative masters the conventionalism prevails everywhere and sinks gradually into scrawled work like fig 28 about the worst which it is possible to get into the habit of using though an ignorant person might perhaps suppose it more free and therefore better than fig 26 note also that in noble outline drawing it does not follow that a bough is wrongly drawn because it looks contracted unnaturally somewhere as in fig 26 just above the foliage very often the muscular action which is to be expressed by the line runs into the middle of the branch and the actual outline of the branch at that place may be dimly seen or not at all and it is then only by the future shade that its actual shape or the cause of its disappearance will be indicated  illustration fig 28  one point more remains to be noted about trees and i have done in the minds of our ordinary watercolour artists a distant tree seems only to be conceived as a flat green blot grouping pleasantly with other masses and giving cool colour to the landscape but differing nowise in texture from the blots of other shapes which these painters use to express stones or water or figures but as soon as you have drawn trees carefully a little while you will be impressed and impressed more strongly the better you draw them with the idea of their softness of surface a distant tree is not a flat and even piece of colour but a more or less globular mass of a downy or bloomy texture partly passing into a misty vagueness i find practically this lovely softness of faraway trees the most difficult of all characters to reach because it cannot be got by mere scratching or roughening the surface but is always associated with such delicate expressions of form and growth as are only imitable by very careful drawing the penknife passed lightly over this careful drawing will do a good deal but you must accustom yourself from the beginning to aim much at this softness in the lines of the drawing itself by crossing them delicately and more or less effacing and confusing the edges you must invent according to the character of tree various modes of execution adapted to express its texture but always keep this character of softness in your mind and in your scope of aim for in most landscapes it is the intention of nature that the tenderness and transparent infinitude of her foliage should be felt even at the far distance in the most distinct opposition to the solid masses and flat surfaces of rocks or buildings                                       ii we were in the second place to consider a little the modes of representing water of which important feature of landscape i have hardly said anything yet  water is expressed in common drawings by conventional lines whose horizontality is supposed to convey the idea of its surface in paintings white dashes or bars of light are used for the same purpose  but these and all other such expedients are vain and absurd a piece of calm water always contains a picture in itself an exquisite reflection of the objects above it if you give the time necessary to draw these reflections disturbing them here and there as you see the breeze or current disturb them you will get the effect of the water but if you have not patience to draw the reflections no expedient will give you a true effect the picture in the pool needs nearly as much delicate drawing as the picture above the pool except only that if there be the least motion on the water the horizontal lines of the images will be diffused and broken while the vertical ones will remain decisive and the oblique ones decisive in proportion to their steepness  a few close studies will soon teach you this the only thing you need to be told is to watch carefully the lines of disturbance on the surface as when a bird swims across it or a fish rises or the current plays round a stone reed or other obstacle take the greatest pains to get the curves of these lines true the whole value of your careful drawing of the reflections may be lost by your admitting a single false curve of ripple from a wild ducks breast and as in other subjects if you are dissatisfied with your result always try for more unity and delicacy if your reflections are only soft and gradated enough they are nearly sure to give you a pleasant effect when you are taking pains work the softer reflections where they are drawn out by motion in the water with touches as nearly horizontal as may be but when you are in a hurry indicate the place and play of the images with vertical lines the actual construction of a calm elongated reflection is with horizontal lines but it is often impossible to draw the descending shades delicately enough with a horizontal touch and it is best always when you are in a hurry and sometimes when you are not to use the vertical touch when the ripples are large the reflections become shaken and must be drawn with bold undulatory descending lines  i need not i should think tell you that it is of the greatest possible importance to draw the curves of the shore rightly their perspective is if not more subtle at least more stringent than that of any other lines in nature it will not be detected by the general observer if you miss the curve of a branch or the sweep of a cloud or the perspective of a building231 but every intelligent spectator will feel the difference between a rightly drawn bend of shore or shingle and a false one absolutely right in difficult river perspectives seen from heights i believe no one but turner ever has been yet and observe there is no rule for them to develope the curve mathematically would require a knowledge of the exact quantity of water in the river the shape of its bed and the hardness of the rock or shore and even with these data the problem would be one which no mathematician could solve but approximatively the instinct of the eye can do it nothing else  if after a little study from nature you get puzzled by the great differences between the aspect of the reflected image and that of the object casting it and if you wish to know the law of reflection it is simply this suppose all the objects above the water actually reversed not in appearance but in fact beneath the water and precisely the same in form and in relative position only all topsyturvy then whatever you can see from the place in which you stand of the solid objects so reversed under the water you will see in the reflection always in the true perspective of the solid objects so reversed  if you cannot quite understand this in looking at water take a mirror lay it horizontally on the table put some books and papers upon it and draw them and their reflections moving them about and watching how their reflections alter and chiefly how their reflected colours and shades differ from their own colours and shades by being brought into other oppositions this difference in chiaroscuro is a more important character in water painting than mere difference in form  when you are drawing shallow or muddy water you will see shadows on the bottom or on the surface continually modifying the reflections and in a clear mountain stream the most wonderful complications of effect resulting from the shadows and reflections of the stones in it mingling with the aspect of the stones themselves seen through the water do not be frightened at the complexity but on the other hand do not hope to render it hastily look at it well making out everything that you see and distinguishing each component part of the effect there will be first the stones seen through the water distorted always by refraction so that if the general structure of the stone shows straight parallel lines above the water you may be sure they will be bent where they enter it then the reflection of the part of the stone above the water crosses and interferes with the part that is seen through it so that you can hardly tell which is which and wherever the reflection is darkest you will see through the water best and vice vers√¢ then the real shadow of the stone crosses both these images and where that shadow falls it makes the water more reflective and where the sunshine falls you will see more of the surface of the water and of any dust or motes that may be floating on it but whether you are to see at the same spot most of the bottom of the water or of the reflection of the objects above depends on the position of the eye the more you look down into the water the better you see objects through it the more you look along it the eye being low the more you see the reflection of objects above it hence the colour of a given space of surface in a stream will entirely change while you stand still in the same spot merely as you stoop or raise your head and thus the colours with which water is painted are an indication of the position of the spectator and connected inseparably with the perspective of the shores the most beautiful of all results that i know in mountain streams is when the water is shallow and the stones at the bottom are rich reddishorange and black and the water is seen at an angle which exactly divides the visible colours between those of the stones and that of the sky and the sky is of clear full blue the resulting purple obtained by the blending of the blue and the orangered broken by the play of innumerable gradations in the stones is indescribably lovely  all this seems complicated enough already but if there be a strong colour in the clear water itself as of green or blue in the swiss lakes all these phenomena are doubly involved for the darker reflections now become of the colour of the water the reflection of a black gondola for instance at venice is never black but pure dark green and farther the colour of the water itself is of three kinds one seen on the surface is a kind of milky bloom the next is seen where the waves let light through them at their edges and the third shown as a change of colour on the objects seen through the water thus the same wave that makes a white object look of a clear blue when seen through it will take a red or violetcoloured bloom on its surface and will be made pure emerald green by transmitted sunshine through its edges with all this however you are not much concerned at present but i tell it you partly as a preparation for what we have afterwards to say about colour and partly that you may approach lakes and streams with reverence and study them as carefully as other things not hoping to express them by a few horizontal dashes of white or a few tremulous blots232 not but that much may be done by tremulous blots when you know precisely what you mean by them as you will see by many of the turner sketches which are now framed at the national gallery but you must have painted water many and many a dayyes and all day longbefore you can hope to do anything like those                                       iii lastly you may perhaps wonder why before passing to the clouds i say nothing special about ground233 but there is too much to be said about that to admit of my saying it here you will find the principal laws of its structure examined at length in the fourth volume of modern painters and if you can get that volume and copy carefully plate 21 which i have etched after turner with great pains it will give you as much help as you need in the linear expression of groundsurface strive to get the retirement and succession of masses in irregular ground much may be done in this way by careful watching of the perspective diminutions of its herbage as well as by contour and much also by shadows if you draw the shadows of leaves and tree trunks on any undulating ground with entire carefulness you will be surprised to find how much they explain of the form and distance of the earth on which they fall  passing then to skies note that there is this great peculiarity about sky subject as distinguished from earth subjectthat the clouds not being much liable to mans interference are always beautifully arranged you cannot be sure of this in any other features of landscape the rock on which the effect of a mountain scene especially depends is always precisely that which the roadmaker blasts or the landlord quarries and the spot of green which nature left with a special purpose by her dark forest sides and finished with her most delicate grasses is always that which the farmer ploughs or builds upon but the clouds though we can hide them with smoke and mix them with poison cannot be quarried nor built over and they are always therefore gloriously arranged so gloriously that unless you have notable powers of memory you need not hope to approach the effect of any sky that interests you for both its grace and its glow depend upon the united influence of every cloud within its compass they all move and burn together in a marvellous harmony not a cloud of them is out of its appointed place or fails of its part in the choir and if you are not able to recollect which in the case of a complicated sky it is impossible you should precisely the form and position of all the clouds at a given moment you cannot draw the sky at all for the clouds will not fit if you draw one part of them three or four minutes before another you must try therefore to help what memory you have by sketching at the utmost possible speed the whole range of the clouds marking by any shorthand or symbolic work you can hit upon the peculiar character of each as transparent or fleecy or linear or undulatory giving afterwards such completion to the parts as your recollection will enable you to do this however only when the sky is interesting from its general aspect at other times do not try to draw all the sky but a single cloud sometimes a round cumulus will stay five or six minutes quite steady enough to let you mark out his principal masses and one or two white or crimson lines which cross the sunrise will often stay without serious change for as long and in order to be the readier in drawing them practise occasionally drawing lumps of cotton which will teach you better than any other stable thing the kind of softness there is in clouds for you will find when you have made a few genuine studies of sky and then look at any ancient or modern painting that ordinary artists have always fallen into one of two faults either in rounding the clouds they make them as solid and hardedged as a heap of stones tied up in a sack or they represent them not as rounded at all but as vague wreaths of mist or flat lights in the sky and think they have done enough in leaving a little white paper between dashes of blue or in taking an irregular space out with the sponge now clouds are not as solid as floursacks but on the other hand they are neither spongy nor flat they are definite and very beautiful forms of sculptured mist sculptured is a perfectly accurate word they are not more drifted into form than they are carved into form the warm air around them cutting them into shape by absorbing the visible vapour beyond certain limits hence their angular and fantastic outlines as different from a swollen spherical or globular formation on the one hand as from that of flat films or shapeless mists on the other and the worst of all is that while these forms are difficult enough to draw on any terms especially considering that they never stay quiet they must be drawn also at greater disadvantage of light and shade than any others the force of light in clouds being wholly unattainable by art so that if we put shade enough to express their form as positively as it is expressed in reality we must make them painfully too dark on the dark sides nevertheless they are so beautiful if you in the least succeed with them that you will hardly i think lose courage outline them often with the pen as you can catch them here and there one of the chief uses of doing this will be not so much the memorandum so obtained as the lesson you will get respecting the softness of the cloudoutlines you will always find yourself at a loss to see where the outline really is and when drawn it will always look hard and false and will assuredly be either too round or too square however often you alter it merely passing from the one fault to the other and back again the real cloud striking an inexpressible mean between roundness and squareness in all its coils or battlements i speak at present of course only of the cumulus cloud the lighter wreaths and flakes of the upper sky cannot be outlinedthey can only be sketched like locks of hair by many lines of the pen firmly developed bars of cloud on the horizon are in general easy enough and may be drawn with decision when you have thus accustomed yourself a little to the placing and action of clouds try to work out their light and shade just as carefully as you do that of other things looking exclusively for examples of treatment to the vignettes in rogerss italy and poems and to the liber studiorum unless you have access to some examples of turners own work no other artist ever yet drew the sky even titians clouds and tintorets are conventional the clouds in the ben arthur source of arveron and calais pier are among the best of turners storm studies and of the upper clouds the vignettes to rogerss poems furnish as many examples as you need  and now as our first lesson was taken from the sky so for the present let our last be i do not advise you to be in any haste to master the contents of my next letter if you have any real talent for drawing you will take delight in the discoveries of natural loveliness which the studies i have already proposed will lead you into among the fields and hills and be assured that the more quietly and singleheartedly you take each step in the art the quicker on the whole will your progress be i would rather indeed have discussed the subjects of the following letter at greater length and in a separate work addressed to more advanced students but as there are one or two things to be said on composition which may set the young artists mind somewhat more at rest or furnish him with defence from the urgency of illadvisers i will glance over the main heads of the matter here trusting that my doing so may not beguile you my dear reader from your serious work or lead you to think me in occupying part of this book with talk not altogether relevant to it less entirely or      faithfully yours      j ruskin  footnotes  220 it is meant i believe for salt hill  221 i do not mean that you can approach turner or durer in their strength that is to say in their imagination or power of design but you may approach them by perseverance in truth of manner  222 the following are the most desirable plates      grande

martello towers  12 calm  it is very unlikely that you should meet with one of the original etchings if you should it will be a drawingmaster in itself alone for it is not only equivalent to a penandink drawing by turner but to a very careful one only observe the source of arveron raglan and dumblane were not etched by turner and the etchings of those three are not good for separate study though it is deeply interesting to see how turner apparently provoked at the failure of the beginnings in the arveron and raglan took the plates up himself and either conquered or brought into use the bad etching by his marvellous engraving the dumblane was however well etched by mr lupton and beautifully engraved by him the finest turner etching is of an aqueduct with a stork standing in a mountain stream not in the published series and next to it are the unpublished etchings of the via mala and crowhurst turner seems to have been so fond of these plates that he kept retouching and finishing them and never made up his mind to let them go the via mala is certainly in the state in which turner left it the finest of the whole series its etching is as i said the best after that of the aqueduct figure 20 above is part of another fine unpublished etching windsor from salt hill of the published etchings the finest are the ben arthur √Üsacus cephalus and stone pines with the girl washing at a cistern the three latter are the more generally instructive hindhead hill isis jason and morpeth are also very desirable  223 you will find more notice of this point in the account of hardings treedrawing a little farther on  224 the impressions vary so much in colour that no brown can be specified  225 you had better get such a photograph even if you have a liber print as well  226 see the closing letter in this volume  227 bogue fleet street if you are not acquainted with hardings works an unlikely supposition considering their popularity and cannot meet with the one in question the diagrams given here will enable you to understand all that is needful for our purposes  228 i draw this figure a young shoot of oak in outline only it being impossible to express the refinements of shade in distant foliage in a woodcut  229 his lithographic sketches those for instance in the park and the forest and his various lessons on foliage possess greater merit than the more ambitious engravings in his principles and practice of art there are many useful remarks however dispersed through this latter work  230 on this law you will do well if you can get access to it to look at the fourth chapter of the fourth volume of modern painters  231 the student may hardly at first believe that the perspective of buildings is of little consequence but he will find it so ultimately see the remarks on this point in the preface  232 it is a useful piece of study to dissolve some prussian blue in water so as to make the liquid definitely blue fill a large white basin with the solution and put anything you like to float on it or lie in it walnut shells bits of wood leaves of flowers c then study the effects of the reflections and of the stems of the flowers or submerged portions of the floating objects as they appear through the blue liquid noting especially how as you lower your head and look along the surface you see the reflections clearly and how as you raise your head you lose the reflections and see the submerged stems clearly  233 respecting architectural drawing see the notice of the works of prout in the appendix     letter iii  on colour and composition   my dear reader  if you have been obedient and have hitherto done all that i have told you i trust it has not been without much subdued remonstrance and some serious vexation for i should be sorry if when you were led by the course of your study to observe closely such things as are beautiful in colour you had not longed to paint them and felt considerable difficulty in complying with your restriction to the use of black or blue or grey you ought to love colour and to think nothing quite beautiful or perfect without it and if you really do love it for its own sake and are not merely desirous to colour because you think painting a finer thing than drawing there is some chance you may colour well nevertheless you need not hope ever to produce anything more than pleasant helps to memory or useful and suggestive sketches in colour unless you mean to be wholly an artist you may in the time which other vocations leave at your disposal produce finished beautiful and masterly drawings in light and shade but to colour well requires your life it cannot be done cheaper the difficulty of doing right is increasednot twofold nor threefold but a thousandfold and moreby the addition of colour to your work for the chances are more than a thousand to one against your being right both in form and colour with a given touch it is difficult enough to be right in form if you attend to that only but when you have to attend at the same moment to a much more subtle thing than the form the difficulty is strangely increasedand multiplied almost to infinity by this great fact that while form is absolute so that you can say at the moment you draw any line that it is either right or wrong colour is wholly relative every hue throughout your work is altered by every touch that you add in other places so that what was warm a minute ago becomes cold when you have put a hotter colour in another place and what was in harmony when you left it becomes discordant as you set other colours beside it so that every touch must be laid not with a view to its effect at the time but with a view to its effect in futurity the result upon it of all that is afterwards to be done being previously considered you may easily understand that this being so nothing but the devotion of life and great genius besides can make a colourist  but though you cannot produce finished coloured drawings of any value you may give yourself much pleasure and be of great use to other people by occasionally sketching with a view to colour only and preserving distinct statements of certain colour factsas that the harvestmoon at rising was of such and such a red and surrounded by clouds of such and such a rosy grey that the mountains at evening were in truth so deep in purple and the waves by the boats side were indeed of that incredible green this only observe if you have an eye for colour but you may presume that you have this if you enjoy colour  and though of course you should always give as much form to your subject as your attention to its colour will admit of remember that the whole value of what you are about depends in a coloured sketch on the colour merely if the colour is wrong everything is wrong just as if you are singing and sing false notes it does not matter how true the words are if you sing at all you must sing sweetly and if you colour at all you must colour rightly give up all the form rather than the slightest part of the colour just as if you felt yourself in danger of a false note you would give up the word and sing a meaningless sound if you felt that so you could save the note never mind though your houses are all tumbling downthough your clouds are mere blots and your trees mere knobs and your sun and moon like crooked sixpencesso only that trees clouds houses and sun or moon are of the right colours of course the discipline you have gone through will enable you to hint something of form even in the fastest sweep of the brush but do not let the thought of form hamper you in the least when you begin to make coloured memoranda if you want the form of the subject draw it in black and white if you want its colour take its colour and be sure you have it and not a spurious treacherous halfmeasured piece of mutual concession with the colours all wrong and the forms still anything but right it is best to get into the habit of considering the coloured work merely as supplementary to your other studies making your careful drawings of the subject first and then a coloured memorandum separately as shapeless as you like but faithful in hue and entirely minding its own business this principle however bears chiefly on large and distant subjects in foregrounds and near studies the colour cannot be had without a good deal of definition of form for if you do not map the mosses on the stones accurately you will not have the right quantity of colour in each bit of moss pattern and then none of the colours will look right but it always simplifies the work much if you are clear as to your point of aim and satisfied when necessary to fail of all but that  now of course if i were to enter into detail respecting colouring which is the beginning and end of a painters craft i should need to make this a work in three volumes instead of three letters and to illustrate it in the costliest way i only hope at present to set you pleasantly and profitably to work leaving you within the tethering of certain leadingstrings to gather what advantages you can from the works of art of which every year brings a greater number within your reachand from the instruction which every year our rising artists will be more ready to give kindly and better able to give wisely  and first of materials use hard cake colours not moist colours grind a sufficient quantity of each on your palette every morning keeping a separate plate large and deep for colours to be used in broad washes and wash both plate and palette every evening so as to be able always to get good and pure colour when you need it and force yourself into cleanly and orderly habits about your colours the two best colourists of modern times turner and rossetti234 afford us i am sorry to say no confirmation of this precept by their practice turner was and rossetti is as slovenly in all their procedures as men can well be but the result of this was with turner that the colours have altered in all his pictures and in many of his drawings and the result of it with rossetti is that though his colours are safe he has sometimes to throw aside work that was half done and begin over again william hunt of the old watercolour is very neat in his practice so i believe is mulready so is john lewis and so are the leading preraphaelites rossetti only excepted and there can be no doubt about the goodness of the advice if it were only for this reason that the more particular you are about your colours the more you will get into a deliberate and methodical habit in using them and all true speed in colouring comes of this deliberation  use chinese white well ground to mix with your colours in order to pale them instead of a quantity of water you will thus be able to shape your masses more quietly and play the colours about with more ease they will not damp your paper so much and you will be able to go on continually and lay forms of passing cloud and other fugitive or delicately shaped lights otherwise unattainable except by time  this mixing of white with the pigments so as to render them opaque constitutes bodycolour drawing as opposed to transparentcolour drawing and you will perhaps have it often said to you that this bodycolour is illegitimate it is just as legitimate as oilpainting being so far as handling is concerned the same process only without its uncleanliness its unwholesomeness or its inconvenience for oil will not dry quickly nor carry safely nor give the same effects of atmosphere without tenfold labour and if you hear it said that the bodycolour looks chalky or opaque and as is very likely think so yourself be yet assured of this that though certain effects of glow and transparencies of gloom are not to be reached without transparent colour those glows and glooms are not the noblest aim of art after many years study of the various results of fresco and oil painting in italy and of bodycolour and transparent colour in england i am now entirely convinced that the greatest things that are to be done in art must be done in dead colour the habit of depending on varnish or on lucid tints transparency makes the painter comparatively lose sight of the nobler translucence which is obtained by breaking various colours amidst each other and even when as by correggio exquisite play of hue is joined with exquisite transparency the delight in the depth almost always leads the painter into mean and false chiaroscuro it leads him to like dark backgrounds instead of luminous ones235 and to enjoy in general quality of colour more than grandeur of composition and confined light rather than open sunshine so that the really greatest thoughts of the greatest men have always so far as i remember been reached in dead colour and the noblest oil pictures of tintoret and veronese are those which are likest frescos  besides all this the fact is that though sometimes a little chalky and coarselooking bodycolour is in a sketch infinitely liker nature than transparent colour the bloom and mist of distance are accurately and instantly represented by the film of opaque blue quite accurately i think by nothing else and for ground rocks and buildings the earthy and solid surface is of course always truer than the most finished and carefully wrought work in transparent tints can ever be  against one thing however i must steadily caution you all kinds of colour are equally illegitimate if you think they will allow you to alter at your pleasure or blunder at your ease there is no vehicle or method of colour which admits of alteration or repentance you must be right at once or never and you might as well hope to catch a rifle bullet in your hand and put it straight when it was going wrong as to recover a tint once spoiled the secret of all good colour in oil water or anything else lies primarily in that sentence spoken to me by mulready know what you have to do the process may be a long one perhaps you may have to ground with one colour to touch it with fragments of a second to crumble a third into the interstices a fourth into the interstices of the third to glaze the whole with a fifth and to reinforce in points with a sixth but whether you have one or ten or twenty processes to go through you must go straight through them knowingly and foreseeingly all the way and if you get the thing once wrong there is no hope for you but in washing or scraping boldly down to the white ground and beginning again  the drawing in bodycolour will tend to teach you all this more than any other method and above all it will prevent you from falling into the pestilent habit of sponging to get texture a trick which has nearly ruined our modern watercolour school of art there are sometimes places in which a skilful artist will roughen his paper a little to get certain conditions of dusty colour with more ease than he could otherwise and sometimes a skilfully rased piece of paper will in the midst of transparent tints answer nearly the purpose of chalky bodycolour in representing the surfaces of rocks or buildings but artifices of this kind are always treacherous in a tyros hands tempting him to trust in them and you had better always work on white or grey paper as smooth as silk236 and never disturb the surface of your colour or paper except finally to scratch out the very highest lights if you are using transparent colours  i have said above that bodycolour drawing will teach you the use of colour better than working with merely transparent tints but this is not because the process is an easier one but because it is a more complete one and also because it involves some working with transparent tints in the best way you are not to think that because you use bodycolour you may make any kind of mess that you like and yet get out of it but you are to avail yourself of the characters of your material which enable you most nearly to imitate the processes of nature thus suppose you have a red rocky cliff to sketch with blue clouds floating over it you paint your cliff first firmly then take your blue mixing it to such a tint and here is a great part of the skill needed that when it is laid over the red in the thickness required for the effect of the mist the warm rockcolour showing through the blue cloudcolour may bring it to exactly the hue you want your upper tint therefore must be mixed colder than you want it then you lay it on varying it as you strike it getting the forms of the mist at once and if it be rightly done with exquisite quality of colour from the warm tints showing through and between the particles of the other when it is dry you may add a little colour to retouch the edges where they want shape or heighten the lights where they want roundness or put another tone over the whole but you can take none away if you touch or disturb the surface or by any untoward accident mix the under and upper colours together all is lost irrecoverably begin your drawing from the ground again if you like or throw it into the fire if you like but do not waste time in trying to mend it237  this discussion of the relative merits of transparent and opaque colour has however led us a little beyond the point where we should have begun we must go back to our palette if you please get a cake of each of the hard colours named in the note below238 and try experiments on their simple combinations by mixing each colour with every other if you like to do it in an orderly way you may prepare a squared piece of pasteboard and put the pure colours in columns at the top and side the mixed tints being given at the intersections thus the letters standing for colours          b      c      d      e      f      c      a  ab     ac     ad     ae     af     b       bc     bd     be     bf     c            cd     ce     cf     d                 de     df     e                      ef     c  this will give you some general notion of the characters of mixed tints of two colours only and it is better in practice to confine yourself as much as possible to these and to get more complicated colours either by putting a third over the first blended tint or by putting the third into its interstices nothing but watchful practice will teach you the effects that colours have on each other when thus put over or beside each other  illustration fig 29  when you have got a little used to the principal combinations place yourself at a window which the sun does not shine in at commanding some simple piece of landscape outline this landscape roughly then take a piece of white cardboard cut out a hole in it about the size of a large pea and supposing r is the room a d the window and you are sitting at a fig 29 hold this cardboard a little outside of the window upright and in the direction b d parallel a little turned to the side of the window or so as to catch more light as at a d never turned as at c d or the paper will be dark then you will see the landscape bit by bit through the circular hole match the colours of each important bit as nearly as you can mixing your tints with white beside the aperture when matched put a touch of the same tint at the top of your paper writing under it dark tree colour hill colour field colour as the case may be then wash the tint away from beside the opening and the cardboard will be ready to match another piece of the landscape239 when you have got the colours of the principal masses thus indicated lay on a piece of each in your sketch in its right place and then proceed to complete the sketch in harmony with them by your eye  in the course of your early experiments you will be much struck by two things the first the inimitable brilliancy of light in sky and in sunlighted things and the second that among the tints which you can imitate those which you thought the darkest will continually turn out to be in reality the lightest darkness of objects is estimated by us under ordinary circumstances much more by knowledge than by sight thus a cedar or scotch fir at 200 yards off will be thought of darker green than an elm or oak near us because we know by experience that the peculiar colour they exhibit at that distance is the sign of darkness of foliage but when we try them through the cardboard the near oak will be found indeed rather dark green and the distant cedar perhaps pale graypurple the quantity of purple and grey in nature is by the way another somewhat surprising subject of discovery  well having ascertained thus your principal tints you may proceed to fill up your sketch in doing which observe these following particulars  1 many portions of your subject appeared through the aperture in the paper brighter than the paper as sky sunlighted grass c leave these portions for the present white and proceed with the parts of which you can match the tints  2 as you tried your subject with the cardboard you must have observed how many changes of hue took place over small spaces in filling up your work try to educate your eye to perceive these differences of hue without the help of the cardboard and lay them deliberately like a mosaicworker as separate colours preparing each carefully on your palatte and laying it as if it were a patch of coloured cloth cut out to be fitted neatly by its edge to the next patch so that the fault of your work may be not a slurred or misty look but a patched bedcover look as if it had all been cut out with scissors for instance in drawing the trunk of a birch tree there will be probably white high lights then a pale rosy grey round them on the light side then a probably greenish deeper grey on the dark side varied by reflected colours and over all rich black strips of bark and brown spots of moss lay first the rosy grey leaving white for the high lights and for the spots of moss and not touching the dark side then lay the grey for the dark side fitting it well up to the rosy grey of the light leaving also in this darker grey the white paper in the places for the black and brown moss then prepare the moss colours separately for each spot and lay each in the white place left for it not one grain of white except that purposely left for the high lights must be visible when the work is done even through a magnifyingglass so cunningly must you fit the edges to each other finally take your background colours and put them on each side of the treetrunk fitting them carefully to its edge  fine work you would make of this wouldnt you if you had not learned to draw first and could not now draw a good outline for the stem much less terminate a colour mass in the outline you wanted  your work will look very odd for some time when you first begin to paint in this way and before you can modify it as i shall tell you presently how but never mind it is of the greatest possible importance that you should practice this separate laying on of the hues for all good colouring finally depends on it it is indeed often necessary and sometimes desirable to lay one colour and form boldly over another thus in laying leaves on blue sky it is impossible always in large pictures or when pressed for time to fill in the blue through the interstices of the leaves and the great venetians constantly lay their blue ground first and then having let it dry strike the golden brown over it in the form of the leaf leaving the under blue to shine through the gold and subdue it to the olive green they want but in the most precious and perfect work each leaf is inlaid and the blue worked round it and whether you use one or other mode of getting your result it is equally necessary to be absolute and decisive in your laying the colour either your ground must be laid firmly first and then your upper colour struck upon it in perfect form for ever thenceforward unalterable or else the two colours must be individually put in their places and led up to each other till they meet at their appointed border equally thenceforward unchangeable either process you see involves absolute decision if you once begin to slur or change or sketch or try this way and that with your colour it is all over with it and with you you will continually see bad copyists trying to imitate the venetians by daubing their colours about and retouching and finishing and softening when every touch and every added hue only lead them farther into chaos there is a dog between two children in a veronese in the louvre which gives the copyist much employment he has a dark ground behind him which veronese has painted first and then when it was dry or nearly so struck the locks of the dogs white hair over it with some halfdozen curling sweeps of his brush right at once and forever had one line or hair of them gone wrong it would have been wrong forever no retouching could have mended it the poor copyists daub in first some background and then some dogs hair then retouch the background then the hair work for hours at it expecting it always to come right tomorrowwhen it is finished they may work for centuries at it and they will never do it if they can do it with veroneses allowance of work half a dozen sweeps of the hand over the dark background well if not they may ask the dog himself whether it will ever come right and get true answer from himon launces conditions if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will  whenever you lay on a mass of colour be sure that however large it may be or however small it shall be gradated no colour exists in nature under ordinary circumstances without gradation if you do not see this it is the fault of your inexperience you will see it in due time if you practise enough but in general you may see it at once in the birch trunk for instance the rosy grey must be gradated by the roundness of the stem till it meets the shaded side similarly the shaded side is gradated by reflected light accordingly whether by adding water or white paint or by unequal force of touch this you will do at pleasure according to the texture you wish to produce you must in every tint you lay on make it a little paler at one part than another and get an even gradation between the two depths this is very like laying down a formal law or recipe for you but you will find it is merely the assertion of a natural fact it is not indeed physically impossible to meet with an ungradated piece of colour but it is so supremely improbable that you had better get into the habit of asking yourself invariably when you are going to copy a tintnot is that gradated but which way is it gradated and at least in ninetynine out of a hundred instances you will be able to answer decisively after a careful glance though the gradation may have been so subtle that you did not see it at first and it does not matter how small the touch of colour may be though not larger than the smallest pins head if one part of it is not darker than the rest it is a bad touch for it is not merely because the natural fact is so that your colour should be gradated the preciousness and pleasantness of the colour itself depends more on this than on any other of its qualities for gradation is to colours just what curvature is to lines both being felt to be beautiful by the pure instinct of every human mind and both considered as types expressing the law of gradual change and progress in the human soul itself what the difference is in mere beauty between a gradated and ungradated colour may be seen easily by laying an even tint of rosecolour on paper and putting a rose leaf beside it the victorious beauty of the rose as compared with other flowers depends wholly on the delicacy and quantity of its colour gradations all other flowers being either less rich in gradation not having so many folds of leaf or less tender being patched and veined instead of flushed  4 but observe it is not enough in general that colour should be gradated by being made merely paler or darker at one place than another generally colour changes as it diminishes and is not merely darker at one spot but also purer at one spot than anywhere else it does not in the least follow that the darkest spot should be the purest still less so that the lightest should be the purest very often the two gradations more or less cross each other one passing in one direction from paleness to darkness another in another direction from purity to dullness but there will almost always be both of them however reconciled and you must never be satisfied with a piece of colour until you have got both that is to say every piece of blue that you lay on must be quite blue only at some given spot nor that a large spot and must be gradated from that into less pure bluegreyish blue or greenish blue or purplish blue over all the rest of the space it occupies and this you must do in one of three ways either while the colour is wet mix it with the colour which is to subdue it adding gradually a little more and a little more or else when the colour is quite dry strike a gradated touch of another colour over it leaving only a point of the first tint visible or else lay the subduing tints on in small touches as in the exercise of tinting the chessboard of each of these methods i have something to tell you separately but that is distinct from the subject of gradation which i must not quit without once more pressing upon you the pre√´minent necessity of introducing it everywhere i have profound dislike of anything like habit of hand and yet in this one instance i feel almost tempted to encourage you to get into a habit of never touching paper with colour without securing a gradation you will not in turners largest oil pictures perhaps six or seven feet long by four or five high find one spot of colour as large as a grain of wheat ungradated and you will find in practice that brilliancy of hue and vigour of light and even the aspect of transparency in shade are essentially dependent on this character alone hardness coldness and opacity resulting far more from equality of colour than from nature of colour give me some mud off a city crossing some ochre out of a gravel pit a little whitening and some coaldust and i will paint you a luminous picture if you give me time to gradate my mud and subdue my dust but though you had the red of the ruby the blue of the gentian snow for the light and amber for the gold you cannot paint a luminous picture if you keep the masses of those colours unbroken in purity and unvarying in depth  5 next note the three processes by which gradation and other characters are to be obtained  a mixing while the colour is wet  you may be confused by my first telling you to lay on the hues in separate patches and then telling you to mix hues together as you lay them on but the separate masses are to be laid when colours distinctly oppose each other at a given limit the hues to be mixed when they palpitate one through the other or fade one into the other it is better to err a little on the distinct side thus i told you to paint the dark and light sides of the birch trunk separately though in reality the two tints change as the trunk turns away from the light gradually one into the other and after being laid separately on will need some farther touching to harmonize them but they do so in a very narrow space marked distinctly all the way up the trunk and it is easier and safer therefore to keep them separate at first whereas it often happens that the whole beauty of two colours will depend on the one being continued well through the other and playing in the midst of it blue and green often do so in water blue and grey or purple and scarlet in sky in hundreds of such instances the most beautiful and truthful results may be obtained by laying one colour into the other while wet judging wisely how far it will spread or blending it with the brush in somewhat thicker consistence of wet bodycolour only observe never mix in this way two mixtures let the colour you lay into the other be always a simple not a compound tint  b laying one colour over another  if you lay on a solid touch of vermilion and after it is quite dry strike a little very wet carmine quickly over it you will obtain a much more brilliant red than by mixing the carmine and vermilion similarly if you lay a dark colour first and strike a little blue or white bodycolour lightly over it you will get a more beautiful grey than by mixing the colour and the blue or white in very perfect painting artifices of this kind are continually used but i would not have you trust much to them they are apt to make you think too much of quality of colour i should like you to depend on little more than the dead colours simply laid on only observe always this that the less colour you do the work with the better it will always be240 so that if you have laid a red colour and you want a purple one above do not mix the purple on your palette and lay it on so thick as to overpower the red but take a little thin blue from your palette and lay it lightly over the red so as to let the red be seen through and thus produce the required purple and if you want a green hue over a blue one do not lay a quantity of green on the blue but a little yellow and so on always bringing the under colour into service as far as you possibly can if however the colour beneath is wholly opposed to the one you have to lay on as suppose if green is to be laid over scarlet you must either remove the required parts of the under colour daintily first with your knife or with water or else lay solid white over it massively and leave that to dry and then glaze the white with the upper colour this is better in general than laying the upper colour itself so thick as to conquer the ground which in fact if it be a transparent colour you cannot do thus if you have to strike warm boughs and leaves of trees over blue sky and they are too intricate to have their places left for them in laying the blue it is better to lay them first in solid white and then glaze with sienna and ochre than to mix the sienna and white though of course the process is longer and more troublesome nevertheless if the forms of touches required are very delicate the after glazing is impossible you must then mix the warm colour thick at once and so use it and this is often necessary for delicate grasses and such other fine threads of light in foreground work  c breaking one colour in small points through or over another  this is the most important of all processes in good modern241 oil and watercolour painting but you need not hope to attain very great skill in it to do it well is very laborious and requires such skill and delicacy of hand as can only be acquired by unceasing practice but you will find advantage in noting the following points  a in distant effects of rich subjects wood or rippled water or broken clouds much may be done by touches or crumbling dashes of rather dry colour with other colours afterwards put cunningly into the interstices the more you practise this when the subject evidently calls for it the more your eye will enjoy the higher qualities of colour the process is in fact the carrying out of the principle of separate colours to the utmost possible refinement using atoms of colour in juxtaposition instead of large spaces and note in filling up minute interstices of this kind that if you want the colour you fill them with to show brightly it is better to put a rather positive point of it with a little white left beside or round it in the interstice than to put a pale tint of the colour over the whole interstice yellow or orange will hardly show if pale in small spaces but they show brightly in firm touches however small with white beside them  b if a colour is to be darkened by superimposed portions of another it is in many cases better to lay the uppermost colour in rather vigorous small touches like finely chopped straw over the under one than to lay it on as a tint for two reasons the first that the play of the two colours together is pleasant to the eye the second that much expression of form may be got by wise administration of the upper dark touches in distant mountains they may be made pines of or broken crags or villages or stones or whatever you choose in clouds they may indicate the direction of the rain the roll and outline of the cloud masses and in water the minor waves all noble effects of dark atmosphere are got in good watercolour drawing by these two expedients interlacing the colours or retouching the lower one with fine darker drawing in an upper sponging and washing for dark atmospheric effect is barbarous and mere tyros work though it is often useful for passages of delicate atmospheric light  c when you have time practice the production of mixed tints by interlaced touches of the pure colours out of which they are formed and use the process at the parts of your sketches where you wish to get rich and luscious effects study the works of william hunt of the old watercolour society in this respect continually and make frequent memoranda of the variegations in flowers not painting the flower completely but laying the ground colour of one petal and painting the spots on it with studious precision a series of single petals of lilies geraniums tulips c numbered with proper reference to their position in the flower will be interesting to you on many grounds besides those of art be careful to get the gradated distribution of the spots well followed in the calceolarias foxgloves and the like and work out the odd indefinite hues of the spots themselves with minute grains of pure interlaced colour otherwise you will never get their richness of bloom you will be surprised to find as you do this first the universality of the law of gradation we have so much insisted upon secondly that nature is just as economical of her fine colours as i have told you to be of yours you would think by the way she paints that her colours cost her something enormous she will only give you a single pure touch just where the petal turns into light but down in the bell all is subdued and under the petal all is subdued even in the showiest flower what you thought was bright blue is when you look close only dusty grey or green or purple or every colour in the world at once only a single gleam or streak of pure blue in the centre of it and so with all her colours sometimes i have really thought her miserliness intolerable in a gentian for instance the way she economises her ultramarine down in the bell is a little too bad  next respecting general tone i said just now that for the sake of students my tax should not be laid on black or on white pigments but if you mean to be a colourist you must lay a tax on them yourselves when you begin to use true colour that is to say you must use them little and make of them much there is no better test of your colour tones being good than your having made the white in your picture precious and the black conspicuous  i say first the white precious i do not mean merely glittering or brilliant it is easy to scratch white seagulls out of black clouds and dot clumsy foliage with chalky dew but when white is well managed it ought to be strangely delicioustender as well as brightlike inlaid mother of pearl or white roses washed in milk the eye ought to seek it for rest brilliant though it may be and to feel it as a space of strange heavenly paleness in the midst of the flushing of the colours this effect you can only reach by general depth of middle tint by absolutely refusing to allow any white to exist except where you need it and by keeping the white itself subdued by grey except at a few points of chief lustre  secondly you must make the black conspicuous however small a point of black may be it ought to catch the eye otherwise your work is too heavy in the shadow all the ordinary shadows should be of some colournever black nor approaching black they should be evidently and always of a luminous nature and the black should look strange among them never occurring except in a black object or in small points indicative of intense shade in the very centre of masses of shadow shadows of absolutely negative grey however may be beautifully used with white or with gold but still though the black thus in subdued strength becomes spacious it should always be conspicuous the spectator should notice this grey neutrality with some wonder and enjoy all the more intensely on account of it the gold colour and the white which it relieves of all the great colourists velasquez is the greatest master of the black chords his black is more precious than most other peoples crimson  it is not however only white and black which you must make valuable you must give rare worth to every colour you use but the white and black ought to separate themselves quaintly from the rest while the other colours should be continually passing one into the other being all evidently companions in the same gay world while the white black and neutral grey should stand monkishly aloof in the midst of them you may melt your crimson into purple your purple into blue and your blue into green but you must not melt any of them into black you should however try as i said to give preciousness to all your colours and this especially by never using a grain more than will just do the work and giving each hue the highest value by opposition all fine colouring like fine drawing is delicate and so delicate that if at last you see the colour you are putting on you are putting on too much you ought to feel a change wrought in the general tone by touches of colour which individually are too pale to be seen and if there is one atom of any colour in the whole picture which is unnecessary to it that atom hurts it  notice also that nearly all good compound colours are odd colours you shall look at a hue in a good painters work ten minutes before you know what to call it you thought it was brown presently you feel that it is red next that there is somehow yellow in it presently afterwards that there is blue in it if you try to copy it you will always find your colour too warm or too coldno colour in the box will seem to have any affinity with it and yet it will be as pure as if it were laid at a single touch with a single colour  as to the choice and harmony of colours in general if you cannot choose and harmonize them by instinct you will never do it at all if you need examples of utterly harsh and horrible colour you may find plenty given in treatises upon colouring to illustrate the laws of harmony and if you want to colour beautifully colour as best pleases yourself at quiet times not so as to catch the eye nor to look as if it were clever or difficult to colour in that way but so that the colour may be pleasant to you when you are happy or thoughtful look much at the morning and evening sky and much at simple flowersdogroses wood hyacinths violets poppies thistles heather and such likeas nature arranges them in the woods and fields if ever any scientific person tells you that two colours are discordant make a note of the two colours and put them together whenever you can i have actually heard people say that blue and green were discordant the two colours which nature seems to intend never to be separated and never to be felt either of them in its full beauty without the othera peacocks neck or a blue sky through green leaves or a blue wave with green lights though it being precisely the loveliest things next to clouds at sunrise in this coloured world of ours if you have a good eye for colours you will soon find out how constantly nature puts purple and green together purple and scarlet green and blue yellow and neutral grey and the like and how she strikes these colourconcords for general tones and then works into them with innumerable subordinate ones and you will gradually come to like what she does and find out new and beautiful chords of colour in her work every day if you enjoy them depend upon it you will paint them to a certain point right or at least if you do not enjoy them you are certain to paint them wrong if colour does not give you intense pleasure let it alone depend upon it you are only tormenting the eyes and senses of people who feel colour whenever you touch it and that is unkind and improper you will find also your power of colouring depend much on your state of health and right balance of mind when you are fatigued or ill you will not see colours well and when you are illtempered you will not choose them well thus though not infallibly a test of character in individuals colour power is a great sign of mental health in nations when they are in a state of intellectual decline their colouring always gets dull242 you must also take great care not to be misled by affected talk about colour from people who have not the gift of it numbers are eager and voluble about it who probably never in all their lives received one genuine coloursensation the modern religionists of the school of overbeck are just like people who eat slatepencil and chalk and assure everybody that they are nicer and purer than strawberries and plums  take care also never to be misled into any idea that colour can help or display form colour243 always disguises form and is meant to do so  it is a favourite dogma among modern writers on colour that warm colours reds and yellows approach or express nearness and cold colours blue and grey retire or express distance so far is this from being the case that no expression of distance in the world is so great as that of the gold and orange in twilight sky colours as such are absolutely inexpressive respecting distance it is their quality as depth delicacy c which expresses distance not their tint a blue bandbox set on the same shelf with a yellow one will not look an inch farther off but a red or orange cloud in the upper sky will always appear to be beyond a blue cloud close to us as it is in reality it is quite true that in certain objects blue is a sign of distance but that is not because blue is a retiring colour but because the mist in the air is blue and therefore any warm colour which has not strength of light enough to pierce the mist is lost or subdued in its blue but blue is no more on this account a retiring colour than brown is a retiring colour because when stones are seen through brown water the deeper they lie the browner they look or than yellow is a retiring colour because when objects are seen through a london fog the farther off they are the yellower they look neither blue nor yellow nor red can have as such the smallest power of expressing either nearness or distance they express them only under the peculiar circumstances which render them at the moment or in that place signs of nearness or distance thus vivid orange in an orange is a sign of nearness for if you put the orange a great way off its colour will not look so bright but vivid orange in sky is a sign of distance because you cannot get the colour of orange in a cloud near you so purple in a violet or a hyacinth is a sign of nearness because the closer you look at them the more purple you see but purple in a mountain is a sign of distance because a mountain close to you is not purple but green or grey it may indeed be generally assumed that a tender or pale colour will more or less express distance and a powerful or dark colour nearness but even this is not always so heathery hills will usually give a pale and tender purple near and an intense and dark purple far away the rose colour of sunset on snow is pale on the snow at your feet deep and full on the snow in the distance and the green of a swiss lake is pale in the clear waves on the beach but intense as an emerald in the sunstreak six miles from shore and in any case when the foreground is in strong light with much water about it or white surface casting intense reflections all its colours may be perfectly delicate pale and faint while the distance when it is in shadow may relieve the whole foreground with intense darks of purple blue green or ultramarine blue so that on the whole it is quite hopeless and absurd to expect any help from laws of a√´rial perspective look for the natural effects and set them down as fully as you can and as faithfully and never alter a colour because it wont look in its right place put the colour strong if it be strong though far off faint if it be faint though close to you why should you suppose that nature always means you to know exactly how far one thing is from another she certainly intends you always to enjoy her colouring but she does not wish you always to measure her space you would be hard put to it every time you painted the sun setting if you had to express his 95000000 miles of distance in a√´rial perspective  there is however i think one law about distance which has some claims to be considered a constant one namely that dullness and heaviness of colour are more or less indicative of nearness all distant colour is pure colour it may not be bright but it is clear and lovely not opaque nor soiled for the air and light coming between us and any earthy or imperfect colour purify or harmonise it hence a bad colourist is peculiarly incapable of expressing distance i do not of course mean that you are to use bad colours in your foreground by way of making it come forward but only that a failure in colour there will not put it out of its place while a failure in colour in the distance will at once do away with its remoteness your dullcoloured foreground will still be a foreground though illpainted but your illpainted distance will not be merely a dull distanceit will be no distance at all  i have only one thing more to advise you namely never to colour petulantly or hurriedly you will not indeed be able if you attend properly to your colouring to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch nevertheless if you do not dash or rush at your work nor do it lazily you may always get enough form to be satisfactory an extra quarter of an hour distributed in quietness over the course of the whole study may just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing and a slovenly and obscure one if you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of colour is to have and when it is on the paper guide it without nervousness as far as you can into the form required and then after it is dry consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it before laying one of them on you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look as compared with a hurried or illconsidered sketch in no process that i know ofleast of all in sketchingcan time be really gained by precipitation it is gained only by caution and gained in all sorts of ways for not only truth of form but force of light is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colours you may often make a simple flat tint rightly gradated and edged express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch the two swiss cottages for instance with their balconies and glittering windows and general character of shingly eaves are expressed in fig 30 with one tint of grey and a few dispersed spots and lines of it all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush and without a single touch after the tint is dry  illustration fig 30  here then for i cannot without coloured illustrations tell you more i must leave you to follow out the subject for yourself with such help as you may receive from the watercolour drawings accessible to you or from any of the little treatises on their art which have been published lately by our watercolour painters244 but do not trust much to works of this kind you may get valuable hints from them as to mixture of colours and here and there you will find a useful artifice or process explained but nearly all such books are written only to help idle amateurs to a meretricious skill and they are full of precepts and principles which may for the most part be interpreted by their precise negatives and then acted upon with advantage most of them praise boldness when the only safe attendant spirit of a beginner is cautionadvise velocity when the first condition of success is deliberationand plead for generalisation when all the foundations of power must be laid in knowledge of specialty  and now in the last place i have a few things to tell you respecting that dangerous nobleness of consummate artcomposition for though it is quite unnecessary for you yet awhile to attempt it and it may be inexpedient for you to attempt it at all you ought to know what it means and to look for and enjoy it in the art of others  composition means literally and simply putting several things together so as to make one thing out of them the nature and goodness of which they all have a share in producing thus a musician composes an air by putting notes together in certain relations a poet composes a poem by putting thoughts and words in pleasant order and a painter a picture by putting thoughts forms and colours in pleasant order  in all these cases observe an intended unity must be the result of composition a paviour cannot be said to compose the heap of stones which he empties from his cart nor the sower the handful of seed which he scatters from his hand it is the essence of composition that everything should be in a determined place perform an intended part and act in that part advantageously for everything that is connected with it  composition understood in this pure sense is the type in the arts of mankind of the providential government of the world245 it is an exhibition in the order given to notes or colours or forms of the advantage of perfect fellowship discipline and contentment in a wellcomposed air no note however short or low can be spared but the least is as necessary as the greatest no note however prolonged is tedious but the others prepare for and are benefited by its duration no note however high is tyrannous the others prepare for and are benefited by its exaltation no note however low is overpowered the others prepare for and sympathise with its humility and the result is that each and every note has a value in the position assigned to it which by itself it never possessed and of which by separation from the others it would instantly be deprived  similarly in a good poem each word and thought enhances the value of those which precede and follow it and every syllable has a loveliness which depends not so much on its abstract sound as on its position look at the same word in a dictionary and you will hardly recognise it  much more in a great picture every line and colour is so arranged as to advantage the rest none are inessential however slight and none are independent however forcible it is not enough that they truly represent natural objects but they must fit into certain places and gather into certain harmonious groups so that for instance the red chimney of a cottage is not merely set in its place as a chimney but that it may affect in a certain way pleasurable to the eye the pieces of green or blue in other parts of the picture and we ought to see that the work is masterly merely by the positions and quantities of these patches of green red and blue even at a distance which renders it perfectly impossible to determine what the colours represent or to see whether the red is a chimney or an old womans cloak and whether the blue is smoke sky or water  it seems to be appointed in order to remind us in all we do of the great laws of divine government and human polity that composition in the arts should strongly affect every order of mind however unlearned or thoughtless hence the popular delight in rhythm and metre and in simple musical melodies but it is also appointed that power of composition in the fine arts should be an exclusive attribute of great intellect all men can more or less copy what they see and more or less remember it powers of reflection and investigation are also common to us all so that the decision of inferiority in these rests only on questions of degree a has a better memory than b and c reflects more profoundly than d but the gift of composition is not given at all to more than one man in a thousand in its highest range it does not occur above three or four times in a century  it follows from these general truths that it is impossible to give rules which will enable you to compose you might much more easily receive rules to enable you to be witty if it were possible to be witty by rule wit would cease to be either admirable or amusing if it were possible to compose melody by rule mozart and cimarosa need not have been born if it were possible to compose pictures by rule titian and veronese would be ordinary men the essence of composition lies precisely in the fact of its being unteachable in its being the operation of an individual mind of range and power exalted above others  but though no one can invent by rule there are some simple laws of arrangement which it is well for you to know because though they will not enable you to produce a good picture they will often assist you to set forth what goodness may be in your work in a more telling way than you could have done otherwise and by tracing them in the work of good composers you may better understand the grasp of their imagination and the power it possesses over their materials i shall briefly state the chief of these laws   1 the law of principality  the great object of composition being always to secure unity that is to make out of many things one whole the first mode in which this can be effected is by determining that one feature shall be more important than all the rest and that the others shall group with it in subordinate positions  this is the simplest law of ordinary ornamentation thus the group of two leaves a fig 31 is unsatisfactory because it has no leading leaf but that at b is prettier because it has a head or master leaf and c more satisfactory still because the subordination of the other members to this head leaf is made more manifest by their gradual loss of size as they fall back from it hence part of the pleasure we have in the greek honeysuckle ornament and such others  illustration fig 31  thus also good pictures have always one light larger or brighter than the other lights or one figure more prominent than the other figures or one mass of colour dominant over all the other masses and in general you will find it much benefit your sketch if you manage that there shall be one light on the cottage wall or one blue cloud in the sky which may attract the eye as leading light or leading gloom above all others but the observance of the rule is often so cunningly concealed by the great composers that its force is hardly at first traceable and you will generally find that they are vulgar pictures in which the law is strikingly manifest this may be simply illustrated by musical melody for instance in such phrases as this  illustration  one note here the upper g rules the whole passage and has the full energy of it concentrated in itself such passages corresponding to completely subordinated compositions in painting are apt to be wearisome if often repeated but in such a phrase as this  illustration  it is very difficult to say which is the principal note the a in the last bar is lightly dominant but there is a very equal current of power running through the whole and such passages rarely weary and this principle holds through vast scales of arrangement so that in the grandest compositions such as paul veroneses marriage in cana or raphaels disputa it is not easy to fix at once on the principal figure and very commonly the figure which is really chief does not catch the eye at first but is gradually felt to be more and more conspicuous as we gaze thus in titians grand composition of the cornaro family the figure meant to be principal is a youth of fifteen or sixteen whose portrait it was evidently the painters object to make as interesting as possible but a grand madonna and a st george with a drifting banner and many figures more occupy the centre of the picture and first catch the eye little by little we are led away from them to a gleam of pearly light in the lower corner and find that from the head which it shines upon we can turn our eyes no more  as in every good picture nearly all laws of design are more or less exemplified it will on the whole be an easier way of explaining them to analyse one composition thoroughly than to give instances from various works i shall therefore take one of turners simplest which will allow us so to speak easily to decompose it and illustrate each law by it as we proceed  figure 32 is a rude sketch of the arrangement of the whole subject the old bridge over the moselle at coblentz the town of coblentz on the right ehrenbreitstein on the left the leading or master feature is of course the tower on the bridge it is kept from being too principal by an important group on each side of it the boats on the right and ehrenbreitstein beyond the boats are large in mass and more forcible in colour but they are broken into small divisions while the tower is simple and therefore it still leads ehrenbreitstein is noble in its mass but so reduced by a√´rial perspective of colour that it cannot contend with the tower which therefore holds the eye and becomes the key of the picture we shall see presently how the very objects which seem at first to contend with it for the mastery are made occultly to increase its pre√´minence  illustration fig 32   2 the law of repetition  another important means of expressing unity is to mark some kind of sympathy among the different objects and perhaps the pleasantest because most surprising kind of sympathy is when one group imitates or repeats another not in the way of balance or symmetry but subordinately like a faraway and broken echo of it prout has insisted much on this law in all his writings on composition and i think it is even more authoritatively present in the minds of most great composers than the law of principality it is quite curious to see the pains that turner sometimes takes to echo an important passage of colour in the pembroke castle for instance there are two fishingboats one with a red and another with a white sail in a line with them on the beach are two fish in precisely the same relative positions one red and one white it is observable that he uses the artifice chiefly in pictures where he wishes to obtain an expression of repose in my notice of the plate of scarborough in the series of the harbours of england i have already had occasion to dwell on this point and i extract in the note246 one or two sentences which explain the principle in the composition i have chosen for our illustration this reduplication is employed to a singular extent the tower or leading feature is first repeated by the low echo of it to the left put your finger over this lower tower and see how the picture is spoiled then the spires of coblentz are all arranged in couples how they are arranged in reality does not matter when we are composing a great picture we must play the towers about till they come right as fearlessly as if they were chessmen instead of cathedrals the dual arrangement of these towers would have been too easily seen were it not for a little one which pretends to make a triad of the last group on the right but is so faint as hardly to be discernible it just takes off the attention from the artifice helped in doing so by the mast at the head of the boat which however has instantly its own duplicate put at the stern247 then there is the large boat near and its echo beyond it that echo is divided into two again and each of those two smaller boats has two figures in it while two figures are also sitting together on the great rudder that lies half in the water and half aground then finally the great mass of ehrenbreitstein which appears at first to have no answering form has almost its facsimile in the bank on which the girl is sitting this bank is as absolutely essential to the completion of the picture as any object in the whole series all this is done to deepen the effect of repose  symmetry or the balance of parts or masses in nearly equal opposition is one of the conditions of treatment under the law of repetition for the opposition in a symmetrical object is of like things reflecting each other it is not the balance of contrary natures like that of day and night but of like natures or like forms one side of a leaf being set like the reflection of the other in water  symmetry in nature is however never formal nor accurate she takes the greatest care to secure some difference between the corresponding things or parts of things and an approximation to accurate symmetry is only permitted in animals because their motions secure perpetual difference between the balancing parts stand before a mirror hold your arms in precisely the same position at each side your head upright your body straight divide your hair exactly in the middle and get it as nearly as you can into exactly the same shape over each ear and you will see the effect of accurate symmetry you will see no less how all grace and power in the human form result from the interference of motion and life with symmetry and from the reconciliation of its balance with its changefulness your position as seen in the mirror is the highest type of symmetry as understood by modern architects  in many sacred compositions living symmetry the balance of harmonious opposites is one of the profoundest sources of their power almost any works of the early painters angelico perugino giotto c will furnish you with notable instances of it the madonna of perugino in the national gallery with the angel michael on one side and raphael on the other is as beautiful an example as you can have  in landscape the principle of balance is more or less carried out in proportion to the wish of the painter to express disciplined calmness in bad compositions as in bad architecture it is formal a tree on one side answering a tree on the other but in good compositions as in graceful statues it is always easy and sometimes hardly traceable in the coblentz however you cannot have much difficulty in seeing how the boats on one side of the tower and the figures on the other are set in nearly equal balance the tower as a central mass uniting both   3 the law of continuity  another important and pleasurable way of expressing unity is by giving some orderly succession to a number of objects more or less similar and this succession is most interesting when it is connected with some gradual change in the aspect or character of the objects thus the succession of the pillars of a cathedral aisle is most interesting when they retire in perspective becoming more and more obscure in distance so the succession of mountain promontories one behind another on the flanks of a valley so the succession of clouds fading farther and farther towards the horizon each promontory and each cloud being of different shape yet all evidently following in a calm and appointed order if there be no change at all in the shape or size of the objects there is no continuity there is only repetitionmonotony it is the change in shape which suggests the idea of their being individually free and able to escape if they liked from the law that rules them and yet submitting to it i will leave our chosen illustrative composition for a moment to take up another still more expressive of this law it is one of turners most tender studies a sketch on calais sands at sunset so delicate in the expression of wave and cloud that it is of no use for me to try to reach it with any kind of outline in a woodcut but the rough sketch fig 33 is enough to give an idea of its arrangement the aim of the painter has been to give the intensest expression of repose together with the enchanted lulling monotonous motion of cloud and wave all the clouds are moving in innumerable ranks after the sun meeting towards the point in the horizon where he has set and the tidal waves gain in winding currents upon the sand with that stealthy haste in which they cross each other so quietly at their edges just folding one over another as they meet like a little piece of ruffled silk and leaping up a little as two children kiss and clap their hands and then going on again each in its silent hurry drawing pointed arches on the sand as their thin edges intersect in parting but all this would not have been enough expressed without the line of the old piertimbers black with weeds strained and bent by the storm waves and now seeming to stoop in following one another like dark ghosts escaping slowly from the cruelty of the pursuing sea  i need not i hope point out to the reader the illustration of this law of continuance in the subject chosen for our general illustration it was simply that gradual succession of the retiring arches of the bridge which induced turner to paint the subject at all and it was this same principle which led him always to seize on subjects including long bridges whereever he could find them but especially observe unequal bridges having the highest arch at one side rather than at the centre there is a reason for this irrespective of general laws of composition and connected with the nature of rivers which i may as well stop a minute to tell you about and let you rest from the study of composition  illustration fig 33  all rivers small or large agree in one character they like to lean a little on one side they cannot bear to have their channels deepest in the middle but will always if they can have one bank to sun themselves upon and another to get cool under one shingly shore to play over where they may be shallow and foolish and childlike and another steep shore under which they can pause and purify themselves and get their strength of waves fully together for due occasion rivers in this way are just like wise men who keep one side of their life for play and another for work and can be brilliant and chattering and transparent when they are at ease and yet take deep counsel on the other side when they set themselves to their main purpose and rivers are just in this divided also like wicked and good men the good rivers have serviceable deep places all along their banks that ships can sail in but the wicked rivers go scoopingly irregularly under their banks until they get full of strangling eddies which no boat can row over without being twisted against the rocks and pools like wells which no one can get out of but the waterkelpie that lives at the bottombut wicked or good the rivers all agree in having two kinds of sides now the natural way in which a village stonemason therefore throws a bridge over a strong stream is of course to build a great door to let the cat through and little doors to let the kittens through a great arch for the great current to give it room in flood time and little arches for the little currents along the shallow shore this even without any prudential respect for the floods of the great current he would do in simple economy of work and stone for the smaller your arches are the less material you want on their flanks two arches over the same span of river supposing the butments are at the same depth are cheaper than one and that by a great deal so that where the current is shallow the village mason makes his arches many and low as the water gets deeper and it becomes troublesome to build his piers up from the bottom he throws his arches wider at last he comes to the deep stream and as he cannot build at the bottom of that he throws his largest arch over it with a leap and with another little one or so gains the opposite shore of course as arches are wider they must be higher or they will not stand so the roadway must rise as the arches widen and thus we have the general type of bridge with its highest and widest arch towards one side and a train of minor arches running over the flat shore on the other usually a steep bank at the riverside next the large arch always of course a flat shore on the side of the small ones and the bend of the river assuredly concave towards this flat cutting round with a sweep into the steep bank or if there is no steep bank still assuredly cutting into the shore at the steep end of the bridge  now this kind of bridge sympathising as it does with the spirit of the river and marking the nature of the thing it has to deal with and conquer is the ideal of a bridge and all endeavours to do the thing in a grand engineers manner with a level roadway and equal arches are barbarous not only because all monotonous forms are ugly in themselves but because the mind perceives at once that there has been cost uselessly thrown away for the sake of formality248  well to return to our continuity we see that the turnerian bridge in fig 32 is of the absolutely perfect type and is still farther interesting by having its main arch crowned by a watchtower but as i want you to note especially what perhaps was not the case in the real bridge but is entirely turners doing you will find that though the arches diminish gradually not one is regularly diminishedthey are all of different shapes and sizes you cannot see this clearly in 32 but in the larger diagram fig 34 opposite you will with ease this is indeed also part of the ideal of a bridge because the lateral currents near the shore are of course irregular in size and a simple builder would naturally vary his arches accordingly and also if the bottom was rocky build his piers where the rocks came but it is not as a part of bridge ideal but as a necessity of all noble composition that this irregularity is introduced by turner it at once raises the object thus treated from the lower or vulgar unity of rigid law to the greater unity of clouds and waves and trees and human souls each different each obedient and each in harmonious service   4 the law of curvature  there is however another point to be noticed in this bridge of turners not only does it slope away unequally at its sides but it slopes in a gradual though very subtle curve and if you substitute a straight line for this curve drawing one with a rule from the base of the tower on each side to the ends of the bridge in fig 34 and effacing the curve you will instantly see that the design has suffered grievously you may ascertain by experiment that all beautiful objects whatsoever are thus terminated by delicately curved lines except where the straight line is indispensable to their use or stability and that when a complete system of straight lines throughout the form is necessary to that stability as in crystals the beauty if any exists is in colour and transparency not in form cut out the shape of any crystal you like in white wax or wood and put it beside a white lily and you will feel the force of the curvature in its purity irrespective of added colour or other interfering elements of beauty  illustration fig 34  well as curves are more beautiful than straight lines it is necessary to a good composition that its continuities of object mass or colour should be if possible in curves rather than straight lines or angular ones perhaps one of the simplest and prettiest examples of a graceful continuity of this kind is in the line traced at any moment by the corks of a net as it is being drawn nearly every person is more or less attracted by the beauty of the dotted line now it is almost always possible not only to secure such a continuity in the arrangement or boundaries of objects which like these bridge arches or the corks of the net are actually connected with each other butand this is a still more noble and interesting kind of continuityamong features which appear at first entirely separate thus the towers of ehrenbreitstein on the left in fig 32 appear at first independent of each other but when i give their profile on a larger scale fig 35 the reader may easily perceive that there is a subtle cadence and harmony among them the reason of this is that they are all bounded by one grand curve traced by the dotted line out of the seven towers four precisely touch this curve the others only falling back from it here and there to keep the eye from discovering it too easily  illustration fig 35  and it is not only always possible to obtain continuities of this kind it is in drawing large forest or mountain forms essential to truth the towers of ehrenbreitstein might or might not in reality fall into such a curve but assuredly the basalt rock on which they stand did for all mountain forms not cloven into absolute precipice nor covered by straight slopes of shales are more or less governed by these great curves it being one of the aims of nature in all her work to produce them the reader must already know this if he has been able to sketch at all among the mountains if not let him merely draw for himself carefully the outlines of any low hills accessible to him where they are tolerably steep or of the woods which grow on them the steeper shore of the thames at maidenhead or any of the downs at brighton or dover or even nearer about croydon as addington hills are easily accessible to a londoner and he will soon find not only how constant but how graceful the curvature is graceful curvature is distinguished from ungraceful by two characters first its moderation that is to say its close approach to straightness in some parts of its course249 and secondly by its variation that is to say its never remaining equal in degree at different parts of its course  this variation is itself twofold in all good curves  illustration fig 36  a there is first a steady change through the whole line from less to more curvature or more to less so that no part of the line is a segment of a circle or can be drawn by compasses in any way whatever thus in fig 36 a is a bad curve because it is part of a circle and is therefore monotonous throughout but b is a good curve because it continually changes its direction as it proceeds  illustration fig 37  the first difference between good and bad drawing of tree boughs consists in observance of this fact thus when i put leaves on the line b as in fig 37 you can immediately feel the springiness of character dependent on the changefulness of the curve you may put leaves on the other line for yourself but you will find you cannot make a right tree spray of it for all tree boughs large or small as well as all noble natural lines whatsoever agree in this character and it is a point of primal necessity that your eye should always seize and your hand trace it here are two more portions of good curves with leaves put on them at the extremities instead of the flanks fig 38 and two showing the arrangement of masses of foliage seen a little farther off fig 39 which you may in like manner amuse yourself by turning into segments of circlesyou will see with what result i hope however you have beside you by this time many good studies of tree boughs carefully made in which you may study variations of curvature in their most complicated and lovely forms250  illustration fig 38  illustration fig 39  b not only does every good curve vary in general tendency but it is modulated as it proceeds by myriads of subordinate curves thus the outlines of a tree trunk are never as at a fig 40 but as at b so also in waves clouds and all other nobly formed masses thus another essential difference between good and bad drawing or good and bad sculpture depends on the quantity and refinement of minor curvatures carried by good work into the great lines strictly speaking however this is not variation in large curves but composition of large curves out of small ones it is an increase in the quantity of the beautiful element but not a change in its nature   5 the law of radiation  illustration fig 40  we have hitherto been concerned only with the binding of our various objects into beautiful lines or processions the next point we have to consider is how we may unite these lines or processions themselves so as to make groups of them  now there are two kinds of harmonies of lines one in which moving more or less side by side they variously but evidently with consent retire from or approach each other intersect or oppose each other currents of melody in music for different voices thus approach and cross fall and rise in harmony so the waves of the sea as they approach the shore flow into one another or cross but with a great unity through all and so various lines of composition often flow harmoniously through and across each other in a picture but the most simple and perfect connexion of lines is by radiation that is by their all springing from one point or closing towards it and this harmony is often in nature almost always united with the other as the boughs of trees though they intersect and play amongst each other irregularly indicate by their general tendency their origin from one root an essential part of the beauty of all vegetable form is in this radiation it is seen most simply in a single flower or leaf as in a convolvulus bell or chestnut leaf but more beautifully in the complicated arrangements of the large boughs and sprays for a leaf is only a flat piece of radiation but the tree throws its branches on all sides and even in every profile view of it which presents a radiation more or less correspondent to that of its leaves it is more beautiful because varied by the freedom of the separate branches i believe it has been ascertained that in all trees the angle at which in their leaves the lateral ribs are set on their central rib is approximately the same at which the branches leave the great stem and thus each section of the tree would present a kind of magnified view of its own leaf were it not for the interfering force of gravity on the masses of foliage this force in proportion to their age and the lateral leverage upon them bears them downwards at the extremities so that as before noticed the lower the bough grows on the stem the more it droops fig 17 p 295 besides this nearly all beautiful trees have a tendency to divide into two or more principal masses which give a prettier and more complicated symmetry than if one stem ran all the way up the centre fig 41 may thus be considered the simplest type of tree radiation as opposed to leaf radiation in this figure however all secondary ramification is unrepresented for the sake of simplicity but if we take one half of such a tree and merely give two secondary branches to each main branch as represented in the general branch structure shown at b fig 18 p 296 we shall have the form fig 42 this i consider the perfect general type of tree structure and it is curiously connected with certain forms of greek byzantine and gothic ornamentation into the discussion of which however we must not enter here it will be observed that both in figs 41 and 42 all the branches so spring from the main stem as very nearly to suggest their united radiation from the root r this is by no means universally the case but if the branches do not bend towards a point in the root they at least converge to some point or other in the examples in fig 43 the mathematical centre of curvature a is thus in one case on the ground at some distance from the root and in the other near the top of the tree half only of each tree is given for the sake of clearness fig 44 gives both sides of another example in which the origins of curvature are below the root as the positions of such points may be varied without end and as the arrangement of the lines is also farther complicated by the fact of the boughs springing for the most part in a spiral order round the tree and at proportionate distances the systems of curvature which regulate the form of vegetation are quite infinite infinite is a word easily said and easily written and people do not always mean it when they say it in this case i do mean it the number of systems is incalculable and even to furnish any thing like a representative number of types i should have to give several hundreds of figures such as fig 44251  illustration fig 41  illustration fig 42  illustration fig 43  illustration fig 44  thus far however we have only been speaking of the great relations of stem and branches the forms of the branches themselves are regulated by still more subtle laws for they occupy an intermediate position between the form of the tree and of the leaf the leaf has a flat ramification the tree a completely rounded one the bough is neither rounded nor flat but has a structure exactly balanced between the two in a halfflattened halfrounded flake closely resembling in shape one of the thick leaves of an artichoke or the flake of a fir cone by combination forming the solid mass of the tree as the leaves compose the artichoke head i have before pointed out to you the general resemblance of these branch flakes to an extended hand but they may be more accurately represented by the ribs of a boat if you can imagine a very broadheaded and flattened boat applied by its keel to the end of a main branch252 as in fig 45 the lines which its ribs will take and the general contour of it as seen in different directions from above and below and from one side and another will give you the closest approximation to the perspectives and foreshortenings of a wellgrown branchflake fig 25 above page 316 is an unharmed and unrestrained shoot of healthy young oak and if you compare it with fig 45 you will understand at once the action of the lines of leafage the boat only failing as a type in that its ribs are too nearly parallel to each other at the sides while the bough sends all its ramification well forwards rounding to the head that it may accomplish its part in the outer form of the whole tree yet always securing the compliance with the great universal law that the branches nearest the root bend most back and of course throwing some always back as well as forwards the appearance of reversed action being much increased and rendered more striking and beautiful by perspective figure 25 shows the perspective of such a bough as it is seen from below fig 46 gives rudely the look it would have from above  illustration fig 45  illustration fig 46  you may suppose if you have not already discovered what subtleties of perspective and light and shade are involved in the drawing of these branchflakes as you see them in different directions and actions now raised now depressed touched on the edges by the wind or lifted up and bent back so as to show all the white under surfaces of the leaves shivering in light as the bottom of a boat rises white with spray at the surgecrest or drooping in quietness towards the dew of the grass beneath them in windless mornings or bowed down under oppressive grace of deepcharged snow snow time by the way is one of the best for practice in the placing of tree masses but you will only be able to understand them thoroughly by beginning with a single bough and a few leaves placed tolerably even as in fig 38 page 372 first one with three leaves a central and two lateral ones as at a then with five as at b and so on directing your whole attention to the expression both by contour and light and shade of the boatlike arrangements which in your earlier studies will have been a good deal confused partly owing to your inexperience and partly to the depth of shade or absolute blackness of mass required in those studies  one thing more remains to be noted and i will let you out of the wood you see that in every generally representative figure i have surrounded the radiating branches with a dotted line such lines do indeed terminate every vegetable form and you see that they are themselves beautiful curves which according to their flow and the width or narrowness of the spaces they enclose characterize the species of tree or leaf and express its free or formal action its grace of youth or weight of age so that throughout all the freedom of her wildest foliage nature is resolved on expressing an encompassing limit and marking a unity in the whole tree caused not only by the rising of its branches from a common root but by their joining in one work and being bound by a common law and having ascertained this let us turn back for a moment to a point in leaf structure which i doubt not you must already have observed in your earlier studies but which it is well to state here as connected with the unity of the branches in the great trees you must have noticed i should think that whenever a leaf is compoundthat is to say divided into other leaflets which in any way repeat or imitate the form of the whole leafthose leaflets are not symmetrical as the whole leaf is but always smaller on the side towards the point of the great leaf so as to express their subordination to it and show even when they are pulled off that they are not small independent leaves but members of one large leaf  illustration fig 47  fig 47 which is a blockplan of a leaf of columbine without its minor divisions on the edges will illustrate the principle clearly it is composed of a central large mass a and two lateral ones of which the one on the right only is lettered b each of these masses is again composed of three others a central and two lateral ones but observe the minor one a of a is balanced equally by its opposite but the minor b1 of b is larger than its opposite b2 again each of these minor masses is divided into three but while the central mass a of a is symmetrically divided the b of b is unsymmetrical its largest sidelobe being lowest again b2 the lobe c1 its lowest lobe in relation to b is larger than c2 and so also in b1 so that universally one lobe of a lateral leaf is always larger than the other and the smaller lobe is that which is nearer the central mass the lower leaf as it were by courtesy subduing some of its own dignity or power in the immediate presence of the greater or captain leaf and always expressing therefore its own subordination and secondary character this law is carried out even in single leaves as far as i know the upper half towards the point of the spray is always the smaller and a slightly different curve more convex at the springing is used for the lower side giving an exquisite variety to the form of the whole leaf so that one of the chief elements in the beauty of every subordinate leaf throughout the tree is made to depend on its confession of its own lowliness and subjection  and now if we bring together in one view the principles we have ascertained in trees we shall find they may be summed under four great laws and that all perfect253 vegetable form is appointed to express these four laws in noble balance of authority  1 support from one living root  2 radiation or tendency of force from some one given point either in the root or in some stated connexion with it  3 liberty of each bough to seek its own livelihood and happiness according to its needs by irregularities of action both in its play and its work either stretching out to get its required nourishment from light and rain by finding some sufficient breathingplace among the other branches or knotting and gathering itself up to get strength for any load which its fruitful blossoms may lay upon it and for any stress of its stormtossed luxuriance of leaves or playing hither and thither as the fitful sunshine may tempt its young shoots in their undecided states of mind about their future life  4 imperative requirement of each bough to stop within certain limits expressive of its kindly fellowship and fraternity with the boughs in its neighborhood and to work with them according to its power magnitude and state of health to bring out the general perfectness of the great curve and circumferent stateliness of the whole tree  i think i may leave you unhelped to work out the moral analogies of these laws you may perhaps however be a little puzzled to see the meeting of the second one it typically expresses that healthy human actions should spring radiantly like rays from some single heart motive the most beautiful systems of action taking place when this motive lies at the root of the whole life and the action is clearly seen to proceed from it while also many beautiful secondary systems of action taking place from motives not so deep or central but in some beautiful subordinate connexion with the central or life motive  the other laws if you think over them you will find equally significative and as you draw trees more and more in their various states of health and hardship you will be every day more struck by the beauty of the types they present of the truths most essential for mankind to know254 and you will see what this vegetation of the earth which is necessary to our life first as purifying the air for us and then as food and just as necessary to our joy in all places of the earthwhat these trees and leaves i say are meant to teach us as we contemplate them and read or hear their lovely language written or spoken for us not in frightful black letters nor in dull sentences but in fair green and shadowy shapes of waving words and blossomed brightness of odoriferous wit and sweet whispers of unintrusive wisdom and playful morality  well i am sorry myself to leave the wood whatever my reader may be but leave it we must or we shall compose no more pictures today  this law of radiation then enforcing unison of action in arising from or proceeding to some given point is perhaps of all principles of composition the most influential in producing the beauty of groups of form other laws make them forcible or interesting but this generally is chief in rendering them beautiful in the arrangement of masses in pictures it is constantly obeyed by the great composers but like the law of principality with careful concealment of its imperativeness the point to which the lines of main curvature are directed being very often far away out of the picture sometimes however a system of curves will be employed definitely to exalt by their concurrence the value of some leading object and then the law becomes traceable enough  in the instance before us the principal object being as we have seen the tower on the bridge turner has determined that his system of curvature should have its origin in the top of this tower the diagram fig 34 page 369 compared with fig 32 page 361 will show how this is done one curve joins the two towers and is continued by the back of the figure sitting on the bank into the piece of bent timber this is a limiting curve of great importance and turner has drawn a considerable part of it with the edge of the timber very carefully and then led the eye up to the sitting girl by some white spots and indications of a ledge in the bank then the passage to the tops of the towers cannot be missed  the next curve is begun and drawn carefully for half an inch of its course by the rudder it is then taken up by the basket and the heads of the figures and leads accurately to the tower angle the gunwales of both the boats begin the next two curves which meet in the same point and all are centralised by the long reflection which continues the vertical lines  subordinated to this first system of curves there is another begun by the small crossing bar of wood inserted in the angle behind the rudder continued by the bottom of the bank on which the figure sits interrupted forcibly beyond it255 but taken up again by the waterline leading to the bridge foot and passing on in delicate shadows under the arches not easily shown in so rude a diagram towards the other extremity of the bridge this is a most important curve indicating that the force and sweep of the river have indeed been in old times under the large arches while the antiquity of the bridge is told us by the long tongue of land either of carted rubbish or washed down by some minor stream which has interrupted this curve and is now used as a landingplace for the boats and for embarkation of merchandise of which some bales and bundles are laid in a heap immediately beneath the great tower a common composer would have put these bales to one side or the other but turner knows better he uses them as a foundation for his tower adding to its importance precisely as the sculptured base adorns a pillar and he farther increases the aspect of its height by throwing the reflection of it far down in the nearer water all the great composers have this same feeling about sustaining their vertical masses you will constantly find prout using the artifice most dexterously see for instance the figure with the wheelbarrow under the great tower in the sketch of st nicolas at prague and the white group of figures under the tower in the sketch of augsburg256 and veronese titian and tintoret continually put their principal figures at bases of pillars turner found out their secret very early the most prominent instance of his composition on this principle being the drawing of turin from the superga in hakewells italy  i chose fig 20 already given to illustrate foliage drawing chiefly because being another instance of precisely the same arrangement it will serve to convince you of its being intentional there the vertical formed by the larger tree is continued by the figure of the farmer and that of one of the smaller trees by his stick the lines of the interior mass of the bushes radiate under the law of radiation from a point behind the farmers head but their outline curves are carried on and repeated under the law of continuity by the curves of the dog and boyby the way note the remarkable instance in these of the use of darkest lines towards the lightall more or less guiding the eye up to the right in order to bring it finally to the keep of windsor which is the central object of the picture as the bridge tower is in the coblentz the wall on which the boy climbs answers the purpose of contrasting both in direction and character with these greater curves thus corresponding as nearly as possible to the minor tongue of land in the coblentz this however introduces us to another law which we must consider separately   6 the law of contrast  of course the character of everything is best manifested by contrast rest can only be enjoyed after labour sound to be heard clearly must rise out of silence light is exhibited by darkness darkness by light and so on in all things now in art every colour has an opponent colour which if brought near it will relieve it more completely than any other so also every form and line may be made more striking to the eye by an opponent form or line near them a curved line is set off by a straight one a massy form by a slight one and so on and in all good work nearly double the value which any given colour or form would have uncombined is given to each by contrast257  in this case again however a too manifest use of the artifice vulgarises a picture great painters do not commonly or very visibly admit violent contrast they introduce it by stealth and with intermediate links of tender change allowing indeed the opposition to tell upon the mind as a surprise but not as a shock258  thus in the rock of ehrenbreitstein fig 35 the main current of the lines being downwards in a convex swell they are suddenly stopped at the lowest tower by a counter series of beds directed nearly straight across them this adverse force sets off and relieves the great curvature but it is reconciled to it by a series of radiating lines below which at first sympathize with the oblique bar then gradually get steeper till they meet and join in the fall of the great curve no passage however intentionally monotonous is ever introduced by a good artist without some slight counter current of this kind so much indeed do the great composers feel the necessity of it that they will even do things purposely ill or unsatisfactorily in order to give greater value to their welldoing in other places in a skilful poets versification the socalled bad or inferior lines are not inferior because he could not do them better but because he feels that if all were equally weighty there would be no real sense of weight anywhere if all were equally melodious the melody itself would be fatiguing and he purposely introduces the labouring or discordant verse that the full ring may be felt in his main sentence and the finished sweetness in his chosen rhythm259 and continually in painting inferior artists destroy their work by giving too much of all that they think is good while the great painter gives just enough to be enjoyed and passes to an opposite kind of enjoyment or to an inferior state of enjoyment he gives a passage of rich involved exquisitely wrought colour then passes away into slight and pale and simple colour he paints for a minute or two with intense decision then suddenly becomes as the spectator thinks slovenly but he is not slovenly you could not have taken any more decision from him just then you have had as much as is good for you he paints over a great space of his picture forms of the most rounded and melting tenderness and suddenly as you think by a freak gives you a bit as jagged and sharp as a leafless blackthorn perhaps the most exquisite piece of subtle contrast in the world of painting is the arrow point laid sharp against the white side and among the flowing hair of correggios antiope it is quite singular how very little contrast will sometimes serve to make an entire group of forms interesting which would otherwise have been valueless there is a good deal of picturesque material for instance in this top of an old tower fig 48 tiles and stones and sloping roof not disagreeably mingled but all would have been unsatisfactory if there had not happened to be that iron ring on the inner wall which by its vigorous black circular line precisely opposes all the square and angular characters of the battlements and roof draw the tower without the ring and see what a difference it will make  illustration fig 48  one of the most important applications of the law of contrast is in association with the law of continuity causing an unexpected but gentle break in a continuous series this artifice is perpetual in music and perpetual also in good illumination the way in which little surprises of change are prepared in any current borders or chains of ornamental design being one of the most subtle characteristics of the work of the good periods we take for instance a bar of ornament between two written columns of an early 14th century ms and at the first glance we suppose it to be quite monotonous all the way up composed of a winding tendril with alternately a blue leaf and a scarlet bud presently however we see that in order to observe the law of principality there is one large scarlet leaf instead of a bud nearly halfway up which forms a centre to the whole rod and when we begin to examine the order of the leaves we find it varied carefully let a stand for scarlet bud b for blue leaf c for two blue leaves on one stalk s for a stalk without a leaf and r for the large red leaf then counting from the ground the order begins as follows  b b a b s b a b b a b b a and we think we shall have two bs and an a all the way when suddenly it becomes b a b r b a b a b a and we think we are going to have b a continued but no here it becomes b s b s b a b s b s c s b s b s and we think we are surely going to have b s continued but behold it runs away to the end with a quick b b a b b b b260 very often however the designer is satisfied with one surprise but i never saw a good illuminated border without one at least and no series of any kind is ever introduced by a great composer in a painting without a snap somewhere there is a pretty one in turners drawing of rome with the large balustrade for a foreground in the hakewells italy series the single baluster struck out of the line and showing the street below through the gap simply makes the whole composition right when otherwise it would have been stiff and absurd  if you look back to fig 48 you will see in the arrangement of the battlements a simple instance of the use of such variation the whole top of the tower though actually three sides of a square strikes the eye as a continuous series of five masses the first two on the left somewhat square and blank then the next two higher and richer the tiles being seen on their slopes both these groups being couples there is enough monotony in the series to make a change pleasant and the last battlement therefore is a little higher than the first twoa little lower than the second twoand different in shape from either hide it with your finger and see how ugly and formal the other four battlements look  there are in this figure several other simple illustrations of the laws we have been tracing thus the whole shape of the walls mass being square it is well still for the sake of contrast to oppose it not only by the element of curvature in the ring and lines of the roof below but by that of sharpness hence the pleasure which the eye takes in the projecting point of the roof also because the walls are thick and sturdy it is well to contrast their strength with weakness therefore we enjoy the evident decrepitude of this roof as it sinks between them the whole mass being nearly white we want a contrasting shadow somewhere and get it under our piece of decrepitude this shade with the tiles of the wall below forms another pointed mass necessary to the first by the law of repetition hide this inferior angle with your finger and see how ugly the other looks a sense of the law of symmetry though you might hardly suppose it has some share in the feeling with which you look at the battlements there is a certain pleasure in the opposed slopes of their top on one side down to the left on the other to the right still less would you think the law of radiation had anything to do with the matter but if you take the extreme point of the black shadow on the left for a centre and follow first the low curve of the eaves of the wall it will lead you if you continue it to the point of the tower cornice follow the second curve the top of the tiles of the wall and it will strike the top of the righthand battlement then draw a curve from the highest point of the angle battlement on the left through the points of the roof and its dark echo and you will see how the whole top of the tower radiates from this lowest dark point there are other curvatures crossing these main ones to keep them from being too conspicuous follow the curve of the upper roof it will take you to the top of the highest battlement and the stones indicated at the righthand side of the tower are more extended at the bottom in order to get some less direct expression of sympathy such as irregular stones may be capable of with the general flow of the curves from left to right  you may not readily believe at first that all these laws are indeed involved in so trifling a piece of composition but as you study longer you will discover that these laws and many more are obeyed by the powerful composers in every touch that literally there is never a dash of their pencil which is not carrying out appointed purposes of this kind in twenty various ways at once and that there is as much difference in way of intention and authority between one of the great composers ruling his colours and a common painter confused by them as there is between a general directing the march of an army and an old lady carried off her feet by a mob   7 the law of interchange  closely connected with the law of contrast is a law which enforces the unity of opposite things by giving to each a portion of the character of the other if for instance you divide a shield into two masses of colour all the way downsuppose blue and white and put a bar or figure of an animal partly on one division partly on the other you will find it pleasant to the eye if you make the part of the animal blue which comes upon the white half and white which comes upon the blue half this is done in heraldry partly for the sake of perfect intelligibility but yet more for the sake of delight in interchange of colour since in all ornamentation whatever the practice is continual in the ages of good design  sometimes this alternation is merely a reversal of contrasts as that after red has been for some time on one side and blue on the other red shall pass to blues side and blue to reds this kind of alternation takes place simply in fourquartered shields in more subtle pieces of treatment a little bit only of each colour is carried into the other and they are as it were dovetailed together one of the most curious facts which will impress itself upon you when you have drawn some time carefully from nature in light and shade is the appearance of intentional artifice with which contrasts of this alternate kind are produced by her the artistry with which she will darken a tree trunk as long as it comes against light sky and throw sunlight on it precisely at the spot where it comes against a dark hill and similarly treat all her masses of shade and colour is so great that if you only follow her closely every one who looks at your drawing with attention will think that you have been inventing the most artifically and unnaturally delightful interchanges of shadow that could possibly be devised by human wit  you will find this law of interchange insisted upon at length by prout in his lessons on light and shade it seems of all his principles of composition to be the one he is most conscious of many others he obeys by instinct but this he formally accepts and forcibly declares  the typical purpose of the law of interchange is of course to teach us how opposite natures may be helped and strengthened by receiving each as far as they can some impress or imparted power from the other   8 the law of consistency  it is to be remembered in the next place that while contrast exhibits the characters of things it very often neutralises or paralyses their power a number of white things may be shown to be clearly white by opposition of a black thing but if you want the full power of their gathered light the black thing may be seriously in our way thus while contrast displays things it is unity and sympathy which employ them concentrating the power of several into a mass and not in art merely but in all the affairs of life the wisdom of man is continually called upon to reconcile these opposite methods of exhibiting or using the materials in his power by change he gives them pleasantness and by consistency value by change he is refreshed and by perseverence strengthened  hence many compositions address themselves to the spectator by aggregate force of colour or line more than by contrasts of either many noble pictures are painted almost exclusively in various tones of red or grey or gold so as to be instantly striking by their breadth of flush or glow or tender coldness these qualities being exhibited only by slight and subtle use of contrast similarly as to form some compositions associate massive and rugged forms others slight and graceful ones each with few interruptions by lines of contrary character and in general such compositions possess higher sublimity than those which are more mingled in their elements they tell a special tale and summon a definite state of feeling while the grand compositions merely please the eye  this unity or breadth of character generally attaches most to the works of the greatest men their separate pictures have all separate aims we have not in each grey colour set against sombre and sharp forms against soft and loud passages against low but we have the bright picture with its delicate sadness the sombre picture with its single ray of relief the stern picture with only one tender group of lines the soft and calm picture with only one rock angle at its flank and so on hence the variety of their work as well as its impressiveness the principal bearing of this law however is on the separate masses or divisions of a picture the character of the whole composition may be broken or various if we please but there must certainly be a tendency to consistent assemblage in its divisions as an army may act on several points at once but can only act effectually by having somewhere formed and regular masses and not wholly by skirmishers so a picture may be various in its tendencies but must be somewhere united and coherent in its masses good composers are always associating their colours in great groups binding their forms together by encompassing lines and securing by various dexterities of expedient what they themselves call breadth that is to say a large gathering of each kind of thing into one place light being gathered to light darkness to darkness and colour to colour if however this be done by introducing false lights or false colours it is absurd and monstrous the skill of a painter consists in obtaining breadth by rational arrangement of his objects not by forced or wanton treatment of them it is an easy matter to paint one thing all white and another all black or brown but not an easy matter to assemble all the circumstances which will naturally produce white in one place and brown in another generally speaking however breadth will result in sufficient degree from fidelity of study nature is always broad and if you paint her colours in true relations you will paint them in majestic masses if you find your work look broken and scattered it is in all probability not only ill composed but untrue  the opposite quality to breadth that of division or scattering of light and colour has a certain contrasting charm and is occasionally introduced with exquisite effect by good composers261 still it is never the mere scattering but the order discernible through this scattering which is the real source of pleasure not the mere multitude but the constellation of multitude the broken lights in the work of a good painter wander like flocks upon the hills not unshepherded speaking of life and peace the broken lights of a bad painter fall like hailstones and are capable only of mischief leaving it to be wished they were also of dissolution   9 the law of harmony  this last law is not strictly speaking so much one of composition as of truth but it must guide composition and is properly therefore to be stated in this place  good drawing is as we have seen an abstract of natural facts you cannot represent all that you would but must continually be falling short whether you will or no of the force or quantity of nature now suppose that your means and time do not admit of your giving the depth of colour in the scene and that you are obliged to paint it paler if you paint all the colours proportionately paler as if an equal quantity of tint had been washed away from each of them you still obtain a harmonious though not an equally forcible statement of natural fact but if you take away the colours unequally and leave some tints nearly as deep as they are in nature while others are much subdued you have no longer a true statement you cannot say to the observer fancy all those colours a little deeper and you will have the actual fact however he adds in imagination or takes away something is sure to be still wrong the picture is out of harmony  it will happen however much more frequently that you have to darken the whole system of colours than to make them paler you remember in your first studies of colour from nature you were to leave the passages of light which were too bright to be imitated as white paper but in completing the picture it becomes necessary to put colour into them and then the other colours must be made darker in some fixed relation to them if you deepen all proportionately though the whole scene is darker than reality it is only as if you were looking at the reality in a lower light but if while you darken some of the tints you leave others undarkened the picture is out of harmony and will not give the impression of truth  it is not indeed possible to deepen all the colours so much as to relieve the lights in their natural degree you would merely sink most of your colours if you tried to do so into a broad mass of blackness but it is quite possible to lower them harmoniously and yet more in some parts of the picture than in others so as to allow you to show the light you want in a visible relief in wellharmonised pictures this is done by gradually deepening the tone of the picture towards the lighter parts of it without materially lowering it in the very dark parts the tendency in such pictures being of course to include large masses of middle tints but the principal point to be observed in doing this is to deepen the individual tints without dirtying or obscuring them it is easy to lower the tone of the picture by washing it over with grey or brown and easy to see the effect of the landscape when its colours are thus universally polluted with black by using the black convex mirror one of the most pestilent inventions for falsifying nature and degrading art which ever was put into an artists hand262 for the thing required is not to darken pale yellow by mixing grey with it but to deepen the pure yellow not to darken crimson by mixing black with it but by making it deeper and richer crimson and thus the required effect could only be seen in nature if you had pieces of glass of the colour of every object in your landscape and of every minor hue that made up those colours and then could see the real landscape through this deep gorgeousness of the varied glass you cannot do this with glass but you can do it for yourself as you work that is to say you can put deep blue for pale blue deep gold for pale gold and so on in the proportion you need and then you may paint as forcibly as you choose but your work will still be in the manner of titian not of caravaggio or spagnoletto or any other of the black slaves of painting263  supposing those scales of colour which i told you to prepare in order to show you the relations of colour to grey were quite accurately made and numerous enough you would have nothing more to do in order to obtain a deeper tone in any given mass of colour than to substitute for each of its hues the hue as many degrees deeper in the scale as you wanted that is to say if you want to deepen the whole two degrees substituting for the yellow no 5 the yellow no 7 and for the red no 9 the red no 11 and so on but the hues of any object in nature are far too numerous and their degrees too subtle to admit of so mechanical a process still you may see the principle of the whole matter clearly by taking a group of colours out of your scale arranging them prettily and then washing them all over with grey that represents the treatment of nature by the black mirror then arrange the same group of colours with the tints five or six degrees deeper in the scale and that will represent the treatment of nature by titian  you can only however feel your way fully to the right of the thing by working from nature  the best subject on which to begin a piece of study of this kind is a good thick tree trunk seen against blue sky with some white clouds in it paint the clouds in true and tenderly gradated white then give the sky a bold full blue bringing them well out then paint the trunk and leaves grandly dark against all but in such glowing dark green and brown as you see they will bear afterwards proceed to more complicated studies matching the colours carefully first by your old method then deepening each colour with its own tint and being careful above all things to keep truth of equal change when the colours are connected with each other as in dark and light sides of the same object much more aspect and sense of harmony are gained by the precision with which you observe the relation of colours in dark sides and light sides and the influence of modifying reflections than by mere accuracy of added depth in independent colours  this harmony of tone as it is generally called is the most important of those which the artist has to regard but there are all kinds of harmonies in a picture according to its mode of production there is even a harmony of touch if you paint one part of it very rapidly and forcibly and another part slowly and delicately each division of the picture may be right separately but they will not agree together the whole will be effectless and valueless out of harmony similarly if you paint one part of it by a yellow light in a warm day and another by a grey light in a cold day though both may have been sunlight and both may be well toned and have their relative shadows truly cast neither will look like light they will destroy each others power by being out of harmony these are only broad and definable instances of discordance but there is an extent of harmony in all good work much too subtle for definition depending on the draughtsmans carrying everything he draws up to just the balancing and harmonious point in finish and colour and depth of tone and intensity of moral feeling and style of touch all considered at once and never allowing himself to lean too emphatically on detached parts or exalt one thing at the expense of another or feel acutely in one place and coldly in another if you have got some of cruikshanks etchings you will be able i think to feel the nature of harmonious treatment in a simple kind by comparing them with any of richters illustrations to the numerous german storybooks lately published at christmas with all the german stories spoiled cruikshanks work is often incomplete in character and poor in incident but as drawing it is perfect in harmony the pure and simple effects of daylight which he gets by his thorough mastery of treatment in this respect are quite unrivalled as far as i know by any other work executed with so few touches his vignettes to grimms german stories already recommended are the most remarkable in this quality richters illustrations on the contrary are of a very high stamp as respects understanding of human character with infinite playfulness and tenderness of fancy but as drawings they are almost unendurably out of harmony violent blacks in one place being continually opposed to trenchant white in another and as is almost sure to be the case with bad harmonists the local colour hardly felt anywhere all german work is apt to be out of harmony in consequence of its too frequent conditions of affectation and its wilful refusals of fact as well as by reason of a feverish kind of excitement which dwells violently on particular points and makes all the lines of thought in the picture to stand on end as it were like a cats fur electrified while good work is always as quiet as a couchant leopard and as strong  i have now stated to you all the laws of composition which occur to me as capable of being illustrated or defined but there are multitudes of others which in the present state of my knowledge i cannot define and others which i never hope to define and these the most important and connected with the deepest powers of the art among those which i hope to be able to explain when i have thought of them more are the laws which relate to nobleness and ignobleness that ignobleness especially which we commonly call vulgarity and which in its essence is one of the most curious subjects of inquiry connected with human feeling among those which i never hope to explain are chiefly laws of expression and others bearing simply on simple matters but for that very reason more influential than any others these are from the first as inexplicable as our bodily sensations are it being just as impossible i think to explain why one succession of musical notes264 shall be noble and pathetic and such as might have been sung by casella to dante and why another succession is base and ridiculous and would be fit only for the reasonably good ear of bottom as to explain why we like sweetness and dislike bitterness the best part of every great work is always inexplicable it is good because it is good and innocently gracious opening as the green of the earth or falling as the dew of heaven  but though you cannot explain them you may always render yourself more and more sensitive to these higher qualities by the discipline which you generally give to your character and this especially with regard to the choice of incidents a kind of composition in some sort easier than the artistical arrangements of lines and colours but in every sort nobler because addressed to deeper feelings  for instance in the datur hora quieti the last vignette to rogers poems the plough in the foreground has three purposes the first purpose is to meet the stream of sunlight on the river and make it brighter by opposition but any dark object whatever would have done this its second purpose is by its two arms to repeat the cadence of the group of the two ships and thus give a greater expression of repose but two sitting figures would have done this its third and chief or pathetic purpose is as it lies abandoned in the furrow the vessels also being moored and having their sails down to be a type of human labour closed with the close of day the parts of it on which the hand leans are brought most clearly into sight and they are the chief dark of the picture because the tillage of the ground is required of man as a punishment but they make the soft light of the setting sun brighter because rest is sweetest after toil these thoughts may never occur to us as we glance carelessly at the design and yet their under current assuredly affects the feelings and increases as the painter meant it should the impression of melancholy and of peace  again in the lancaster sands which is one of the plates i have marked as most desirable for your possession the stream of light which falls from the setting sun on the advancing tide stands similarly in need of some force of near object to relieve its brightness but the incident which turner has here adopted is the swoop of an angry seagull at a dog who yelps at it drawing back as the wave rises over his feet and the bird shrieks within a foot of his face its unexpected boldness is a type of the anger of its ocean element and warns us of the seas advance just as surely as the abandoned plough told us of the ceased labour of the day  it is not however so much in the selection of single incidents of this kind as in the feeling which regulates the arrangement of the whole subject that the mind of a great composer is known a single incident may be suggested by a felicitous chance as a pretty motto might be for the heading of a chapter but the great composers so arrange all their designs that one incident illustrates another just as one colour relieves another perhaps the heysham of the yorkshire series which as to its locality may be considered a companion to the last drawing we have spoken of the lancaster sands presents as interesting an example as we could find of turners feeling in this respect the subject is a simple northcountry village on the shore of morecambe bay not in the common sense a picturesque village there are no pretty bowwindows or red roofs or rocky steps of entrance to the rustic doors or quaint gables nothing but a single street of thatched and chiefly claybuilt cottages ranged in a somewhat monotonous line the roofs so green with moss that at first we hardly discern the houses from the fields and trees the village street is closed at the end by a wooden gate indicating the little traffic there is on the road through it and giving it something the look of a large farmstead in which a right of way lies through the yard the road which leads to this gate is full of ruts and winds down a bad bit of hill between two broken banks of moor ground succeeding immediately to the few enclosures which surround the village they can hardly be called gardens but a decayed fragment or two of fencing fill the gaps in the bank and a clothesline with some clothes on it striped blue and red and a smockfrock is stretched between the trunks of some stunted willows a very small haystack and pigstye being seen at the back of the cottage beyond an empty twowheeled lumbering cart drawn by a pair of horses with huge wooden collars the driver sitting lazily in the sun sideways on the leader is going slowly home along the rough road it being about country dinnertime at the end of the village there is a better house with three chimneys and a dormer window in its roof and the roof is of stone shingle instead of thatch but very rough this house is no doubt the clergymans there is some smoke from one of its chimneys none from any other in the village this smoke is from the lowest chimney at the back evidently that of the kitchen and it is rather thick the fire not having been long lighted a few hundred yards from the clergymans house nearer the shore is the church discernible from the cottage only by its lowarched belfry a little neater than one would expect in such a village perhaps lately built by the puseyite incumbent265 and beyond the church close to the sea are two fragments of a border wartower standing on their circular mound worn on its brow deep into edges and furrows by the feet of the village children on the bank of moor which forms the foreground are a few cows the carters dog barking at a vixenish one the milkmaid is feeding another a gentle white one which turns its head to her expectant of a handful of fresh hay which she has brought for it in her blue apron fastened up round her waist she stands with her pail on her head evidently the village coquette for she has a neat bodice and pretty striped petticoat under the blue apron and red stockings nearer us the cowherd barefooted stands on a piece of the limestone rock for the ground is thistly and not pleasurable to bare feetwhether boy or girl we are not sure it may be a boy with a girls wornout bonnet on or a girl with a pair of ragged trowsers on probably the first as the old bonnet is evidently useful to keep the sun out of our eyes when we are looking for strayed cows among the moorland hollows and helps us at present to watch holding the bonnets edge down the quarrel of the vixenish cow with the dog which leaning on our long stick we allow to proceed without any interference a little to the right the hay is being got in of which the milkmaid has just taken her apronful to the white cow but the hay is very thin and cannot well be raked up because of the rocks we must glean it like corn hence the smallness of our stack behind the willows and a woman is pressing a bundle of it hard together kneeling against the rocks edge to carry it safely to the haycart without dropping any beyond the village is a rocky hill deep set with brushwood a square crag or two of limestone emerging here and there with pleasant turf on their brows heaved in russet and mossy mounds against the sky which clear and calm and as golden as the moss stretches down behind it towards the sea a single cottage just shows its roof over the edge of the hill looking seaward perhaps one of the village shepherds is a sea captain now and may have built it there that his mother may first see the sails of his ship whenever it runs into the bay then under the hill and beyond the border tower is the blue sea itself the waves flowing in over the sand in long curved lines slowly shadows of cloud and gleams of shallow water on white sand alternatingmiles away but no sail is visible not one fisherboat on the beach not one dark speck on the quiet horizon beyond all are the cumberland mountains clear in the sun with rosy light on all their crags  i should think the reader cannot but feel the kind of harmony there is in this composition the entire purpose of the painter to give us the impression of wild yet gentle country life monotonous as the succession of the noiseless waves patient and enduring as the rocks but peaceful and full of health and quiet hope and sanctified by the pure mountain air and baptismal dew of heaven falling softly between days of toil and nights of innocence  all noble composition of this kind can be reached only by instinct you cannot set yourself to arrange such a subject you may see it and seize it at all times but never laboriously invent it and your power of discerning what is best in expression among natural subjects depends wholly on the temper in which you keep your own mind above all on your living so much alone as to allow it to become acutely sensitive in its own stillness the noisy life of modern days is wholly incompatible with any true perception of natural beauty if you go down into cumberland by the railroad live in some frequented hotel and explore the hills with merry companions however much you may enjoy your tour or their conversation depend upon it you will never choose so much as one pictorial subject rightly you will not see into the depth of any but take knapsack and stick walk towards the hills by short days journeysten or twelve miles a daytaking a week from some startingplace sixty or seventy miles away sleep at the pretty little wayside inns or the rough village ones then take the hills as they tempt you following glen or shore as your eye glances or your heart guides wholly scornful of local fame or fashion and of everything which it is the ordinary travellers duty to see or pride to do never force yourself to admire anything when you are not in the humour but never force yourself away from what you feel to be lovely in search of anything better and gradually the deeper scenes of the natural world will unfold themselves to you in still increasing fulness of passionate power and your difficulty will be no more to seek or to compose subjects but only to choose one from among the multitude of melodious thoughts with which you will be haunted thoughts which will of course be noble or original in proportion to your own depth of character and general power of mind for it is not so much by the consideration you give to any single drawing as by the previous discipline of your powers of thought that the character of your composition will be determined simplicity of life will make you sensitive to the refinement and modesty of scenery just as inordinate excitement and pomp of daily life will make you enjoy coarse colours and affected forms habits of patient comparison and accurate judgment will make your art precious as they will make your actions wise and every increase of noble enthusiasm in your living spirit will be measured by the reflection of its light upon the works of your hands      faithfully yours      j ruskin  footnotes  234 i give rossetti this pre√´minence because though the leading preraphaelites have all about equal power over colour in the abstract rossetti and holman hunt are distinguished above the rest for rendering colour under effects of light and of these two rossetti composes with richer fancy and with a deeper sense of beauty hunts stern realism leading him continually into harshness rossettis carelessness to do him justice is only in watercolour never in oil  235 all the degradation of art which was brought about after the rise of the dutch school by asphaltum yellow varnish and brown trees would have been prevented if only painters had been forced to work in dead colour any colour will do for some people if it is browned and shining but fallacy in dead colour is detected on the instant i even believe that whenever a painter begins to wish that he could touch any portion of his work with gum he is going wrong  it is necessary however in this matter carefully to distinguish between translucency and lustre translucency though as i have said above a dangerous temptation is in its place beautiful but lustre or shininess is always in painting a defect nay one of my best painterfriends the best being understood to attach to both divisions of that awkward compound word tried the other day to persuade me thatlustre was an ignobleness in anything and it was only the fear of treason to ladies eyes and to mountain streams and to morning dew which kept me from yielding the point to him one is apt always to generalise too quickly in such matters but there can be no question that lustre is destructive of loveliness in colour as it is of intelligibility in form whatever may be the pride of a young beauty in the knowledge that her eyes shine though perhaps even eyes are most beautiful in dimness she would be sorry if her cheeks did and which of us would wish to polish a rose  236 but not shiny or greasy bristol board or hotpressed imperial or grey paper that feels slightly adhesive to the hand is best coarse gritty and sandy papers are fit only for blotters and blunderers no good draughtsman would lay a line on them turner worked much on a thin tough paper dead in surface rolling up his sketches in tight bundles that would go deep into his pockets  237 i insist upon this unalterability of colour the more because i address you as a beginner or an amateur a great artist can sometimes get out of a difficulty with credit or repent without confession yet even titians alterations usually show as stains on his work  238 it is i think a piece of affectation to try to work with few colours it saves time to have enough tints prepared without mixing and you may at once allow yourself these twentyfour if you arrange them in your colourbox in the order i have set them down you will always easily put your finger on the one you want    cobalt         smalt                antwerp blue   prussian blue   black          gamboge              emerald green  hookers green   lemon yellow   cadmium yellow       yellow ochre

sepia  antwerp blue and prussian blue are not very permanent colours but you need not care much about permanence in your own work as yet and they are both beautiful while indigo is marked by field as more fugitive still and is very ugly hookers green is a mixed colour put in the box merely to save you loss of time in mixing gamboge and prussian blue no 1 is the best tint of it violet carmine is a noble colour for laying broken shadows with to be worked into afterwards with other colours  if you wish to take up colouring seriously you had better get fields chromatography at once only do not attend to anything it says about principles or harmonies of colour but only to its statements of practical serviceableness in pigments and of their operations on each other when mixed c  239 a more methodical though under general circumstances uselessly prolix way is to cut a square hole some half an inch wide in the sheet of cardboard and a series of small circular holes in a slip of cardboard an inch wide pass the slip over the square opening and match each colour beside one of the circular openings you will thus have no occasion to wash any of the colours away but the first rough method is generally all you want as after a little practice you only need to look at the hue through the opening in order to be able to transfer it to your drawing at once  240 if colours were twenty times as costly as they are we should have many more good painters if i were chancellor of the exchequer i would lay a tax of twenty shillings a cake on all colours except black prussian blue vandyke brown and chinese white which i would leave for students i dont say this jestingly i believe such a tax would do more to advance real art than a great many schools of design  241 i say modern because titians quiet way of blending colours which is the perfectly right one is not understood now by any artist the best colour we reach is got by stippling but this not quite right  242 the worst general character that colour can possibly have is a prevalent tendency to a dirty yellowish green like that of a decaying heap of vegetables this colour is accurately indicative of decline or paralysis in missalpainting  243 that is to say local colour inherent in the object the gradations of colour in the various shadows belonging to various lights exhibit form and therefore no one but a colourist can ever draw forms perfectly see modern painters vol iv chap iii at the end but all notions of explaining form by superimposed colour as in architectural mouldings are absurd colour adorns form but does not interpret it an apple is prettier because it is striped but it does not look a bit rounder and a cheek is prettier because it is flushed but you would see the form of the cheek bone better if it were not colour may indeed detach one shape from another as in grounding a basrelief but it always diminishes the appearance of projection and whether you put blue purple red yellow or green for your ground the basrelief will be just as clearly or just as imperfectly relieved as long as the colours are of equal depth the blue ground will not retire the hundredth part of an inch more than the red one  244 see however at the close of this letter the notice of one more point connected with the management of colour under the head law of harmony  245 see farther on this subject modern painters vol iv chap viii ¬ß 6  246 in general throughout nature reflection and repetition are peaceful things associated with the idea of quiet succession in events that one day should be like another day or one history the repetition of another history being more or less results of quietness while dissimilarity and nonsuccession are results of interference and disquietude thus though an echo actually increases the quantity of sound heard its repetition of the note or syllable gives an idea of calmness attainable in no other way hence also the feeling of calm given to a landscape by the voice of a cuckoo  247 this is obscure in the rude woodcut the masts being so delicate that they are confused among the lines of reflection in the original they have orange light upon them relieved against purple behind  248 the cost of art in getting a bridge level is always lost for you must get up to the height of the central arch at any rate and you only can make the whole bridge level by putting the hill farther back and pretending to have got rid of it when you have not but have only wasted money in building an unnecessary embankment of course the bridge should not be difficultly or dangerously steep but the necessary slope whatever it may be should be in the bridge itself as far as the bridge can take it and not pushed aside into the approach as in our waterloo road the only rational excuse for doing which is that when the slope must be long it is inconvenient to put on a drag at the top of the bridge and that any restiveness of the horse is more dangerous on the bridge than on the embankment to this i answer first it is not more dangerous in reality though it looks so for the bridge is always guarded by an effective parapet but the embankment is sure to have no parapet or only a useless rail and secondly that it is better to have the slope on the bridge and make the roadway wide in proportion so as to be quite safe because a little waste of space on the river is no loss but your wide embankment at the side loses good ground and so my picturesque bridges are right as well as beautiful and i hope to see them built again some day instead of the frightful straightbacked things which we fancy are fine and accept from the pontifical rigidities of the engineering mind  249 i cannot waste space here by reprinting what i have said in other books but the reader ought if possible to refer to the notices of this part of our subject in modern painters vol iv chap xviii and stones of venice vol iii chap i ¬ß 8  250 if you happen to be reading at this part of the book without having gone through any previous practice turn back to the sketch of the ramification of stone pine fig 4 page 30 and examine the curves of its boughs one by one trying them by the conditions here stated under the heads a and b  251 the reader i hope observes always that every line in these figures is itself one of varying curvature and cannot be drawn by compasses  252 i hope the reader understands that these woodcuts are merely facsimiles of the sketches i make at the side of my paper to illustrate my meaning as i writeoften sadly scrawled if i want to get on to something else this one is really a little too careless but it would take more time and trouble to make a proper drawing of so odd a boat than the matter is worth it will answer the purpose well enough as it is  253 imperfect vegetable form i consider that which is in its nature dependent as in runners and climbers or which is susceptible of continual injury without materially losing the power of giving pleasure by its aspect as in the case of the smaller grasses i have not of course space here to explain these minor distinctions but the laws above stated apply to all the more important trees and shrubs likely to be familiar to the student  254 there is a very tender lesson of this kind in the shadows of leaves upon the ground shadows which are the most likely of all to attract attention by their pretty play and change if you examine them you will find that the shadows do not take the forms of the leaves but that through each interstice the light falls at a little distance in the form of a round or oval spot that is to say it produces the image of the sun itself cast either vertically or obliquely in circle or ellipse according to the slope of the ground of course the suns rays produce the same effect when they fall through any small aperture but the openings between leaves are the only ones likely to show it to an ordinary observer or to attract his attention to it by its frequency and lead him to think what this type may signify respecting the greater sun and how it may show us that even when the opening through which the earth receives light is too small to let us see the sun himself the ray of light that enters if it comes straight from him will still bear with it his image  255 in the smaller figure 32 it will be seen that this interruption is caused by a cart coming down to the waters edge and this object is serviceable as beginning another system of curves leading out of the picture on the right but so obscurely drawn as not to be easily represented in outline as it is unnecessary to the explanation of our point here it has been omitted in the larger diagram the direction of the curve it begins being indicated by the dashes only  256 both in the sketches in flanders and germany  257 if you happen to meet with the plate of durers representing a coat of arms with a skull in the shield note the value given to the concave curves and sharp point of the helmet by the convex leafage carried round it in front and the use of the blank white part of the shield in opposing the rich folds of the dress  258 turner hardly ever as far as i remember allows a strong light to oppose a full dark without some intervening tint his suns never set behind dark mountains without a film of cloud above the mountains edge  259      a prudent chief not always must display     his powers in equal ranks and fair array     but with the occasion and the place comply     conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly     those oft are stratagems which errors seem     nor is it homer nods but we that dream  essay on criticism  260 i am describing from a ms circa 1300 of gregorys decretalia in my own possession  261 one of the most wonderful compositions of tintoret in venice is little more than a field of subdued crimson spotted with flakes of scattered gold the upper clouds in the most beautiful skies owe great part of their power to infinitude of division order being marked through this division  262 i fully believe that the strange grey gloom accompanied by considerable power of effect which prevails in modern french art must be owing to the use of this mischievous instrument the french landscape always gives me the idea of nature seen carelessly in the dark mirror and painted coarsely but scientifically through the veil of its perversion  263 various other parts of this subject are entered into especially in their bearing on the ideal of painting in modern painters vol iv chap iii  264 in all the best arrangements of colour the delight occasioned by their mode of succession is entirely inexplicable nor can it be reasoned about we like it just as we like an air in music but cannot reason any refractory person into liking it if they do not and yet there is distinctly a right and a wrong in it and a good taste and bad taste respecting it as also in music  265 puseyism was unknown in the days when this drawing was made but the kindly and helpful influences of what may be called ecclesiastical sentiment which in a morbidly exaggerated condition forms one of the principal elements of puseyismi use this word regretfully no other existing which will serve for ithad been known and felt in our wild northern districts long before     appendix   things to be studied  the worst danger by far to which a solitary student is exposed is that of liking things that he should not it is not so much his difficulties as his tastes which he must set himself to conquer and although under the guidance of a master many works of art may be made instructive which are only of partial excellence the good and bad of them being duly distinguished his safeguard as long as he studies alone will be in allowing himself to possess only things in their way so free from faults that nothing he copies in them can seriously mislead him and to contemplate only those works of art which he knows to be either perfect or noble in their errors i will therefore set down in clear order the names of the masters whom you may safely admire and a few of the books which you may safely possess in these days of cheap illustration the danger is always rather of your possessing too much than too little it may admit of some question how far the looking at bad art may set off and illustrate the characters of the good but on the whole i believe it is best to live always on quite wholesome food and that our taste of it will not be made more acute by feeding however temporarily on ashes of course the works of the great masters can only be serviceable to the student after he has made considerable progress himself it only wastes the time and dulls the feelings of young persons to drag them through picture galleries at least unless they themselves wish to look at particular pictures generally young people only care to enter a picture gallery when there is a chance of getting leave to run a race to the other end of it and they had better do that in the garden below if however they have any real enjoyment of pictures and want to look at this one or that the principal point is never to disturb them in looking at what interests them and never to make them look at what does not nothing is of the least use to young people nor by the way of much use to old ones but what interests them and therefore though it is of great importance to put nothing but good art into their possession yet when they are passing through great houses or galleries they should be allowed to look precisely at what pleases them if it is not useful to them as art it will be in some other way and the healthiest way in which art can interest them is when they look at it not as art but because it represents something they like in nature if a boy has had his heart filled by the life of some great man and goes up thirstily to a vandyck portrait of him to see what he was like that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of portraiture if he love mountains and dwell on a turner drawing because he sees in it a likeness to a yorkshire scar or an alpine pass that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of landscape and if a girls mind is filled with dreams of angels and saints and she pauses before an angelico because she thinks it must surely be indeed like heaven that is the wholesomest way for her to begin the study of religious art  when however the student has made some definite progress and every picture becomes really a guide to him false or true in his own work it is of great importance that he should never so much as look at bad art and then if the reader is willing to trust me in the matter the following advice will be useful to him in which with his permission i will quit the indirect and return to the epistolary address as being the more convenient  first in galleries of pictures  1 you may look with trust in their being always right at titian veronese tintoret giorgione john bellini and velasquez the authenticity of the picture being of course established for you by proper authority  2 you may look with admiration admitting however question of right and wrong266 at van eyck holbein perugino francia angelico leonardo da vinci correggio vandyck rembrandt reynolds gainsborough turner and the modern preraphaelites267 you had better look at no other painters than these for you run a chance otherwise of being led far off the road or into grievous faults by some of the other great ones as michael angelo raphael and rubens and of being besides corrupted in taste by the base ones as murillo salvator claude gasper poussin teniers and such others you may look however for examples of evil with safe universality of reprobation being sure that everything you see is bad at domenichino the caracci bronzino and the figure pieces of salvator  among those named for study under question you cannot look too much at nor grow too enthusiastically fond of angelico correggio reynolds turner and the preraphaelites but if you find yourself getting especially fond of any of the others leave off looking at them for you must be going wrong some way or other if for instance you begin to like rembrandt or leonardo especially you are losing your feeling for colour if you like van eyck or perugino especially you must be getting too fond of rigid detail and if you like vandyck or gainsborough especially you must be too much attracted by gentlemanly flimsiness  secondly of published or otherwise multiplied art such as you may be able to get yourself or to see at private houses or in shops the works of the following masters are the most desirable after the turners rembrandts and durers which i have asked you to get first   1 samuel prout  all his published lithographic sketches are of the greatest value wholly unrivalled in power of composition and in love and feeling of architectural subject his somewhat mannered linear execution though not to be imitated in your own sketches from nature may be occasionally copied for disciplines sake with great advantage it will give you a peculiar steadiness of hand not quickly attainable in any other way and there is no fear of your getting into any faultful mannerism as long as you carry out the different modes of more delicate study above recommended  if you are interested in architecture and wish to make it your chief study you should draw much from photographs of it and then from the architecture itself with the same completion of detail and gradation only keeping the shadows of due paleness in photographs they are always about four times as dark as they ought to be and treat buildings with as much care and love as artists do their rock foregrounds drawing all the moss and weeds and stains upon them but if without caring to understand architecture you merely want the picturesque character of it and to be able to sketch it fast you cannot do better than take prout for your exclusive master only do not think that you are copying prout by drawing straight lines with dots at the end of them get first his rhine and draw the subjects that have most hills and least architecture in them with chalk on smooth paper till you can lay on his broad flat tints and get his gradations of light which are very wonderful then take up the architectural subjects in the rhine and draw again and again the groups of figures c in his microcosm and lessons on light and shadow after that proceed to copy the grand subjects in the sketches in flanders and germany or in switzerland and italy if you cannot get the flanders but the switzerland is very far inferior then work from nature not trying to proutise nature by breaking smooth buildings into rough ones but only drawing what you see with prouts simple method and firm lines dont copy his coloured works they are good but not at all equal to his chalk and pencil drawings and you will become a mere imitator and a very feeble imitator if you use colour at all in prouts method i have not space to explain why this is so it would take a long piece of reasoning trust me for the statement   2 john lewis  his sketches in spain lithographed by himself are very valuable get them if you can and also some engravings about eight or ten i think altogether of wild beasts executed by his own hand a long time ago they are very precious in every way the series of the alhambra is rather slight and few of the subjects are lithographed by himself still it is well worth having  but let no lithographic work come into the house if you can help it nor even look at any except prouts and those sketches of lewiss   3 george cruikshank  if you ever happen to meet with the two volumes of grimms german stories which were illustrated by him long ago pounce upon them instantly the etchings in them are the finest things next to rembrandts that as far as i know have been done since etching was invented you cannot look at them too much nor copy them too often  all his works are very valuable though disagreeable when they touch on the worst vulgarities of modern life and often much spoiled by a curiously mistaken type of face divided so as to give too much to the mouth and eyes and leave too little for forehead the eyes being set about two thirds up instead of at half the height of the head but his manner of work is always right and his tragic power though rarely developed and warped by habits of caricature is in reality as great as his grotesque power  there is no fear of his hurting your taste as long as your principal work lies among art of so totally different a character as most of that which i have recommended to you and you may therefore get great good by copying almost anything of his that may come in your way except only his illustrations lately published to cinderella and jack and the beanstalk and tom thumb which are much overlaboured and confused in line you should get them but do not copy them   4 alfred rethel  i only know two publications by him one the dance of death with text by reinick published in leipsic but to be had now of any london bookseller for the sum i believe of eighteen pence and containing six plates full of instructive character the other of two plates only death the avenger and death the friend these two are far superior to the todtentanz and if you can get them will be enough in themselves to show all that rethel can teach you if you dislike ghastly subjects get death the friend only   5 bewick  the execution of the plumage in bewicks birds is the most masterly thing ever yet done in woodcutting it is just worked as paul veronese would have worked in wood had he taken to it his vignettes though too coarse in execution and vulgar in types of form to be good copies show nevertheless intellectual power of the highest order and there are pieces of sentiment in them either pathetic or satirical which have never since been equalled in illustrations of this simple kind the bitter intensity of the feeling being just like that which characterises some of the leading preraphaelites bewick is the burns of painting   6 blake  the book of job engraved by himself is of the highest rank in certain characters of imagination and expression in the mode of obtaining certain effects of light it will also be a very useful example to you in expressing conditions of glaring and flickering light blake is greater than rembrandt   7 richter  i have already told you what to guard against in looking at his works i am a little doubtful whether i have done well in including them in this catalogue at all but the fancies in them are so pretty and numberless that i must risk for their sake the chance of hurting you a little in judgment of style if you want to make presents of storybooks to children his are the best you can now get   8 rossetti  an edition of tennyson lately published contains woodcuts from drawings by rossetti and other chief preraphaelite masters they are terribly spoiled in the cutting and generally the best part the expression of feature entirely lost268 still they are full of instruction and cannot be studied too closely but observe respecting these woodcuts that if you have been in the habit of looking at much spurious work in which sentiment action and style are borrowed or artificial you will assuredly be offended at first by all genuine work which is intense in feeling genuine art which is merely art such as veroneses or titians may not offend you though the chances are that you will not care about it but genuine works of feeling such as maude and aurora leigh in poetry or the grand preraphaelite designs in painting are sure to offend you and if you cease to work hard and persist in looking at vicious and false art they will continue to offend you it will be well therefore to have one type of entirely false art in order to know what to guard against flaxmans outlines to dante contain i think examples of almost every kind of falsehood and feebleness which it is possible for a trained artist not base in thought to commit or admit both in design and execution base or degraded choice of subject such as you will constantly find in teniers and others of the dutch painters i need not i hope warn you against you will simply turn away from it in disgust while mere bad or feeble drawing which makes mistakes in every direction at once cannot teach you the particular sort of educated fallacy in question but in these designs of flaxmans you have gentlemanly feeling and fair knowledge of anatomy and firm setting down of lines all applied in the foolishest and worst possible way you cannot have a more finished example of learned error amiable want of meaning and bad drawing with a steady hand269 retschs outlines have more real material in them than flaxmans occasionally showing true fancy and power in artistic principle they are nearly as bad and in taste worse all outlines from statuary as given in works on classical art will be very hurtful to you if you in the least like them and nearly all finished line engravings some particular prints i could name which possess instructive qualities but it would take too long to distinguish them and the best way is to avoid line engravings of figures altogether if you happen to be a rich person possessing quantities of them and if you are fond of the large finished prints from raphael correggio c it is wholly impossible that you can make any progress in knowledge of real art till you have sold them allor burnt them which would be a greater benefit to the world i hope that some day true and noble engravings will be made from the few pictures of the great schools which the restorations undertaken by the modern managers of foreign galleries may leave us but the existing engravings have nothing whatever in common with the good in the works they profess to represent and if you like them you like in the originals of them hardly anything but their errors  finally your judgment will be of course much affected by your taste in literature indeed i know many persons who have the purest taste in literature and yet false taste in art and it is a phenomenon which puzzles me not a little but i have never known any one with false taste in books and true taste in pictures it is also of the greatest importance to you not only for arts sake but for all kinds of sake in these days of book deluge to keep out of the salt swamps of literature and live on a rocky island of your own with a spring and a lake in it pure and good i cannot of course suggest the choice of your library to you every several mind needs different books but there are some books which we all need and assuredly if you read homer270 plato √Üschylus herodotus dante271 shakspeare and spenser as much as you ought you will not require wide enlargement of shelves to right and left of them for purposes of perpetual study among modern books avoid generally magazine and review literature sometimes it may contain a useful abridgement or a wholesome piece of criticism but the chances are ten to one it will either waste your time or mislead you if you want to understand any subject whatever read the best book upon it you can hear of not a review of the book if you dont like the first book you try seek for another but do not hope ever to understand the subject without pains by a reviewers help avoid especially that class of literature which has a knowing tone it is the most poisonous of all every good book or piece of book is full of admiration and awe it may contain firm assertion or stern satire but it never sneers coldly nor asserts haughtily and it always leads you to reverence or love something with your whole heart it is not always easy to distinguish the satire of the venomous race of books from the satire of the noble and pure ones but in general you may notice that the coldblooded crustacean and batrachian books will sneer at sentiment and the warmblooded human books at sin then in general the more you can restrain your serious reading to reflective or lyric poetry history and natural history avoiding fiction and the drama the healthier your mind will become of modern poetry keep to scott wordsworth keats crabbe tennyson the two brownings lowell longfellow and coventry patmore whose angel in the house is a most finished piece of writing and the sweetest analysis we possess of quiet modern domestic feeling while mrs brownings aurora leigh is as far as i know the greatest poem which the century has produced in any language cast coleridge at once aside as sickly and useless and shelley as shallow and verbose byron until your taste is fully formed and you are able to discern the magnificence in him from the wrong never read bad or common poetry nor write any poetry yourself there is perhaps rather too much than too little in the world already  of reflective prose read chiefly bacon johnson and helps carlyle is hardly to be named as a writer for beginners because his teaching though to some of us vitally necessary may to others be hurtful if you understand and like him read him if he offends you you are not yet ready for him and perhaps may never be so at all events give him up as you would seabathing if you found it hurt you till you are stronger of fiction read sir charles grandison scotts novels miss edgeworths and if you are a young lady madame de genlis the french miss edgeworth making these i mean your constant companions of course you must or will read other books for amusement once or twice but you will find that these have an element of perpetuity in them existing in nothing else of their kind while their peculiar quietness and repose of manner will also be of the greatest value in teaching you to feel the same characters in art read little at a time trying to feel interest in little things and reading not so much for the sake of the story as to get acquainted with the pleasant people into whose company these writers bring you a common book will often give you much amusement but it is only a noble book which will give you dear friends remember also that it is of less importance to you in your earlier years that the books you read should be clever than that they should be right i do not mean oppressively or repulsively instructive but that the thoughts they express should be just and the feelings they excite generous it is not necessary for you to read the wittiest or the most suggestive books it is better in general to hear what is already known and may be simply said much of the literature of the present day though good to be read by persons of ripe age has a tendency to agitate rather than confirm and leaves its readers too frequently in a helpless or hopeless indignation the worst possible state into which the mind of youth can be thrown it may indeed become necessary for you as you advance in life to set your hand to things that need to be altered in the world or apply your heart chiefly to what must be pitied in it or condemned but for a young person the safest temper is one of reverence and the safest place one of obscurity certainly at present and perhaps through all your life your teachers are wisest when they make you content in quiet virtue and that literature and art are best for you which point out in common life and familiar things the objects for hopeful labour and for humble love  footnotes  266 i do not mean necessarily to imply inferiority of rank in saying that this second class of painters have questionable qualities the greatest men have often many faults and sometimes their faults are a part of their greatness but such men are not of course to be looked upon by the student with absolute implicitness of faith  267 including under this term john lewis and william hunt of the old watercolour who take him all in all is the best painter of still life i believe that ever existed  268 this is especially the case in the st cecily rossettis first illustration to the palace of art which would have been the best in the book had it been well engraved the whole work should be taken up again and done by line engraving perfectly and wholly from preraphaelite designs with which no other modern work can bear the least comparison  269 the praise i have given incidentally to flaxmans sculpture in the seven lamps and elsewhere refers wholly to his studies from nature and simple groups in marble which were always good and interesting still i have overrated him even in this respect and it is generally to be remembered that in speaking of artists whose works i cannot be supposed to have specially studied the errors i fall into will always be on the side of praise for of course praise is most likely to be given when the thing praised is above ones knowledge and therefore as our knowledge increases such things may be found less praiseworthy than we thought but blame can only be justly given when the thing blamed is below ones level of sight and practically i never do blame anything until i have got well past it and am certain that there is demonstrable falsehood in it i believe therefore all my blame to be wholly trustworthy having never yet had occasion to repent of one depreciatory word that i have ever written while i have often found that with respect to things i had not time to study closely i was led too far by sudden admiration helped perhaps by peculiar associations or other deceptive accidents and this the more because i never care to check an expression of delight thinking the chances are that even if mistaken it will do more good than harm but i weigh every word of blame with scrupulous caution i have sometimes erased a strong passage of blame from second editions of my books but this was only when i found it offended the reader without convincing him never because i repented of it myself  270 chapmans if not the original  271 careys or cayleys if not the original i do not know which are the best translations of plato herodotus and √Üschylus can only be read in the original it may seem strange that i name books like these for beginners but all the greatest books contain food for all ages and an intelligent and rightly bred youth or girl ought to enjoy much even in plato by the time they are fifteen or sixteen
