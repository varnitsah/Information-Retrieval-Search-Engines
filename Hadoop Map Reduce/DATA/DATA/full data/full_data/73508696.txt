73508696	my discovery of england  1922  by leacock stephen     introduction of mr stephen leacock given by sir owen seaman on the occasion of his first lecture in london   ladies and gentlemen it is usual on these occasions for the chairman to begin something like this the lecturer i am sure needs no introduction from me and indeed when i have been the lecturer and somebody else has been the chairman i have more than once suspected myself of being the better man of the two of course i hope i should always have the good mannersi am sure mr leacock hasto disguise that suspicion however one has to go through these formalities and i will therefore introduce the lecturer to you  ladies and gentlemen this is mr stephen leacock mr leacock this is the flower of london intelligenceor perhaps i should say one of the flowers the rest are coming to your other lectures  in ordinary social life one stops at an introduction and does not proceed to personal details but behaviour on the platform as on the stage is seldom ordinary i will therefore tell you a thing or two about mr leacock in the first place by vocation he is a professor of political economy and he practises humourfrenzied fiction instead of frenzied financeby way of recreation there he differs a good deal from me who have to study the products of humour for my living and by way of recreation read mr leacock on political economy  further mr leacock is allbritish being english by birth and canadian by residence i mention this for two reasons firstly because england and the empire are very proud to claim him for their own and secondly because i do not wish his nationality to be confused with that of his neighbours on the other side for english and american humourists have not always seen eye to eye when we fail to appreciate their humour they say we are too dull and effete to understand it and when they do not appreciate ours they say we havent got any  now mr leacocks humour is british by heredity but he has caught something of the spirit of american humour by force of association this puts him in a similar position to that in which i found myself once when i took the liberty of swimming across a rather large loch in scotland after climbing into the boat i was in the act of drying myself when i was accosted by the proprietor of the hotel adjacent to the shore you have no business to be bathing here he shouted im not i said im bathing on the other side in the same way if anyone on either side of the water is unintelligent enough to criticise mr leacocks humour he can always say it comes from the other side but the truth is that his humour contains all that is best in the humour of both hemispheres  having fulfilled my duty as chairman in that i have told you nothing that you did not know beforeexcept perhaps my swimming feat which never got into the press because i have a very bad publicity agenti will not detain you longer from what you are really wanting to get at but ask mr leacock to proceed at once with his lecture on frenzied fiction    contents       i      the balance of trade in impressions      ii     i am interviewed by the press      iii    impressions of london      iv     a clear view of the government and politics of england      v      oxford as i see it      vi     the british and the american press      vii    business in england      viii   is prohibition coming to england      ix     we have with us tonight      x      have the english any sense of humour      my discovery of england     i the balance of trade in impressions  for some years past a rising tide of lecturers and literary men from england has washed upon the shores of our north american continent the purpose of each one of them is to make a new discovery of america they come over to us travelling in great simplicity and they return in the ducal suite of the aquitania they carry away with them their impressions of america and when they reach england they sell them this export of impressions has now been going on so long that the balance of trade in impressions is all disturbed there is no doubt that the americans and canadians have been too generous in this matter of giving away impressions we emit them with the careless ease of a glow worm and like the glowworm ask for nothing in return  but this irregular and onesided traffic has now assumed such great proportions that we are compelled to ask whether it is right to allow these people to carry away from us impressions of the very highest commercial value without giving us any pecuniary compensation whatever british lecturers have been known to land in new york pass the customs drive uptown in a closed taxi and then forward to england from the closed taxi itself ten dollars worth of impressions of american national character i have myself seen an english literary manthe biggest i believe he had at least the appearance of it sit in the corridor of a fashionable new york hotel and look gloomily into his hat and then from his very hat produce an estimate of the genius of amer ica at twenty cents a word the nice question as to whose twenty cents that was never seems to have occurred to him  i am not writing in the faintest spirit of jealousy i quite admit the extraordinary ability that is involved in this peculiar susceptibility to impressions i have estimated that some of these english visitors have been able to receive impressions at the rate of four to the second in fact they seem to get them every time they see twenty cents but without jealousy or complaint i do feel that somehow these impressions are inadequate and fail to depict us as we really are  let me illustrate what i mean here are some of the impressions of new york gathered from visitors discoveries of america and reproduced not perhaps word for word but as closely as i can remember them new york writes one nestling at the foot of the hudson gave me an impression of cosiness of tiny graciousness in short of weeness but compare thisnew york according to another discoverer of america gave me an impression of size of vastness there seemed to be a big ness about it not found in smaller places a third visitor writes new york struck me as hard cruel almost inhuman this i think was because his taxi driver had charged him three dollars the first thing that struck me in new york writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him  nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent  i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly definean atmosphere rather than an idea  all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity  new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it  chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance  or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and againat cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air  this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at torontoin short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus  i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word  nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they dont care how he came to write it hes written it and thats enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished authors book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they dont know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely readin america  in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense  it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in  i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool during the last fifty years so many travellers have made the voyage across the atlantic that it is now impossible to obtain any impressions from the ocean of the slightest commercial value my readers will recall the fact that washington irving as far back as a century ago chronicled the pleasure that one felt during an atlantic voyage in idle day dreams while lying prone upon the bowsprit and watching the dolphins leaping in the crystalline foam since his time so many gifted writers have attempted to do the same thing that on the large atlantic liners the bowsprit has been removed or at any rate a notice put up authors are requested not to lie prostrate on the bowsprit but even without this advantage three or four generations of writers have chronicled with great minuteness their sensations during the transit i need only say that my sensations were just as good as theirs i will content myself with chronicling the fact that during the voyage we passed two dolphins one whale and one iceberg none of them moving very fast at the time and that on the fourth day out the sea was so rough that the captain said that in forty years he had never seen such weather one of the steerage passengers we were told was actually washed overboard i think it was over board that he was washed but it may have been on board the ship itself  i pass over also the incidents of my landing in liverpool except perhaps to comment upon the extraordinary behaviour of the english customs officials without wishing in any way to disturb international relations one cannot help noticing the rough and inquisitorial methods of the english customs men as compared with the gentle and affectionate ways of the american officials at new york the two trunks that i brought with me were dragged brutally into an open shed the strap of one of them was rudely unbuckled while the lid of the other was actually lifted at least four inches the trunks were then roughly scrawled with chalk the lids slammed to and that was all not one of the officials seemed to care to look at my things or to have the politeness to pretend to want to i had arranged my dress suit and my pyjamas so as to make as effective a display as possible a new york customs officer would have been delighted with it here they simply passed it over do open this trunk i asked one of the officials and see my pyjamas i dont think it is necessary sir the man answered there was a coldness about it that cut me to the quick  but bad as is the conduct of the english customs men the immigration officials are even worse i could not help being struck by the dreadful carelessness with which people are admitted into england there are it is true a group of officials said to be in charge of immigration but they know nothing of the discriminating care exercised on the other side of the atlantic  do you want to know i asked one of them whether i am a polygamist  no sir he said very quietly  would you like me to tell you whether i am fundamentally opposed to any and every system of government  the man seemed mystified no sir he said i dont know that i would  dont you care i asked  well not particularly sir he answered  i was determined to arouse him from his lethargy  let me tell you then i said that i am an anarchistic polygamist that i am opposed to all forms of government that i object to any kind of revealed religion that i regard the state and property and marriage as the mere tyranny of the bourgeoisie and that i want to see class hatred carried to the point where it forces every one into brotherly love now do i get in  the official looked puzzled for a minute you are not irish are you sir he said  no  then i think you can come in all right he answered  the journey from liverpool to london like all other english journeys is short this is due to the fact that england is a small country it contains only 50000 square miles whereas the united states as every one knows contains three and a half billion i mentioned this fact to an english fellow passenger on the train together with a provisional estimate of the american corn crop for 1922 but he only drew his rug about his knees took a sip of brandy from his travelling flask and sank into a state resembling death i contented myself with jotting down an impression of incivility and paid no further attention to my fellow traveller other than to read the labels on his lug gage and to peruse the headings of his newspaper by peeping over his shoulder  it was my first experience of travelling with a fellow passenger in a compartment of an english train and i admit now that i was as yet ignorant of the proper method of conduct later on i became fully conversant with the rule of travel as understood in england i should have known of course that i must on no account speak to the man but i should have let down the window a little bit in such a way as to make a strong draught on his ear had this failed to break down his reserve i should have placed a heavy valise in the rack over his head so balanced that it might fall on him at any moment failing this again i could have blown rings of smoke at him or stepped on his feet under the pretence of looking out of the window under the english rule as long as he bears this in silence you are not supposed to know him in fact he is not supposed to be there you and he each presume the other to be a mere piece of empty space but let him once be driven to say oh i beg your pardon i wonder if you would mind my closing the window and he is lost after that you are entitled to tell him anything about the corn crop that you care to  but in the present case i knew nothing of this and after three hours of charming silence i found myself in london     ii i am interviewed by the press  immediately upon my arrival in london i was interviewed by the press i was interviewed in all twenty times i am not saying this in any spirit of elation or boastfulness i am simply stating it as a factinterviewed twenty times sixteen times by men and twice by women but as i feel that the results of these interviews were not all that i could have wished i think it well to make some public explanation of what happened  the truth is that we do this thing so differently over in america that i was for the time being completely thrown off my bearings the questions that i had every right to expect after many years of american and canadian interviews failed to appear  i pass over the fact that being interviewed for five hours is a fatiguing process i lay no claim to exemption for that but to that no doubt was due the singular discrepancies as to my physical appearance which i detected in the london papers  the young man who interviewed me immediately after breakfast described me as a brisk energetic man still on the right side of forty with energy in every movement  the lady who wrote me up at 1130 reported that my hair was turning grey and that there was a peculiar languor in my manner  and at the end the boy who took me over at a quarter to two said the old gentleman sank wearily upon a chair in the hotel lounge his hair is almost white  the trouble is that i had not understood that london reporters are supposed to look at a mans personal appearance in america we never bother with that we simply describe him as a dynamo for some reason or other it always pleases everybody to be called a dynamo and the readers at least with us like to read about people who are dynamos and hardly care for anything else  in the case of very old men we sometimes call them battlehorses or extinct volcanoes but beyond these three classes we hardly venture on description so i was misled i had expected that the reporter would say as soon as mr leacock came across the floor we felt we were in the presence of a dynamo or an extinct battlehorse as the case may be otherwise i would have kept up those energetic movements all the morning but they fatigue me and i did not think them necessary but i let that pass  the more serious trouble was the questions put to me by the reporters over in our chief centres of population we use another set altogether i am thinking here especially of the kind of interview that i have given out in youngstown ohio and richmond indiana and peterborough ontario in all these placesfor example in youngstown ohio the reporter asks as his first question what is your impression of youngstown  in london they dont they seem indifferent to the fate of their city perhaps it is only english pride for all i know they may have been burning to know this just as the youngstown ohio people are and were too proud to ask in any case i will insert here the answer i had written out in my pocketbook one copy for each paperthe way we do it in youngstown and which read  london strikes me as emphatically a city with a future standing as she does in the heart of a rich agricultural district with railroad connection in all directions and resting as she must on a bed of coal and oil i prophesy that she will one day be a great city  the advantage of this is that it enables the reporter to get just the right kind of heading prophesies bright future for london had that been used my name would have stood higher there than it does todayunless the london people are very different from the people in youngstown which i doubt as it is they dont know whether their future is bright or is as dark as mud but its not my fault the reporters never asked me  if the first question had been handled properly it would have led up by an easy and pleasant transition to question two which always runs have you seen our factories to which the answer is  i have i was taken out early this morning by a group of your citizens whom i cannot thank enough in a ford car to look at your pail and bucket works at eleventhirty i was taken out by a second group in what was apparently the same car to see your soap works i understand that you are the second nailmaking centre east of the alleghenies and i am amazed and appalled this afternoon i am to be taken out to see your wonderful system of disposing of sewerage a thing which has fascinated me from childhood  now i am not offering any criticism of the london system of interviewing but one sees at once how easy and friendly for all concerned this youngstown method is how much better it works than the london method of asking questions about literature and art and difficult things of that sort i am sure that there must be soap works and perhaps a pail factory somewhere in london but during my entire time of residence there no one ever offered to take me to them as for the sewerageoh well i suppose we are more hospitable in america let it go at that  i had my answer all written and ready saying  i understand that london is the second greatest hopconsuming the fourth hogkilling and the first eggabsorbing centre in the world  but what i deplore still more and i think with reason is the total omission of the familiar interrogation what is your impression of our women  thats where the reporter over on our side hits the nail every time that is the point at which we always nudge him in the ribs and buy him a cigar and at which youth and age join in a sly jest together here again the subheading comes in so nicely thinks youngstown women charming and they are they are everywhere but i hate to think that i had to keep my impression of london women unused in my pocket while a young man asked me whether i thought modern literature owed more to observation and less to inspiration than some other kind of literature  now thats exactly the kind of question the last one that the london reporters seem to harp on they seemed hipped about literature and their questions are too difficult one asked me whether the american drama was structurally inferior to the french i dont call that fair i told him i didnt know that i used to know the answer to it when i was at college but that i had forgotten it and that anyway i am too well off now to need to remember it  that question is only one of a long list that they asked me about art and literature i missed nearly all of them except one as to whether i thought al jolson or frank tinney was the higher artist and even that one was asked by an american who is wasting himself on the london press  i dont want to speak in anger but i say it frankly the atmosphere of these young men is not healthy and i felt that i didnt want to see them any more  had there been a reporter of the kind we have at home in montreal or toledo or springfield illinois i would have welcomed him at my hotel he could have taken me out in a ford car and shown me a factory and told me how many cubic feet of water go down the thames in an hour i should have been glad of his society and he and i would have together made up the kind of copy that people of his class and mine read but i felt that if any young man came along to ask about the structure of the modern drama he had better go on to the british museum  meantime as the reporters entirely failed to elicit the large fund of information which i acquired i reserve my impressions of london for a chapter by themselves     iii impressions of london  before setting down my impressions of the great english metropolis a phrase which i have thought out as a designation for london i think it proper to offer an initial apology i find that i receive impressions with great difficulty and have nothing of that easy facility in picking them up which is shown by british writers on america i remember hugh walpole telling me that he could hardly walk down broadway without getting at least three dollars worth and on fifth avenue five dollars worth and i recollect that st john ervine came up to my house in montreal drank a cup of tea borrowed some tobacco and got away with sixty dollars worth of impressions of canadian life and character  for this kind of thing i have only a despairing admiration i can get an impression if i am given time and can think about it beforehand but it requires thought this fact was all the more distressing to me in as much as one of the leading editors of america had made me a proposal as honourable to him as it was lucrative to me that immediately on my arrival in londonor just before iti should send him a thousand words on the genius of the english and five hundred words on the spirit of london and two hundred words of personal chat with lord northcliffe this contract i was unable to fulfil except the personal chat with lord northcliffe which proved an easy matter as he happened to be away in australia  but i have since pieced together my impressions as conscientiously as i could and i present them here if they seem to be a little bit modelled on british impressions of america i admit at once that the influence is there we writers all act and react on one another and when i see a good thing in another mans book i react on it at once  london the name of which is already known to millions of readers of this book is beautifully situated on the river thames which here sweeps in a wide curve with much the same breadth and majesty as the st jo river at south bend indiana london like south bend itself is a city of clean streets and admirable sidewalks and has an excellent water supply one is at once struck by the number of excellent and wellappointed motor cars that one sees on every hand the neatness of the shops and the cleanliness and cheerfulness of the faces of the people in short as an english visitor said of peterborough ontario there is a distinct note of optimism in the air i forget who it was who said this but at any rate i have been in peterborough myself and i have seen it  contrary to my expectations and contrary to all our transatlantic precedents i was not met at the depot by one of the leading citizens himself a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car he did not tuck a fur rug about my knees present me with a really excellent cigar and proceed to drive me about the town so as to show me the leading points of interest the municipal reservoir the gas works and the municipal abattoir in fact he was not there but i attribute his absence not to any lack of hospitality but merely to a certain reserve in the english character they are as yet unused to the arrival of lecturers when they get to be more accustomed to their coming they will learn to take them straight to the municipal abattoir just as we do  for lack of better guidance therefore i had to form my impressions of london by myself in the mere physical sense there is much to attract the eye the city is able to boast of many handsome public buildings and offices which compare favourably with anything on the other side of the atlantic on the bank of the thames itself rises the power house of the westminster electric supply corporation a handsome modern edifice in the later japanese style close by are the commodious premises of the imperial tobacco company while at no great distance the chelsea gas works add a striking feature of rotundity passing northward one observes westminster bridge notable as a principal station of the underground railway this station and the one next above it the charing cross one are connected by a wide thoroughfare called whitehall one of the best american drug stores is here situated the upper end of whitehall opens into the majestic and spacious trafalgar square here are grouped in imposing proximity the offices of the canadian pacific and other railways the international sleeping car company the montreal star and the anglodutch bank two of the best american barber shops are conveniently grouped near the square while the existence of a tall stone monument in the middle of the square itself enables the american visitor to find them without difficulty passing eastward towards the heart of the city one notes on the left hand the imposing pile of st pauls an enormous church with a round dome on the top suggesting strongly the first church of christ scientist on euclid avenue cleveland  but the english churches not being labelled the visitor is often at a loss to distinguish them  a little further on one finds oneself in the heart of financial london here all the great financial institutions of americathe first national bank of milwaukee the planters national bank of st louis the montana farmers trust co and many othershave either their offices or their agents the bank of englandwhich acts as the london agent of the montana farmers trust companyand the london county bank which represents the peoples deposit co of yonkers ny are said to be in the neighbourhood  this particular part of london is connected with the existence of that strange and mysterious thing called the city i am still unable to decide whether the city is a person or a place or a thing but as a form of being i give it credit for being the most emotional the most volatile the most peculiar creature in the world you read in the morning paper that the city is deeply depressed at noon it is reported that the city is buoyant and by four oclock that the city is wildly excited  i have tried in vain to find the causes of these peculiar changes of feeling the ostensible reasons as given in the newspaper are so trivial as to be hardly worthy of belief for example here is the kind of news that comes out from the city the news that a modus vivendi has been signed between the sultan of kowfat and the shriekulislam has caused a sudden buoyancy in the city steel rails which had been depressed all morning reacted immediately while american mules rose up sharply to par monsieur poincar speaking at bordeaux said that henceforth france must seek to retain by all possible means the pingpong championship of the world values in the city collapsed at once despatches from bombay say that the shah of persia yesterday handed a golden slipper to the grand vizier feebli pasha as a sign that he might go and chase himself the news was at once followed by a drop in oil and a rapid attempt to liquidate everything that is fluid  but these mysteries of the city i do not pretend to explain i have passed through the place dozens of times and never noticed anything particular in the way of depression or buoyancy or falling oil or rising rails but no doubt it is there  a little beyond the city and further down the river the visitor finds this district of london terminating in the gloomy and forbidding tower the principal penitentiary of the city here queen victoria was imprisoned for many years  excellent gasoline can be had at the american garage immediately north of the tower where motor repairs of all kinds are also carried on  these however are but the superficial pictures of london gathered by the eye of the tourist a far deeper meaning is found in the examination of the great historic monuments of the city the principal ones of these are the tower of london just mentioned the british museum and westminster abbey no visitor to london should fail to see these indeed he ought to feel that his visit to england is wasted unless he has seen them i speak strongly on the point because i feel strongly on it to my mind there is something about the grim fascination of the historic tower the cloistered quiet of the museum and the majesty of the ancient abbey which will make it the regret of my life that i didnt see any one of the three i fully meant to but i failed and i can only hope that the circumstances of my failure may be helpful to other visitors  the tower of london i most certainly intended to inspect each day after the fashion of every tourist i wrote for myself a little list of things to do and i always put the tower of london on it no doubt the reader knows the kind of little list that i mean it runs      1 go to bank      2 buy a shirt      3 national picture gallery      4 razor blades      5 tower of london      6 soap  this itinerary i regret to say was never carried out in full i was able at times both to go to the bank and buy a shirt in a single morning at other times i was able to buy razor blades and almost to find the national picture gallery meantime i was urged on all sides by my london acquaintances not to fail to see the tower theres a grim fascination about the place they said you mustnt miss it i am quite certain that in due course of time i should have made my way to the tower but for the fact that i made a fatal discovery i found out that the london people who urged me to go and see the tower had never seen it themselves it appears they never go near it one night at a dinner a man next to me said have you seen the tower you really ought to theres a grim fascination about it i looked him in the face have you seen it yourself i asked oh yes he answered ive seen it when i asked the man hesitated when i was just a boy he said my father took me there how long ago is that i enquired about forty years ago he answered  i always mean to go again but i dont somehow seem to get the time  after this i got to understand that when a londoner says have you seen the tower of london the answer is no and neither have you  take the parallel case of the british museum here is a place that is a veritable treasure house a repository of some of the most priceless historical relics to be found upon the earth it contains for instance the famous papyrus manuscript of thotmes ii of the first egyptian dynastya thing known to scholars all over the world as the oldest extant specimen of what can be called writing indeed one can here see the actual evolution i am quoting from a work of reference or at least from my recollection of it from the ideographic cuneiform to the phonetic syllabic script every time i have read about that manuscript and have happened to be in orillia ontario or schenectady ny or any such place i have felt that i would be willing to take a whole trip to england to have five minutes at the british museum just five to look at that papyrus yet as soon as i got to london this changed the railway stations of london have been so arranged that to get to any train for the north or west the traveller must pass the british museum the first time i went by it in a taxi i felt quite a thrill inside those walls i thought to myself is the manuscript of thotmes ii the next time i actually stopped the taxi is that the british museum i asked the driver i think it is something of the sort sir he said i hesitated drive me i said to where i can buy safety razor blades  after that i was able to drive past the museum with the quiet assurance of a londoner and to take part in dinner table discussions as to whether the british museum or the louvre contains the greater treasures it is quite easy any way all you have to do is to remember that the winged victory of samothrace is in the louvre and the papyrus of thotmes ii or some such document is in the museum  the abbey i admit is indeed majestic i did not intend to miss going into it but i felt as so many tourists have that i wanted to enter it in the proper frame of mind i never got into the frame of mind at least not when near the abbey itself i have been in exactly that frame of mind when on state street chicago or on king street toronto or anywhere three thousand miles away from the abbey but by bad luck i never struck both the frame of mind and the abbey at the same time  but the londoners after all in not seeing their own wonders are only like the rest of the world the people who live in buffalo never go to see niagara falls people in cleveland dont know which is mr rockefellers house and people live and even die in new york without going up to the top of the woolworth building and anyway the past is remote and the present is near i know a cab driver in the city of quebec whose business in life it is to drive people up to see the plains of abraham but unless they bother him to do it he doesnt show them the spot where wolfe fell what he does point out with real zest is the place where the mayor and the city council sat on the wooden platform that they put up for the municipal celebration last summer  no description of london would be complete without a reference however brief to the singular salubrity and charm of the london climate this is seen at its best during the autumn and winter months the climate of london and indeed of england generally is due to the influence of the gulf stream the way it works is thus the gulf stream as it nears the shores of the british isles and feels the propinquity of ireland rises into the air turns into soup and comes down on london at times the soup is thin and is in fact little more than a mist at other times it has the consistency of a thick potage st germain london people are a little sensitive on the point and flatter their atmosphere by calling it a fog but it is not it is soup the notion that no sunlight ever gets through and that in the london winter people never see the sun is of course a ridiculous error circulated no doubt by the jealousy of foreign nations i have myself seen the sun plainly visible in london without the aid of glasses on a november day in broad daylight and again one night about four oclock in the afternoon i saw the sun distinctly appear through the clouds the whole subject of daylight in the london winter is however one which belongs rather to the technique of astronomy than to a book of description in practice daylight is but little used electric lights are burned all the time in all houses buildings railway stations and clubs this practice which is now universally observed is called daylight saving  but the distinction between day and night during the london winter is still quite obvious to any one of an observant mind it is indicated by various signs such as the striking of clocks the tolling of bells the closing of saloons and the raising of taxi rates it is much less easy to distinguish the technical approach of night in the other cities of england that lie outside the confines physical and intellectual of london and live in a continuous gloom in such places as the great manufacturing cities bugginghamundersmoke or gloomsburyonooze night may be said to be perpetual            i had written the whole of the above chapter and looked on it as finished when i realised that i had made a terrible omission i neglected to say anything about the mind of london this is a thing that is always put into any book of discovery and observation and i can only apologise for not having discussed it sooner i am quite familiar with other peoples chapters on the mind of america and the chinese mind and so forth indeed so far as i know it has turned out that almost everybody all over the world has a mind nobody nowadays travels even in central america or thibet without bringing back a chapter on the mind of costa rica or on the psychology of the mongolian even the gentler peoples such as the burmese the siamese the hawaiians and the russians though they have no minds are written up as souls  it is quite obvious then that there is such a thing as the mind of london and it is all the more culpable in me to have neglected it in as much as my editorial friend in new york had expressly mentioned it to me before i sailed what said he leaning far over his desk after his massive fashion and reaching out into the air what is in the minds of these people are they he added half to himself though i heard him are they thinking and if they think what do they think  i did therefore during my stay in london make an accurate study of the things that london seemed to be thinking about as a comparative basis for this study i brought with me a carefully selected list of the things that new york was thinking about at the moment these i selected from the current newspapers in the proportions to the amount of space allotted to each topic and the size of the heading that announced it having thus a working idea of what i may call the mind of new york i was able to collect and set beside it a list of similar topics taken from the london press to represent the mind of london the two placed side by side make an interesting piece of psychological analysis they read as follows      the mind of new york        the mind of london     what is it thinking        what is it thinking      1 do chorus girls make     1 do chorus girls marry        good wives                 well      2 is red hair a sign of    2 what is red hair a        temperament                sign of      3 can a woman be in        3 can a man be in love        love with two men          with two women      4 is fat a sign of genius 4 is genius a sign of fat  looking over these lists i think it is better to present them without comment i feel sure that somewhere or other in them one should detect the heartthrobs the pulsations of two great peoples but i dont get it in fact the two lists look to me terribly like the mind of costa rica  the same editor also advised me to mingle at his expense in the brilliant intellectual life of england there he said is a coterie of men probably the most brilliant group east of the mississippi i think he said the mississippi you will find them he said to me brilliant witty filled with repartee he suggested that i should send him back as far as words could express it some of this brilliance i was very glad to be able to do this although i fear that the results were not at all what he had anticipated still i held conversations with these people and i gave him in all truthfulness the result sir james barrie said this is really very exceptional weather for this time of year cyril maude said and so a martini cocktail is merely gin and vermouth ian hay said youll find the underground ever so handy once you understand it  i have a lot more of these repartees that i could insert here if it was necessary but somehow i feel that it is not     iv a clear view of the government and politics of england  a loyal british subject like myself in dealing with the government of england should necessarily begin with a discussion of the monarchy i have never had the pleasure of meeting the kingexcept once on the gtr platform in orillia ontario when he was the duke of york and i was one of the welcoming delegates of the town council no doubt he would recall it in a minute  but in england the king is surrounded by formality and circumstance on many mornings i waited round the gates of buckingham palace but i found it quite impossible to meet the king in the quiet sociable way in which one met him in orillia the english it seems love to make the kingship a subject of great pomp and official etiquette in canada it is quite different perhaps we understand kings and princes better than the english do at any rate we treat them in a far more human hearttoheart fashion than is the english custom and they respond to it at once i remember when king georgehe was as i say duke of york thencame up to orillia ontario how we all met him in a delegation on the platform bob curranbob was mayor of the town that yearwent up to him and shook hands with him and invited him to come right on up to the orillia house where he had a room reserved for him charlie janes and mel tudhope and the other boys who were on the town council gathered round the royal prince and shook hands and told him that he simply must stay over george rapley the bank manager said that if he wanted a cheque cashed or anything of that sort to come right into the royal bank and he would do it for him the prince had two aidesdecamp with him and a secretary but bob curran said to bring them uptown too and it would be all right we had planned to have an oyster supper for the prince at jim smiths hotel and then take him either to the ymca pool room or else over to the tea social in the basement of the presbyterian church  unluckily the prince couldnt stay it turned out that he had to get right back into his train and go on to peterborough ontario where they were to have a brass band to meet him which naturally he didnt want to miss  but the point is that it was a real welcome and you could see that the prince appreciated it there was a warmth and a meaning to it that the prince understood at once it was a pity that he couldnt have stayed over and had time to see the carriage factory and the new sewerage plant we all told the prince that he must come back and he said that if he could he most certainly would when the princes train pulled out of the station and we all went back uptown together it was before prohibition came to ontario you could feel that the institution of royalty was quite solid in orillia for a generation  but you dont get that sort of thing in england  theres a formality and coldness in all their dealings with royalty that would never go down with us they like to have the king come and open parliament dressed in royal robes and with a clattering troop of soldiers riding in front of him as for taking him over to the ymca to play pin pool they never think of it they have seen so much of the mere outside of his kingship that they dont understand the heart of it as we do in canada  but let us turn to the house of commons for no description of england would be complete without at least some mention of this interesting body indeed for the ordinary visitor to london the greatest interest of all attaches to the spacious and magnificent parliament buildings the house of commons is commodiously situated beside the river thames the principal features of the house are the large lunch room on the western side and the tearoom on the terrace on the eastern a series of smaller luncheon rooms extend apparently all round about the premises while a commodious bar offers a ready access to the members at all hours of the day while any members are in the bar a light is kept burning in the tall clock tower at one corner of the building but when the bar is closed the light is turned off by whichever of the scotch members leaves last there is a handsome legislative chamber attached to the premises from whichso the antiquarians tell usthe house of commons took its name but it is not usual now for the members to sit in the legislative chamber as the legislation is now all done outside either at the home of mr lloyd george or at the national liberal club or at one or other of the newspaper offices the house however is called together at very frequent intervals to give it an opportunity of hearing the latest legislation and allowing the members to indulge in cheers sighs groans votes and other expressions of vitality after having cheered as much as is good for it it goes back again to the lunch rooms and goes on eating till needed again  it is however an entire exaggeration to say that the house of commons no longer has a real share in the government of england this is not so anybody connected with the government values the house of commons in a high degree one of the leading newspaper proprietors of london himself told me that he has always felt that if he had the house of commons on his side he had a very valuable ally many of the labour leaders are inclined to regard the house of commons as of great utility while the leading womens organizations now that women are admitted as members may be said to regard the house as one of themselves  looking around to find just where the natural service of the house of commons comes in i am inclined to think that it must be in the practice of asking questions in the house whenever anything goes wrong a member rises and asks a question he gets up for example with a little paper in his hand and asks the government if ministers are aware that the khedive of egypt was seen yesterday wearing a turkish tarbosh ministers say very humbly that they hadnt known it and a thrill runs through the whole country the members can apparently ask any questions they like in the repeated visits which i made to the gallery of the house of commons i was unable to find any particular sense or meaning in the questions asked though no doubt they had an intimate bearing on english politics not clear to an outsider like myself i heard one member ask the government whether they were aware that herrings were being imported from hamburg to harwich the government said no another member rose and asked the government whether they considered shakespere or moliere the greater dramatic artist the government answered that ministers were taking this under their earnest consideration and that a report would be submitted to parliament another member asked the government if they knew who won the queens plate this season at toronto they didin fact this member got in wrong as this is the very thing that the government do know towards the close of the evening a member rose and asked the government if they knew what time it was the speaker however ruled this question out of order on the ground that it had been answered before  the parliament buildings are so vast that it is not possible to state with certainty what they do or do not contain but it is generally said that somewhere in the building is the house of lords when they meet they are said to come together very quietly shortly before the dinner hour take a glass of dry sherry and a biscuit they are all abstemious men reject whatever bills may be before them at the moment take another dry sherry and then adjourn for two years  the public are no longer allowed unrestricted access to the houses of parliament its approaches are now strictly guarded by policemen in order to obtain admission it is necessary either to a communicate in writing with the speaker of the house enclosing certificates of naturalization and proof of identity or b give the policeman five shillings method b is the one usually adopted on great nights however when the house of commons is sitting and is about to do something important such as ratifying a home rule bill or cheering or welcoming a new lady member it is not possible to enter by merely bribing the policeman with five shillings it takes a pound the english people complain bitterly of the rich americans who have in this way corrupted the london public before they were corrupted they would do anything for sixpence  this peculiar vein of corruption by the americans runs like a thread i may say through all the texture of english life among those who have been principally exposed to it are the servantsespecially butlers and chauffeurs hotel porters bellboys railway porters and guards all taxidrivers pewopeners curates bishops and a large part of the peerage  the terrible ravages that have been made by the americans on english morality are witnessed on every hand whole classes of society are hopelessly damaged i have it in the evidence of the english themselves and there seems to be no doubt of the fact till the americans came to england the people were an honest lawabiding race respecting their superiors and despising those below them they had never been corrupted by money and their employers extended to them in this regard their tenderest solicitude then the americans came servants ceased to be what they were butlers were hopelessly damaged hotel porters became a wreck taxidrivers turned out thieves curates could no longer be trusted to handle money peers sold their daughters at a million dollars a piece or three for two in fact the whole kingdom began to deteriorate till it got where it is now at present after a rich american has stayed in any english country house its owners find that they can do nothing with the butler a wildness has come over the man there is a restlessness in his demeanour and a strange wistful look in his eye as if seeking for something in many cases so i understand after an american has stayed in a country house the butler goes insane he is found in his pantry counting over the sixpence given to him by a duke and laughing to himself he has to be taken in charge by the police with him generally go the chauffeur whose mind has broken down from driving a rich american twenty miles and the gardener who is found tearing up raspberry bushes by the roots to see if there is any money under them and the local curate whose brain has collapsed or expanded i forget which when a rich american gave him fifty dollars for his soup kitchen  there are it is true a few classes that have escaped this contagion shepherds living in the hills drovers sailors fishermen and such like i remember the first time i went into the english countryside being struck with the clean honest look in the peoples faces i realised exactly where they got it they had never seen any americans i remember speaking to an aged peasant down in somerset have you ever seen any americans nah he said uz eeard a mowt o em zir but uz zeen nowt o em it was clear that the noble fellow was quite undamaged by american contact  now the odd thing about this corruption is that exactly the same idea is held on the other side of the water it is a known fact that if a young english lord comes to an american town he puts it to the bad in one week socially the whole place goes to pieces girls whose parents are in the hardware business and who used to call their father pop begin to talk of precedence and whether a duchess dowager goes in to dinner ahead of or behind a countess scavenger after the young lord has attended two dances and one teasocial in the methodist church sunday school building adults 25 cents children 10 centsall welcome there is nothing for the young men of the town to do except to drive him out or go further west  one can hardly wonder then that this general corruption has extended even to the policemen who guard the houses of parliament on the other hand this vein of corruption has not extended to english politics unlike ours english politicsone hears it on every handare pure ours unfortunately are known to be not so the difference seems to be that our politicians will do anything for money and the english politicians wont they just take the money and wont do a thing for it  somehow there always seems to be a peculiar interest about english political questions that we dont find elsewhere at home in canada our politics turn on such things as how much money the canadian national railways lose as compared with how much they could lose if they really tried on whether the grain growers of manitoba should be allowed to import ploughs without paying a duty or to pay a duty without importing the ploughs our members at ottawa discuss such things as highway subsidies dry farming the bank act and the tariff on hardware these things leave me absolutely cold to be quite candid there is something terribly plebeian about them in short our politics are what we call in french peuple  but when one turns to england what a striking difference the english with the whole huge british empire to fish in and the european system to draw upon can always dig up some kind of political topic of discussion that has a real charm about it one month you find english politics turning on the oasis of merv and the next on the hinterland of albania or a member rises in the commons with a little bit of paper in his hand and desires to ask the foreign secretary if he is aware that the ahkoond of swat is dead the foreign secretary states that the government have no information other than that the ahkoond was dead a month ago there is a distinct sensation in the house at the realisation that the ahkoond has been dead a month without the house having known that he was alive the sensation is conveyed to the press and the afternoon papers appear with large headings the ahkoond of swat is dead the public who have never heard of the ahkoond bare their heads in a moment in a pause to pray for the ahkoonds soul then the cables take up the refrain and word is flashed all over the world the ahkoond of swat is dead  there was a canadian journalist and poet once who was so impressed with the news that the ahkoond was dead so bowed down with regret that he had never known the ahkoond while alive that he forthwith wrote a poem in memory of the ahkoond of swat i have always thought that the reason of the wide admiration that lannigans verses received was not merely because of the brilliant wit that is in them but because in a wider sense they typify so beautifully the scope of english politics the death of the ahkoond of swat and whether great britain should support as his successor mustalpha el djin or kamu flajthere is something worth talking of over an afternoon tea table but suppose that the whole of the manitoba grain growers were to die what could one say about it theyd be dead thats all  so it is that people all over the world turn to english politics with interest what more delightful than to open an atlas find out where the new kingdom of hejaz is and then violently support the british claim to a protectorate over it over in america we dont understand this sort of thing there is naturally little chance to do so and we dont know how to use it when it comes i remember that when a chance did come in connection with the great venezuela dispute over the ownership of the jungles and mudflats of british guiana the american papers at once inserted headings where is the essiquibo river that spoiled the whole thing if you admit that you dont know where a place is then the bottom is knocked out of all discussion but if you pretend that you do then you are all right mr lloyd george is said to have caused great amusement at the versailles conference by admitting that he hadnt known where teschen was so at least it was reported in the papers and for all i know it might even have been true but the fun that he raised was not really half what could have been raised i have it on good authority that two of the american delegates hadnt known where austria proper was and thought that unredeemed italy was on the east side of new york while the chinese delegate thought that the cameroons were part of scotland but it is these little geographic niceties that lend a charm to european politics that ours lack forever  i dont mean to say the english politics always turn on romantic places or on small questions they dont they often include questions of the largest order but when the english introduce a really large question as the basis of their politics they like to select one that is insoluble this guarantees that it will last take for example the rights of the crown as against the people that lasted for one hundred yearsall the seventeenth century in oklahoma or in alberta they would have called a convention on the question settled it in two weeks and spoiled it for further use in the same way the protestant reformation was used for a hundred years and the reform bill for a generation  at the present time the genius of the english for politics has selected as their insoluble political question the topic of the german indemnity the essence of the problem as i understand it may be stated as follows  it was definitely settled by the conference at versailles that germany is to pay the allies 3912486782421 marks i think that is the correct figure though of course i am speaking only from memory at any rate the correct figure is within a hundred billion marks of the above  the sum to be paid was not reached without a great deal of discussion monsieur briand the french minister is reported to have thrown out the figure 4281390687471 but mr lloyd george would not pick it up nor do i blame him unless he had a basket to pick it up with  lloyd georges point of view was that the germans could very properly pay a limited amount such as 3912486782421 marks but it was not feasible to put on them a burden of 4281390687471 marks  by the way if any one at this point doubts the accuracy of the figures just given all he has to do is to take the amount of the indemnity as stated in gold marks and then multiply it by the present value of the mark and he will find to his chagrin that the figures are correct if he is still not satisfied i refer him to a book of logarithms if he is not satisfied with that i refer him to any work on conic sections and if not convinced even then i refer him so far that he will never come back  the indemnity being thus fixed the next question is as to the method of collecting it in the first place there is no intention of allowing the germans to pay in actual cash if they do this they will merely inflate the english beyond what is bearable england has been inflated now for eight years and has had enough of it  in the second place it is understood that it will not do to allow the germans to offer 4218 390687471 marks worth of coal it is more than the country needs  what is more if the english want coal they propose to buy it in an ordinary decent way from a christian coaldealer in their own country they do not purpose to ruin their own coal industry for the sake of building up the prosperity of the german nation  what i say of coal is applied with equal force to any offers of food grain oil petroleum gas or any other natural product payment in any of these will be sternly refused even now it is all the british farmers can do to live and for some it is more many of them are having to sell off their motors and pianos and to send their sons to college to work at the same time the german producer by depressing the mark further and further is able to work fourteen hours a day this argument may not be quite correct but i take it as i find it in the london press whether i state it correctly or not it is quite plain that the problem is insoluble that is all that is needed in first class politics  a really good question like the german reparation question will go on for a century undoubtedly in the year 2000 ad a british chancellor of the exchequer will still be explaining that the government is fully resolved that germany shall pay to the last farthing cheers but that ministers have no intention of allowing the german payment to take a form that will undermine british industry wild applause that the german indemnity shall be so paid that without weakening the power of the germans to buy from us it shall increase our power of selling to them  such questions last forever  on the other hand sometimes by sheer carelessness a question gets settled and passes out of politics this so we are given to understand has happened to the irish question it is settled a group of irish delegates and british ministers got together round a table and settled it the settlement has since been celebrated at a demonstration of brotherhood by the irish americans of new york with only six casualties henceforth the irish question passes into history there may be some odd fighting along the ulster border or a little civil war with perhaps a little revolution every now and then but as a question the thing is finished  i must say that i for one am very sorry to think that the irish question is gone we shall miss it greatly debating societies which have flourished on it ever since 1886 will be wrecked for want of it dinner parties will now lose half the sparkle of their conversation it will be no longer possible to make use of such good old remarks as after all the irish are a gifted people or you must remember that fifty per cent of the great english generals were irish  the settlement turned out to be a very simple affair ireland was merely given dominion status what that is no one knows but it means that the irish have now got it and that they sink from the high place that they had in the white light of publicity to the level of the canadians or the new zealanders  whether it is quite a proper thing to settle trouble by conferring dominion status on it is open to question it is a practice that is bound to spread it is rumoured that it is now contemplated to confer dominion status upon the borough of poplar and on the cambridge undergraduates it is even understood that at the recent disarmament conference england offered to confer dominion status on the united states president harding would assuredly have accepted it at once but for the protest of mr briand who claimed that any such offer must be accompanied by a permission to increase the french firebrigade by fifty per cent  it is lamentable too that at the very same moment when the irish question was extinguished the naval question which had lasted for nearly fifty years was absolutely obliterated by disarmament henceforth the alarm of invasion is a thing of the past and the navy practically needless beyond keeping a fleet in the north sea and one on the mediterranean and maintaining a patrol all round the rim of the pacific ocean britain will cease to be a naval power a mere annual expenditure of fifty million pounds sterling will suffice for such thin pretence of naval preparedness as a disarmed nation will have to maintain  this thing too came as a surprise or at least a surprise to the general public who are unaware of the workings of diplomacy those who know about such things were fully aware of what would happen if a whole lot of british sailors and diplomatists and journalists were exposed to the hospitalities of washington the british and americans are both alike you cant drive them or lead them or coerce them but if you give them a cigar theyll do anything the inner history of the conference is only just beginning to be known but it is whispered that immediately on his arrival mr balfour was given a cigar by president harding mr balfour at once offered to scrap five ships and invited the entire american cabinet into the british embassy where sir a geddes was rash enough to offer them champagne  the american delegates immediately offered to scrap ten ships mr balfour who simply cannot be outdone in international courtesy saw the ten and raised it to twenty president harding saw the twenty raised it to thirty and sent out for more poker chips  at the close of the play lord beatty who is urbanity itself offered to scrap portsmouth dockyard and asked if anybody present would like canada president harding replied with his customary tact that if england wanted the philippines he would think it what he would term a residuum of normalcy to give them away there is no telling what might have happened had not mr briand interposed to say that any transfer of the philippines must be regarded as a signal for a twenty per cent increase in the boy scouts of france as a tactful conclusion to the matter president harding raised mr balfour to the peerage  as things are disarmament coming along with the irish settlement leaves english politics in a bad way the general outlook is too peaceful altogether one looks round almost in vain for any of those strained relations which used to be the very basis of english foreign policy in only one direction do i see light for english politics and that is over towards czechoslovakia it appears that czechoslovakia owes the british exchequer fifty million sterling i cannot quote the exact figure but it is either fifty million or fifty billion in either case czechoslovakia is unable to pay the announcement has just been made by m sgitzch the new treasurer that the country is bankrupt or at least that he sees his way to make it so in a week  it has been at once reported in city circles that there are strained relations between great britain and czechoslovakia now what i advise is that if the relations are strained keep them so england has lost nearly all the strained relations she ever had let her cherish the few that she still has i know that there are other opinions the suggestion has been at once made for a round table conference at which the whole thing can be freely discussed without formal protocols and something like a gentlemans agreement reached i say dont do it england is being ruined by these round table conferences they are sitting round in cairo and calcutta and capetown filling all the best hotels and eating out the substance of the taxpayer  i am told that lloyd george has offered to go to czechoslovakia he should be stopped it is said that professor keynes has proved that the best way to deal with the debt of czechoslovakia is to send them whatever cash we have left thereby turning the exchange upside down on them and forcing them to buy all their christmas presents in manchester  it is wiser not to do anything of the sort england should send them a good oldfashioned ultimatum mobilise all the naval officers at the embankment hotels raise the income tax another sixpence and defy them  if that were done it might prove a successful first step in bringing english politics back to the high plane of conversational interest from which they are threatening to fall     v oxford as i see it  my private station being that of a university professor i was naturally deeply interested in the system of education in england i was therefore led to make a special visit to oxford and to submit the place to a searching scrutiny arriving one afternoon at four oclock i stayed at the mitre hotel and did not leave until eleven oclock next morning the whole of this time except for one hour spent in addressing the undergraduates was devoted to a close and eager study of the great university when i add to this that i had already visited oxford in 1907 and spent a sunday at all souls with colonel l s amery it will be seen at once that my views on oxford are based upon observations extending over fourteen years  at any rate i can at least claim that my acquaintance with the british university is just as good a basis for reflection and judgment as that of the numerous english critics who come to our side of the water i have known a famous english author to arrive at harvard university in the morning have lunch with president lowell and then write a whole chapter on the excellence of higher education in america i have known another one come to harvard have lunch with president lowell and do an entire book on the decline of serious study in america or take the case of my own university i remember mr rudyard kipling coming to mcgill and saying in his address to the undergraduates at 230 pm you have here a great institution but how could he have gathered this information as far as i know he spent the entire morning with sir andrew macphail in his house beside the campus smoking cigarettes when i add that he distinctly refused to visit the palaeontologic museum that he saw nothing of our new hydraulic apparatus or of our classes in domestic science his judgment that we had here a great institution seems a little bit superficial i can only put beside it to redeem it in some measure the hasty and illformed judgment expressed by lord milner mcgill is a noble university and the rash and indiscreet expression of the prince of wales when we gave him an lld degree mcgill has a glorious future  to my mind these unthinking judgments about our great college do harm and i determined therefore that anything that i said about oxford should be the result of the actual observation and real study based upon a bona fide residence in the mitre hotel  on the strength of this basis of experience i am prepared to make the following positive and emphatic statements oxford is a noble university it has a great past it is at present the greatest university in the world and it is quite possible that it has a great future oxford trains scholars of the real type better than any other place in the world its methods are antiquated it despises science its lectures are rotten it has professors who never teach and students who never learn it has no order no arrangement no system its curriculum is unintelligible it has no president it has no state legislature to tell it how to teach and yetit gets there whether we like it or not oxford gives something to its students a life and a mode of thought which in america as yet we can emulate but not equal  if anybody doubts this let him go and take a room at the mitre hotel ten and six for a wainscotted bedroom period of charles i and study the place for himself  these singular results achieved at oxford are all the more surprising when one considers the distressing conditions under which the students work the lack of an adequate building fund compels them to go on working in the same old buildings which they have had for centuries the buildings at brasenose college have not been renewed since the year 1525 in new college and magdalen the students are still housed in the old buildings erected in the sixteenth century at christ church i was shown a kitchen which had been built at the expense of cardinal wolsey in 1527 incredible though it may seem they have no other place to cook in than this and are compelled to use it today on the day when i saw this kitchen four cooks were busy roasting an ox whole for the students lunch this at least is what i presumed they were doing from the size of the fireplace used but it may not have been an ox perhaps it was a cow on a huge table twelve feet by six and made of slabs of wood five inches thick two other cooks were rolling out a game pie i estimated it as measuring three feet across in this rude way unchanged since the time of henry viii the unhappy oxford students are fed i could not help contrasting it with the cosy little boarding houses on cottage grove avenue where i used to eat when i was a student at chicago or the charming little basement diningrooms of the students boarding houses in toronto but then of course henry viii never lived in toronto  the same lack of a buildingfund necessitates the oxford students living in the identical old boarding houses they had in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries technically they are called quadrangles closes and rooms but i am so broken in to the usage of my student days that i cant help calling them boarding houses in many of these the old stairway has been worn down by the feet of ten generations of students the windows have little latticed panes there are old names carved here and there upon the stone and a thick growth of ivy covers the walls the boarding house at st johns college dates from 1509 the one at christ church from the same period a few hundred thousand pounds would suffice to replace these old buildings with neat steel and brick structures like the normal school at schenectady ny or the peel street high school at montreal but nothing is done a movement was indeed attempted last autumn towards removing the ivy from the walls but the result was unsatisfactory and they are putting it back any one could have told them beforehand that the mere removal of the ivy would not brighten oxford up unless at the same time one cleared the stones of the old inscriptions put in steel fireescapes and in fact brought the boarding houses up to date  but henry viii being dead nothing was done yet in spite of its dilapidated buildings and its lack of fireescapes ventilation sanitation and uptodate kitchen facilities i persist in my assertion that i believe that oxford in its way is the greatest university in the world i am aware that this is an extreme statement and needs explanation oxford is much smaller in numbers for example than the state university of minnesota and is much poorer it has or had till yesterday fewer students than the university of toronto to mention oxford beside the 26000 students of columbia university sounds ridiculous in point of money the 39000000 dollar endowment of the university of chicago and the 35000000 one of columbia and the 43000000 of harvard seem to leave oxford nowhere yet the peculiar thing is that it is not nowhere by some queer process of its own it seems to get there every time it was therefore of the very greatest interest to me as a profound scholar to try to investigate just how this peculiar excellence of oxford arises  it can hardly be due to anything in the curriculum or programme of studies indeed to any one accustomed to the best models of a university curriculum as it flourishes in the united states and canada the programme of studies is frankly quite laughable there is less applied science in the place than would be found with us in a theological college hardly a single professor at oxford would recognise a dynamo if he met it in broad daylight the oxford student learns nothing of chemistry physics heat plumbing electric wiring gasfitting or the use of a blowtorch any american college student can run a motor car take a gasoline engine to pieces fix a washer on a kitchen tap mend a broken electric bell and give an expert opinion on what has gone wrong with the furnace it is these things indeed which stamp him as a college man and occasion a very pardonable pride in the minds of his parents  but in all these things the oxford student is the merest amateur  this is bad enough but after all one might say this is only the mechanical side of education true but one searches in vain in the oxford curriculum for any adequate recognition of the higher and more cultured studies strange though it seems to us on this side of the atlantic there are no courses at oxford in housekeeping or in salesmanship or in advertising or on comparative religion or on the influence of the press there are no lectures whatever on human behaviour on altruism on egotism or on the play of wild animals apparently the oxford student does not learn these things this cuts him off from a great deal of the larger culture of our side of the atlantic what are you studying this year i once asked a fourth year student at one of our great colleges i am electing salesmanship and religion he answered here was a young man whose training was destined inevitably to turn him into a moral business man either that or nothing at oxford salesmanship is not taught and religion takes the feeble form of the new testament the more one looks at these things the more amazing it becomes that oxford can produce any results at all  the effect of the comparison is heightened by the peculiar position occupied at oxford by the professors lectures in the colleges of canada and the united states the lectures are supposed to be a really necessary and useful part of the students training again and again i have heard the graduates of my own college assert that they had got as much or nearly as much out of the lectures at college as out of athletics or the greek letter society or the banjo and mandolin club in short with us the lectures form a real part of the college life at oxford it is not so the lectures i understand are given and may even be taken but they are quite worthless and are not supposed to have anything much to do with the development of the students mind the lectures here said a canadian student to me are punk i appealed to another student to know if this was so i dont know whether id call them exactly punk he answered but theyre certainly rotten other judgments were that the lectures were of no importance that nobody took them that they dont matter that you can take them if you like that they do you no harm  it appears further that the professors themselves are not keen on their lectures if the lectures are called for they give them if not the professors feelings are not hurt he merely waits and rests his brain until in some later year the students call for his lectures there are men at oxford who have rested their brains this way for over thirty years the accumulated brain power thus dammed up is said to be colossal  i understand that the key to this mystery is found in the operations of the person called the tutor it is from him or rather with him that the students learn all that they know one and all are agreed on that yet it is a little odd to know just how he does it we go over to his rooms said one student and he just lights a pipe and talks to us we sit round with him said another and he simply smokes and goes over our exercises with us from this and other evidence i gather that what an oxford tutor does is to get a little group of students together and smoke at them men who have been systematically smoked at for four years turn into ripe scholars if anybody doubts this let him go to oxford and he can see the thing actually in operation a wellsmoked man speaks and writes english with a grace that can be acquired in no other way  in what was said above i seem to have been directing criticism against the oxford professors as such but i have no intention of doing so for the oxford professor and his whole manner of being i have nothing but a profound respect there is indeed the greatest difference between the modern uptodate american idea of a professor and the english type but even with us in older days in the bygone time when such people as henry wadsworth longfellow were professors one found the english idea a professor was supposed to be a venerable kind of person with snowwhite whiskers reaching to his stomach he was expected to moon around the campus oblivious of the world around him if you nodded to him he failed to see you of money he knew nothing of business far less he was as his trustees were proud to say of him a child  on the other hand he contained within him a reservoir of learning of such depth as to be practically bottomless none of this learning was supposed to be of any material or commercial benefit to anybody its use was in saving the soul and enlarging the mind  at the head of such a group of professors was one whose beard was even whiter and longer whose absence of mind was even still greater and whose knowledge of money business and practical affairs was below zero him they made the president  all this is changed in america a university professor is now a busy hustling person approximating as closely to a business man as he can do it it is on the business man that he models himself he has a little place that he calls his office with a typewriter machine and a stenographer here he sits and dictates letters beginning after the best business models in re yours of the eighth ult would say etc etc he writes these letters to students to his fellow professors to the president indeed to any people who will let him write to them the number of letters that he writes each month is duly counted and set to his credit if he writes enough he will get a reputation as an executive and big things may happen to him he may even be asked to step out of the college and take a post as an executive in a soap company or an advertising firm the man in short is a hustler an advertiser whose highest aim is to be a livewire if he is not he will presently be dismissed or to use the business term be let go by a board of trustees who are themselves hustlers and livewires as to the professors soul he no longer needs to think of it as it has been handed over along with all the others to a board of censors  the american professor deals with his students according to his lights it is his business to chase them along over a prescribed ground at a prescribed pace like a flock of sheep they all go humping together over the hurdles with the professor chasing them with a set of tests and recitations marks and attendances the whole apparatus obviously copied from the timeclock of the business mans factory this process is what is called showing results the pace set is necessarily that of the slowest and thus results in what i have heard mr edward beatty describe as the convoy system of education  in my own opinion reached after fiftytwo years of profound reflection this system contains in itself the seeds of destruction it puts a premium on dulness and a penalty on genius it circumscribes that latitude of mind which is the real spirit of learning if we persist in it we shall presently find that true learning will fly away from our universities and will take rest wherever some individual and enquiring mind can mark out its path for itself  now the principal reason why i am led to admire oxford is that the place is little touched as yet by the measuring of results and by this passion for visible and provable efficiency the whole system at oxford is such as to put a premium on genius and to let mediocrity and dulness go their way on the dull student oxford after a proper lapse of time confers a degree which means nothing more than that he lived and breathed at oxford and kept out of jail this for many students is as much as society can expect but for the gifted students oxford offers great opportunities there is no question of his hanging back till the last sheep has jumped over the fence he need wait for no one he may move forward as fast as he likes following the bent of his genius if he has in him any ability beyond that of the common herd his tutor interested in his studies will smoke at him until he kindles him into a flame for the tutors soul is not harassed by herding dull students with dismissal hanging by a thread over his head in the class room the american professor has no time to be interested in a clever student he has time to be interested in his deportment his letterwriting his executive work and his organising ability and his hope of promotion to a soap factory but with that his mind is exhausted the student of genius merely means to him a student who gives no trouble who passes all his tests and is present at all his recitations such a student also if he can be trained to be a hustler and an advertiser will undoubtedly make good but beyond that the professor does not think of him the everlasting principle of equality has inserted itself in a place where it has no right to be and where inequality is the breath of life  american or canadian college trustees would be horrified at the notion of professors who apparently do no work give few or no lectures and draw their pay merely for existing yet these are really the only kind of professors worth havingi mean men who can be trusted with a vague general mission in life with a salary guaranteed at least till their death and a sphere of duties entrusted solely to their own consciences and the promptings of their own desires such men are rare but a single one of them when found is worth ten executives and a dozen organisers  the excellence of oxford then as i see it lies in the peculiar vagueness of the organisation of its work it starts from the assumption that the professor is a really learned man whose sole interest lies in his own sphere and that a student or at least the only student with whom the university cares to reckon seriously is a young man who desires to know this is an ancient mediaeval attitude long since buried in more uptodate places under successive strata of compulsory education state teaching the democratisation of knowledge and the substitution of the shadow for the substance and the casket for the gem no doubt in newer places the thing has got to be so higher education in america flourishes chiefly as a qualification for entrance into a moneymaking profession and not as a thing in itself but in oxford one can still see the surviving outline of a nobler type of structure and a higher inspiration  i do not mean to say however that my judgment of oxford is one undiluted stream of praise in one respect at least i think that oxford has fallen away from the high ideals of the middle ages i refer to the fact that it admits women students to its studies in the middle ages women were regarded with a peculiar chivalry long since lost it was taken for granted that their brains were too delicately poised to allow them to learn anything it was presumed that their minds were so exquisitely hung that intellectual effort might disturb them the present age has gone to the other extreme and this is seen nowhere more than in the crowding of women into colleges originally designed for men oxford i regret to find has not stood out against this change  to a profound scholar like myself the presence of these young women many of them most attractive flittering up and down the streets of oxford in their caps and gowns is very distressing  who is to blame for this and how they first got in i do not know but i understand that they first of all built a private college of their own close to oxford and then edged themselves in foot by foot if this is so they only followed up the precedent of the recognised method in use in america when an american college is established the women go and build a college of their own overlooking the grounds then they put on becoming caps and gowns and stand and look over the fence at the college athletics the male undergraduates who were originally and by nature a hardy lot were not easily disturbed but inevitably some of the senior trustees fell in love with the first year girls and became convinced that coeducation was a noble cause american statistics show that between 1880 and 1900 the number of trustees and senior professors who married girl undergraduates or who wanted to do so reached a percentage ofi forget the exact percentage it was either a hundred or a little over  i dont know just what happened at oxford but presumably something of the sort took place in any case the women are now all over the place they attend the college lectures they row in a boat and they perambulate the high street they are even offering a serious competition against the men last year they carried off the pingpong championship and took the chancellors prize for needlework while in music cooking and millinery the men are said to be nowhere  there is no doubt that unless oxford puts the women out while there is yet time they will overrun the whole university what this means to the progress of learning few can tell and those who know are afraid to say  cambridge university i am glad to see still sets its face sternly against this innovation i am reluctant to count any superiority in the university of cambridge having twice visited oxford having made the place a subject of profound study for many hours at a time having twice addressed its undergraduates and having stayed at the mitre hotel i consider myself an oxford man but i must admit that cambridge has chosen the wiser part  last autumn while i was in london on my voyage of discovery a vote was taken at cambridge to see if the women who have already a private college nearby should be admitted to the university they were triumphantly shut out and as a fit and proper sign of enthusiasm the undergraduates went over in a body and knocked down the gates of the womens college i know that it is a terrible thing to say that any one approved of this all the london papers came out with headings that readare our undergraduates turning into baboons and so on the manchester guardian draped its pages in black and even the london morning post was afraid to take bold ground in the matter but i do know also that there was a great deal of secret chuckling and jubilation in the london clubs nothing was expressed openly the men of england have been too terrorised by the women for that  but in safe corners of the club out of earshot of the waiters and away from casual strangers little groups of elderly men chuckled quietly together knocked down their gates eh said the wicked old men to one another and then whispered guiltily behind an uplifted hand serve em right nobody dared to say anything outside if they had some one would have got up and asked a question in the house of commons when this is done all england falls flat upon its face  but for my part when i heard of the cambridge vote i felt as lord chatham did when he said in parliament sir i rejoice that america has resisted for i have long harboured views of my own upon the higher education of women in these days however it requires no little hardihood to utter a single word of criticism against it it is like throwing half a brick through the glass roof of a conservatory it is bound to make trouble let me hasten therefore to say that i believe most heartily in the higher education of women in fact the higher the better the only question to my mind is what is higher education and how do you get it with which goes the secondary enquiry what is a woman and is she just the same as a man i know that it sounds a terrible thing to say in these days but i dont believe she is  let me say also that when i speak of coeducation i speak of what i know i was coeducated myself some thirtyfive years ago at the very beginning of the thing i learned my greek alongside of a bevy of beauty on the opposite benches that mashed up the irregular verbs for us very badly incidentally those girls are all married long since and all the greek they know now you could put under a thimble but of that presently  i have had further experience as well i spent three years in the graduate school of chicago where coeducational girls were as thick as autumn leaves and some thicker and as a college professor at mcgill university in montreal i have taught mingled classes of men and women for twenty years  on the basis of which experience i say with assurance that the thing is a mistake and has nothing to recommend it but its relative cheapness let me emphasise this last point and have done with it coeducation is of course a great economy to teach ten men and ten women in a single class of twenty costs only half as much as to teach two classes where economy must rule then the thing has got to be but where the discussion turns not on what is cheapest but on what is best then the case is entirely different  the fundamental trouble is that men and women are different creatures with different minds and different aptitudes and different paths in life there is no need to raise here the question of which is superior and which is inferior though i think the lord help me i know the answer to that too the point lies in the fact that they are different  but the mad passion for equality has masked this obvious fact when women began to demand quite rightly a share in higher education they took for granted that they wanted the same curriculum as the men they never stopped to ask whether their aptitudes were not in various directions higher and better than those of the men and whether it might not be better for their sex to cultivate the things which were best suited to their minds let me be more explicit in all that goes with physical and mathematical science women on the average are far below the standard of men there are of course exceptions but they prove nothing it is no use to quote to me the case of some brilliant girl who stood first in physics at cornell thats nothing there is an elephant in the zoo that can count up to ten yet i refuse to reckon myself his inferior  tabulated results spread over years and the actual experience of those who teach show that in the whole domain of mathematics and physics women are outclassed at mcgill the girls of our first year have wept over their failures in elementary physics these twentyfive years it is time that some one dried their tears and took away the subject  but in any case examination tests are never the whole story to those who know a written examination is far from being a true criterion of capacity it demands too much of mere memory imitativeness and the insidious willingness to absorb other peoples ideas parrots and crows would do admirably in examinations indeed the colleges are full of them  but take on the other hand all that goes with the aesthetic side of education with imaginative literature and the cult of beauty here women are or at least ought to be the superiors of men women were in primitive times the first storytellers they are still so at the cradle side the original college woman was the witch with her incantations and her prophecies and the glow of her bright imagination and if brutal men of duller brains had not burned it out of her she would be incanting still to my thinking we need more witches in the colleges and less physics  i have seen such young witches myselfif i may keep the word i like itin colleges such as wellesley in massachusetts and bryn mawr in pennsylvania where there isnt a man allowed within the three mile limit to my mind they do infinitely better thus by themselves they are freer less restrained they discuss things openly in their classes they lift up their voices and they speak whereas a girl in such a place as mcgill with men all about her sits for four years as silent as a frog full of shot  but there is a deeper trouble still the careers of the men and women who go to college together are necessarily different and the preparation is all aimed at the mans career the men are going to be lawyers doctors engineers business men and politicians and the women are not  there is no use pretending about it it may sound an awful thing to say but the women are going to be married that is and always has been their career and what is more they know it and even at college while they are studying algebra and political economy they have their eye on it sideways all the time the plain fact is that after a girl has spent four years of her time and a great deal of her parents money in equipping herself for a career that she is never going to have the wretched creature goes and gets married and in a few years she has forgotten which is the hypotenuse of a rightangled triangle and she doesnt care she has much better things to think of  at this point some one will shriek but surely even for marriage isnt it right that a girl should have a college education to which i hasten to answer most assuredly i freely admit that a girl who knows algebra or once knew it is a far more charming companion and a nobler wife and mother than a girl who doesnt know x from y but the point is this does the higher education that fits a man to be a lawyer also fit a person to be a wife and mother or in other words is a lawyer a wife and mother i say he is not granted that a girl is to spend four years in time and four thousand dollars in money in going to college why train her for a career that she is never going to adopt why not give her an education that will have a meaning and a harmony with the real life that she is to follow  for example suppose that during her four years every girl lucky enough to get a higher education spent at least six months of it in the training and discipline of a hospital as a nurse there is more education and character making in that than in a whole bucketful of algebra  but no the woman insists on snatching her share of an education designed by erasmus or william of wykeham or william of occam for the creation of scholars and lawyers and when later on in her home there is a sudden sickness or accident and the life or death of those nearest to her hangs upon skill and knowledge and a trained fortitude in emergency she must needs send in all haste for a hired woman to fill the place that she herself has never learned to occupy  but i am not here trying to elaborate a whole curriculum i am only trying to indicate that higher education for the man is one thing for the woman another nor do i deny the fact that women have got to earn their living their higher education must enable them to do that they cannot all marry on their graduation day but that is no great matter no scheme of education that any one is likely to devise will fail in this respect  the positions that they hold as teachers or civil servants they would fill all the better if their education were fitted to their wants  some few a small minority really and truly have a careerhusbandless and childlessin which the sacrifice is great and the honour to them perhaps all the higher and others no doubt dream of a career in which a husband and a group of blossoming children are carried as an appendage to a busy life at the bar or on the platform but all such are the mere minority so small as to make no difference to the general argument  but therei have written quite enough to make plenty of trouble except perhaps at cambridge university so i return with relief to my general study of oxford viewing the situation as a whole i am led then to the conclusion that there must be something in the life of oxford itself that makes for higher learning smoked at by his tutor fed in henry viiis kitchen and sleeping in a tangle of ivy the student evidently gets something not easily obtained in america and the more i reflect on the matter the more i am convinced that it is the sleeping in the ivy that does it how different it is from student life as i remember it  when i was a student at the university of toronto thirty years ago i livedfrom start to finishin seventeen different boarding houses as far as i am aware these houses have not or not yet been marked with tablets but they are still to be found in the vicinity of mccaul and darcy and st patrick streets any one who doubts the truth of what i have to say may go and look at them  i was not alone in the nomadic life that i led there were hundreds of us drifting about in this fashion from one melancholy habitation to another we lived as a rule two or three in a house sometimes alone we dined in the basement we always had beef done up in some way after it was dead and there were always soda biscuits on the table they used to have a brand of soda biscuits in those days in the toronto boarding houses that i have not seen since they were better than dog biscuits but with not so much snap my contemporaries will all remember them a great many of the leading barristers and professional men of toronto were fed on them  in the life we led we had practically no opportunities for association on a large scale no common rooms no reading rooms nothing we never saw the magazinespersonally i didnt even know the names of them the only interchange of ideas we ever got was by going over to the caer howell hotel on university avenue and interchanging them there  i mention these melancholy details not for their own sake but merely to emphasise the point that when i speak of students dormitories and the larger life which they offer i speak of what i know  if we had had at toronto when i was a student the kind of dormitories and dormitory life that they have at oxford i dont think i would ever have graduated id have been there still the trouble is that the universities on our continent are only just waking up to the idea of what a university should mean they were very largely instituted and organised with the idea that a university was a place where young men were sent to absorb the contents of books and to listen to lectures in the class rooms the student was pictured as a pallid creature burning what was called the midnight oil his wan face bent over his desk if you wanted to do something for him you gave him a book if you wanted to do something really large on his behalf you gave him a whole basketful of them if you wanted to go still further and be a benefactor to the college at large you endowed a competitive scholarship and set two or more pallid students working themselves to death to get it  the real thing for the student is the life and environment that surrounds him all that he really learns he learns in a sense by the active operation of his own intellect and not as the passive recipient of lectures and for this active operation what he really needs most is the continued and intimate contact with his fellows students must live together and eat together talk and smoke together experience shows that that is how their minds really grow and they must live together in a rational and comfortable way they must eat in a big dining room or hall with oak beams across the ceiling and the stained glass in the windows and with a shield or tablet here or there upon the wall to remind them between times of the men who went before them and left a name worthy of the memory of the college if a student is to get from his college what it ought to give him a college dormitory with the life in common that it brings is his absolute right a university that fails to give it to him is cheating him  if i were founding a universityand i say it with all the seriousness of which i am capablei would found first a smoking room then when i had a little more money in hand i would found a dormitory then after that or more probably with it a decent reading room and a library after that if i still had money over that i couldnt use i would hire a professor and get some text books  this chapter has sounded in the most part like a continuous eulogy of oxford with but little in favour of our american colleges i turn therefore with pleasure to the more congenial task of showing what is wrong with oxford and with the english university system generally and the aspect in which our american universities far excell the british  the point is that henry viii is dead the english are so proud of what henry viii and the benefactors of earlier centuries did for the universities that they forget the present there is little or nothing in england to compare with the magnificent generosity of individuals provinces and states which is building up the colleges of the united states and canada there used to be but by some strange confusion of thought the english people admire the noble gifts of cardinal wolsey and henry viii and queen margaret and do not realise that the carnegies and rockefellers and the william macdonalds are the cardinal wolseys of today the university of chicago was founded upon oil mcgill university rests largely on a basis of tobacco in america the world of commerce and business levies on itself a noble tribute in favour of the higher learning in england with a few conspicuous exceptions such as that at bristol there is little of the sort the feudal families are content with what their remote ancestors have done they do not try to emulate it in any great degree  in the long run this must count of all the various reforms that are talked of at oxford and of all the imitations of american methods that are suggested the only one worth while to my thinking is to capture a few millionaires give them honorary degrees at a million pounds sterling apiece and tell them to imagine that they are henry the eighth i give oxford warning that if this is not done the place will not last another two centuries     vi the british and the american press  the only paper from which a man can really get the news of the world in a shape that he can understand is the newspaper of his own home town for me unless i can have the montreal gazette at my breakfast and the montreal star at my dinner i dont really know what is happening in the same way i have seen a man from the south of scotland settle down to read the dumfries chronicle with a deep sigh of satisfaction and a man from burlington vermont pick up the burlington eagle and study the foreign news in it as the only way of getting at what was really happening in france and germany  the reason is i suppose that there are different ways of serving up the news and we each get used to our own some people like the news fed to them gently others like it thrown at them in a bombshell some prefer it to be made as little of as possible they want it minimised others want the maximum  this is where the greatest difference lies between the british newspapers and those of the united states and canada with us in america the great thing is to get the news and shout it at the reader in england they get the news and then break it to him as gently as possible hence the big headings the bold type and the double columns of the american paper and the small headings and the general air of quiet and respectability of the english press  it is quite beside the question to ask which is the better neither is they are different things thats all the english newspaper is designed to be read quietly propped up against the sugar bowl of a man eating a slow breakfast in a quiet corner of a club or by a retired banker seated in a leather chair nearly asleep or by a country vicar sitting in a wicker chair under a pergola the american paper is for reading by a man hanging on the straps of a clattering subway express by a man eating at a lunch counter by a man standing on one leg by a man getting a twominute shave or by a man about to have his teeth drawn by a dentist  in other words there is a difference of atmosphere it is not merely in the type and the lettering it is a difference in the way the news is treated and the kind of words that are used in america we love such words as gunmen and joyride and deathcell in england they prefer person of doubtful character and motor travelling at excessive speed and corridor no 6 if a milkwaggon collides in the street with a coalcart we write that a lifewaggon has struck a deathcart we call a murderer a thug or a gunman or a yegman in england they simply call him the accused who is a grocers assistant in houndsditch that designation would knock any decent murder story to pieces  hence comes the great difference between the american lead or opening sentence of the article and the english method of commencement in the american paper the idea is that the reader is so busy that he must first be offered the news in one gulp after that if he likes it he can go on and eat some more of it so the opening sentence must give the whole thing thus suppose that a leading member of the united states congress has committed suicide this is the way in which the american reporter deals with it  seated in his room at the grand hotel with his carpet slippers on his feet and his body wrapped in a blue dressinggown with pink insertions after writing a letter of farewell to his wife and emptying a bottle of scotch whisky in which he exonerated her from all culpability in his death congressman ahasuerus p tigg was found by nightwatchman henry t smith while making his rounds as usual with four bullets in his stomach  now let us suppose that a leading member of the house of commons in england had done the same thing here is the way it would be written up in a firstclass london newspaper  the heading would be home and general intelligence that is inserted so as to keep the reader soothed and quiet and is no doubt thought better than the american heading bughouse congressman blows out brains in hotel after the heading home and general intelligence the english paper runs the subheading incident at the grand hotel the reader still doesnt know what happened he isnt meant to then the article begins like this  the grand hotel which is situated at the corner of millbank and victoria streets was the scene last night of a distressing incident  what is it thinks the reader the hotel itself which is an old georgian structure dating probably from about 1750 is a quiet establishment its clientele mainly drawn from business men in the cattledroving and distillery business from south wales  what happened thinks the reader  its cuisine has long been famous for the excellence of its boiled shrimps  what happened  while the hotel itself is also known as the meeting place of the surbiton harmonic society and other associations  what happened  among the more prominent of the guests of the hotel has been numbered during the present parliamentary session mr llewylln ap jones mp for south llanfydd mr jones apparently came to his room last night at about ten pm and put on his carpet slippers and his blue dressing gown he then seems to have gone to the cupboard and taken from it a whisky bottle which however proved to be empty the unhappy gentleman then apparently went to bed  at that point the american reader probably stops reading thinking that he has heard it all the unhappy man found that the bottle was empty and went to bed very natural and the affair very properly called a distressing incident quite right but the trained english reader would know that there was more to come and that the air of quiet was only assumed and he would read on and on until at last the tragic interest heightened the four shots were fired with a good long pause after each for discussion of the path of the bullet through mr ap jones  i am not saying that either the american way or the british way is the better they are just two different ways thats all but the result is that anybody from the united states or canada reading the english papers gets the impression that nothing is happening and an english reader of our newspapers with us gets the idea that the whole place is in a tumult  when i was in london i used always in glancing at the morning papers to get a first impression that the whole world was almost asleep there was for example a heading called indian intelligence that showed on close examination that two thousand parsees had died of the blue plague that a powder boat had blown up at bombay that some one had thrown a couple of bombs at one of the provincial governors and that four thousand agitators had been sentenced to twenty years hard labour each but the whole thing was just called indian intelligence similarly there was a little item called our chinese correspondent that one explained ten lines down in very small type that a hundred thousand chinese had been drowned in a flood and there was another little item labelled foreign gossip under which was mentioned that the pope was dead and that the president of paraguay had been assassinated  in short i got the impression that i was living in an easy drowsy world as no doubt the editor meant me to it was only when the montreal star arrived by post that i felt that the world was still revolving pretty rapidly on its axis and that there was still something doing  as with the world news so it is with the minor events of ordinary lifebirth death marriage accidents crime let me give an illustration suppose that in a suburb of london a housemaid has endeavoured to poison her employers family by putting a drug in the coffee now on our side of the water we should write that little incident up in a way to give it life and put headings over it that would capture the readers attention in a minute we should begin it thus      pretty parlor maid        deals deathdrink            to clubmans family  the english reader would ask at once how do we know that the parlor maid is pretty we dont but our artistic sense tells us that she ought to be pretty parlor maids are the only ones we take any interest in if an ugly parlor maid poisoned her employers family we should hang her then again the english reader would say how do we know that the man is a clubman have we ascertained this fact definitely and if so of what club or clubs is he a member well we dont know except in so far as the thing is selfevident any man who has romance enough in his life to be poisoned by a pretty housemaid ought to be in a club thats the place for him in fact with us the word club man doesnt necessarily mean a man who belongs to a club it is defined as a man who is arrested in a gambling den or fined for speeding a motor or who shoots another person in a hotel corridor therefore this man must be a club man having settled the heading we go on with the text  brooding over love troubles which she has hitherto refused to divulge under the most grilling fusillade of rapidfire questions shot at her by the best brains of the new york police force miss mary de forrest a handsome brunette thirtysix inches around the hips employed as a parlor maid in the residence of mr spudd bung a wellknown clubman fortytwo inches around the chest was arrested yesterday by the flying squad of the emergency police after having so it is alleged put four ounces of alleged picrate of potash into the alleged coffee of her employers familys alleged breakfast at their residence on hudson heights in the most fashionable quarter of the metropolis dr slink the leading fashionable practitioner of the neighbourhood who was immediately summoned said that but for his own extraordinary dexterity and promptness the death of the whole family if not of the entire entourage was a certainty the magistrate in committing miss de forrest for trial took occasion to enlarge upon her youth and attractive appearance he castigated the moving pictures severely and said that he held them together with the public school system and the present method of doing the hair directly responsible for the crimes of the kind alleged  now when you read this over you begin to feel that something big has happened here is a man like dr slink all quivering with promptness and dexterity here is an inserted picture a photograph a brick house in a row marked with a cross  and labelled the bung residence as it appeared immediately after the alleged outrage it isnt really it is just a photograph that we use for this sort of thing and have grown to like it is called sometimesresidence of senator borah or scene of the recent spiritualistic manifestations or anything of the sort as long as it is marked with a cross  the reader will look at it with interest  in other words we make something out of an occurrence like this it doesnt matter if it all fades out afterwards when it appears that mary de forrest merely put ground allspice into the coffee in mistake for powdered sugar and that the family didnt drink it anyway the reader has already turned to other mysteries  but contrast the pitifully tame way in which the same event is written up in england here it is  suburban item  yesterday at the police court of surbitononthames mary forrester a servant in the employ of mr s bung was taken into custody on a charge of having put a noxious preparation possibly poison into the coffee of her employers family the young woman was remanded for a week  look at that mary forrester a servant  how wide was she round the chest it doesnt say mr s bung of what club was he a member none apparently then who cares if he is poisoned and the young woman what a way to speak of a decent girl who never did any other harm than to poison a club man and the english magistrate what a tame part he must have played his name indeed doesnt occur at all apparently he didnt enlarge on the girls good looks or comment on her attractive appearance or anything i dont suppose that he even asked mary forrester out to lunch with him  notice also that according to the english way of writing the thing up as soon as the girl was remanded for a week the incident is closed the english reporter doesnt apparently know enough to follow miss de forrest to her home called the de forrest residence and marked with a cross  the american reporter would make certain to supplement what went above with further information of this fashion miss de forrest when seen later at her own home by a representative of the eagle said that she regretted very much having been put to the necessity of poisoning mr bung she had in the personal sense nothing against mr bung and apart from poisoning him she had every respect for mr bung miss de forrest who talks admirably on a variety of topics expressed herself as warmly in favour of the league of nations and as a devotee of the short ballot and proportional representation  any american reader who studies the english press comes upon these wasted opportunities every day there are indeed certain journals of a newer type which are doing their best to imitate us but they dont really get it yet they use type up to about one inch and after that they get afraid  i hope that in describing the spirit of the english press i do not seem to be writing with any personal bitterness i admit that there might be a certain reason for such a bias during my stay in england i was most anxious to appear as a contributor to some of the leading papers this is with the english a thing that always adds prestige to be able to call oneself a contributor to the times or to punch or the morning post or the spectator is a high honour i have met these contributors all over the british empire some i admit look strange an ancient wreck in the back bar of an ontario tavern ancient regime has told me that he was a contributor to the times the janitor of the building where i lived admits that he is a contributor to punch a man arrested in bristol for vagrancy while i was in england pleaded that he was a contributor to the spectator in fact it is an honour that everybody seems to be able to get but me  i had often tried before i went to england to contribute to the great english newspapers i had never succeeded but i hoped that while in england itself the very propinquity of the atmosphere i mean the very contiguity of the surroundings would render the attempt easier i tried and i failed my failure was all the more ignominious in that i had very direct personal encouragement by all means said the editor of the london times do some thing for us while you are here best of all do something in a political way thats rather our special line i had already received almost an identical encouragement from the london morning post and in a more qualified way from the manchester guardian in short success seemed easy  i decided therefore to take some simple political event of the peculiar kind that always makes a stir in english politics and write it up for these english papers to simplify matters i thought it better to use one and the same incident and write it up in three different ways and get paid for it three times all of those who write for the press will understand the motive at once i waited therefore and watched the papers to see if anything interesting might happen to the ahkoond of swat or the sandjak of novi bazar or any other native potentate within a couple of days i got what i wanted in the following item which i need hardly say is taken word for word from the press despatches  perim via bombay news comes by messenger that the shriek of kowfat who has been living under the convention of 1898 has violated the modus operandi he is said to have torn off his suspenders dipped himself in oil and proclaimed a jehad the situation is critical  everybody who knows england knows that this is just the kind of news that the english love on our side of the atlantic we should be bothered by the fact that we did not know where kowfat is nor what was the convention of 1898 they are not they just take it for granted that kowfat is one of the many thousand places that they own somewhere in the outer darkness they have so many kowfats that they cannot keep track of them  i knew therefore that everybody would be interested in any discussion of what was at once called the kowfat crisis and i wrote it up i resisted the temptation to begin after the american fashion shriek sheds suspenders and suited the writing as i thought to the market i was writing for i wrote up the incident for the morning post after the following fashion  the news from kowfat affords one more instance of a painful backdown on the part of the government our policy of spineless supineness is now reaping its inevitable reward to us there is only one thing to be done if the shriek has torn off his suspenders he must be made to put them on again we have always held that where the imperial prestige of this country is concerned there is no room for hesitation in the present instance our prestige is at stake the matter involves our reputation in the eyes of the surrounding natives the bantu hottentots the negritos the dwarf men of east abyssinia and the dog men of darfur what will they think of us if we fail in this crisis their notion of us will fall fifty per cent in our opinion this country cannot stand a fifty per cent drop in the estimation of the dog men the time is one that demands action an ultimatum should be sent at once to the shriek of kowfat if he has one already we should send him another he should be made at once to put on his suspenders the oil must be scraped off him and he must be told plainly that if a pup like him tries to start a jehad he will have to deal with the british navy we call the shriek a pup in no sense of belittling him as our imperial ally but because we consider that the present is no time for half words and we do not regard pup as half a word events such as the present rocking the empire to its base make one long for the spacious days of a salisbury or a queen elizabeth or an alfred the great or a julius caesar we doubt whether the present cabinet is in this class  not to lose any time in the coming and going of the mail always a serious thought for the contributor to the press waiting for a cheque i sent another editorial on the same topic to the manchester guardian it ran as follows  the action of the shriek of kowfat in proclaiming a jehad against us is one that amply justifies all that we have said editorially since jeremy bentham died we have always held that the only way to deal with a mohammedan potentate like the shriek is to treat him like a christian the khalifate of kowfat at present buys its whole supply of cotton piece goods in our market and pays cash the shriek who is a man of enlightenment has consistently upheld the principles of free trade not only are our exports of cotton piece goods bibles rum and beads constantly increasing but they are more than offset by our importation from kowfat of ivory rubber gold and oil in short we have never seen the principles of free trade better illustrated the shriek it is now reported refuses to wear the braces presented to him by our envoy at the time of his coronation five years ago he is said to have thrown them into the mud but we have no reason to suppose that this is meant as a blow at our prestige it may be that after five years of use the little pulleys of the braces no longer work properly we have ourselves in our personal life known instances of this and can speak of the sense of irritation occasioned even we have thrown on the floor ours and in any case as we have often reminded our readers what is prestige if any one wants to hit us let him hit us right there we regard a blow at our trade as far more deadly than a blow at our prestige  the situation as we see it demands immediate reparation on our part the principal grievance of the shriek arises from the existence of our fort and garrison on the kowfat river our proper policy is to knock down the fort and either remove the garrison or give it to the shriek we are convinced that as soon as the shriek realises that we are prepared to treat him in the proper christian spirit he will at once respond with true mohammedan generosity  we have further to remember that in what we do we are being observed by the neighbouring tribes the negritos the dwarf men and the dog men of darfur these are not only shrewd observers but substantial customers the dwarf men at present buy all their cotton on the manchester market and the dog men depend on us for their soap  the present crisis is one in which the nation needs statesmanship and a broad outlook upon the world in the existing situation we need not the duplicity of a machiavelli but the commanding prescience of a gladstone or an alfred the great or a julius caesar luckily we have exactly this type of man at the head of affairs  after completing the above i set to work without delay on a similar exercise for the london times the special excellence of the times as everybody knows is its fulness of information for generations past the times has commanded a peculiar minuteness of knowledge about all parts of the empire it is the proud boast of this great journal that to whatever far away outlandish part of the empire you may go you will always find a correspondent of the times looking for something to do it is said that the present proprietor has laid it down as his maxim i dont want men who think i want men who know the arrangements for thinking are made separately  incidentally i may say that i had personal opportunities while i was in england of realising that the reputation of the times staff for the possession of information is well founded dining one night with some members of the staff i happened to mention saskatchewan one of the editors at the other end of the table looked up at the mention of the name saskatchewan he said ah yes thats not far from alberta is it and then turned quietly to his food again when i remind the reader that saskatchewan is only half an inch from alberta he may judge of the nicety of the knowledge involved having all this in mind i recast the editorial and sent it to the london times as follows  the news that the sultan of kowfat has thrown away his suspenders renders it of interest to indicate the exact spot where he has thrown them see map kowfat lying as the reader knows on the kowfat river occupies the hinterland between the back end of southwest somaliland and the east that is to say the west bank of lake pschu it thus forms an enclave between the dog men of darfur and the negritos of tchk the inhabitants of kowfat are a coloured race three quarters negroid and more than three quarters tabloid  as a solution of the present difficulty the first thing required in our opinion is to send out a boundary commission to delineate more exactly still just where kowfat is after that an ethnographical survey might be completed   it was a matter not only of concern but of surprise to me that not one of the three contributions recited above was accepted by the english press the morning post complained that my editorial was not firm enough in tone the guardian that it was not humane enough the times that i had left out the latitude and longitude always expected by their readers i thought it not worth while to bother to revise the articles as i had meantime conceived the idea that the same material might be used in the most delightfully amusing way as the basis of a poem far punch everybody knows the kind of verses that are contributed to punch by sir owen seaman and mr charles graves and men of that sort and everybody has been struck as i have by the extraordinary easiness of the performance all that one needs is to get some odd little incident such as the revolt of the sultan of kowfat make up an amusing title and then string the verses together in such a way as to make rhymes with all the odd words that come into the narrative in fact the thing is ease itself  i therefore saw a glorious chance with the sultan of kowfat indeed i fairly chuckled to myself when i thought what amusing rhymes could be made with negritos modus operandi and dog men of darfur i can scarcely imagine anything more excruciatingly funny than the rhymes which can be made with them and as for the title bringing in the word kowfat or some play upon it the thing is perfectly obvious the idea amused me so much that i set to work at the poem at once  i am sorry to say that i failed to complete it not that i couldnt have done so given time i am quite certain that if i had had about two years i could have done it the main structure of the poem however is here and i give it for what it is worth even as it is it strikes me as extraordinarily good here it is          title      kowfat          verse one          modus operandi         negritos     pshu          verse two      khalifate     dog men of darfur     tchk   excellent little thing isnt it all it needs is the rhymes as far as it goes it has just exactly the ease and the sweep required and if some one will tell me how owen seaman and those people get the rest of the ease and the sweep ill be glad to put it in  one further experiment of the same sort i made with the english press in another direction and met again with failure if there is one paper in the world for which i have respect andif i may say itan affection it is the london spectator i suppose that i am only one of thousands and thousands of people who feel that way why under the circumstances the spectator failed to publish my letter i cannot say i wanted no money for it i only wanted the honour of seeing it inserted beside the letter written from the rectory hops hants or the shrubbery potts shropsi mean from one of those places where the readers of the spectator live i thought too that my letter had just the right touch however they wouldnt take it something wrong with it somewhere i suppose this is it      to the editor       the spectator         london england      dear sir      your correspondence of last week contained such interesting     information in regard to the appearance of the first cowslip     in kensington common that i trust that i may without     fatiguing your readers to the point of saturation narrate     a somewhat similar and i think sir an equally interesting     experience of my own while passing through lambeth gardens     yesterday towards the hour of dusk i observed a crow with     one leg sitting beside the duckpond and apparently lost in     thought there was no doubt that the bird was of the     species pulex hibiscus an order which is becoming     singularly rare in the vicinity of the metropolis indeed     so far as i am aware the species has not been seen in     london since 1680 i may say that on recognising the bird i     drew as near as i could keeping myself behind the     shrubbery but the pulex hibiscus which apparently caught a     brief glimpse of my face uttered a cry of distress and flew     away      i am sir       believe me        yours sir           oy botherwithit      retd major burmese army  distressed by these repeated failures i sank back to a lower level of english literary work the puzzle department for some reason or other the english delight in puzzles it is i think a part of the peculiar schoolboy pedantry which is the reverse side of their literary genius i speak with a certain bitterness because in puzzle work i met with no success whatever my solutions were never acknowledged never paid for in fact they were ignored but i append two or three of them here with apologies to the editors of the strand and other papers who should have had the honour of publishing them first      puzzle i  can you fold a square piece of paper in such a way that with a single fold it forms a pentagon  my solution yes if i knew what a pentagon was      puzzle ii  a and b agree to hold a walking match across an open meadow each seeking the shortest line a walking from corner to corner may be said to diangulate the hypotenuse of the meadow b allowing for a slight rise in the ground walks on an obese tabloid which wins  my solution frankly i dont know       puzzle iii  with apologies to the strand  a rope is passed over a pulley it has a weight at one end and a monkey at the other there is the same length of rope on either side and equilibrium is maintained the rope weighs four ounces per foot the age of the monkey and the age of the monkeys mother together total four years the weight of the monkey is as many pounds as the monkeys mother is years old the monkeys mother was twice as old as the monkey was when the monkeys mother was half as old as the monkey will be when the monkey is three times as old as the monkeys mother was when the monkeys mother was three times as old as the monkey the weight of the rope with the weight at the end was half as much again as the difference in weight between the weight of the weight and the weight of the monkey now what was the length of the rope  my solution i should think it would have to be a rope of a fairly good length  in only one department of english journalism have i met with a decided measure of success i refer to the juvenile competition department this is a sort of thing to which the english are especially addicted as a really educated nation for whom good literature begins in the home they encourage in every way literary competitions among the young readers of their journals at least half a dozen of the wellknown london periodicals carry on this work the prizes run all the way from one shilling to half a guinea and the competitions are generally open to all children from three to six years of age it was here that i saw my open opportunity and seized it i swept in prize after prize as little agatha i got four shillings for the best description of autumn in two lines and one shilling for guessing correctly the missing letters in brstol shffield and hll a lot of the competitors fell down on hll i got six shillings for giving the dates of the norman conquest1492 ad and the crimean war of 1870 in short the thing was easy i might say that to enter these competitions one has to have a certificate of age from a member of the clergy but i know a lot of them     vii business in england wantedmore profiteers  it is hardly necessary to say that so shrewd an observer as i am could not fail to be struck by the situation of business in england passing through the factory towns and noticing that no smoke came from the tall chimneys and that the doors of the factories were shut i was led to the conclusion that they were closed  observing that the streets of the industrial centres were everywhere filled with idle men i gathered that they were unemployed and when i learned that the moving picture houses were full to the doors every day and that the concert halls beer gardens grand opera and religious concerts were crowded to suffocation i inferred that the country was suffering from an unparalleled depression this diagnosis turned out to be absolutely correct it has been freely estimated that at the time i refer to almost two million men were out of work  but it does not require government statistics to prove that in england at the present day everybody seems poor just as in the united states everybody to the eye of the visitor seems to be rich in england nobody seems to be able to afford anything in the united states everybody seems to be able to afford everything in england nobody smokes cigars in america everybody does on the english railways the first class carriages are empty in the united states the reserved drawingrooms are full poverty no doubt is only a relative matter but a man whose income used to be 10000 a year and is now 5000 is living in reduced circumstances he feels himself just as poor as the man whose income has been cut from five thousand pounds to three or from five hundred pounds to two they are all in the same boat what with the lowering of dividends and the raising of the income tax the closing of factories feeding the unemployed and trying to employ the unfed things are in a bad way  the underlying cause is plain enough the economic distress that the world suffers now is the inevitable consequence of the war everybody knows that but where the people differ is in regard to what is going to happen next and what we must do about it here opinion takes a variety of forms some people blame it on the german mark by permitting their mark to fall the germans it is claimed are taking away all the business from england the fall of the mark by allowing the germans to work harder and eat less than the english is threatening to drive the english out of house and home if the mark goes on falling still further the germans will thereby outdo us also in music literature and in religion what has got to be done therefore is to force the germans to lift the mark up again and make them pay up their indemnity  another more popular school of thought holds to an entirely contrary opinion the whole trouble they say comes from the sad collapse of germany these unhappy people having been too busy for four years in destroying valuable property in france and belgium to pay attention to their home affairs now find themselves collapsed it is our first duty to pick them up again the english should therefore take all the money they can find and give it to the germans by this means german trade and industry will revive to such an extent that the port of hamburg will be its old bright self again and german waiters will reappear in the london hotels after that everything will be all right  speaking with all the modesty of an outsider and a transient visitor i give it as my opinion that the trouble is elsewhere the danger of industrial collapse in england does not spring from what is happening in germany but from what is happening in england itself england like most of the other countries in the world is suffering from the overextension of government and the decline of individual selfhelp for six generations industry in england and america has flourished on individual effort called out by the prospect of individual gain every man acquired from his boyhood the idea that he must look after himself morally physically and financially that was the recognised way of getting on the desire to make a fortune was regarded as a laudable ambition a proper stimulus to effort the ugly word profiteer had not yet been coined there was no income tax to turn a mans pockets inside out and take away his savings the world was to the strong  under the stimulus of this the wheels of industry hummed factories covered the land national production grew to a colossal size and the whole outer world seemed laid under a tribute to the great industry as a system it was far from perfect it contained in itself all kinds of gross injustices demands that were too great wages that were too small in spite of the splendour of the foreground poverty and destitution hovered behind the scenes but such as it was the system worked and it was the only one that we knew  or turn to another aspect of this same principle of selfhelp the way to acquire knowledge in the early days was to buy a tallow candle and read a book after ones days work as benjamin franklin read or lincoln and when the soul was stimulated to it then the aspiring youth must save money put himself to college live on nothing think much and in the course of this starvation and effort become a learned man with somehow a peculiar moral fibre in him not easily reproduced today for today the candle is free and the college is free and the student has a union like the profiteers club and a swimmingbath and a drama league and a coeducational society at his elbow for which he buys beauty roses at five dollars a bunch  or turn if one will to the moral side the older way of being good was by much prayer and much effort of ones own soul now it is done by a board of censors there is no need to fight sin by the power of the spirit let the board of censors do it they together with three or four kinds of commissioners are supposed to keep sin at arms length and to supply a first class legislative guarantee of righteousness as a short cut to morality and as a way of saving individual effort our legislatures are turning out morality legislation by the bucketful the legislature regulates our drink it begins already to guard us against the deadly cigarette it regulates here and there the length of our skirts it safeguards our amusements and in two states of the american union it even proposes to save us from the teaching of the darwinian theory of evolution the ancient prayer lead us not into temptation is passing out of date the way to temptation is declared closed by act of parliament and by amendment to the constitution of the united states yet oddly enough the moral tone of the world fails to respond the world is apparently more full of thugs holdup men yegmen bandits motorthieves porchclimbers spotters spies and crooked policemen than it ever was till it almost seems that the slow oldfashioned method of an effort of the individual soul may be needed still before the world is made good  this vast new system the system of leaning on the government is spreading like a blight over england and america and everywhere we suffer from it government that in theory represents a union of effort and a saving of force sprawls like an octopus over the land it has become like a dead weight upon us wherever it touches industry it cripples it it runs railways and makes a heavy deficit it builds ships and loses money on them it operates the ships and loses more money it piles up taxes to fill the vacuum and when it has killed employment opens a bureau of unemployment and issues a report on the depression of industry  now the only way to restore prosperity is to give back again to the individual the opportunity to make money to make lots of it and when he has got it to keep it in spite of all the devastation of the war the raw assets of our globe are hardly touched here and there as in parts of china and in england and in belgium with about seven hundred people to the square mile the world is fairly well filled up there is standing room only but there are vast empty spaces still mesopotamia alone has millions of acres of potential wheat land with a few arabs squatting on it canada could absorb easily half a million settlers a year for a generation to come the most fertile part of the world the valley of the amazon is still untouched so fertile is it that for tens of thousands of square miles it is choked with trees a mere tangle of life defying all entry the idea of our humanity sadly walking the streets of glasgow or sitting mournfully fishing on the piers of the hudson out of work would be laughable if it were not for the pathos of it  the world is out of work for the simple reason that the world has killed the goose that laid the golden eggs of industry by taxation by legislation by popular sentiment all over the world there has been a disparagement of the capitalist and all over the world capital is frightened it goes and hides itself in the form of an investment in a victory bond a thing that is only a particular name for a debt with no productive effort behind it and indicating only a dead weight of taxes there capital sits like a bullfrog hidden behind waterlilies refusing to budge  hence the way to restore prosperity is not to multiply government departments and government expenditures nor to appoint commissions and to pile up debts but to start going again the machinery of bold productive effort take off all the excess profits taxes and the supertaxes on income and as much of the income tax itself as can be done by a wholesale dismissal of government employees and then give industry a mark to shoot at what is needed now is not the multiplication of government reports but corporate industry the formation of land companies development companies irrigation companies any kind of corporation that will call out private capital from its hiding places offer employment to millions and start the wheels moving again if the promoters of such corporations presently earn huge fortunes for themselves society is none the worse and in any case humanity being what it is they will hand back a vast part of what they have acquired in return for lld degrees or bits of blue ribbon or companionships of the bath or whatever kind of glass bead fits the fancy of the retired millionaire  the next thing to be done then is to fire the government officials and to bring back the profiteer as to which officials are to be fired first it doesnt matter much in england people have been greatly perturbed as to the use to be made of such instruments as the geddes axe the edge of the axe of dismissal seems so terribly sharp but there is no need to worry if the edge of the axe is too sharp hit with the back of it  as to the profiteer bring him back he is really just the same person who a few years ago was called a captain of industry and an empire builder and a nation maker it is the times that have changed not the man he is there still just as greedy and rapacious as ever but no greedier and we have just the same social need of his greed as a motive power in industry as we ever had and indeed a worse need than before  we need him not only in business but in the whole setting of life or if not him personally we need the eager selfish but reliant spirit of the man who looks after himself and doesnt want to have a spoonfed education and a government job alternating with a government dole and a set of morals framed for him by a board of censors bring back the profiteer fetch him from the riviera from his countryplace on the hudson or from whatever spot to which he has withdrawn with his tin box full of victory bonds if need be go and pick him out of the penitentiary take the stripes off him and tell him to get busy again show him the map of the world and ask him to pick out a few likely spots the trained greed of the rascal will find them in a moment then write him out a concession for coal in asia minor or oil in the mackenzie basin or for irrigation in mesopotamia the ink will hardly be dry on it before the capital will begin to flow in it will come from all kinds of places whence the government could never coax it and where the taxgatherer could never find it only promise that it is not going to be taxed out of existence and the stream of capital which is being dried up in the sands of government mismanagement will flow into the hands of private industry like a river of gold  and incidentally when the profiteer has finished his work we can always put him back into the penitentiary if we like but we need him just now     viii is prohibition coming to england  in the united states and canada the principal topic of polite conversation is now prohibition at every dinner party the serving of the cocktails immediately introduces the subject the rest of the dinner is enlivened throughout with the discussion of rumrunners bootleggers storage of liquor and the state constitution of new jersey under this influence all social and conversational values are shifted and rearranged a scholarly man no longer means a man who can talk well on literary subjects but a man who understands the eighteenth amendment and can explain the legal difference between implementing statutes such as the volstead act and the underlying state legislation a scientist invaluable in these conversations is a man who can make clear the distinction between alcoholic percentages by bulk and by weight and a brilliant engineer means a man who explains how to make homebrewed beer with a kick in it similarly a raconteur means a man who has a fund of amusing stories about bootleggers and an interesting traveller means a man who has been to havana and can explain how wet it is indeed the whole conception of travel and of interest in foreign countries is now altered as soon as any one mentions that he has been in a foreign country all the company ask in one breath is it dry the question how is samoa or how is turkey or how is british columbia no longer refers to the climate or natural resources it means is the place dry when such a question is asked and the answer is its wet there is a deep groan all around the table  i understand that when the recent disarmament conference met at washington just as the members were going to sit down at the table monsieur briand said to president harding how dry is the united states anyway and the whole assembly talked about it for half an hour that was why the first newspaper bulletins merely said conference exchanges credentials  as a discoverer of england i therefore made it one of my chief cares to try to obtain accurate information of this topic i was well aware that immediately on my return to canada the first question i would be asked would be is england going dry i realised that in any report i might make to the national geographical society or to the political science association the members of these bodies being scholars would want accurate information about the price of whiskey the percentage of alcohol and the hours of opening and closing the saloons  my first impression on the subject was i must say one of severe moral shock landing in england after spending the summer in ontario it seemed a terrible thing to see people openly drinking on an english train on an ontario train as everybody knows there is no way of taking a drink except by climbing up on the roof lying flat on ones stomach and taking a suck out of a flask but in england in any dining car one actually sees a waiter approach a person dining and say beer sir or wine this is done in broad daylight with no apparent sense of criminality or moral shame appalling though it sounds bottled ale is openly sold on the trains at twentyfive cents a bottle and dry sherry at eighteen cents a glass  when i first saw this i expected to see the waiter arrested on the spot i looked around to see if there were any spotters detectives or secret service men on the train i anticipated that the train conductor would appear and throw the waiter off the car but then i realised that i was in england and that in the british isles they still tolerate the consumption of alcohol indeed i doubt if they are even aware that they are consuming alcohol their impression is that they are drinking beer  at the beginning of my discussion i will therefore preface a few exact facts and statistics for the use of geographical societies learned bodies and government commissions the quantity of beer consumed in england in a given period is about 200000000 gallons the life of a bottle of scotch whiskey is seven seconds the number of public houses or pubs in the english countryside is one to every half mile the percentage of the working classes drinking beer is 125 the percentage of the class without work drinking beer is 200  statistics like these do not however give a final answer to the question is prohibition coming to england they merely show that it is not there now the question itself will be answered in as many different ways as there are different kinds of people any prohibitionist will tell you that the coming of prohibition to england is as certain as the coming eclipse of the sun but this is always so it is in human nature that people are impressed by the cause they work in i once knew a minister of the scotch church who took a voyage round the world he said that the thing that impressed him most was the growth of presbyterianism in japan no doubt it did when the orillia lacrosse team took their trip to australia they said on their return that lacrosse was spreading all over the world in the same way there is said to be a spread all over the world of christian science proportional representation militarism peace sentiment barbarism altruism psychoanalysis and death from wood alcohol they are what are called world movements  my own judgment in regard to prohibition in the british isles is this in scotland prohibition is not coming if anything it is going in ireland prohibition will only be introduced when they have run out of other forms of trouble but in england i think that prohibition could easily come unless the english people realise where they are drifting and turn back they are in the early stage of the movement already  turning first to scotland there is no fear i say that prohibition will be adopted there and this from the simple reason that the scotch do not drink i have elsewhere alluded to the extraordinary misapprehension that exists in regard to the scotch people and their sense of humour i find a similar popular error in regard to the use of whiskey by the scotch because they manufacture the best whiskey in the world the scotch in popular fancy are often thought to be addicted to the drinking of it this is purely a delusion during the whole of two or three pleasant weeks spent in lecturing in scotland i never on any occasion saw whiskey made use of as a beverage i have seen people take it of course as a medicine or as a precaution or as a wise offset against a rather treacherous climate but as a beverage never  the manner and circumstance of their offering whiskey to a stranger amply illustrates their point of view towards it thus at my first lecture in glasgow where i was to appear before a large and fashionable audience the chairman said to me in the committee room that he was afraid that there might be a draft on the platform here was a serious matter for a lecturer who has to earn his living by his occupation a draft on the platform is not a thing to be disregarded it might kill him nor is it altogether safe for the chairman himself a man already in middle life to be exposed to a current of cold air in this case therefore the chairman suggested that he thought it might be prudentthat was his word prudentif i should take a small drop of whiskey before encountering the draft in return i told him that i could not think of his accompanying me to the platform unless he would let me insist on his taking a very reasonable precaution whiskey taken on these terms not only seems like a duty but it tastes better  in the same way i find that in scotland it is very often necessary to take something to drink on purely meteorological grounds the weather simply cannot be trusted a man might find that on going out into the weather he is overwhelmed by a heavy fog or an avalanche of snow or a driving storm of rain in such a case a mere drop of whiskey might save his life it would be folly not to take it againcoming in out of the weather is a thing not to be trifled with a person coming in unprepared and unprotected might be seized with angina pectoris or appendicitis and die upon the spot no reasonable person would refuse the simple precaution of taking a small drop immediately after his entry  i find that classified altogether there are seventeen reasons advanced in scotland for taking whiskey they run as follows reason one because it is raining two because it is not raining three because you are just going out into the weather four because you have just come in from the weather five no i forget the ones that come after that but i remember that reason number seventeen is because it canna do ye any harm on the whole reason seventeen is the best  put in other words this means that the scotch make use of whiskey with dignity and without shame and they never call it alcohol  in england the case is different already the english are showing the first signs that indicate the possible approach of prohibition already all over england there are weird regulations about the closing hours of the public houses they open and close according to the varying regulations of the municipality in some places they open at six in the morning close down for an hour from nine till ten open then till noon shut for ten minutes and so on in some places they are open in the morning and closed in the evening in other places they are open in the evening and closed in the morning the ancient idea was that a wayside public house was a place of sustenance and comfort a human need that might be wanted any hour it was in the same class with the life boat or the emergency ambulance under the old common law the innkeeper must supply meat and drink at any hour if he was asleep the traveller might wake him and in those days meat and drink were regarded in the same light note how great the change is in modern life in england there is nothing that you dare wake up a man for except gasoline the mere fact that you need a drink is no longer held to entitle you to break his rest  in london especially one feels the full force of the closing regulations the bars open and shut at intervals like daisies blinking at the sun and like the flowers at evening they close their petals with the darkness in london they have already adopted the deadly phrases of the prohibitionist such as alcohol and liquor traffic and so on and already the sale of spirits stops absolutely at about eleven oclock at night  this means that after theatre hours london is a city of dreadful night the people from the theatre scuttle to their homes the lights are extinguished in the windows the streets darken only a belated taxi still moves at midnight the place is deserted at 1 am the lingering footfalls echo in the empty street here and there a restaurant in a fashionable street makes a poor pretence of keeping open for after theatre suppers odd people the shivering wrecks of theatre parties are huddled here and there a gloomy waiter lays a sardine on the table the guests charge their glasses with perrier water lithia water citrate of magnesia or bromo seltzer they eat the sardine and vanish into the night not even oshkosh wisconsin or middlebury vermont is quieter than is the night life of london it may no doubt seem a wise thing to go to bed early  but it is a terrible thing to go to bed early by act of parliament  all of which means that the people of england are not facing the prohibition question fairly and squarely if they see no harm in consuming alcohol they ought to say so and let their code of regulations reflect the fact but the closing and regulating and squeezing of the liquor traffic without any outspoken protest means letting the whole case go by default under these circumstances an organised and active minority can always win and impose its will upon the crowd  when i was in england i amused myself one day by writing an imaginary picture of what england will be like when the last stage is reached and london goes the way of new york and chicago i cast it in the form of a letter from an american prohibitionist in which he describes the final triumph of prohibition in england with the permission of the reader i reproduce it here      the advent of prohibition in england      as written in the correspondence of an american visitor      how glad i am that i have lived to see this wonderful reform     of prohibition at last accomplished in england there is     something so difficult about the british so stolid so hard     to move      we tried everything in the great campaign that we made and     for ever so long it didnt seem to work we had processions     just as we did at home in america with great banners     carried round bearing the inscription do you want to save     the boy but these people looked on and said boy boy     what boy our workers were almost disheartened oh sir     said one of them an exbarkeeper from oklahoma it does     seem so hard that we have total prohibition in the states     and here they can get all the drink they want and the good     fellow broke down and sobbed      but at last it has come after the most terrific efforts we     managed to get this nation stampeded and for more than a     month now england has been dry i wish you could have     witnessed the scenes just like what we saw at home in     america when it was known that the bill had passed the     members of the house of lords all stood up on their seats     and yelled rah rah rah whos bone dry we are and the     brewers and innkeepers were emptying their barrels of beer     into the thames just as at st louis they emptied the beer     into the mississippi      i cant tell you with what pleasure i watched a group of     members of the athenaeum club sitting on the bank of the     thames and opening bottles of champagne and pouring them     into the river to think said one of them to me that     there was a time when i used to lap up a couple of quarts of     this terrible stuff every evening i got him to give me a     few bottles as a souvenir and i got some more souvenirs     whiskey and liqueurs when the members of the beefsteak club     were emptying out their cellars into green street so when     you come over i shall still be able of course to give you     a drink      we have as i said been bone dry only a month and yet     already we are getting the same splendid results as in     america all the big dinners are now as refined and as     elevating and the dinner speeches as long and as informal as     they are in new york or toronto the other night at a dinner     at the white friars club i heard sir owen seaman speaking     not in that light futile way that he used to have but quite     differently he talked for over an hour and a half on the     state ownership of the chinese railway system and i almost     fancied myself back in boston      and the working class too it is just wonderful how     prohibition has increased their efficiency in the old days     they used to drop their work the moment the hour struck now     they simply refuse to do so i noticed yesterday a foreman     in charge of a building operation vainly trying to call the     bricklayers down come come gentlemen he shouted i     must insist on your stopping for the night but they just     went on laying bricks faster than ever      of course as yet there are a few slight difficulties and     deficiencies just as there are with us in america we have     had the same trouble with woodalcohol they call it     methylated spirit here with the same deplorable results     on some days the list of deaths is very serious and in some     cases we are losing men we can hardly spare a great many of     our leading actorsin fact most of themare dead and there     has been a heavy loss too among the literary class and in     the legal profession      there was a very painful scene last week at the dinner of     the benchers of grays inn it seems that one of the chief     justices had undertaken to make home brew for the benchers     just as the people do on our side of the water he got one     of the waiters to fetch him some hops and three raw     potatoes a packet of yeast and some boiling water in the     end four of the benchers were carried out dead but they     are going to give them a public funeral in the abbey      i regret to say that the death list in the royal navy is     very heavy some of the best sailors are gone and it is     very difficult to keep admirals but i have tried to explain     to the people here that these are merely the things that one     must expect and that with a little patience they will     have bonedry admirals and bonedry statesmen just as good     as the wet ones even the clergy can be dried up with     firmness and perseverance      there was also a slight sensation here when the chancellor     of the exchequer brought in his first appropriation for     maintaining prohibition from our point of view in america     it was modest enough but these people are not used to it     the chancellor merely asked for ten million pounds a month     to begin on he explained that his task was heavy he has to     police not only the entire coast but also the interior     for the grampian hills of scotland alone he asked a million     there was a good deal of questioning in the house over these     figures the chancellor was asked if he intended to keep a     hired spy at every street corner in london he answered     no only on every other street he added also that every     spy must wear a brass collar with his number      i must admit further and i am sorry to have to tell you     this that now we have prohibition it is becoming     increasingly difficult to get a drink in fact sometimes     especially in the very early morning it is most     inconvenient and almost impossible the public houses being     closed it is necessary to go into a drug storejust as it     is with usand lean up against the counter and make a     gurgling sound like apoplexy one often sees these apoplexy     cases lined up four deep      but the people are finding substitutes just as they do with     us there is a tremendous run on patent medicines perfume     glue and nitric acid it has been found that shears soap     contains alcohol and one sees people everywhere eating     cakes of it the upper classes have taken to chewing tobacco     very considerably and the use of opium in the house of     lords has very greatly increased      but i dont want you to think that if you come over here to     see me your private life will be in any way impaired or     curtailed i am glad to say that i have plenty of rich     connections whose cellars are very amply stocked the duke     of blank is said to have 5000 cases of scotch whiskey and     i have managed to get a card of introduction to his butler     in fact you will find that just as with us in america the     benefit of prohibition is intended to fall on the poorer     classes there is no desire to interfere with the rich     ix we have with us tonight  not only during my tour in england but for many years past it has been my lot to speak and to lecture in all sorts of places under all sorts of circumstances and before all sorts of audiences i say this not in boastfulness but in sorrow indeed i only mention it to establish the fact that when i talk of lecturers and speakers i talk of what i know  few people realise how arduous and how disagreeable public lecturing is the public sees the lecturer step out on to the platform in his little white waistcoat and his long tailed coat and with a false air of a conjurer about him and they think him happy after about ten minutes of his talk they are tired of him most people tire of a lecture in ten minutes clever people can do it in five sensible people never go to lectures at all but the people who do go to a lecture and who get tired of it presently hold it as a sort of a grudge against the lecturer personally in reality his sufferings are worse than theirs  for my own part i always try to appear as happy as possible while i am lecturing i take this to be part of the trade of anybody labelled a humourist and paid as such i have no sympathy whatever with the idea that a humourist ought to be a lugubrious person with a face stamped with melancholy this is a cheap and elementary effect belonging to the level of a circus clown the image of laughter shaking both his sides is the truer picture of comedy therefore i say i always try to appear cheerful at my lectures and even to laugh at my own jokes oddly enough this arouses a kind of resentment in some of the audience well i will say said a sternlooking woman who spoke to me after one of my lectures you certainly do seem to enjoy your own fun madam i answered if i didnt who would but in reality the whole business of being a public lecturer is one long variation of boredom and fatigue so i propose to set down here some of the many trials which the lecturer has to bear  the first of the troubles which any one who begins giving public lectures meets at the very outset is the fact that the audience wont come to hear him this happens invariably and constantly and not through any fault or shortcoming of the speaker  i dont say that this happened very often to me in my tour in england in nearly all cases i had crowded audiences by dividing up the money that i received by the average number of people present to hear me i have calculated that they paid thirteen cents each and my lectures are evidently worth thirteen cents but at home in canada i have very often tried the fatal experiment of lecturing for nothing and in that case the audience simply wont come a man will turn out at night when he knows he is going to hear a first class thirteen cent lecture but when the thing is given for nothing why go to it  the city in which i live is overrun with little societies clubs and associations always wanting to be addressed so at least it is in appearance in reality the societies are composed of presidents secretaries and officials who want the conspicuousness of office and a large list of other members who wont come to the meetings for such an association the invited speaker who is to lecture for nothing prepares his lecture on indogermanic factors in the current of history if he is a professor he takes all the winter at it you may drop in at his house at any time and his wife will tell you that he is upstairs working on his lecture if he comes down at all it is in carpet slippers and dressing gown his mental vision of his meeting is that of a huge gathering of keen people with indogermanic faces hanging upon every word  then comes the fated night there are seventeen people present the lecturer refuses to count them he refers to them afterwards as about a hundred to this group he reads his paper on the indogermanic factor it takes him two hours when he is over the chairman invites discussion there is no discussion the audience is willing to let the indogermanic factors go unchallenged then the chairman makes this speech he says  i am very sorry indeed that we should have had such a very poor turn out tonight i am sure that the members who were not here have missed a real treat in the delightful paper that we have listened to i want to assure the lecturer that if he comes to the owls club again we can guarantee him next time a capacity audience and will any members please who havent paid their dollar this winter pay it either to me or to mr sibley as they pass out  i have heard this speech in the years when i have had to listen to it so many times that i know it by heart i have made the acquaintance of the owls club under so many names that i recognise it at once i am aware that its members refuse to turn out in cold weather that they do not turn out in wet weather that when the weather is really fine it is impossible to get them together that the slightest counterattractiona hockey match a sacred concertgoes to their heads at once  there was a time when i was the newly appointed occupant of a college chair and had to address the owls club it is a penalty that all new professors pay and the owls batten upon them like bats it is one of the compensations of age that i am free of the owls club forever but in the days when i still had to address them i used to take it out of the owls in a speech delivered in imagination only and not out loud to the assembled meeting of the seventeen owls after the chairman had made his concluding remarks it ran as follows  gentlemenif you are such which i doubt i realise that the paper which i have read on was hegel a deist has been an error i spent all the winter on it and now i realise that not one of you pups know who hegel was or what a deist is never mind it is over now and i am glad but just let me say this only this which wont keep you a minute your chairman has been good enough to say that if i come again you will get together a capacity audience to hear me let me tell you that if your society waits for its next meeting till i come to address you again you will wait indeed in fact gentlemeni say it very franklyit will be in another world  but i pass over the audience suppose there is a real audience and suppose them all duly gathered together then it becomes the business of that gloomy gentlemanfacetiously referred to in the newspaper reports as the genial chairmanto put the lecturer to the bad in nine cases out of ten he can do so some chairmen indeed develop a great gift for it here are one or two examples from my own experience  ladies and gentlemen said the chairman of a society in a little country town in western ontario to which i had come as a paid a very humbly paid lecturer we have with us tonight a gentleman here he made an attempt to read my name on a card failed to read it and put the card back in his pocketa gentleman who is to lecture to us on here he looked at his card againon ancient ancienti dont very well see what it isancientbritain thank you on ancient britain now this is the first of our series of lectures for this winter the last series as you all know was not a success in fact we came out at the end of the year with a deficit so this year we are starting a new line and trying the experiment of cheaper talent  here the chairman gracefully waved his hand toward me and there was a certain amount of applause before i sit down the chairman added id like to say that i am sorry to see such a poor turnout tonight and to ask any of the members who havent paid their dollar to pay it either to me or to mr sibley as they pass out  let anybody who knows the discomfiture of coming out before an audience on any terms judge how it feels to crawl out in front of them labelled cheaper talent  another charming way in which the chairman endeavours to put both the speaker for the evening and the audience into an entirely good humour is by reading out letters of regret from persons unable to be present this of course is only for grand occasions when the speaker has been invited to come under very special auspices it was my fate not long ago to appear this is the correct word to use in this connection in this capacity when i was going about canada trying to raise some money for the relief of the belgians i travelled in great glory with a pass on the canadian pacific railway not since extended officials of the road kindly note this and was most generously entertained wherever i went  it was therefore the business of the chairman at such meetings as these to try and put a special distinction or cachet on the gathering this is how it was done  ladies and gentlemen said the chairman rising from his seat on the platform with a little bundle of papers in his hand before i introduce the speaker of the evening i have one or two items that i want to read to you here he rustles his papers and there is a deep hush in the hall while he selects one we had hoped to have with us tonight sir robert borden the prime minister of this dominion i have just received a telegram from sir robert in which he says that he will not be able to be here great applause the chairman puts up his hand for silence picks up another telegram and continues our committee ladies and gentlemen telegraphed an invitation to sir wilfrid laurier very cordially inviting him to be here tonight i have here sir wilfrids answer in which he says that he will not be able to be with us renewed applause the chairman again puts up his hand for silence and goes on picking up one paper after another the minister of finance regrets that he will be unable to come applause mr rodolphe lemieux applause will not be here great applausethe mayor of toronto applause is detained on business wild applausethe anglican bishop of the diocese applausethe principal of the university college toronto great applausethe minister of education applausenone of these are coming there is a great clapping of hands and enthusiasm after which the meeting is called to order with a very distinct and palpable feeling that it is one of the most distinguished audiences ever gathered in the hall  here is another experience of the same period while i was pursuing the same exalted purpose i arrived in a little town in eastern ontario and found to my horror that i was billed to appear in a church i was supposed to give readings from my works and my books are supposed to be of a humorous character a church hardly seemed the right place to get funny in i explained my difficulty to the pastor of the church a very solemn looking man he nodded his head slowly and gravely as he grasped my difficulty i see he said i see but i think that i can introduce you to our people in such a way as to make that right  when the time came he led me up on to the pulpit platform of the church just beside and below the pulpit itself with a reading desk and a big bible and a shaded light beside it it was a big church and the audience sitting in half darkness as is customary during a sermon reached away back into the gloom the place was packed full and absolutely quiet then the chairman spoke  dear friends he said i want you to understand that it will be all right to laugh tonight let me hear you laugh heartily laugh right out just as much as ever you want to because and here his voice assumed the deep sepulchral tones of the preacherwhen we think of the noble object for which the professor appears tonight we may be assured that the lord will forgive any one who will laugh at the professor  i am sorry to say however that none of the audience even with the plenary absolution in advance were inclined to take a chance on it  i recall in this same connection the chairman of a meeting at a certain town in vermont he represents the type of chairman who turns up so late at the meeting that the committee have no time to explain to him properly what the meeting is about or who the speaker is i noticed on this occasion that he introduced me very guardedly by name from a little card and said nothing about the belgians and nothing about my being supposed to be a humourist this last was a great error the audience for want of guidance remained very silent and decorous and well behaved during my talk then somehow at the end while some one was moving a vote of thanks the chairman discovered his error so he tried to make it good just as the audience were getting up to put on their wraps he rose knocked on his desk and said  just a minute please ladies and gentlemen just a minute i have just found outi should have known it sooner but i was late in coming to this meetingthat the speaker who has just addressed you has done so in behalf of the belgian relief fund i understand that he is a wellknown canadian humourist ha ha and i am sure that we have all been immensely amused ha ha he is giving his delightful talks ha hathough i didnt know this till just this minutefor the belgian relief fund and he is giving his services for nothing i am sure when we realise this we shall all feel that it has been well worth while to come i am only sorry that we didnt have a better turn out tonight but i can assure the speaker that if he will come again we shall guarantee him a capacity audience and i may say that if there are any members of this association who have not paid their dollar this season they can give it either to myself or to mr sibley as they pass out  with the amount of accumulated experience that i had behind me i was naturally interested during my lecture in england in the chairmen who were to introduce me i cannot help but feel that i have acquired a fine taste in chair men i know them just as other experts know old furniture and pekinese dogs the witty chairman the prosy chairman the solemn chairmani know them all as soon as i shake hands with the chairman in the committee room i can tell exactly how he will act  there are certain types of chairmen who have so often been described and are so familiar that it is not worth while to linger on them everybody knows the chairman who says now ladies and gentlemen you have not come here to listen to me so i will be very brief in fact i will confine my remarks to just one or two very short observations he then proceeds to make observations for twentyfive minutes at the end of it he remarks with charming simplicity now i know that you are all impatient to hear the lecturer  and everybody knows the chairman who comes to the meeting with a very imperfect knowledge of who or what the lecturer is and is driven to introduce him by saying  our lecturer of the evening is widely recognised as one of the greatest authorities on onon his subject in the world today he comes to us from from a great distance and i can assure him that it is a great pleasure to this audience to welcome a man who has done so much tototo advance the interests ofof of everything as he has  but this man bad as he is is not so bad as the chairman whose preparation for introducing the speaker has obviously been made at the eleventh hour just such a chairman it was my fate to strike in the form of a local alderman built like an ox in one of those small manufacturing places in the north of england where they grow men of this type and elect them into office  i never saw the lecturer before he said but ive read his book i have written nineteen books the committee was good enough to send me over his book last night i didnt read it all but i took a look at the preface and i can assure him that he is very welcome i understand he comes from a college then he turned directly towards me and said in a loud voice what was the name of that college over there you said you came from  mcgill i answered equally loudly  he comes from mcgill the chairman boomed out i never heard of mcgill myself but i can assure him hes welcome hes going to lecture to us onwhat did you say it was to be about  its a humorous lecture i said  ay its to be a humorous lecture ladies and gentlemen and ill venture to say it will be a rare treat im only sorry i cant stay for it myself as i have to get back over to the town hall for a meeting so without more ado ill get off the platform and let the lecturer go on with his humour  a still more terrible type of chairman is one whose mind is evidently preoccupied and disturbed with some local happening and who comes on to the platform with a face imprinted with distress before introducing the lecturer he refers in moving tones to the local sorrow whatever it is as a prelude to a humorous lecture this is not gay  such a chairman fell to my lot one night before a gloomy audience in a london suburb as i look about this hall tonight he began in a doleful whine i see many empty seats here he stifled a sob nor am i surprised that a great many of our people should prefer tonight to stay quietly at home  i had no clue to what he meant i merely gathered that some particular sorrow must have overwhelmed the town that day  to many it may seem hardly fitting that after the loss our town has sustained we should come out here to listen to a humorous lecture whats the trouble i whispered to a citizen sitting beside me on the platform  our oldest residenthe whispered backhe died this morning  how old  ninetyfour he whispered  meantime the chairman with deep sobs in his voice continued  we debated in our committee whether or not we should have the lecture had it been a lecture of another character our position would have been less difficult by this time i began to feel like a criminal the case would have been different had the lecture been one that contained information or that was inspired by some serious purpose or that could have been of any benefit but this is not so we understand that this lecture which mr leacock has already given i believe twenty or thirty times in england  here he turned to me with a look of mild reproval while the silent audience deeply moved all looked at me as at a man who went around the country insulting the memory of the dead by giving a lecture thirty times  we understand though this we shall have an opportunity of testing for ourselves presently that mr leacocks lecture is not of a character whichhas not so to speak the kind of value in short is not a lecture of that class  here he paused and choked back a sob  had our poor friend been spared to us for another six years he would have rounded out the century but it was not to be for two or three years past he has noted that somehow his strength was failing that for some reason or other he was no longer what he had been last month he began to droop last week he began to sink speech left him last tuesday this morning he passed and he has gone now we trust in safety to where there are no lectures  the audience were now nearly in tears  the chairman made a visible effort towards firmness and control  but yet he continued our committee felt that in another sense it was our duty to go on with our arrangements i think ladies and gentlemen that the war has taught us all that it is always our duty to carry on no matter how hard it may be no matter with what reluctance we do it and whatever be the difficulties and the dangers we must carry on to the end for after all there is an end and by resolution and patience we can reach it  i will therefore invite mr leacock to deliver to us his humorous lecture the title of which i have forgotten but i understand it to be the same lecture which he has already given thirty or forty times in england  but contrast with this melancholy man the genial and pleasing person who introduced me all upside down to a metropolitan audience  he was so brisk so neat so sure of himself that it didnt seem possible that he could make any kind of a mistake i thought it unnecessary to coach him he seemed absolutely all right  it is a great pleasurehe said with a charming easy appearance of being entirely at home on the platformto welcome here tonight our distinguished canadian fellow citizen mr learoydhe turned half way towards me as he spoke with a sort of gesture of welcome admirably executed if only my name had been learoyd instead of leacock it would have been excellent  there are many of us he continued who have awaited mr learoyds coming with the most pleasant anticipations we seemed from his books to know him already as an old friend in fact i think i do not exaggerate when i tell mr learoyd that his name in our city has long been a household word i have very very great pleasure ladies and gentlemen in introducing to you mr learoyd  as far as i know that chairman never knew his error at the close of my lecture he said that he was sure that the audience were deeply indebted to mr learoyd and then with a few words of rapid genial apology buzzed off like a humming bird to other avocations but i have amply forgiven him anything for kindness and geniality it makes the whole of life smooth if that chairman ever comes to my home town he is hereby invited to lunch or dine with me as mr learoyd or under any name that he selects  such a man is after all in sharp contrast to the kind of chairman who has no native sense of the geniality that ought to accompany his office there is for example a type of man who thinks that the fitting way to introduce a lecturer is to say a few words about the finances of the society to which he is to lecture for money and about the difficulty of getting members to turn out to hear lectures  everybody has heard such a speech a dozen times but it is the paid lecturer sitting on the platform who best appreciates it it runs like this  now ladies and gentlemen before i invite the lecturer of the evening to address us there are a few words that i would like to say there are a good many members who are in arrears with their fees i am aware that these are hard times and it is difficult to collect money but at the same time the members ought to remember that the expenses of the society are very heavy the fees that are asked by the lecturers as i suppose you know have advanced very greatly in the last few years in fact i may say that they are becoming almost prohibitive  this discourse is pleasant hearing for the lecturer he can see the members who have not yet paid their annual dues eyeing him with hatred the chairman goes on  our finance committee were afraid at first that we could not afford to bring mr leacock to our society but fortunately through the personal generosity of two of our members who subscribed ten pounds each out of their own pocket we are able to raise the required sum     applause during which the lecturer sits looking and feeling    like the embodiment of the required sum  now ladies and gentlemen continues the chairman what i feel is that when we have members in the society who are willing to make this sacrificebecause it is a sacrifice ladies and gentlemenwe ought to support them in every way the members ought to think it their duty to turn out to the lectures i know that it is not an easy thing to do on a cold night like this evening it is hard i admit it is hard to turn out from the comfort of ones own fireside and come and listen to a lecture but i think that the members should look at it not as a matter of personal comfort but as a matter of duty towards this society we have managed to keep this society alive for fifteen years and though i dont say it in any spirit of boasting it has not been an easy thing to do it has required a good deal of pretty hard spade work by the committee well ladies and gentlemen i suppose you didnt come here to listen to me and perhaps i have said enough about our difficulties and troubles so without more ado this is always a favourite phrase with chairmen ill invite mr leacock to address the society oh just a word before i sit down will all those who are leaving before the end of the lecture kindly go out through the side door and step as quietly as possible mr leacock  anybody who is in the lecture business knows that that introduction is far worse than being called mr learoyd   when any lecturer goes across to england from this side of the water there is naturally a tendency on the part of the chairman to play upon this fact this is especially true in the case of a canadian like myself the chairman feels that the moment is fitting for one of those great imperial thoughts that bind the british empire together but sometimes the expression of the thought falls short of the full glory of the conception  witness this word for word introduction that was used against me by a clerical chairman in a quiet spot in the south of england  not so long ago ladies and gentlemen said the vicar we used to send out to canada various classes of our community to help build up that country we sent out our labourers we sent out our scholars and professors indeed we even sent out our criminals and now with a wave of his hand towards me they are coming back  there was no laughter an english audience is nothing if not literal and they are as polite as they are literal they understood that i was a reformed criminal and as such they gave me a hearty burst of applause  but there is just one thing that i would like to chronicle here in favour of the chairman and in gratitude for his assistance even at his worst he is far better than having no chairman at all over in england a great many societies and public bodies have adopted the plan of cutting out the chairman wearying of his faults they have forgotten the reasons for his existence and undertaken to do without him  the result is ghastly the lecturer steps up on to the platform alone and unaccompanied there is a feeble ripple of applause he makes his miserable bow and explains with as much enthusiasm as he can who he is the atmosphere of the thing is so cold that an arctic expedition isnt in it with it i found also the further difficulty that in the absence of the chairman very often the audience or a large part of it doesnt know who the lecturer is on many occasions i received on appearing a wild burst of applause under the impression that i was somebody else i have been mistaken in this way for mr briand then prime minister of france for charlie chaplin for mrs asquithbut stop i may get into a libel suit all i mean is that without a chairman we celebrities get terribly mixed up together  to one experience of my tour as a lecturer i shall always be able to look back with satisfaction i nearly had the pleasure of killing a man with laughing and this in the most literal sense american lecturers have often dreamed of doing this i nearly did it the man in question was a comfortable apoplecticlooking man with the kind of merry rubicund face that is seen in countries where they dont have prohibition he was seated near the back of the hall and was laughing uproariously all of a sudden i realised that something was happening the man had collapsed sideways on to the floor a little group of men gathered about him they lifted him up and i could see them carrying him out a silent and inert mass as in duty bound i went right on with my lecture but my heart beat high with satisfaction i was sure that i had killed him the reader may judge how high these hopes rose when a moment or two later a note was handed to the chairman who then asked me to pause for a moment in my lecture and stood up and asked is there a doctor in the audience a doctor rose and silently went out the lecture continued but there was no more laughter my aim had now become to kill another of them and they knew it they were aware that if they started laughing they might die in a few minutes a second note was handed to the chairman he announced very gravely a second doctor is wanted the lecture went on in deeper silence than ever all the audience were waiting for a third announcement it came a new message was handed to the chairman he rose and said if mr murchison the undertaker is in the audience will he kindly step outside  that man i regret to say got well  disappointing though it is to read it he recovered i sent back next morning from london a telegram of enquiry i did it in reality so as to have a proper proof of his death and received the answer patient doing well is sitting up in bed and reading lord haldanes relativity no danger of relapse     x have the english any sense of humour  it was understood that the main object of my trip to england was to find out whether the british people have any sense of humour no doubt the geographical society had this investigation in mind in not paying my expenses certainly on my return i was at once assailed with the question on all sides have they got a sense of humour even if it is only a rudimentary sense have they got it or have they not i propose therefore to address myself to the answer to this question  a peculiar interest always attaches to humour there is no quality of the human mind about which its possessor is more sensitive than the sense of humour a man will freely confess that he has no ear for music or no taste for fiction or even no interest in religion but i have yet to see the man who announces that he has no sense of humour in point of fact every man is apt to think himself possessed of an exceptional gift in this direction and that even if his humour does not express itself in the power either to make a joke or to laugh at one it none the less consists in a peculiar insight or inner light superior to that of other people  the same thing is true of nations each thinks its own humour of an entirely superior kind and either refuses to admit or admits reluctantly the humorous quality of other peoples the englishman may credit the frenchman with a certain light effervescence of mind which he neither emulates nor envies the frenchman may acknowledge that english literature shows here and there a sort of heavy playfulness but neither of them would consider that the humour of the other nation could stand a moments comparison with his own  yet oddly enough american humour stands as a conspicuous exception to this general rule a certain vogue clings to it ever since the spacious days of artemus ward and mark twain it has enjoyed an extraordinary reputation and this not only on our own continent but in england it was in a sense the english who discovered mark twain i mean it was they who first clearly recognised him as a man of letters of the foremost rank at a time when academic boston still tried to explain him away as a mere comic man of the west in the same way artemus ward is still held in affectionate remembrance in london and of the later generation mr dooley at least is a household word  this is so much the case that a sort of legend has grown around american humour it is presumed to be a superior article and to enjoy the same kind of preeminence as french cooking the russian ballet and italian organ grinding with this goes the converse supposition that the british people are inferior in humour that a joke reaches them only with great difficulty and that a british audience listens to humour in gloomy and unintelligent silence people still love to repeat the famous story of how john bright listened attentively to artemus wards lecture in london and then said gravely that he doubted many of the young mans statements and readers still remember mark twains famous parody of the discussion of his book by a woodenheaded reviewer of an english review  but the legend in reality is only a legend if the english are inferior to americans in humour i for one am at a loss to see where it comes in if there is anything on our continent superior in humour to punch i should like to see it if we have any more humorous writers in our midst than e v lucas and charles graves and owen seaman i should like to read what they write and if there is any audience capable of more laughter and more generous appreciation than an audience in london or bristol or aberdeen i should like to lecture to it  during my voyage of discovery in great britain i had very exceptional opportunities for testing the truth of these comparisons it was my good fortune to appear as an avowed humourist in all the great british cities i lectured as far north as aberdeen and as far south as brighton and bournemouth i travelled eastward to ipswich and westward into wales i spoke on serious subjects but with a joke or two in loco at the universities at business gatherings and at london dinners i watched lost in admiration the inspired merriment of the savages of adelphi terrace and in my moments of leisure i observed with a scientific eye the gaieties of the london revues as a result of which i say with conviction that speaking by and large the two communities are on the same level a harvard audience as i have reason gratefully to acknowledge is wonderful but an oxford audience is just as good a gathering of business men in a textile town in the midlands is just as heavy as a gathering of business men in decatur indiana but no heavier and an audience of english schoolboys as at rugby or at clifton is capable of a wild and sustained merriment not to be outdone from halifax to los angeles  there is however one vital difference between american and english audiences which would be apt to discourage at the outset any american lecturer who might go to england the english audiences from the nature of the way in which they have been brought together expect more in england they still associate lectures with information we dont our american lecture audiences are in nine cases out of ten organised by a womans club of some kind and drawn not from the working class but fromwhat shall we call itthe class that doesnt have to work or at any rate not too hard it is largely a social audience well educated without being highbrow and tolerant and kindly to a degree in fact what the people mainly want is to see the lecturer they have heard all about g k chesterton and hugh walpole and john drinkwater and so when these gentlemen come to town the womans club want to have a look at them just as the english people who are all crazy about animals flock to the zoo to look at a new giraffe they dont expect the giraffe to do anything in particular they want to see it thats all so with the american womans club audience after they have seen mr chesterton they ask one another as they come outjust as an incidental matterdid you understand his lecture and the answer is i cant say i did but there is no malice about it they can now go and say that they have seen mr chesterton thats worth two dollars in itself the nearest thing to this attitude of mind that i heard of in england was at the city temple in london where they have every week a huge gathering of about two thousand people to listen to a socalled popular lecture when i was there i was told that the person who had preceded me was lord haldane who had lectured on einsteins theory of relativity i said to the chairman surely this kind of audience couldnt understand a lecture like that he shook his head no he said they didnt understand it but they all enjoyed it  i dont mean to imply by what i said above that american lecture audiences do not appreciate good things or that the english lecturers who come to this continent are all giraffes on the contrary when the audience finds that chesterton and walpole and drinkwater in addition to being visible are also singularly interesting lecturers they are all the better pleased but this doesnt alter the fact that they have come primarily to see the lecturer  not so in england here a lecture outside london is organised on a much sterner footing the people are there for information the lecture is organised not by idle amiable charming women but by a body called with variations the philosophical society from experience i should define an english philosophical society as all the people in town who dont know anything about philosophy the academic and university classes are never there the audience is only of plainer folk in the united states and canada at any evening lecture a large sprinkling of the audience are in evening dress at an english lecture outside of london none of them are philosophy is not to be wooed in such a garb nor are there the same commodious premises the same bright lights and the same atmosphere of gaiety as at a society lecture in america on the contrary the setting is a gloomy one in england in winter night begins at four in the afternoon in the manufacturing towns of the midlands and the north which is where the philosophical societies flourish there is always a drizzling rain and wet slop underfoot a bedraggled poverty in the streets and a dimness of lights that contrasts with the glare of light in an american town there is no visible sign in the town that a lecture is to happen no placards no advertisements nothing the lecturer is conducted by a chairman through a side door in a dingy building the institute established 1840 and then all of a sudden in a huge dim hallthere sits the philosophical society there are a thousand of them but they sit as quiet as a prayer meeting they are waiting to be fedon information  now i dont mean to say that the philosophical society are not a good audience in their own way theyre all right once the philosophical society has decided that a lecture is humorous they do not stint their laughter i have had many times the satisfaction of seeing a philosophical society swept away from its moorings and tossing in a sea of laughter as generous and as wholehearted as anything we ever see in america  but they are not so willing to begin with us the chairman has only to say to the gaily dressed members of the ladies fortnightly club well ladies im sure we are all looking forward very much to mr walpoles lecture and at once there is a ripple of applause and a responsive expression on a hundred charming faces  not so the philosophical society of the midlands the chairman rises he doesnt call for silence it is there thick we have with us tonight he says a man whose name is well known to the philosophical society here he looks at his card mr stephen leacock complete silence he is a professor of political economy at here he turns to me and says which college did you say i answer quite audibly in the silence at mcgill he is at mcgill says the chairman more silence i dont suppose however ladies and gentlemen that hes come here to talk about political economy this is meant as a jest but the audience takes it as a threat however ladies and gentlemen you havent come here to listen to me this evokes applause the first of the evening so without more ado the man always has the impression that theres been a lot of ado but i never see any of it ill now introduce mr leacock complete silence  nothing of which means the least harm it only implies that the philosophical society are true philosophers in accepting nothing unproved they are like the man from missouri they want to be shown and undoubtedly it takes a little time therefore to rouse them i remember listening with great interest to sir michael sadler who is possessed of a very neat wit introducing me at leeds he threw three jokes one after the other into the heart of a huge silent audience without effect he might as well have thrown soap bubbles but the fourth joke broke fair and square like a bomb in the middle of the philosophical society and exploded them into convulsions the process is very like what artillery men tell of bracketing the object fired at and then landing fairly on it  in what i have just written about audiences i have purposely been using the word english and not british for it does not in the least apply to the scotch there is for a humorous lecturer no better audience in the world than a scotch audience the old standing joke about the scotch sense of humour is mere nonsense yet one finds it everywhere  so youre going to try to take humour up to scotland the most eminent author in england said to me well the lord help you youd better take an axe with you to open their skulls there is no other way how this legend started i dont know but i think it is because the english are jealous of the scotch they got into the union with them in 1707 and they cant get out the scotch dont want home rule or swa raj or dominion status or anything they just want the english when they want money they go to london and make it if they want literary fame they sell their books to the english and to prevent any kind of political trouble they take care to keep the cabinet well filled with scotchmen the english for shames sake cant get out of the union so they retaliate by saying that the scotch have no sense of humour but theres nothing in it one has only to ask any of the theatrical people and they will tell you that the audiences in glasgow and edinburgh are the best in the british islespossess the best taste and the best ability to recognise what is really good  the reason for this lies i think in the wellknown fact that the scotch are a truly educated people not educated in the mere sense of having been made to go to school but in the higher sense of having acquired an interest in books and a respect for learning in england the higher classes alone possess this the working class as a whole know nothing of it but in scotland the attitude is universal and the more i reflect upon the subject the more i believe that what counts most in the appreciation of humour is not nationality but the degree of education enjoyed by the individual concerned i do not think that there is any doubt that educated people possess a far wider range of humour than the uneducated class some people of course get overeducated and become hopelessly academic the word highbrow has been invented exactly to fit the case the sense of humour in the highbrow has become atrophied or to vary the metaphor it is submerged or buried under the accumulated strata of his education on the top soil of which flourishes a fine growth of conceit but even in the highbrow the educated appreciation of humour is thereaway down generally if one attempts to amuse a highbrow he will resent it as if the process were beneath him or perhaps the intellectual jealousy and touchiness with which he is always overcharged will lead him to retaliate with a pointless story from plato but if the highbrow is right off his guard and has no jealousy in his mind you may find him roaring with laughter and wiping his spectacles with his sides shaking and see him converted as by magic into the merry clever little schoolboy that he was thirty years ago before his education ossified him  but with the illiterate and the rustic no such process is possible his sense of humour may be there as a sense but the mechanism for setting it in operation is limited and rudimentary only the broadest and most elementary forms of joke can reach him the magnificent mechanism of the art of words is quite literally a sealed book to him here and there indeed a form of fun is found so elementary in its nature and yet so excellent in execution that it appeals to all alike to the illiterate and to the highbrow to the peasant and the professor such for example are the antics of mr charles chaplin or the depiction of mr jiggs by the pencil of george mcmanus but such cases are rare as a rule the cheap fun that excites the rustic to laughter is execrable to the man of education  in the light of what i have said before it follows that the individuals that are findable in every english or american audience are much the same all those who lecture or act are well aware that there are certain types of people that are always to be seen somewhere in the hall some of these belong to the general class of discouraging people they listen in stolid silence no light of intelligence ever gleams on their faces no response comes from their eyes  i find for example that wherever i go there is always seated in the audience about three seats from the front a silent man with a big motionless face like a melon he is always there i have seen that man in every town or city from richmond indiana to bournemouth in hampshire he haunts me i get to expect him i feel like nodding to him from the platform and i find that all other lecturers have the same experience wherever they go the man with the big face is always there he never laughs no matter if the people all round him are convulsed with laughter he sits there like a rockor no like a toadimmovable what he thinks i dont know why he comes to lectures i cannot guess once and once only i spoke to him or rather he spoke to me i was coming out from the lecture and found myself close to him in the corridor it had been a rather gloomy evening the audience had hardly laughed at all and i know nothing sadder than a humorous lecture without laughter the man with the big face finding himself beside me turned and said some of them people werent getting that tonight his tone of sympathy seemed to imply that he had got it all himself if so he must have swallowed it whole without a sign but i have since thought that this man with the big face may have his own internal form of appreciation this much however i know to look at him from the platform is fatal one sustained look into his big motionless face and the lecturer would be lost inspiration would die upon ones lipsthe basilisk isnt in it with him  personally i no sooner see the man with the big face than instinctively i turn my eyes away i look round the hall for another man that i know is always there the opposite type the little man with the spectacles there he sits good soul about twelve rows back his large spectacles beaming with appreciation and his quick face anticipating every point i imagine him to be by trade a minor journalist or himself a writer of sorts but with not enough of success to have spoiled him  there are other people always there too there is the old lady who thinks the lecture improper it doesnt matter how moral it is shes out for impropriety and she can find it anywhere then there is another very terrible man against whom all american lecturers in england should be warnedthe man who is leaving on the 9 pm train english railways running into suburbs and nearby towns have a schedule which is expressly arranged to have the principal train leave before the lecture ends hence the 9pmtrain man he sits right near the front and at ten minutes to nine he gathers up his hat coat and umbrella very deliberately rises with great calm and walks firmly away his air is that of a man who has stood all that he can and can bear no more till one knows about this man and the others who rise after him it is very disconcerting at first i thought i must have said something to reflect upon the royal family but presently the lecturer gets to understand that it is only the nineoclock train and that all the audience know about it then its all right its just like the people rising and stretching themselves after the seventh innings in baseball  in all that goes above i have been emphasising the fact that the british and the american sense of humour are essentially the same thing but there are of course peculiar differences of form and peculiar preferences of material that often make them seem to diverge widely  by this i mean that each community has within limits its own particular ways of being funny and its own particular conception of a joke thus a scotchman likes best a joke which he has all to himself or which he shares reluctantly with a few the thing is too rich to distribute the american loves particularly as his line of joke an anecdote with the point all concentrated at the end and exploding in a phrase the englishman loves best as his joke the narration of something that actually did happen and that depends of course for its point on its reality  there are plenty of minor differences too in point of mere form and very naturally each community finds the particular form used by the others less pleasing than its own in fact for this very reason each people is apt to think its own humour the best  thus on our side of the atlantic to cite our own faults first we still cling to the supposed humour of bad spelling we have indeed told ourselves a thousand times over that bad spelling is not funny but is very tiresome yet it is no sooner laid aside and buried than it gets resurrected i suppose the real reason is that it is funny at least to our eyes when bill nye spells wife with yph we cant help being amused now bill nyes bad spelling had absolutely no point to it except its oddity at times it was extremely funny but as a mode it led easily to widespread and pointless imitation it was the kind of thinglike poetrythat anybody can do badly it was most deservedly abandoned with execration no american editor would print it today but witness the new and excellent effect produced with bad spelling by mr ring w lardner here however the case is altered it is not the falseness of mr lardners spelling that is the amusing feature of it but the truth of it when he writes dear friend al i would of rote sooner etc he is truer to actual sound and intonation than the lexicon the mode is excellent but the imitations will soon debase it into such bad coin that it will fail to pass current in england however the humour of bad spelling does not and has never i believe flourished bad spelling is only used in england as an attempt to reproduce phonetically a dialect it is not intended that the spelling itself should be thought funny but the dialect that it represents but the effect on the whole is tiresome a little dose of the humour of lancashire or somerset or yorkshire pronunciation may be all right but a whole page of it looks like the gibbering of chimpanzees set down on paper  in america also we run perpetually to the supposed humour of slang a form not used in england if we were to analyse what we mean by slang i think it would be found to consist of the introduction of new metaphors or new forms of language of a metaphorical character strained almost to the breaking point sometimes we do it with a single word when some genius discovers that a hat is really only a lid placed on top of a human being straightway the word lid goes rippling over the continent similarly a woman becomes a skirt and so on ad infinitum  these words presently either disappear or else retain a permanent place being slang no longer no doubt half our words if not all of them were once slang even within our own memory we can see the whole process carried through cinch once sounded funny it is now standard americanenglish but other slang is made up of descriptive phrases at the best these slang phrases areat least we think they areextremely funny but they are funniest when newly coined and it takes a master hand to coin them well for a supreme example of wild vagaries of language used for humour one might take o henrys gentle grafter but here the imitation is as easy as it is tiresome the invention of pointless slang phrases without real suggestion or merit is one of our most familiar forms of factorymade humour now the english people are apt to turn away from the whole field of slang in the first place it puzzles themthey dont know whether each particular word or phrase is a sort of idiom already known to americans or something as with o henry never said before and to be analysed for its own sake the result is that with the english public the great mass of american slang writing genius apart doesnt go i have even found english people of undoubted literary taste repelled from such a master as o henry now read by millions in england because at first sight they get the impression that it is all american slang  another point in which american humour or at least the form which it takes differs notably from british is in the matter of story telling it was a great surprise to me the first time i went out to a dinner party in london to find that my host did not open the dinner by telling a funny story that the guests did not then sit silent trying to think of another that some one did not presently break silence by saying i heard a good one the other dayand so forth and i realised that in this respect english society is luckier than ours  it is my candid opinion that no man ought to be allowed to tell a funny story or anecdote without a license we insist rightly enough that every taxidriver must have a license and the same principle should apply to anybody who proposes to act as a raconteur telling a story is a difficult thingquite as difficult as driving a taxi and the risks of failure and accident and the unfortunate consequences of such to the public if not exactly identical are at any rate analogous  this is a point of view not generally appreciated a man is apt to think that just because he has heard a good story he is able and entitled to repeat it he might as well undertake to do a snake dance merely because he has seen madame pavlowa do one the point of a story is apt to lie in the telling or at least to depend upon it in a high degree certain stories it is true depend so much on the final point or nub as we americans call it that they are almost foolproof but even these can be made so prolix and tiresome can be so messed up with irrelevant detail that the general effect is utter weariness relieved by a kind of shock at the end let me illustrate what i mean by a story with a nub or point i will take one of the best known so as to make no claim to originalityfor example the famous anecdote of the man who wanted to be put off at buffalo here it is  a man entered a sleepingcar and said to the porter at what time do we get to buffalo the porter answered at halfpast three in the morning sir all right the man said now i want to get off at buffalo and i want you to see that i get off i sleep heavily and im hard to rouse but you just make me wake up dont mind what i say dont pay attention if i kick about it just put me off do you see all right sir said the porter the man got into his berth and fell fast asleep he never woke or moved till it was broad daylight and the train was a hundred miles beyond buffalo he called angrily to the porter see here you didnt i tell you to put me off at buffalo the porter looked at him aghast well i declare to goodness boss he exclaimed if it wasnt you who was that man that i threw off this train at halfpast three at buffalo  now this story is as nearly foolproof as can be and yet it is amazing how badly it can be messed up by a person with a special gift for mangling a story he does it something after this fashion  there was a fellow got on the train one night and he had a berth reserved for buffalo at least the way i heard it it was buffalo though i guess as a matter of fact you might tell it on any other town just as wellor no i guess he didnt have his berth reserved he got on the train and asked the porter for a reservation for buffaloor anyway that part doesnt mattersay that he had a berth for buffalo or any other place and the porter came through and said do you want an early callor no he went to the porterthat was itand said  but stop the rest of the story becomes a mere painful waiting for the end  of course the higher type of funny story is the one that depends for its amusing quality not on the final point or not solely on it but on the wording and the narration all through this is the way in which a story is told by a comedian or a person who is a raconteur in the real sense when sir harry lauder narrates an incident the telling of it is funny from beginning to end when some lesser person tries to repeat it afterwards there is nothing left but the final point the rest is weariness  as a consequence most storytellers are driven to telling stories that depend on the point or nub and not on the narration the storyteller gathers these up till he is equipped with a sort of little repertory of fun by which he hopes to surround himself with social charm in america especially by which i mean here the united states and canada but not mexico we suffer from the storytelling habit as far as i am able to judge english society is not pervaded and damaged by the storytelling habit as much as is society in the united states and canada on our side of the atlantic storytelling at dinners and on every other social occasion has become a curse in every phase of social and intellectual life one is haunted by the funny anecdote any one who has ever attended a canadian or american banquet will recall the solemn way in which the chairman rises and says gentlemen it is to me a very great pleasure and a very great honour to preside at this annual dinner there was an old darky once and so forth when he concludes he says i will now call upon the rev dr stooge head of the provincial university haroe english any sense of humour to propose the toast our dominion dr stooge rises amid great applause and with great solemnity begins there were once two irishmen and so on to the end but in london england it is apparently not so not long ago i had the pleasure of meeting at dinner a member of the government i fully anticipated that as a member of the government he would be expected to tell a funny story about an old darky just as he would on our side of the water in fact i should have supposed that he could hardly get into the government unless he did tell a funny story of some sort but all through dinner the cabinet minister never said a word about either a methodist minister or a commercial traveller or an old darky or two irishmen or any of the stock characters of the american repertory on another occasion i dined with a bishop of the church i expected that when the soup came he would say there was an old darky after which i should have had to listen with rapt attention and when he had finished without any pause rejoin there were a couple of irishmen once and so on but the bishop never said a word of the sort  i can further for the sake of my fellowmen in canada and the united states who may think of going to england vouchsafe the following facts if you meet a director of the bank of england he does not say i am very glad to meet you sit down there was a mule in arkansas once etc how they do their banking without that mule i dont know but they manage it i can certify also that if you meet the proprietor of a great newspaper he will not begin by saying there was a scotchman once in fact in england you can mingle freely in general society without being called upon either to produce a funny story or to suffer from one  i dont mean to deny that the american funny story in capable hands is amazingly funny and that it does brighten up human intercourse but the real trouble lies not in the fun of the story but in the painful waiting for the point to come and in the strained and anxious silence that succeeds it each person around the dinner table is trying to think of another there is a dreadful pause the hostess puts up a prayer that some one may think of another then at last to the relief of everybody some one says i heard a story the other dayi dont know whether youve heard it and the grateful cries of no no go ahead show how great the tension has been  nine times out of ten the people have heard the story before and ten times out of nine the teller damages it in the telling but his hearers are grateful to him for having saved them from the appalling mantle of silence and introspection which had fallen upon the table for the trouble is that when once two or three stories have been told it seems to be a point of honour not to subside into mere conversation it seems rude when a storyteller has at last reached the triumphant ending and climax of the mule from arkansas it seems impolite to follow it up by saying i see that germany refuses to pay the indemnity it cant be done either the mule or the indemnityone cant have both  the english i say have not developed the american custom of the funny story as a form of social intercourse but i do not mean to say that they are sinless in this respect as i see it they hand round in general conversation something nearly as bad in the form of what one may call the literal anecdote or personal experience by this i refer to the habit of narrating some silly little event that has actually happened to them or in their sight which they designate as screamingly funny and which was perhaps very funny when it happened but which is not the least funny in the telling the american funny story is imaginary it never happened somebody presumably once made it up it is fiction thus there must once have been some great palpitating brain some glowing imagination which invented the story of the man who was put off at buffalo but the english screamingly funny story is not imaginary it really did happen it is an actual personal experience in short it is not fiction but history  i thinkif one may say it with all respectthat in english society girls and women are especially prone to narrate these personal experiences as contributions to general merriment rather than the men the english girl has a sort of traditional idea of being amusing the english man cares less about it he prefers facts to fancy every time and as a rule is free from that desire to pose as a humourist which haunts the american mind so it comes about that most of the screamingly funny stories are told in english society by the women thus the counterpart of put me off at buffalo done into english would be something like this we were so amused the other night in the sleepingcar going to buffalo there was the most amusing old negro making the beds a perfect scream you know and he kept insisting that if we wanted to get up at buffalo we must all go to bed at nine oclock he positively wouldnt let us sit upi mean to say it was killing the way he wanted to put us to bed we all roared  please note that roar at the end of the english personal anecdote it is the sign that indicates that the story is over when you are assured by the narrators that all the persons present roared or simply roared then you can be quite sure that the humorous incident is closed and that laughter is in place  now as a matter of fact the scene with the darky porter may have been when it really happened most amusing but not a trace of it gets over in the story there is nothing but the bare assertion that it was screamingly funny or simply killing but the english are such an honest people that when they say this sort of thing they believe one another and they laugh  but after all why should people insist on telling funny stories at all why not be content to buy the works of some really firstclass humourist and read them aloud in proper humility of mind without trying to emulate them either that or talk theology  on my own side of the atlantic i often marvel at our extraordinary tolerance and courtesy to one another in the matter of storytelling i have never seen a bad storyteller thrown forcibly out of the room or even stopped and warned we listen with the most wonderful patience to the worst of narration the story is always without any interest except in the unknown point that will be brought in later but this until it does come is no more interesting than tomorrows breakfast yet for some reason or other we permit this storytelling habit to invade and damage our whole social life the english always criticise this and think they are absolutely right to my mind in their social life they give the funny story its proper place and room and no more that is to sayif ten people draw their chairs in to the dinner table and somebody really has just heard a story and wants to tell it there is no reason against it if he says oh by the way i heard a good story today it is just as if he said oh by the way i heard a piece of news about john smith it is quite admissible as conversation but he doesnt sit down to try to think along with nine other rival thinkers of all the stories that he had heard and that makes all the difference  the scotch by the way resemble us in liking to tell and hear stories but they have their own line they like the stories to be grim dealing in a jocose way with death and funerals the story begins will the reader kindly turn it into scotch pronunciation for himself there was a sandy macdonald had died and the wife had the body all laid out for burial and dressed up very fine in his best suit etc now for me that beginning is enough to me that is not a story but a tragedy i am so sorry for mrs macdonald that i cant think of anything else but i think the explanation is that the scotch are essentially such a devout people and live so closely within the shadow of death itself that they may without irreverence or pain jest where our lips would falter or else perhaps they dont care a cuss whether sandy macdonald died or not take it either way  but i am tired of talking of our faults let me turn to the more pleasing task of discussing those of the english in the first place and as a minor matter of form i think that english humour suffers from the tolerance afforded to the pun for some reason english people find puns funny we dont here and there no doubt a pun may be made that for some exceptional reason becomes a matter of genuine wit but the great mass of the english puns that disfigure the press every week are mere pointless verbalisms that to the american mind cause nothing but weariness  but even worse than the use of puns is the peculiar pedantry not to say priggishness that haunts the english expression of humour to make a mistake in a latin quotation or to stick on a wrong ending to a latin word is not really an amusing thing to an ancient roman perhaps it might be but then we are not ancient romans indeed i imagine that if an ancient roman could be resurrected all the latin that any of our classical scholars can command would be about equivalent to the french of a cockney waiter on a channel steamer yet one finds even the immortal punch citing recently as a very funny thing a newspaper misquotation of urbis et orbis instead of urbi et orbos or the other way round i forget which perhaps there was some further point in it that i didnt see but anyway it wasnt funny neither is it funny if a person instead of saying archimedes says archimeeds why shouldnt it have been archimeeds the english scale of values in these things is all wrong very few englishmen can pronounce chicago properly and they think nothing of that but if a person mispronounces the name of a greek village of what o henry called the year bc it is supposed to be excruciatingly funny  i think in reality that this is only a part of the overdone scholarship that haunts so much of english writingnot the best of it but a lot of it it is too full of allusions and indirect references to all sorts of extraneous facts the english writer finds it hard to say a plain thing in a plain way he is too anxious to show in every sentence what a fine scholar he is he carries in his mind an accumulated treasure of quotations allusions and scraps and tags of history and into this like jack horner he must needs stick in his thumb and pull out a plum instead of saying it is a fine morning he prefers to write this is a day of which one might say with the melancholy jacques it is a fine morning  hence it is that many plain american readers find english humour highbrow just as the english are apt to find our humour slangy and cheap so we find theirs academic and heavy but the difference after all is of far less moment than might be supposed it lies only on the surface fundamentally as i said in starting the humour of the two peoples is of the same kind and on an equal level  there is one form of humour which the english have more or less to themselves nor do i envy it to them i mean the merriment that they appear able to draw out of the criminal courts to me a criminal court is a place of horror and a murder trial the last word in human tragedy the english criminal courts i know only from the newspapers and ask no nearer acquaintance but according to the newspapers the courts especially when a murder case is on are enlivened by flashes of judicial and legal humour that seem to meet with general approval the current reports in the press run like this  the prisoner who is being tried on a charge of having burned his wife to death in a furnace was placed in the dock and gave his name as evans did he say evans or ovens asked mr justice blank the court broke into a roar in which all joined but the prisoner or take this how many years did you say you served the last time asked the judge three said the prisoner well twice three is six said the judge laughing till his sides shook so ill give you six years  i dont say that those are literal examples of the humour of the criminal court but they are close to it for a judge to joke is as easy as it is for a schoolmaster to joke in his class his unhappy audience has no choice but laughter no doubt in point of intellect the english judges and the bar represent the most highly trained product of the british empire but when it comes to fun they ought not to pit themselves against the unhappy prisoner  why not take a man of their own size for true amusement mr charles chaplin or mr leslie henson could give them sixty in a hundred i even think i could myself  one final judgment however might with due caution be hazarded i do not think that on the whole the english are quite as fond of humour as we are i mean they are not so willing to welcome at all times the humorous point of view as we are in america the english are a serious people with many serious things to think offootball horse racing dogs fish and many other concerns that demand much national thought they have so many national preoccupations of this kind that they have less need for jokes than we have they have higher things to talk about whereas on our side of the water except when the worlds series is being played we have few if any truly national topics  and yet i know that many people in england would exactly reverse this last judgment and say that the americans are a desperately serious people that in a sense is true any american who takes up with an idea such as new thought psychoanalysis or eating sawdust or any uplift of the kind becomes desperately lopsided in his seriousness and as a very large number of us cultivate new thought or practise breathing exercises or eat sawdust no doubt the english visitors think us a desperate lot  anyway its an ill business to criticise another peoples shortcomings what i said at the start was that the british are just as humorous as are the americans or the canadians or any of us across the atlantic and for greater certainty i repeat it at the end
