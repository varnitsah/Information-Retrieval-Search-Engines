heaven     book i the oblate    chapter i nomen et omen   in seeking other than in myselfas men willthe causes of my tribulations i have often inclined to lay the blame of much of the ill that befell me and the ill that in my sinful life i did to others upon those who held my mother at the baptismal font and concerted that she should bear the name of monica  there are in life many things which in themselves seeming to the vulgar and the heedless to be trivial and without consequence may yet be causes pregnant of terrible effects mainsprings of destiny itself amid such portentous trifles i would number the names so heedlessly bestowed upon us  it surprises me that in none of the philosophic writings of the learned scholars of antiquity can i find that this matter of names has been touched upon much less given the importance of which i account it to be deserving  possibly it is because no one of them ever suffered as i have suffered from the consequences of a name had it but been so they might in their weighty and impressive manner have set down a lesson on the subject and so relieved mewho am allconscious of my shortcomings in this directionfrom the necessity of repairing that omission out of my own experience  let it then even at this late hour be considered what a subtle influence for good or ill what a very mould of character may lie within a name  to the dull clod of earth perhaps or again to the truly strongminded nature that is beyond such influences it can matter little that he be called alexander or achilles and once there was a man named judas who fell so far short of the noble associations of that name that he has changed for all time the very sound and meaning of it  but to him who has been endowed with imaginationthat greatest boon and greatest affliction of mankindor whose nature is such as to crave for models the name he bears may become a thing portentous by the images it conjures up of some mighty dead who bore it erstwhile and whose life inspires to emulation  whatever may be accounted the general value of this premiss at least as it concerns my mother i shall hope to prove it apt  they named her monica why the name was chosen i have never learnt but i do not conceive that there was any reason for the choice other than the taste of her parents in the matter of sounds it is a pleasing enough name euphoniously considered and beyond thatas is so commonly the caseno considerations were taken into account  to her however at once imaginative and of a feeble and dependent spirit the name was fateful st monica was made the special object of her devotions in girlhood and remained so later when she became a wife the life of st monica was the most soiled and fingered portion of an old manuscript collection of the life histories of a score or so of saints that was one of her dearest possessions to render herself worthy of the name she bore to model her life upon that of the sainted woman who had sorrowed and rejoiced so much in her famous offspring became the obsession of my mothers soul and but that st monica had wed and borne a son i do not believe that my mother would ever have adventured herself within the bonds of wedlock  how often in the stressful stormy hours of my most unhappy youth did i not wish that she had preferred the virginal life of the cloister and thus spared me the heavy burden of an existence which her unholy and mistaken saintliness went so near to laying waste  i like to think that in the days when my father wooed her she forgot for a spell in the strong arms of that fierce ghibelline the pattern upon which it had become her wont to weave her life so that in all that drab sackcloth tissue there was embroidered at least one warm and brilliant little wedge of colour so that in all that desert waste in all that parched aridity of her existence there was at least one little patch of gardenland fragrant fruitful and cool  i like to think it for at best such a spell must have been brief indeed and for that i pity heri who once blamed her so very bitterly before ever i was born it must have ceased whilst still she bore me she put from her lips the cup that holds the warm and potent wine of life and turned her once more to her fasting her contemplations and her prayers  that was in the year in which the battle of pavia was fought and won by the emperor my father who had raised a condotta to lend a hand in the expulsion of the french was left for dead upon that glorious field afterwards he was found still living but upon the very edge and border of eternity and when the news of it was borne to my mother i have little doubt but that she imagined it to be a visitationa punishment upon her for having strayed for that brief season of her adolescence from the narrow flinty path that she had erst claimed to tread in the footsteps of holy monica  how much the love of my father may still have swayed her i do not know but to me it seems that in what next she did there was more of duty more of penitence more of reparation for the sin of having been a woman as god made her than of love indeed i almost know this to be so in delicate health as she was she bade her people prepare a litter for her and so she had herself carried into piacenza to the church of st augustine there having confessed and received the sacrament upon her knees before a minor altar consecrated to st monica she made solemn vow that if my fathers life was spared she would devote the unborn child she carried to the service of god and holy church  two months thereafter word was brought her that my father his recovery by now wellnigh complete was making his way home  on the morrow was i borna votive offering an oblate ere yet i had drawn the breath of life  it has oft diverted me to conjecture what would have chanced had i been born a girlsince that could have afforded her no proper parallel in the circumstance that i was a boy i have no faintest doubt but that she saw a sign for she was given to seeing signs in the slightest and most natural happenings it was as it should be it was as it had been with the sainted monica in whose ways she strove poor thing to walk monica had borne a son and he had been named augustine it was very well my name too should be augustine that i might walk in the ways of that other augustine that great theologian whose mothers name was monica  and even as the influence of her name had been my mothers guide so was the influence of my name to exert its sway upon me it was made to do so ere i could read for myself the life of that great saintwith such castrations as my tender years demandedwas told me and repeated until i knew by heart its every incident and act anon his writings were my schoolbooks his de civitate dei and de vita beata were the paps at which i suckled my earliest mental nourishment  and even today after all the tragedy and sin and turbulence of my life that was intended to have been so different it is from his confessions that i have gathered inspiration to set down my ownalthough betwixt the two you may discern little indeed that is comparable  i was prenatally made a votive offering for the preservation of my fathers life for his restoration to my mother safe and sound that restoration she had as you have seen and yet had she been other than she was she must have accounted herself cheated of her bargain in the end for betwixt my father and my mother i became from my earliest years a subject of contentions that drove them far asunder and set them almost in enmity the one against the other  i was his only son heir to the noble lordships of mondolfo and carmina was it likely then that he should sacrifice me willingly to the seclusion of the cloister whilst our lordship passed into the hands of our renegade guelphic cousin cosimo danguissola of codogno  i can picture his outbursts at the very thought of it i can hear him reasoning upbraiding storming but he was as an ocean of energy hurling himself against the impassive rock of my mothers pietistic obstinacy she had vowed me to the service of holy church and she would suffer tribulation and death so that her vow should be fulfilled and hers was a manner against which that strong man my father never could prevail she would stand before him whitefaced and mute never presuming to return an answer to his pleading or to enter into argument  i have vowed she would say just once and thereafter avoiding his fiery glance she would bow her head meekly fold her hands the very incarnation of longsuffering and martyrdom  anon as the storm of his anger crashed about her two glistening lines would appear upon her pallid face and her tearshorrid silent weeping that brought no trace of emotion to her countenanceshowered down at that he would fling out of her presence and away cursing the day in which he had mated with a fool  his hatred of these moods of hers of the vow she had made which bade fair to deprive him of his son drove him ere long to hatred of the cause of it all a ghibelline by inheritance he was not long in becoming an utter infidel at war with rome and the pontifical sway nor was he one to content himself with passive enmity he must be up and doing seeking the destruction of the thing he hated and so it befell that upon the death of pope clement the second medici pontiff profiting by the weak condition from which the papal army had not yet recovered since the emperors invasion and the sack of rome my father raised an army and attempted to shatter the ancient yoke which julius ii had imposed upon parma and piacenza when he took them from the state of milan  a little lad of seven was i at the time and well do i remember the martial stir and bustle there was about our citadel of mondolfo the armed multitudes that thronged the fortress that was our home or drilled and manoeuvred upon the green plains beyond the river  i was all wonderstricken and fascinated by the sight my blood was quickened by the brazen notes of their trumpets and to balance a pike in my hands was to procure me the oddest and most exquisite thrills that i had known but my mother perceiving with alarm the delight afforded me by such warlike matters withdrew me so that i might see as little as possible of it all  and there followed scenes between her and my father of which hazy impressions linger in my memory no longer was she a mute statue enduring with fearful stoicism his harsh upbraidings she was turned into a suppliant now fierce now lachrymose by her prayers by her prophecies of the evil that must attend his ungodly aims she strove with all her poor feeble might to turn him from the path of revolt to which he had set his foot  and he would listen now in silence his face grim and sardonic and when from very weariness the flow of her inspired oratory began to falter he would deliver ever the same answer  it is you who have driven me to this and this is no more than a beginning you have made a vowan outrageous votive offering of something that is not yours to bestow that vow you cannot break you say be it so but i must seek a remedy elsewhere to save my son from the church to which you would doom him i will ere i have done tear down the church and make an end of it in italy  and at that she would shrivel up before him with a little moan of horror taking her poor white face in her hands  blasphemer she would cry in mingled terror and aversion and upon that wordthe amen to all their conferences in those last days they spent togethershe would turn and dragging me with her all stunned and bewildered by something beyond my understanding she would hurry me to the chapel of the citadel and there before the high altar prostrate herself and spend long hours in awful sobbing intercessions  and so the gulf between them widened until the day of his departure  i was not present at their parting what farewells may have been spoken between them what premonitions may have troubled one or the other that they were destined never to meet again i do not know  i remember being rudely awakened one dark morning early in the year and lifted from my bed by arms to whose clasp i never failed to thrill close to mine was pressed a hot dark shaven hawkface a pair of great eyes humid with tears considered me passionately then a ringing voicethat commanding voice that was my fathersspoke to falcone the manatarms who attended him and who ever acted as his equerry  shall we take him with us to the wars falcone  my little arms went round his neck and tightened there convulsively until the steel rim of his gorget bit into them  take me i sobbed take me  he laughed for answer with something of exultation in his voice he swung me to his shoulder and held me poised there looking up at me and then he laughed again  dost hear the whelp he cried to falcone still with his milkteeth in his head and already does he yelp for battle  then he looked up at me again and swore one of his great oaths  i can trust you son of mine he laughed theyll never make a shaveling of you when your thews are grown it will not be on thuribles theyll spend their strength or im a liar else be patient yet awhile and we shall ride together never doubt it  with that he pulled me down again to kiss me and he clasped me to his breast so that the studs of his armour remained stamped upon my tender flesh after he had departed  the next instant he was gone and i lay weeping a very lonely little child  but in the revolt that he led he had not reckoned upon the might and vigour of the new farnese pontiff he had conceived perhaps that one pope must be as supine as another and that paul iii would prove no more redoubtable than clement viii to his bitter cost did he discover his mistake beyond the po he was surprised by the pontifical army under ferrante orsini and there his force was cut to pieces  my father himself escaped and with him some other gentlemen of piacenza notably one of the scions of the great house of pallavicini who took a wound in the leg which left him lame for life so that ever after he was known as pallavicini il zopo  they were all under the popes ban outlaws with a price upon the head of each hunted and harried from state to state by the papal emissaries so that my father never more dared set foot in mondolfo or indeed within the state of piacenza which had been rudely punished for the insubordination it had permitted to be reared upon its soil  and mondolfo went near to suffering confiscation assuredly it would have suffered it but for the influence exerted on my mothers and my own behalf by her brother the powerful cardinal of san paulo in carcere seconded by that guelphic cousin of my fathers cosimo danguissola who after me was heir to mondolfo and had therefore good reason not to see it confiscated to the holy see  thus it fell out that we were left in peace and not made to suffer from my fathers rebellion for that he himself should suffer when taken but taken he never was from time to time we had news of him now he was in venice now in milan now in naples but never long in any place for his safetys sake and then one night six years later a scarred and grizzled veteran coming none knew whence dropped from exhaustion in the courtyard of our citadel whither he had struggled some went to minister to him and amongst these there was a groom who recognized him  it is messer falcone he cried and ran to bear the news to my mother with whom i was at table at the time with us too was fra gervasio our chaplain  it was grim news that old falcone brought us he had never quitted my father in those six weary years of wandering until now that my father was beyond the need of his or any others service  there had been a rising and a bloody battle at perugia falcone informed us an attempt had been made to overthrow the rule there of pier luigi farnese duke of castro the popes own abominable son for some months my father had been enjoying the shelter of the perugians and he had repaid their hospitality by joining them and bearing arms with them in the illstarred blow they struck for liberty they had been crushed in the encounter by the troops of pier luigi and my father had been among the slain  and well was it for him that he came by so fine and merciful an end thought i when i had heard the tale of horrors that had been undergone by the unfortunates who had fallen into the hands of farnese  my mother heard him to the end without any sign of emotion she sat there cold and impassive as a thing of marble what time fra gervasiowho was my fathers fosterbrother as you shall presently learn more fullysank his head upon his arm and wept like a child to hear the piteous tale of it and whether from force of example whether from the memories that came to me so poignantly in that moment of a fine strong man with a brown shaven face and a jovial mighty voice who had promised me that one day we should ride together i fell aweeping too  when the tale was done my mother coldly gave orders that falcone be cared for and went to pray taking me with her  oftentimes since have i wondered what was the tenour of her prayers that night were they for the rest of the great turbulent soul that was gone forth in sin in arms against the holy church excommunicate and foredoomed to hell or were they of thanksgiving that at last she was completely mistress of my destinies her mind at rest since no longer need she fear opposition to her wishes concerning me i do not know nor will i do her the possible injustice that i should were i to guess     chapter ii gino falcone   when i think of my mother now i do not see her as she appeared in any of the scenes that already i have set down there is one picture of her that is burnt as with an acid upon my memory a picture which the mere mention of her name the mere thought of her never fails to evoke like a ghost before me i see her always as she appeared one evening when she came suddenly and without warning upon falcone and me in the armoury of the citadel  i see her again a tall slight graceful woman her oval face of the translucent pallor of wax framed in a nunlike coif over which was thrown a long black veil that fell to her waist and there joined the black unrelieved draperies that she always wore this sable garb was no mere mourning for my father his death had made as little change in her apparel as in her general life it had been ever thus as far as my memory can travel always had her raiment been the same those trailing funereal draperies again i see them and that pallid face with its sunken eyes around which there were great brown patches that seemed to intensify the depth at which they were set and the sombre lustre of them on the rare occasions when she raised them those slim waxlike hands with a chaplet of beads entwined about the left wrist and hanging thence to a silver crucifix at the end  she moved almost silently as a ghost and where she passed she seemed to leave a trail of sorrow and sadness in her wake just as a worldly woman leaves a trail of perfume  thus looked she when she came upon us there that evening and thus will she live for ever in my memory for that was the first time that i knew rebellion against the yoke she was imposing upon me the first time that our wills clashed hers and mine and as a consequence maybe was it the first time that i considered her with purpose and defined her to myself  the thing befell some three months after the coming of falcone to mondolfo  that the old manatarms should have exerted a strong attraction upon my young mind you will readily understand his intimate connection with that dimly remembered father who stood secretly in my imagination in the position that my mother would have had st augustine occupy drew me to his equerry like metal to a lodestone  and this attraction was reciprocal of his own accord old falcone sought me out lingering in my neighbourhood at first like a dog that looks for a kindly word he had not long to wait daily we had our meetings and our talks and daily did these grow in length and they were stolen hours of which i said no word to my mother nor did others for a season so that all was well  our talks were naturally of my father and it was through falcone that i came to know something of the greatness of that noblesouled valiant gentleman whom the old servant painted for me as one who combined with the courage of the lion the wiliness of the fox  he discoursed of their feats of arms together he described charges of horse that set my nerves atingle as in fancy i heard the blare of trumpets and the deafening thunder of hooves upon the turf of escalades of surprises of breaches stormed of camisades and ambushes of dark treacheries and great heroisms did he descant to fire my youthful fancy to fill me first with delight and then with frenzy when i came to think that in all these things my life must have no part that for me another road was seta grey gloomy road at the end of which was dangled a reward which did not greatly interest me  and then one day from fighting as an endeavour as a pitting of force against force and astuteness against astuteness he came to talk of fighting as an art  it was from old falcone that first i heard of marozzo that miracleworker in weapons that master at whose academy in bologna the craft of swordsmanship was to be acquired so that from fighting with his irons as a beast with its claws by sheer brute strength and brute instinct man might by practised skill and knowledge gain advantages against which mere strength must spend itself in vain  what he told me amazed me beyond anything that i had ever heard even from himself and what he told me he illustrated flinging himself into the poises taught by marozzo that i might appreciate the marvellous science of the thing  thus was it that for the first time i made the acquaintancean acquaintance held by few men in those daysof those marvellous guards of marozzos devising falcone showed me the difference between the mandritto and the roverso the false edge and the true the stramazone and the tondo and he left me spellbound by that marvellous guard appropriately called by marozzo the iron girdlea low guard on the level of the waist which on the very parry gives an opening for the point so that in one movement you may ward and strike  at last when i questioned him he admitted that during their wanderings my father with that recklessness that alternated curiously with his caution had ventured into the city of bologna notwithstanding that it was a papal fief for the sole purpose of studying with marozzo that falcone himself had daily accompanied him witnessed the lessons and afterwards practised with my father so that he had come to learn most of the secrets that marozzo taught  one day at last very timidly like one who whilst overconscious of his utter unworthiness ventures to crave a boon which he knows himself without the right to expect i asked falcone would he show me something of marozzos art with real weapons  i had feared a rebuff i had thought that even old falcone might laugh at one predestined to the study of theology desiring to enter into the mysteries of swordcraft but my fears were far indeed from having a foundation there was no laughter in the equerrys grey eyes whilst the smile upon his lips was a smile of gladness of eagerness almost of thankfulness to see me so set  and so it came to pass that daily thereafter did we practise for an hour or so in the armoury with sword and buckler and with every lesson my proficiency with the iron grew in a manner that falcone termed prodigious swearing that i was born to the sword that the knack of it was in the very blood of me  it may be that affection for me caused him to overrate the progress that i made and the aptitude i showed it may even be that what he said was no more than the goodnatured flattery of one who loved me and would have me take pleasure in myself and yet when i look back at the lad i was i incline to think that he spoke no more than sober truth  i have alluded to the curious almost inexplicable delight it afforded me to feel in my hands the balance of a pike for the first time fain would i tell you something of all that i felt when first my fingers closed about a swordhilt the forefinger passed over the quillons in the new manner as falcone showed me but it defies all power of words the sweet seduction of its balance the white gleaming beauty of the blade were things that thrilled me with something akin to the thrill of the first kiss of passion it was not quite the same i know yet i can think of nothing else in life that is worthy of being compared with it  i was at the time a lad in my thirteenth year but i was wellgrown and strong beyond my age despite the fact that my mother had restrained me from all those exercises of horsemanship of arms and of wrestling by which boys of my years attain development i stood almost as tall then as falcone himselfwho was accounted of a good heightand if my reach fell something short of his i made up for this by the youthful quickness of my movements so that soonunless out of good nature he refrained from exerting his full vigouri found myself falcones match  fra gervasio who was then my tutor and with whom my mornings were spent in perfecting my latin and giving me the rudiments of greek soon had his suspicions of where the hour of the siesta was spent by me with old falcone but the good saintly man held his peace a matter which at that time intrigued me others there were however who thought well to bear the tale of our doings to my mother and thus it happened that she came upon us that day in the armoury each of us in shirt and breeches at swordandtarget play  we fell apart upon her entrance each with a guilty feeling like children caught in a forbidden orchard for all that falcone held himself proudly erect his grizzled head thrown back his eyes cold and hard  a long while it seemed ere she spoke and once or twice i shot her a furtive comprehensive glance and saw her as i shall ever see her to my dying day  her eyes were upon me i do not believe that she gave falcone a single thought at first it was at me only that she looked and with such a sorrow in her glance to see me so vigorous and lusty as surely could not have been fetched there by the sight of my corpse itself her lips moved awhile in silence and whether she was at her everlasting prayers or whether she was endeavouring to speak but could not for emotion i do not know at last her voice came laden with a chill reproach  agostino she said and waited as if for some answer from me  it was in that instant that rebellion stirred in me her coming had turned me cold for all that my body was overheated from the exercise and i was sweating furiously now at the sound of her voice something of the injustice that oppressed me something of the unreasoning bigotry that chained and fettered me stood clear before my mental vision for the first time it warmed me again with the warmth of sullen indignation i returned her no answer beyond a curtly respectful invitation that she should speak her mind couchedas had been her reproofin a single word of address  madonna i challenged and emulating something of old falcones attitude i drew myself erect flung back my head and brought my eyes to the level of her own by an effort of will such as i had never yet exerted  it was i think the bravest thing i ever did i felt in doing it as one feels who has nerved himself to enter fire and when the thing was done the ease of it surprised me there followed no catastrophe such as i expected before my glance grown suddenly so very bold her own eyes drooped and fell away as was her habit she spoke thereafter without looking at me in that cold emotionless voice that was peculiar to her always the voice of one in whom the founts of all that is sweet and tolerant and tender in life are for ever frozen  what are you doing with weapons agostino she asked me  as you see madam mother i am at practice i answered and out of the corner of my eye i caught the grim approving twitch of old falcones lips  at practice she echoed dully as one who does not understand then very slowly she shook her sorrowful head men practise what they must one day perform agostino to your books then and leave swords for bloody men nor ever let me see you again with weapons in your hands if you respect me  had you not come hither madam mother you had been spared the sight today i answered with some lingering spark of my rebellious fire still smouldering  it was gods will that i should come to set a term to such vanities before they take too strong a hold upon you answered she lay down those weapons  had she been angry i think i could have withstood her anger in her at such a time must have been as steel upon the flint of my own nature but against that incarnation of sorrow and sadness my purpose my strength of character were turned to water by similar means had she ever prevailed with my poor father and i had too the habit of obedience which is not so lightly broken as i had at first accounted possible  sullenly then i set down my sword upon a bench that stood against the wall and my target with it as i turned aside to do so her gloomy eyes were poised for an instant upon falcone who stood grim and silent then they were lowered again ere she began to address him  you have done very ill falcone said she you have abused my trust in you and you have sought to pervert my son and to lead him into ways of evil  he started under that reproof like a fiery stallion under the spur his face flushed scarlet the habit of obedience may have been strong in falcone too but it was obedience to men with women he had never had much to do old warrior though he was moreover in this he felt that an affront had been put upon the memory of giovanni danguissola who was my father and who went nigh to being falcones god and this his answer plainly showed  the ways into which i lead your son madonna said he in a low voice that boomed up and echoed in the groined ceiling overhead are the ways that were trod by my lord his father and who says that the ways of giovanni danguissola were evil ways lies foully be he man or woman patrician or villein pope or devil and upon that he paused magnificently his eyes aflash  she shuddered under his rough speech then answered without looking up and with no trace of anger in her voice  you are restored to health and strength by now messer falcone the seneschal shall have orders to pay you ten gold ducats in discharge of all that may be still your due from us see that by night you have left mondolfo  and then without changing her deadly inflection or even making a noticeable pause come agostino she commanded  but i did not move her words had fixed me there with horror i heard from falcone a sound that was between a growl and a sob i dared not look at him but the eye of my fancy saw him standing rigid pale and selfcontained  what would he do what would he say oh she had done a cruel a bitterly cruel wrong this poor old warrior all scarred and patched from wounds that he had taken in my fathers service to be turned away in his old age as we should not have turned away a dog it was a monstrous thing mondolfo was his home the anguissola were his family and their honour was his honour since as a villein he had no honour of his own to cast him out thus  all this flashed through my anguished mind in one brief throb of time as i waited marvelling what he would do what say in answer to that dismissal  he would not plead or else i did not know him and i was sure of that without knowing what else there was that must make it impossible for old falcone to stoop to ask a favour of my mother  awhile he just stood there his wits overthrown by sheer surprise and then when at last he moved the thing he did was the last thing that i had looked for not to her did he turn not to her but to me and he dropped on one knee before me  my lord he cried and before he added another word i knew already what else he was about to say for never yet had i been so addressed in my lordship of mondolfo to all there i was just the madonnino but to falcone in that supreme hour of his need i was become his lord  my lord he said then is it your wish that i should go  i drew back still wrought upon by my surprise and then my mothers voice came cold and acid  the madonninos wish is not concerned in this mester falcone it is i who order your departure  falcone did not answer her he affected not to hear her and continued to address himself to me  you are the master here my lord he urged you are the law in mondolfo you carry life and death in your right hand and against your will no man or woman in your lordship can prevail  he spoke the truth a mighty truth which had stood like a mountain before me all these months yet which i had not seen  i shall go or remain as you decree my lord he added and then almost in a snarl of defiance i obey none other he concluded nor pope nor devil  agostino i am waiting for you came my mothers voice from the doorway  something had me by the throat it was temptation and old falcone was the tempter more than that was hethough how much more i did not dream nor with what authority he acted there he was the mentor who showed me the road to freedom and to manhood he showed me how at a blow i might shiver the chains that held me and shake them from me like the cobwebs that they were he tested me too tried my courage and my will and to my undoing was it that he found me wanting in that hour my regrets for him went near to giving me the resolution that i lacked yet even these fell short  i would to god i had given heed to him i would to god i had flung back my head and told my motheras he prompted methat i was lord of mondolfo and that falcone must remain since i so willed it  i strove to do so out of my love for him rather than out of any such fine spirit as he sought to inspire in me had i succeeded i had established my dominion i had become arbiter of my fate and how much of misery of anguish and of sin might i not thereafter have been spared  the hour was crucial though i knew it not i stood at a parting of ways yet for lack of courage i hesitated to take the road to which so invitingly he beckoned me  and then before i could make any answer such as i desired such as i strove to make my mother spoke again and by her tone which had grown faltering and tearfulas was her wont in the old days when she ruled my fathershe riveted anew the fetters i was endeavouring with all the strength of my poor young soul to snap  tell him agostino that your will is as your mothers tell him so and come i am waiting for you  i stifled a groan and let my arms fall limply to my sides i was a weakling and contemptible i realized it and yet today when i look back i see how vast a strength i should have needed i was but thirteen and of a spirit that had been cowed by her and was held under her thrall  i i am sorry falcone i faltered and there were tears in my eyes  i shrugged againshrugged in token of my despair and grief and impotenceand i moved down the long room towards the door where my mother waited  i did not dare to bestow another look upon that poor broken old warrior that faithful lifelong servant turned thus cruelly upon the world by a woman whom bigotry had sapped of all human feelings and a boy who was a coward masquerading under a great name  i heard his gasping sob and the sound smote upon my heart and hurt me as if it had been iron i had failed him he must suffer more in the knowledge of my unworthiness to be called the son of that master whom he had worshipped than in the destitution that might await him  i reached the door  my lord my lord he cried after me despairingly on the very threshold i stood arrested by that heartbroken cry of his i half turned  falcone  i began  and then my mothers white hand fell upon my wrist  come my son she said once more impassive  nervelessly i obeyed her and as i passed out i heard falcones voice crying  my lord my lord god help me and god help you an hour later he had left the citadel and on the stones of the courtyard lay ten golden ducats which he had scattered there and which not one of the greedy grooms or servingmen could take courage to pick up so fearful a curse had old falcone laid upon that money when he cast it from him     chapter iii the pietistic thrall   that evening my mother talked to me at longer length than i remember her ever to have done before  it may be that she feared lest gino falcone should have aroused in me notions which it was best to lull back at once into slumber it may be that she too had felt something of the crucial quality of that moment in the armoury just as she must have perceived my first hesitation to obey her slightest word whence came her resolve to check this mutiny ere it should spread and become too big for her  we sat in the room that was called her private diningroom but which in fact was all things to her save the chamber in which she slept  the fine apartments through which i had strayed as a little lad in my fathers day the handsome lofty chambers with their frescoed ceilings their walls hung with costly tapestries many of which had come from the looms of flanders their floors of wood mosaics and their great carved movables had been shut up these many years  for my mothers claustral needs sufficient was provided by the alcove in which she slept the private chapel of the citadel in which she would spend long hours and this private diningroom where we now sat into the spacious gardens of the castle she would seldom wander into our town of mondolfo never not since my fathers departure upon his illstarred rebellion had she set foot across the drawbridge  tell me whom you go with and i will tell you what you are says the proverb show me your dwelling and i shall see your character say i  and surely never was there a chamber so permeated by the nature of its tenant as that private diningroom of my mothers  it was a narrow room in the shape of a small parallelogram with the windows set high up near the timbered whitewashed ceiling so that it was impossible either to look in or to look out as is sometimes the case with the windows of a chapel  on the white space of wall that faced the door hung a great wooden crucifix very rudely carved by one who either knew nothing of anatomy or elseas is more probablewas utterly unable to set down his knowledge upon timber the crudely tinted figure would be perhaps half the natural size of a man and it was the most repulsive and hideous representation of the tragedy of golgotha that i have ever seen it filled one with a horror which was far indeed removed from the pious horror which that symbol is intended to arouse in every true believer it emphasized all the ghastly ugliness of death upon that most barbarous of gallows without any suggestion of the beauty and immensity of the divine martyrdom of him who in the likeness of the sinful flesh was alone without sin  and to me the ghastliest and most pitiful thing of all was an artifice which its maker had introduced for the purpose of conveying some suggestion of the supernatural to that mangled malformed less than human representation into the place of the wound made by the spear of longinus he had introduced a strip of crystal which caught the light at certain anglesmore particularly when there were lighted tapers in the roomso that in reflecting this it seemed to shed forth luminous rays  an odd thing was that my motherwho looked upon that crucifix with eyes that were very different from minewould be at pains in the evening when lights were fetched to set a taper at such an angle as was best calculated to produce the effect upon which the sculptor had counted what satisfaction it can have been to her to see reflected from that glazed wound the light which she herself had provided for the purpose i am lost to think and yet i am assured that she would contemplate that shining effluence in a sort of ecstatic awe accounting it something very near akin to miracle  under this crucifix hung a little alabaster font of holywater into the back of which was stuck a withered yellow branch of palm which was renewed on each palm sunday before it was set a prayingstool of plain oak without any cushion to mitigate its harshness to the knees  in the corner of the room stood a tall spare square cupboard capacious but very plain in which the necessaries of the table were disposed in the opposite corner there was another smaller cupboard with a sort of writingpulpit beneath here my mother kept the accounts of her household her books of recipes her homely medicines and the heavy devotional tomes and lesser volumesmostly manuscriptout of which she nourished her poor starving soul  amongst these was the treatise of the mental sufferings of christthe book of the blessed battista of varano princess of camerino who founded the convent of poor clares in that citya book whose almost blasphemous presumption fired the train of my earliest misgivings  another was the spiritual combat that queer yet able book of the cleric scupolidescribed as the aureo libro dedicated al supremo capitano e gloriosissimo trionfatore gesu cristo figliuolo di maria and this dedication in the form of a letter to our saviour signed your most humble servant purchased with your blood 1       1 this work which achieved a great vogue and of which      several editions were issued down to 1750 was first printed      in 1589 clearly however ms copies were in existence      earlier and it is to one of these that agostino here      refers   down the middle of the chamber ran a long squareended table of oak very plain like all the rest of the rooms scant furnishings at the head of this table was an armchair for my mother of bare wood without any cushion to relieve its hardness whilst on either side of the board stood a few lesser chairs for those who habitually dined there these were besides myself fra gervasio my tutor messer giorgio the castellan a baldheaded old man long since past the fighting age and who in times of stress would have been as useful for purposes of defending mondolfo as lorenza my mothers elderly woman who sat below him at the board he was toothless bowed and decrepit but he was very devoutas he had need to be seeing that he was half dead alreadyand this counted with my mother above any other virtue2  2 virtu is the word used by agostino and it is susceptible to a wider translation than that which the english language affords comprising as it does a sense of courage and address at arms indeed it is not clear that agostino is not playing here upon the double meaning of the word   the last of the four who habitually sat with us was giojoso the seneschal a lanternjawed fellow with black beetling brows about whom the only joyous thing was his misnomer of a name  of the table that we kept beyond noting that the fare was ever of a lenten kind and that the wine was watered i will but mention that my mother did not observe the barrier of the salt there was no sitting above it or below at our board as from time immemorial is the universal custom in feudal homes that her having abolished it was an act of humility on her part there can be little doubt although this was a subject upon which she never expressed herself in my hearing  the walls of that room were whitewashed and bare  the floor was of stone overlain by a carpet of rushes that was changed no oftener than once a week  from what i have told you you may picture something of the chill gloom of the place something of the pietism which hung upon the very air of that apartment in which so much of my early youth was spent and it had too an odour that is peculiarly full of character the smell which is never absent from a sacristy and rarely from conventual chambers a smell difficult to define faint and yet tenuously pungent and like no other smell in all the world that i have ever known it is a musty odour an odour of staleness which perhaps an open window and the fresh air of heaven might relieve but could not dissipate and to this is wed but so subtly that it would be impossible to say which is predominant the slight sickly aroma of wax  we supped there that night in silence at about the hour that poor gino falcone would be taking his departure silence was habitual with us at mealtimes eating being performedlike everything else in that drab householdas a sort of devotional act occasionally the silence would be relieved by readings aloud from some pious work undertaken at my mothers bidding by one or another of the amanuenses  but on the night in question there was just silence broken chiefly by the toothless slobber of the castellan over the soft meats that were especially prepared for him and there was something of grimness in that silence for noneand fra gervasio less than anyapproved the unchristian thing that out of excess of christianity my mother had done in driving old falcone forth  myself i could not eat at all my misery choked me the thought of that old servitor whom i had loved being sent a wanderer and destitute and all through my own weakness all because i had failed him in his need just as i had failed myself was anguish to me my lip would quiver at the thought and it was with difficulty that i repressed my tears  at last that hideous repast came to an end in prayers of thanksgiving whose immoderate length was out of all proportion to the fare provided  the castellan shuffled forth upon the arm of the seneschal lorenza followed at a sign from my mother and we threegervasio my mother and iwere left alone  and here let me say a word of fra gervasio he was as i have already written my fathers fosterbrother that is to say he was the child of a sturdy peasantwoman of the val di taro from whose lusty healthy breast my father had suckled the first of that fine strength that had been his own  he was older than my father by a month or so and as often happens in such cases he was brought to mondolfo to be first my fathers playmate and later no doubt to have followed him as a manatarms but a chill that he took in his tenth year as a result of a long winter immersion in the icy waters of the taro laid him at the point of death and left him thereafter of a rather weak and sickly nature but he was quick and intelligent and was admitted to learn his letters with my father whence it ensued that he developed a taste for study seeing that by his health he was debarred from the hardy open life of a soldier his scholarly aptitude was encouraged and it was decided that he should follow a clerical career  he had entered the order of st francis but after some years at the convent of aguilona his health having been indifferent and the conventual rules too rigorous for his condition he was given licence to become the chaplain of mondolfo here he had received the kindliest treatment at the hands of my father who entertained for his sometime playmate a very real affection  he was a tall gaunt man with a sweet kindly face reflecting his sweet kindly nature he had deepset dark eyes very gentle in their gaze a tender mouth that was a little drawn by lines of suffering and an upright wrinkle deep as a gash between his brows at the root of his long slender nose  he it was that night who broke the silence that endured even after the others had departed he spoke at first as if communing with himself like a man who thinks aloud and between his thumb and his long forefinger i remember that he kneaded a crumb of bread upon which his eyes were intent  gino falcone is an old man and he was my lords bestloved servant he would have died for my lord and joyfully and now he is turned adrift to die to no purpose ah well he heaved a deep sigh and fell silent whilst ithe pentup anguish in me suddenly released to hear my thoughts thus expressedfell soundlessly to weeping  do you reprove me fra gervasio quoth my mother quite emotionless  the monk pushed back his stool and rose ere he replied i must he said or i am unworthy of the scapulary i wear i must reprove this unchristian act or else am i no true servant of my master  she crossed herself with her thumbnail upon the brow and upon the lips to repress all evil thoughts and evil wordsan unfailing sign that she was stirred to anger and sought to combat the sin of it then she spoke meekly enough in the same cold level voice  i think it is you who are at fault she told him when you call unchristian an act which was necessary to secure this child to christ  he smiled a sad little smile yet even so it were well you should proceed with caution and with authority and in this you have none  it was her turn to smile the palest ghostliest of smiles and even for so much she must have been oddly moved i think i have said she and quoted if thy right hand offend thee hack it off  i saw a hot flush mount to the friars prominent cheekbones indeed he was a very human man under his conventual robe with swift stirrings of passion which the long habit of repression had not yet succeeded in extinguishing he cast his eyes to the ceiling in such a glance of despair as left me thoughtful it was as an invocation to heaven to look down upon the obstinate ignorant folly of this woman who accounted herself wise and who so garbled the divine teaching as to blaspheme with complacency  i know that now at the time i was not quite so clearsighted as to read the full message of that glance  her audacity was as the audacity of fools where wisdom fullfledged might have halted trembling she swept resolutely onward before her stood this friar this teacher and interpreter this man of holy life who was accounted profoundly learned in the divinities and he told her that she had done an evil thing yet out of the tiny pittance of her knowledge and her little intellectual sightwhich was no better than a blindnessmust she confidently tell him that he was at fault  argument was impossible between him and her thus much i saw and i feared an explosion of the wrath of which i perceived in him the signs but he quelled it yet his voice rumbled thunderously upon his next words  it matters something that gino falcone should not starve he said  it matters more that my son should not be damned she answered him and with that answer left him weaponless for against the armour of a crassness so dense and oneideaed there are no weapons that can prevail  listen she said and her eyes raised for a moment comprehended both of us in their glance there is something that it were best i tell you that once for all you may fathom the depth of my purpose for agostino here my lord his father was a man of blood and strife  and so were many whose names stand today upon the roll of saints and are its glory answered the friar with quick asperity  but they did not raise their arms against the holy church and against christs own most holy vicar as did he she reminded him sorrowfully the sword is an ill thing save when it is wielded in a holy cause in my lords hands wielded in the unholiest of all causes it became a thing accursed but gods anger overtook him and laid him low at perugia in all the strength and vigour that had made him arrogant as lucifer it was perhaps well for all of us that it so befell  madonna cried gervasio in stern horror  but she went on quite heedless of him best of all was it for me since i was spared the harshest duty that can be imposed upon a woman and a wife it was necessary that he should expiate the evil he had wrought moreover his life was become a menace to my childs salvation it was his wish to make of agostino such another as himself to lead his only son adown the path of hell it was my duty to my god and to my son to shield this boy and to accomplish that i would have delivered up his father to the papal emissaries who sought him  ah never that the friar protested you could never have done that  could i not i tell you it was as good as done i tell you that the thing was planned i took counsel with my confessor and he showed me my plain duty  she paused a moment whilst we stared fra gervasio whitefaced and with mouth that gaped in sheer horror  for years had he eluded the long arm of the popes justice she resumed and during those years he had never ceased to plot and plan the overthrow of the pontifical dominion he was blinded by his arrogance to think that he could stand against the hosts of heaven his stubbornness in sin had made him mad quem deus vult perdere and she waved one of her emaciated hands leaving the quotation unfinished heaven showed me the way chose me for its instrument i sent him word offering him shelter here at mondolfo where none would look to find him assuming it to be the last place to which he would adventure he was to have come when death took him on the field of perugia  there was something here that i did not understand at all and in like case it seemed was fra gervasio for he passed a hand over his brow as if to clear thence some veils that clogged his understanding  he was to have come he echoed to shelter he asked  nay said she quietly to death the papal emissaries had knowledge of it and would have been here to await him  you would have betrayed him fra gervasios voice was hoarse his eyes were burning sombrely  i would have saved my son said she with quiet satisfaction in a tone that revealed how incontestably right she conceived herself to be  he stood there and he seemed taller and more gaunt than usual for he had drawn himself erect to the full of his great heightand he was a man who usually went bowed his hands were clenched and the knuckles showed bluewhite like marble his face was very pale and in his temple a little pulse was throbbing visibly he swayed slightly upon his feet and the sight of him frightened me a little he seemed so full of terrible potentialities  when i think of vengeance i picture to myself fra gervasio as i beheld him in that hour nothing that he could have done would have surprised me had he fallen upon my mother then and torn her limb from limb it would have been no more than from the sight of him i might have expected  i have said that nothing that he could have done would have surprised me rather should i have said that nothing would have surprised me save the thing he did  whilst a man might have counted ten stood he soshe seeing nothing of the strange transfiguration that had come over him for her eyes were downcast as ever then quite slowly his hands unclenched his arms fell limply to his sides his head sank forward upon his breast and his figure bowed itself lower than was usual quite suddenly quite softly almost as a man who swoons he sank down again into the chair from which he had risen  he set his elbows on the table and took his head in his hands a groan escaped him she heard it and looked at him in her furtive way  you are moved by this knowledge fra gervasio she said and sighed i have told you thisand you agostinothat you may know how deep how ineradicable is my purpose you were a votive offering agostino you were vowed to the service of god that your fathers life might be spared years ago ere you were born from the very edge of death was your father brought back to life and strength he would have used that life and that strength to cheat god of the price of his boon to me  and if fra gervasio questioned almost fiercely agostino in the end should have no vocation should have no call to such a life  she looked at him very wistfully almost pityingly how should that be she asked he was offered to god and that god accepted the gift he showed when he gave giovanni back to life how then could it come to pass that agostino should have no call would god reject that which he had accepted  fra gervasio rose again you go too deep for me madonna he said bitterly it is not for me to speak of my gifts save reverently and in profound and humble gratitude for that grace by which god bestowed them upon me but i am accounted something of a casuist i am a doctor of theology and of canon law and but for the weak state of my health i should be sitting today in the chair of canon law at the university of pavia and yet madonna the things you tell me with such assurance make a mock of everything i have ever learnt  even i lad as i was perceived the bitter irony in which he spoke not so she i vow she flushed under what she accounted his praise of her wisdom and divine revelation for vanity is the last human weakness to be discarded then she seemed to recollect herself she bowed her head very reverently  it is gods grace that reveals to me the truth she said  he fell back a step in his amazement at having been so thoroughly misunderstood then he drew away from the table he looked at her as he would speak but checked on the thought he turned and so without another word departed and left us sitting there together  it was then that we had our talk or rather that she talked whilst i sat listening and presently as i listened i came gradually once more under the spell of which i had more than once that day been on the point of casting off the yoke  for after all you are to discern in what i have written here between what were my feelings at the time and what are my criticisms of today in the light of the riper knowledge to which i have come the handling of a sword had thrilled me strangely as i have shown yet was i ready to believe that such a thrill was but a lure of satans as my mother assured me in deeper matters she might harbour error as fra gervasios irony had shown me that he believed but we went that night into no great depths  she spent an hour or so in vague discourse upon the joys of paradise in showing me the folly of jeopardizing them for the sake of the fleeting vanities of this ephemeral world she dealt at length upon the love of god for us and the love which we should bear to him and she read to me passages from the book of the blessed varano and from scupoli to add point to her teachings upon the beauty and nobility of a life that is devoted to gods servicethe only service of this world in which nobility can exist  and then she added little stories of martyrs who had suffered for the faith of the tortures to which they had been subjected and of the happiness they had felt in actual suffering of the joy that their very torments had brought them borne up as they were by their faith and the strength of their love of god  there was in all this nothing that was new to me nothing that i did not freely accept and implicitly believe without pausing to judge or criticize and yet it was shrewd of her to have plied me then as she did for thereby beyond doubt she checked me upon the point of selfquestioning to which that days happenings were urging me and she brought me once more obediently to heel and caused me to fix my eyes more firmly than ever beyond the things of this world and upon the glories of the next which i was to make my goal and aim  thus came i back within the toils from which i had been for a moment tempted to escape and what is more my imagination fired to some touch of ecstasy by those tales of sainted martyrs i returned willingly to the pietistic thrall to be held in it more firmly than ever yet before  we parted as we always parted and when i had kissed her cold hand i went my way to bed and if i knelt that night to pray that god might watch over poor errant falcone it was to the end that falcone might be brought to see the sin and error of his ways and win to the grace of a happy death when his hour came     chapter iv luisina   of the four years that followed little mention need be made in these pages save for one incident whose importance is derived entirely from that which subsequently befell for at the time it had no meaning for me yet since later it was to have much it is fitting that it should be recorded here  it happened that a month or so after old falcone had left us there wandered one noontide into the outer courtyard of the castle two pilgrim fathers on their wayas they announcedfrom milan to visit the holy house at loreto  it was my mothers custom to receive all pilgrim wayfarers and beggars in this courtyard at noontide twice in each week to bestow upon them food and alms rarely was she herself present at that almsgiving more rarely still was i it was fra gervasio who discharged the office of almoner on the countess of mondolfos behalf occasionally the whines and snarls of the motley crowd that gathered therefor they were not infrequently quarrelsomereached us in the maschio tower where we had our apartments but on the day of which i speak i chanced to stand in the pillared gallery above the courtyard watching the heaving surging human mass below for the concourse was greater than usual  cripples there were of every sort and all in rags some with twisted withered limbs others with mere stumps where limbs had been lopped off others againand there were many of thesewith hideous running sores some of which no doubt would be counterfeitas i now knowand contrived with poultices of salt for the purpose of exciting charity in the piteous all were dishevelled unkempt ragged dirty and doubtless verminous most were greedy and wolfish as they thrust one another aside to reach fra gervasio as if they feared that the supply of alms and food should be exhausted ere their turn arrived amongst them there was commonly a small sprinkling of mendicant friars some of these perhaps just the hypocrite rogues that i have since discovered many of them to be though at the time all who wore the scapulary were holy men in my innocent eyes they were mostly or so they pretended bent upon pilgrimages to distant parts living upon such alms as they could gather on their way  on the steps of the chapel fra gervasio would standgaunt and impassivewith his posse of attendant grooms behind him one of the latter standing nearest to our almoner held a great sack of broken bread another presented a wooden troughlike platter filled with slices of meat and a third dispensed out of horn cups a poor thin and rather sour but very wholesome wine which he drew from the skins that were his charge  from one to the other were the beggars passed on by fra gervasio and lastly came they back to him to receive from his hands a piece of moneya grosso of which he held the bag himself  on the day of which i write as i stood there gazing down upon that mass of misery marvelling perhaps a little upon the inequality of fortune and wondering vaguely what god could be about to inflict so much suffering upon certain of his creatures to cause one to be born into purple and another into rags my eyes were drawn by the insistent stare of two monks who stood at the back of the crowd with their shoulders to the wall  they were both tall men and they stood with their cowls over their tonsures in the conventual attitude their hands tucked away into the ample sleeves of their brown habits one of this twain was broader than his companion and very erect of carriage such as was unusual in a monk his mouth and the half of his face were covered by a thick brown beard and athwart his countenance from under the left eye across his nose and cheek ran a great livid scar to lose itself in the beard towards the right jaw his deepset eyes regarded me so intently that i coloured uncomfortably under their gaze for accustomed as i was to seclusion i was easily abashed i turned away and went slowly along the gallery to the end and yet i had a feeling that those eyes were following me and indeed casting a swift glance over my shoulder ere i went indoors i saw that this was so  that evening at supper i chanced to mention the matter to fra gervasio  there was a big bearded capuchin in the yard at almstime today i was beginning when the friars knife clattered from his hand and he looked at me with eyes of positive fear out of a face from which the last drop of blood had abruptly receded i checked my inquiry at the sight of him thus suddenly disordered whilst my mother who as usual observed nothing made a foolish comment  the little brothers are never absent agostino  this brother was a big brother said i  it is not seemly to make jest of holy men she reproved me in her chilling voice  i had no thought to jest i answered soberly i should never have remarked this friar but that he gazed upon me with so great an intentnessso great that i was unable to bear it  it was her turn to betray emotion she looked at me full and longfor onceand very searchingly she too had grown paler than was her habit  agostino what do you tell me quoth she and her voice quivered  now here was a deal of pother about a capuchin who had stared at the madonnino of anguissola the matter was out of all proportion to the stir it made and i conveyed in my next words some notion of that opinion  but she stared wistfully never think it agostino she besought me you know not what it may import and then she turned to fra gervasio who was this mendicant she asked  he had by now recovered from his erstwhile confusion but he was still pale and i observed that his hand trembled  he must have been one of the two little brothers of st francis on their way they said from milan to loreto on a pilgrimage  not those you told me are resting here until tomorrow  from his face i saw that he would have denied it had it lain within his power to utter a deliberate falsehood  they are the same he answered in a low voice  she rose i must see this friar she announced and never in all my life had i beheld in her such a display of emotion  in the morning then said fra gervasio it is after sunset he explained they have retired and their rule he left the sentence unfinished but he had said enough to be understood by her  she sank back to her chair folded her hands in her lap and fell into meditation the faintest of flushes crept into her waxlike cheeks  if it should be a sign she murmured raptly and then she turned again to fra gervasio you heard agostino say that he could not bear this friars gaze you remember brother how a pilgrim appeared near san rufino to the nurse of saint francis and took from her arms the child that he might bless it ere once more he vanished if this should be a sign such as that  she clasped her hands together fervently i must see this friar ere he departs again she said to the staring dumbfounded fra gervasio  at last then i understood her emotion all her life she had prayed for a sign of grace for herself or for me and she believed that here at last was something that might well be discovered upon inquiry to be an answer to her prayer this capuchin who had stared at me from the courtyard became at once to her mindso illbalanced upon such mattersa supernatural visitant harbinger as it were of my future saintly glory  but though she rose betimes upon the morrow to see the holy man ere he fared forth again she was not early enough in the courtyard whither she descended to make her way to the outhouse where the two were lodged she met fra gervasio who was astir before her  the friar she cried anxiously filled already with forebodings the holy man  gervasio stood before her pale and trembling you are too late madonna already he is gone  she observed his agitation now and beheld in it a reflection of her own springing from the selfsame causes oh it was a sign indeed she exclaimed and you have come to realize it too i see next in a burst of gratitude that was almost pitiful upon such slight foundation oh blessed agostino she cried out  then the momentary exaltation fell from that woman of sorrows this but makes my burden heavier my responsibility greater she wailed god help me bear it  thus passed that incident so trifling in itself and so misunderstood by her but it was never forgotten and from time to time she would allude to it as the sign which had been vouchsafed me and for which great should be my thankfulness and my joy  save for that in the four years that followed time flowed an uneventful course within the four walls of the big citadelfor beyond those four walls i was never once permitted to set foot and although from time to time i heard rumours of doings in the town itself of the affairs of the state whereof i was by right of birth the tyrant and of the greater business of the big world beyond yet so trained and schooled was i that i had no great desire for a nearer acquaintance with that world  a certain curiosity did at times beset me spurred not so much by the little that i heard as by things that i read in such histories as my studies demanded i should read for even the lives of saints and holy writ itself afford their student glimpses of the world but this curiosity i came to look upon as a lure of the flesh and to resist blessed are they who are out of all contact with the world since to them salvation comes more easily so i believed implicitly as i was taught by my mother and by fra gervasio at my mothers bidding  and as the years passed under such influences as had been at work upon me from the cradle influences which had known no check save that brief one afforded by gino falcone i became perforce devout and pious from very inclination  joyous transports were afforded me by the study of the life of that saint luigi of the noble mantuan house of gonzagain whom i saw an ideal to be emulated since he seemed to me to be much in my own case and of my own estatewho had counted the illusory greatness of this world well lost so that he might win the bliss of paradise similarly did i take delight in the life written by tommaso da celano of that blessed son of pietro bernardone the merchant of assisi that francis who became the troubadour of the lord and sang so sweetly the praises of his creation my heart would swell within me and i would weep hot and very bitter tears over the narrative of the early and sinful part of his life as we may weep to see a beloved brother beset by deadly perils and greater hence was the joy the exultation and finally the sweet peace and comfort that i gathered from the tale of his conversion of his wondrous works and of the three companions  in these pagesso lively was my young imagination and so wrought upon by what i readi suffered with him again his agonies of hope i thrilled with some of the joy of his stupendous ecstasies and i almost envied him the signal mark of heavenly grace that had imprinted the stigmata upon his living body  all that concerned him too i read his little flowers his testament the mirror of perfection but my greatest delight was derived from his song of the creatures which i learnt by heart  oftentimes since have i wondered and sought to determine whether it was the piety of those lauds that charmed me spiritually or an appeal to my senses made by the beauty of the lines and the imagery which the assisian used in his writings  similarly i am at a loss to determine whether the pleasure i took in reading of the joyous perfumed life of that other stigmatized saint the blessed catherine of siena was not a sensuous pleasure rather than the soulecstasy i supposed it at the time  and as i wept over the early sins of st francis so too did i weep over the rhapsodical confessions of st augustine that mighty theologian after whom i had been named and whose worksafter those concerning st francisexerted a great influence upon me in those early days  thus did i grow in grace until fra gervasio who watched me narrowly and anxiously seemed more at ease setting aside the doubts that earlier had tormented him lest i should be forced upon a life for which i had no vocation he grew more tender and loving towards me as if something of pity lurked within the strong affection in which he held me  and meanwhile as i grew in grace of spirit so too did i grow in grace of body waxing tall and very strong which would have been nowise surprising but that those nurtured as was i are seldom lusty the mind feeding overmuch upon the growing body is apt to sap its strength and vigour besides which there was the circumstance that i continued throughout those years a life almost of confinement deprived of all the exercises by which youth is brought to its fine flower of strength  as i was approaching my eighteenth year there befell another incident which trivial in itself yet has its place in my development and so should have its place within these confessions nor did i judge it trivial at the timenor were trivial the things that followed out of ittrivial though it may seem to me today as i look back upon it through all the murk of later life  giojoso the seneschal of whom i have spoken had a son a great rawboned lad whom he would have trained as an amanuensis but who was one of natures dunces out of which there is nothing useful to be made he was stronglimbed however and he was given odd menial duties to perform about the castle but these he shirked where possible as he had shirked his lessons in earlier days  now it happened that i was walking one spring morningit was in may of that year 44 of which i am now writingon the upper of the three spacious terraces that formed the castle garden it was but an indifferently tended place and yet perhaps the more agreeable on that account since nature had been allowed to have her prodigal luxuriant way it is true that the great boxwood hedges needed trimming and that weeds were sprouting between the stones of the flights of steps that led from terrace to terrace but the place was gay and fragrant with wild blossoms and the great trees afforded generous shade and the long rank grass beneath them made a pleasant couch to lie on during the heat of the day in summer the lowest terrace of all was in better case it was a wellplanted and welltended orchard where i got many a colic in my earlier days from a gluttony of figs and peaches whose complete ripening i was too impatient to await  i walked there then one morning quite early on the upper terrace immediately under the castle wall and alternately i read from the de civitate dei which i had brought with me alternately mused upon the matter of my reading suddenly i was disturbed by a sound of voices just below me  the boxwood hedge being twice my height and fully two feet thick entirely screened the speakers from my sight  there were two voices and one of these angry and threatening i recognized for that of rinolfomesser giojosos graceless son the other a fresh young feminine voice was entirely unknown to me indeed it was the first girls voice i could recall having heard in all my eighteen years and the sound was as pleasantly strange as it was strangely pleasant  i stood quite still to listen to its expostulations  you are a cruel fellow ser rinolfo and madonna the countess shall be told of this  there followed a crackling of twigs and a rush of heavy feet  you shall have something else of which to tell madonnas beatitude threatened the harsh voice of rinolfo  that and his advances were answered by a frightened screech a screech that moved rapidly to the right as it was emitted there came more snapping of twigs a light scurrying sound followed by a heavier one and lastly a panting of breath and a soft pattering of running feet upon the steps that led up to the terrace where i walked  i moved forward rapidly to the opening in the hedge where these steps debouched and no sooner had i appeared there than a soft lithe body hurtled against me so suddenly that my arms mechanically went round it my right hand still holding the de civitate dei forefinger enclosed within its pages to mark the place  two moist dark eyes looked up appealingly into mine out of a frightened but very winsome suntinted face  o madonnino she panted protect me save me  below us checked midway in his furious ascent halted rinolfo his big face red with anger scowling up at me in sudden doubt and resentment  the situation was not only extraordinary in itself but singularly disturbing to me who the girl was or whence she came i had no thought or notion as i surveyed her she would be of about my own age or perhaps a little younger and from her garb it was plain that she belonged to the peasant class she wore a spotless bodice of white linen which but indifferently concealed the ripening swell of her young breast her petticoat of dark red homespun stopped short above her bare brown ankles and her little feet were naked her brown hair long and abundant was still fastened at the nape of her slim neck but fell loose beyond that having been disturbed no doubt in her scuffle with rinolfo her little mouth was deeply red and it held strong young teeth that were as white as milk  i have since wondered whether she was as beautiful as i deemed her in that moment for it must be remembered that mine was the case of the son of filippo balduccirelated by messer boccaccio in the merry tales of his decamerone 1who had come to years of adolescence without ever having beheld womanhood so that the first sight of it in the streets of florence affected him so oddly that he vexed his sire with foolish questions and still more foolish prayers       1 in the introduction to the fourth day   so was it now with me in all my eighteen years i had by my mothers careful contriving never set eyes upon a woman of an age inferior to her own andconsider me foolish if you will but so it isi do not think that it had occurred to me that they existed or else if they did that in youth they differed materially from what in age i found them thus i had come to look upon women as just feeble timid creatures overprone to gossip tears and lamentations and good for very little that i could perceive  i had been unable to understand for what reason it was that san luigi of gonzaga had from years of discretion never allowed his eyes to rest upon a woman nor could i see wherein lay the special merit attributed to this and certain passages in the confessions of st augustine and in the early life of st francis of assisi bewildered me and left me puzzled  but now quite suddenly it was as if revelation had come to me it was as if the book of life had at last been opened for me and at a glance i had read one of its dazzling pages so that whether this brown peasant girl was beautiful or not beautiful she seemed to me with the radiant beauty that is attributed to the angels of paradise nor did i doubt that she would be as holy for to see in beauty a mark of divine favour is not peculiar only to the ancient greeks  and because of the appeal of this beautyreal or supposedi was very ready with my protection since i felt that protection must carry with it certain rights of ownership which must be very sweet and were certainly desired  holding her therefore within the shelter of my arms where in her heedless innocence she had flung herself and by very instinct stroking with one hand her little brown head to soothe her fears i became truculent for the first time in my newfound manhood and boldly challenged her pursuer  what is this rinolfo i demanded why do you plague her  she broke up my snares he answered sullenly and let the birds go free  what snares what birds quoth i  he is a cruel beast she shrilled and he will lie to you madonnino  if he does ill break the bones of his body i promised in a tone entirely new to me and then to himthe truth now poltroon i admonished him  at last i got the story out of them how rinolfo had scattered grain in a little clearing in the garden and all about it had set twigs that were heavily smeared with viscum that he set this trap almost daily and daily took a great number of birds whose necks he wrung and had them cooked for him with rice by his silly mother that it was a sin in any case to take little birds by such cowardly means but that since amongst these birds there were larks and thrushes and plump blackbirds and other sweet musicians of the air whose innocent lives were spent in singing the praises of god his sin became a hideous sacrilege  finally i learnt that coming that morning upon half a score of poor fluttering terrified birds held fast in rinolfos viscous snares the little girl had given them their liberty and had set about breaking up the springes at this occupation he had caught her and there is no doubt that he would have taken a rude vengeance but for the sanctuary which she had found in me  and when i had heard behold me for the first time indulging the prerogative that was mine by right of birth and dispensing justice at mondolfo like the lord of life and death that i was there  you rinolfo i said will set no more snares here at mondolfo nor will you ever again enter these gardens under pain of my displeasure and its consequences and as for this child if you dare to molest her for what has happened now or if you venture so much as to lay a finger upon her at any time and i have word of it i shall deal with you as with a felon now go  he went straight to his father the seneschal with a lying tale of my having threatened him with violence and forbidden him ever to enter the garden again because he had caught me there with luisinaas the child was calledin my arms and messer giojoso full of parental indignation at this gross treatment of his child and outraged chastity at the notion of a young man of churchly aims as were mine being in perversive dalliance with that peasantwench repaired straight to my mother with the story of it which i doubt not lost nothing by its repetition  meanwhile i abode there with luisina i was in no haste to let her go her presence pleased me in some subtle quite indefinable manner and my sense of beauty which always strong had hitherto lain dormant within me was awake at last and was finding nourishment in the graces of her  i sat down upon the topmost of the terrace steps and made her sit beside me this she did after some demur about the honour of it and her own unworthiness objections which i brushed peremptorily aside  so we sat there on that may morning quite close together for which there was after all no need seeing that the steps were of a noble width at our feet spread the garden away down the flight of terraces to end in the castles grey buttressed wall but from where we sat we could look beyond this our glance meeting the landscape a mile or so away with the waters of the taro glittering in the sunshine and the apennines all hazy for an ultimate background  i took her hand which she relinquished to me quite freely and frankly with an innocence as great as my own and i asked her who she was and how she came to mondolfo it was then that i learnt that her name was luisina that she was the daughter of one of the women employed in the castle kitchen who had brought her to help there a week ago from borgo taro where she had been living with an aunt  today the notion of the tyrant of mondolfo sittingalmost coram populoon the steps of the garden of his castle clasping the hand of the daughter of one of his scullions is grotesque and humiliating at the time the thought never presented itself to me at all and had it done so it would have troubled me no whit she was my first glimpse of fresh young maidenhood and i was filled with pleasant interest and desirous of more acquaintance with this phenomenon beyond that i did not go  i told her frankly that she was very beautiful whereupon she looked at me with suddenly startled eyes that were full of fearful questionings and made to draw her hand from mine unable to understand her fears and seeking to reassure her to convince her that in me she had a friend one who would ever protect her from the brutalities of all the rinolfos in the world i put an arm about her shoulders and drew her closer to me gently and protectingly  she suffered it very stonily like a poor fascinated thing that is robbed by fear of its power to resist the evil that it feels enfolding it  o madonnino she whispered fearfully and sighed nay you must not it it is not good  not good quoth i and it was just so that that fool of a son of balduccis must have protested in the story when he was told by his father that it was not good to look on women nay now but it is good to me  and they say you are to be a priest she added which seemed to me a very foolish and inconsequent thing to add  well then and what of that i asked  she looked at me again with those timid eyes of hers you should be at your studies said she  i am said i and smiled i am studying a new subject  madonnino it is not a subject whose study makes good priests she announced and puzzled me again by the foolish inconsequence of her words  already indeed she began to disappoint me saving my motherwhom i did not presume to judge at all and who seemed a being altogether apart from what little humanity i had known until theni had found that foolishness was as natural to women as its bleat to a sheep or its cackle to a goose and in this opinion i had been warmly confirmed by fra gervasio now here in luisina i had imagined at first that i had discovered a phase of womanhood unsuspected and exceptional she was driving me to conclude however that i had been mistaken and that here was just a pretty husk containing a very trivial spirit whose companionship must prove a dull affair when custom should have staled the first impression of her fresh young beauty  it is plain now that i did her an injustice for there was about her words none of the inconsequence i imagined the fault was in myself and in the profound ignorance of the ways of men and women which went hand in hand with my deep but ineffectual learning in the ways of saints  our entertainment however was not destined to go further for at the moment in which i puzzled over her words and sought to attach to them some intelligent meaning there broke from behind us a scream that flung us apart as startled as if we had been conscious indeed of guilt  we looked round to find that it had been uttered by my mother not ten yards away she stood a tall black figure against the grey background of the lichened wall with giojoso in attendance and rinolfo slinking behind his father leering     chapter v rebellion   the sight of my mother startled me more than i can say it filled me with a positive dread of things indefinable never before had i seen her coldly placid countenance so strangely disordered and her unwonted aspect it must have been that wrought so potently upon me  no longer was she the sorrowful spectre whitefaced with downcast eyes and level almost inanimate tones her cheeks were flushed unnaturally her lips were quivering and angry fires were smouldering in her deepset eyes  swiftly she came down to us seeming almost to glide over the ground not me she addressed but poor luisina and her voice was hoarse with an awful anger  who are you wench quoth she what make you here in mondolfo  luisina had risen and stood swaying there very white and with averted eyes her hands clasping and unclasping her lips moved but she was too terrified to answer it was giojoso who stepped forward to inform my mother of the girls name and condition and upon learning it her anger seemed to increase  a kitchenwench she cried o horror  and quite suddenly as if by inspiration scarce knowing what i said or that i spoke at all i answered her out of the store of the theological learning with which she had had me stuffed  we are all equals in the sight of god madam mother  she flashed me a glance of anger of pious anger than which none can be more terrible  blasphemer she denounced me what has god to do with this  she waited for no answer rightly judging perhaps that i had none to offer  and as for that wanton she commanded turning fiercely to giojoso let her be whipped hence and out of the town of mondolfo set the grooms to it  but upon that command of hers i leapt of a sudden to my feet a tightening about my heart and beset by a certain breathlessness that turned me pale  here again it seemed was to be repeatedthough with methods a thousand times more barbarous and harshthe wrong that was done years ago in the case of poor gino falcone and the reason for it in this instance was not even dimly apparent to me falcone i had loved indeed in my eighteen years of life he was the only human being who had knocked for admission upon the portals of my heart him they had driven forth and now here was a childthe fairest creature of gods that until that hour i had beheld whose companionship seemed to me a thing sweet and desirable and whom i felt that i might love as i had loved falcone her too they would drive forth and with a brutality and cruelty that revolted me  later i was to perceive the reasons better and much food for reflection was i to derive from realizing that there are no spirits so vengeful so fierce so utterly intolerant ungovernable and feral as the spirits of the devout when they conceive themselves justified to anger  all the sweet teaching of charity and brotherly love and patience is jettisoned and by the most amazing paradox that christianity has ever known catholic burns heretic and heretic butchers catholic all for the love of christ and each glories devoutly in the deed never heeding the blasphemy of his belief that thus he obeys the sweet and gentle mandates of the god incarnate  thus then my mother now commanding that hideous deed with a mind at peace in pharisaic selfrighteousness  but not again would i stand by as i had stood by in the case of falcone and let her cruel pietistic will be done i had grown since then and i had ripened more than i was aware it remained for this moment to reveal to me the extent besides the subtle influence of sexall unconscious of it as i wasstirred me now to prove my newfound manhood  stay i said to giojoso and in uttering the command i grew very cold and steady and my breathing resumed the normal  he checked in the act of turning away to do my mothers hideous bidding  you will give madonnas order to the grooms ser giojoso as you have been bidden but you will add from me that if there is one amongst them dares to obey it and to lay be it so much as a finger upon luisina him will i kill with these two hands  never was consternation more profound than that which i flung amongst them by those words giojoso fell to trembling behind him rinolfo the cause of all this garboil stared with round big eyes whilst my mother all aquiver clutched at her bosom and looked at me fearfully but spoke no word  i smiled upon them towering there conscious and glad of my height for the first time in my life  well i demanded of giojoso for what do you wait about it sir and do as my mother has commanded you  he turned to her all bent and grovelling arms outstretched in ludicrous bewilderment every line of him beseeching guidance along this path so suddenly grown thorny  mamadonna he stammered  she swallowed hard and spoke at last  do you defy my will agostino  on the contrary madam mother i am enforcing it your will shall be done your order shall be given i insist upon it but it shall lie with the discretion of the grooms whether they obey you am i to blame if they turn cowards  o i had found myself at last and i was making a furious joyous use of the discovery  that that were to make a mock of me and my authority she protested she was still rather helpless rather breathless and confused like one who has suddenly been hurled into cold water  if you fear that madam perhaps you had better countermand your order  is the girl to remain in mondolfo against my wishes are you so so lost to shame a returning note of warmth in her accents warned me that she was collecting herself to deal with the situation  nay said i and i looked at luisina who stood there so pale and tearful i think that for her own sake poor maid it were better that she went since you desire it but she shall not be whipped hence like a stray dog  come child i said to her as gently as i could go pack and quit this home of misery and be easy for if any man in mondolfo attempts to hasten your going he shall reckon with me  i laid a hand for an instant in kindliness and friendliness upon her shoulder poor little luisina said i sighing but she shrank and trembled under my touch pity me a little for they will not permit me any friends and who is friendless is indeed pitiful  and then whether the phrase touched her so that her simple little nature was roused and she shook off what selfcontrol she had ever learnt or whether she felt secure enough in my protection to dare proclaim her mind before them all she caught my hand and stooping kissed it  o madonnino she faltered and her tears showered upon that hand of mine god reward you your sweet thought for me i shall pray for you madonnino  do luisina said i i begin to think i need it  indeed indeed said my mother very sombrely and as she spoke luisina as if her fears were reawakened turned suddenly and went quickly along the terrace past rinolfo who in that moment smiled viciously and round the angle of the wall  what what are my orders madonna quoth the wretched seneschal reminding her that all had not yet been resolved  she lowered her eyes to the ground and folded her hands she was by now quite composed again her habitual sorrowful self  let be she said let the wench depart so that she goes we may count ourselves fortunate  fortunate i think is she said i fortunate to return to the world beyond all thisthe world of life and love that god made and that st francis praises i do not think he would have praised mondolfo for i greatly doubt that god had a hand in making it as it is today it is too too arid  o my mood was finely rebellious that may morning  are you mad agostino gasped my mother  i think that i am growing sane said i very sadly she flashed me one of her rare glances and i saw her lips tighten  we must talk she said that girl and then she checked come with me she bade me  but in that moment i remembered something and i turned aside to look for my friend rinolfo he was moving stealthily away following the road luisina had taken the conviction that he went to plague and jeer at her to exult over her expulsion from mondolfo kindled my anger all anew  stay you there rinolfo i called  he halted in his strides and looked over his shoulder impudently  i had never yet been paid by any the deference that was my due indeed i think that among the grooms and servingmen at mondolfo i must have been held in a certain measure of contempt as one who would never come to more manhood than that of the cassock  come here i bade him and as he appeared to hesitate i had to repeat the order more peremptorily at last he turned and came  what now agostino cried my mother setting a pale hand upon my sleeve  but i was all intent upon that lout who stood there before me shifting uneasily upon his feet his air mutinous and sullen over his shoulder i had a glimpse of his fathers yellow face wideeyed with alarm  i think you smiled just now said i  heh by bacchus said he impudently as who would say how could i help smiling  will you tell me why you smiled i asked him  heh by bacchus said he again and shrugged to give his insolence a barb  will you answer me i roared and under my display of anger he looked truculent and thus exhausted the last remnant of my patience  agostino came my mothers voice in remonstrance and such is the power of habit that for a moment it controlled me and subdued my violence  nevertheless i went on you smiled to see your spite succeed you smiled to see that poor child driven hence by your contriving you smiled to see your broken snares avenged and you were following after her no doubt to tell her all this and to smile again this is all so it is not  heh by bacchus said he for the third time and at that my patience gave out utterly ere any could stop me i had seized him by throat and belt and shaken him savagely  will you answer me like a fool i cried must you be taught sense and a proper respect of me  agostino agostino wailed my mother help ser giojoso do you not see that he is mad  i do not believe that it was in my mind to do the fellow any grievous hurt but he was so illadvised in that moment as to attempt to defend himself he rashly struck at one of the arms that held him and by the act drove me into a fury ungovernable  you dog i snarled at him from between clenched teeth would you raise your hand to me am i your lord or am i dirt of your own kind go learn submission and i flung him almost headlong down the flight of steps  there were twelve of them and all of stone with edges still sharp enough though blunted here and there by time the fool had never suspected in me the awful strength which until that hour i had never suspected in myself else perhaps there had been fewer insolent shrugs fewer foolish answers and last of all no attempt to defy me physically  he screamed as i flung him my mother screamed and giojoso screamed  after that there was a panicstricken silence whilst he went thudding and bumping to the bottom of the flight i did not greatly care if i killed him but he was fortunate enough to get no worse hurt than a broken leg which should keep him out of mischief for a season and teach him respect for me for all time  his father scuttled down the steps to the assistance of that precious son who lay moaning where he had fallen the angle at which the half of one of his legs stood to the rest of it plainly announcing the nature of his punishment  my mother swept me indoors loading me with reproaches as we went she dispatched some to help giojoso others she sent in urgent quest of fra gervasio me she hurried along to her private diningroom i went very obediently and even a little fearfully now that my passion had fallen from me  there in that cheerless room which not even the splashes of sunlight falling from the highplaced windows upon the whitewashed wall could help to gladden i stood a little sullenly what time she first upbraided me and then wept bitterly sitting in her highbacked chair at the tables head  at last gervasio came anxious and flurried for already he had heard some rumour of what had chanced his keen eyes went from me to my mother and then back again to me  what has happened he asked  what has not happened wailed my mother agostino is possessed  he knit his brows possessed quoth he  ay possessedpossessed of devils he has been violent he has broken poor rinolfos leg  ah said gervasio and turned to me frowning with full tutorial sternness and what have you to say agostino  why that i am sorry answered i rebellious once more i had hoped to break his dirty neck  you hear him cried my mother it is the end of the world gervasio the boy is possessed i say  what was the cause of your quarrel quoth the friar his manner still more stern  quarrel quoth i throwing back my head and snorting audibly i do not quarrel with rinolfos i chastise them when they are insolent or displease me this one did both  he halted before me erect and very sternindeed almost threatening and i began to grow afraid for after all i had a kindness for gervasio and i would not willingly engage in a quarrel with him yet here i was determined to carry through this thing as i had begun it  it was my mother who saved the situation  alas she moaned there is wicked blood in him he has the abominable pride that was the ruin and downfall of his father  now that was not the way to make an ally of fra gervasio it did the very opposite it set him instantly on my side in antagonism to the abuser of my fathers memory a memory which he poor man still secretly revered  the sternness fell away from him he looked at her and sighed then with bowed head and hands clasped behind him he moved away from me a little  do not let us judge rashly he said perhaps agostino received some provocation let us hear  o you shall hear she promised tearfully exultant to prove him wrong you shall hear a yet worse abomination that was the cause of it  and out she poured the story that rinolfo and his father had run to tell herof how i had shown the fellow violence in the first instance because he had surprised me with luisina in my arms  the friars face grew dark and grave as he listened but ere she had quite done unable longer to contain myself i interrupted  in that he lied like the muckworm that he is i exclaimed and it increases my regrets that i did not break his neck as i intended  he lied quoth she her eyes wide open in amazementnot at the fact but at the audacity of what she conceived my falsehood  it is not impossible said fra gervasio what is your story agostino  i told ithow the child out of a very gentle and christian pity had released the poor birds that were taken in rinolfos limed twigs and how in a fury he had made to beat her so that she had fled to me for shelter and protection and how thereupon i had bidden him begone out of that garden and never set foot in it again  and now i ended you know all the violence that i showed him and the reason for it if you say that i did wrong i warn you that i shall not believe you  indeed began the friar with a faint smile of friendliness but my mother interrupted him betwixt sorrow and anger  he lies gervasio he lies shamelessly o into what a morass of sin has he not fallen and every moment he goes deeper have i not said that he is possessed we shall need the exorcist  we shall indeed madam mother to clear your mind of foolishness i answered hotly for it stung me to the soul to be branded thus a liar to have my word discredited by that of a lout such as rinolfo  she rose a sombre pillar of indignation agostino i am your mother she reminded me  let us thank god that for that at least you cannot blame me answered i utterly reckless now  the answer crushed her back into her chair she looked appealingly at fra gervasio who stood glum and frowning is he is he perchance bewitched she asked the friar quite seriously do you think that any spells might have  he interrupted her with a wave of the hand and an impatient snort  we are at cross purposes here he said agostino does not lie for that i will answer  but fra gervasio i tell you that i saw themthat i saw them with these two eyessitting together on the terrace steps and he had his arm about her yet he denies it shamelessly to my face  said i ever a word of that i appealed me to the friar why that was after rinolfo left us my tale never got so far it is quite true i did sit beside her the child was troubled i comforted her where was the harm  the harm quoth he and you had your arm about herand you to be a priest one day  and why not pray quoth i is this some new sin that you have discoveredor that you have kept hidden from me until now to console the afflicted is an ordination of mother church to love our fellowcreatures an ordination of our blessed lord himself i was performing both am i to be abused for that  he looked at me very searchingly seeking in my countenanceas i now knowsome trace of irony or guile finding none he turned to my mother he was very solemn  madonna he said quietly i think that agostino is nearer to being a saint than either you or i will ever get  she looked at him first in surprise then very sadly slowly she shook her head unhappily for him there is another arbiter of saintship who sees deeper than do you gervasio  he bowed his head better not to look deep enough than to do as you seem in danger of doing madonna and by looking too deep imagine things which do not exist  ah you will defend him against reason even she complained his anger exists his thirst to killto stamp himself with the brand of cainexists he confesses that himself his insubordination to me you have seen for yourself and that again is sin for it is ordained that we shall honour our parents  o she moaned my authority is all gone he is beyond my control he has shaken off the reins by which i sought to guide him  you had done well to have taken my advice a year ago madonna even now it is not too late let him go to pavia to the sapienza to study his humanities  out into the world she cried in horror o no no i have sheltered him here so carefully  yet you cannot shelter him for ever said he he must go out into the world some day  he need not she faltered if the call were strong enough within him a convent she left her sentence unfinished and looked at me  go agostino she bade me fra gervasio and i must talk  i went reluctantly since in the matter of their talk none could have had a greater interest than i seeing that my fate stood in the balance of it but i went none the less and her last words to me as i was departing were an injunction that i should spend the time until i should take up my studies for the day with fra gervasio in seeking forgiveness for the mornings sins and grace to do better in the future     chapter vi fra gervasio   i did not again see my mother that day nor did she sup with us that evening i was told by fra gervasio that on my account was she in retreat praying for light and guidance in the thing that must be determined concerning me  i withdrew early to my little bedroom overlooking the gardens a room that had more the air of a monastic cell than a bedchamber fitting the estate of the lord of mondolfo the walls were whitewashed and besides the crucifix that hung over my bed their only decoration was a crude painting of st augustine disputing with the little boy on the seashore  for bed i had a plain hard pallet and the room contained in addition a wooden chair a stool upon which was set a steel basin with its ewer for my ablutions and a cupboard for the few sombre black garments i possessedfor the amiable vanity of raiment usual in young men of my years had never yet assailed me i had none to emulate in that respect  i got me to bed blew out my taper and composed myself to sleep but sleep was playing truant from me long i lay there surveying the events of that daythe day in which i had embarked upon the discovery of myself the most stirring day that i had yet lived the day in which although i scarcely realized it if at all i had at once tasted love and battle the strongest meats that are in the dish of life  for some hours i think had i lain there reflecting and putting together pieces of the riddle of existence when my door was softly opened and i started up in bed to behold fra gervasio bearing a taper which he sheltered with one hand so that the light of it was thrown upwards into his pale gaunt face  seeing me astir he came forward and closed the door  what is it i asked  sh he admonished me a finger to his lips he advanced to my side set down the taper on the chair and seated himself upon the edge of my bed  lie down again my son he bade me i have something to say to you  he paused a moment whilst i settled down again and drew the coverlet to my chin not without a certain premonition of important things to come  madonna has decided he informed me then she fears that having once resisted her authority you are now utterly beyond her control and that to keep you here would be bad for yourself and for her therefore she has resolved that tomorrow you leave mondolfo  a faint excitement began to stir in me to leave mondolfoto go out into that world of which i had read so much to mingle with my fellowman with youths of my own age perhaps with maidens like luisina to see cities and the ways of cities here indeed was matter for excitement yet it was an excitement not altogether pleasurable for with my very natural curiosity and with my eagerness to have it gratified were blended certain fears imbibed from the only quality of reading that had been mine  the world was an evil place in which temptations seethed and through which it was difficult to come unscathed therefore i feared the world and the adventuring beyond the shelter of the walls of the castle of mondolfo and yet i desired to judge for myself the evil of which i read the evil which in moments of doubt i even permitted myself to question  my reasoning followed the syllogism that god being good and god having created the world it was not possible that the creation should be evil it was well enough to say that the devil was loose in it but that was not to say that the devil had created it and it would be necessary to prove this ere it could be established that it was evil in itselfas many theologians appeared to seek to showand a place to be avoided  such was the question that very frequently arose in my mind ultimately to be dismissed as a lure of satans to imperil my poor soul it battled for existence now amid my fears and it gained some little ascendancy  and whither am i to go i asked to pavia or to the university of bologna  had my advice been heeded said he one or the other would have been your goal but your mother took counsel with messer arcolano  he shrugged and there was contempt in the lines of his mouth he distrusted arcolano the regular cleric who was my mothers confessor and spiritual adviser exerting over her a very considerable influence she herself had admitted that it was this arcolano who had induced her to that horrid traffic in my fathers life and liberty which she was mercifully spared from putting into effect  messer arcolano he resumed after a pause has a good friend in piacenza a pedagogue a doctor of civil and canon law a man who he says is very learned and very pious named astorre fifanti i have heard of this fifanti and i do not at all agree with messer arcolano i have said so but your mother he broke off it is decided that you go to him at once to take up your study of the humanities under his tutelage and that you abide with him until you are of an age for ordination which your mother hopes will be very soon indeed it is her wish that you should enter the subdeaconate in the autumn and your novitiate next year to fit you for the habit of st augustine  he fell silent adding no comment of any sort as if he waited to hear what of my own accord i might have to urge but my mind was incapable of travelling beyond the fact that i was to go out into the world tomorrow  the circumstance that i should become a monk was no departure from the idea to which i had been trained although explicitly no more than my mere priesthood had been spoken of so i lay there without thinking of any words in which to answer him  gervasio considered me steadily and sighed a little agostino he said presently you are upon the eve of taking a great step a step whose import you may never fully have considered i have been your tutor and your rearing has been my charge that charge i have faithfully carried out as was ordained me but not as i would have carried it out had i been free to follow my heart and my conscience in the matter  the idea of your ultimate priesthood has been so fostered in your mind that you may well have come to believe that to be a priest is your own inherent desire i would have you consider it well now that the time approaches for a step which is irrevocable  his words and his manner startled me alike  how i cried do you say that it might be better if i did not seek ordination what better can the world offer than the priesthood have you not yourself taught me that it is mans noblest calling  to be a good priest fulfilling all the teachings of the master becoming in your turn his mouthpiece living a life of selfabnegation of selfsacrifice and purity he answered slowly that is the noblest thing a man can be but to be a bad priestthere are other ways of being damned less hurtful to the church  to be a bad priest quoth i is it possible to be a bad priest  it is not only possible my son but in these days it is very frequent many men agostino enter the church out of motives of selfseeking through such as these rome has come to be spoken of as the necropolis of the living others agostinoand these are men most worthy of pityenter the church because they are driven to it in youth by illadvised parents i would not have you one of these my son  i stared at him my amazement ever growing do you do you think i am in danger of it i asked  that is a question you must answer for yourself no man can know what is in anothers heart i have trained you as i was bidden train you i have seen you devout increasing in piety and yet he paused and looked at me again it may be that this is no more than the fruit of your training it may be that your piety and devotion are purely intellectual it is very often so men know the precepts of religion as a lawyer knows the law it no more follows out of that that they are religiousthough they conceive that it doesthan it follows that a lawyer is lawabiding it is in the acts of their lives that we must seek their real natures and no single act of your life agostino has yet given sign that the call is in your heart  today for instance at what is almost your first contact with the world you indulge your human feelings to commit a violence that you did not kill is as much an accident as that you broke rinolfos leg i do not say that you did a very sinful thing in a worldly youth of your years the provocation you received would have more than justified your action but not in one who aims at a life of humility and selfforgetfulness such as the priesthood imposes  and yet said i i heard you tell my mother below stairs that i was nearer sainthood than either of you  he smiled sadly and shook his head they were rash words agostino i mistook ignorance for puritya common error i have pondered it since and my reflection brings me to utter what in this household amounts to treason  i do not understand i confessed  my duty to your mother i have discharged more faithfully perhaps than i had the right to do my duty to my god i am discharging now although to you i may rather appear as an advocatus diaboli this duty is to warn you to bid you consider well the step you are to take  listen agostino i am speaking to you out of the bitter experience of a very cruel life i would not have you tread the path i have trodden it seldom leads to happiness in this world or the next it seldom leads anywhere but straight to hell  he paused and i looked into his haggard face in utter stupefaction to hear such words from the lips of one whom i had ever looked upon as goodness incarnate  had i not known that some day i must speak to you as i am speaking now i had long since abandoned a task which i did not consider good but i feared to leave you i feared that if i were removed my place might be taken by some timeserver who to earn a livelihood would tutor you as your mother would have you tutored and thrust you forth without warning upon the life to which you have been vowed  once years ago i was on the point of resisting your mother he passed a hand wearily across his brow it was on the night that gino falcone left us driven forth by her because she accounted it her duty do you remember agostino  o i remember i answered  that night he pursued i was angeredrighteously angered to see so wicked and unchristian an act performed in blasphemous selfrighteousness i was on the point of denouncing the deed as it deserved of denouncing your mother for it to her face and then i remembered you i remembered the love i had borne your father and my duty to him to see that no such wrong was done you in the end as that which i feared i reflected that if i spoke the words that were burning my tongue for utterance i should go as gino falcone had gone  not that the going mattered i could better save my soul elsewhere than here in this atmosphere of christianity misunderstood and there are always convents of my order to afford me shelter but your being abandoned mattered and i felt that if i went abandoned you would be to the influences that drove and moulded you without consideration for your nature and your inborn inclinations therefore i remained and left falcones cause unchampioned later i was to learn that he had found a friend and that he was that he was being cared for  by whom quoth i more interested perhaps in this than in anything that he had yet said  by one who was your fathers friend he said after a moments hesitation a soldier of fortune by name of galeottoa leader of free lances who goes by the name of il gran galeotto but let that be i want to tell you of myself that you may judge with what authority i speak  i was destined agostino for a soldiers life in the following of my valiant fosterbrother your father had i preserved the strength of my early youth undoubtedly a soldiers harness would be strapped here today in the place of this scapulary but it happened that an illness left me sickly and ailing and unfitted me utterly for such a life similarly it unfitted me for the labour of the fields so that i threatened to become a useless burden upon my parents who were peasantfolk to avoid this they determined to make a monk of me they offered me to god because they found me unfitted for the service of man and poor simple selfdeluded folk they accounted that in doing so they did a good and pious thing  i showed aptitude in learning i became interested in the things i studied i was absorbed by them in fact and never gave a thought to the future i submitted without question to the wishes of my parents and before i awakened to a sense of what was done and what i was myself i was in orders  he sank his voice impressively as he concludedfor ten years thereafter agostino i wore a hairshirt day and night and for girdle a knotted length of whipcord in which were embedded thorns that stung and chafed me and tore my body for ten years then i never knew bodily ease or proper rest at night only thus could i bring into subjection my rebellious flesh and save myself from the way of ordinary men which to me must have been a path of sacrilege and sin i was devout had i not been devout and strong in my devotion i could never have endured what i was forced to endure as the alternative to damnation because without consideration for my nature i had been ordained a priest  consider this agostino consider it well i would not have you go that way nor feel the need to drive yourself from temptation by such a spur because i knowi say it in all humility agostino i hope and thanking god for the exceptional grace he vouchsafed me to support methat for one priest without vocation who can quench temptation by such agonizing means a hundred perish which is bad and by the scandal of their example they drive many from the church and set a weapon in the hands of her enemies which is a still heavier reckoning to meet hereafter  a spell of silence followed i was strangely moved by his tale strangely impressed by the warning that i perceived in it and yet my confidence i think was all unshaken  and when presently he rose took up his taper and stood by my bedside to ask me once again did i believe myself to be called i showed my confidence in my answer  it is my hope and prayer that i am called indeed i said the life that will best prepare me for the world to come is the life i would follow  he looked at me long and sadly you must do as your heart bids you he sighed and when you have seen the world your heart will have learnt to speak to you more plainly and upon that he left me  next day i set out  my leavetakings were brief my mother shed some tears and many prayers over me at parting not that she was moved to any grief at losing me that were a grief i should respect and the memory of which i should treasure as a sacred thing her tears were tears of dread lest surrounded by perils in the world i should succumb and thus falsify her vows  she herself confessed it in the valedictory words she addressed to me words that left the conviction clear upon my mind that the fulfilment of her vow was the only thing concerning me that mattered to the price that later might be paid for it i cannot think that she ever gave a single thought  tears there were too in the eyes of fra gervasio my mother had suffered me to do no more than kiss her handas was my custom but the friar took me to his bosom and held me tight a moment in his long arms  remember he murmured huskily and impressively and then putting me from him god help and guide you my son were his last words  i went down the steps into the courtyard where most of the servants were gathered to see their lords departure whilst messer arcolano who was to go with me paused to assure my mother of the care that he would have of me and to receive her final commands concerning me  four men mounted and armed stood waiting to escort us and with them were three mules one for arcolano one for myself and the third already laden with my baggage  a servant held my stirrup and i swung myself up into the saddle with which i was but indifferently acquainted then arcolano mounted too puffing over the effort for he was a corpulent rubicund man with the fattest hands i have ever seen  i touched my mule with the whip and the beast began to move arcolano ambled beside me and behind us abreast came the menatarms thus we rode down towards the gateway and as we went the servants murmured their valedictory words  a safe journey madonnino  a good return madonnino  i smiled back at them and in the eyes of more than one i detected a look of commiseration  once i turned when the end of the quadrangle was reached and i waved my cap to my mother and fra gervasio who stood upon the steps where i had left them the friar responded by waving back to me but my mother made no sign likely enough her eyes were upon the ground again already  her unresponsiveness almost angered me i felt that a man had the right to some slight display of tenderness from the woman who had borne him her frigidity wounded me it wounded me the more in comparison with the affectionate clasp of old gervasios arms with a knot in my throat i passed from the sunlight of the courtyard into the gloom of the gateway and out again beyond upon the drawbridge our hooves thudded briskly upon the timbers and then with a sharper note upon the cobbles beyond  i was outside the walls of the castle for the first time before me the long rudely paved street of the borgo sloped away to the marketplace of the town of mondolfo beyond that lay the world itselfall at my feet as i imagined  the knot in my throat was dissolved my pulses quickened with anticipation i dug my heels into the mules belly and pushed on the portly cleric at my side  and thus i left my home and the gloomy sorrowful influence of my most dolorous mother       book ii giuliana     chapter i the house of astorre fifanti let me not follow in too close detail the incidents of that journey lest i be in danger of becoming tedious in themselves they contained laughable matter enough but in the mere relation they may seem dull  down the borgo ahead of us ran the rumour that here was the madonnino of mondolfo and the excitement that the announcement caused was something at which i did not know whether to be flattered or offended  the houses gave up their inhabitants and all stood at gaze as we passed to behold for the first time this lord of theirs of whom they had heard heaven knows what storiesfor where there are elements of mystery human invention can be very active  at first so many eyes confused me so that i kept my own steadily upon the glossy neck of my mule very soon however growing accustomed to being stared at i lost some of my shyness and now it was that i became a trouble to messer arcolano for as i looked about me there were a hundred things to hold my attention and to call for inquiry and nearer inspection  we had come by this into the marketplace and it chanced that it was a marketday and that the square was thronged with peasants from the val di taro who had come to sell their produce and to buy their necessaries  i was for halting at each booth and inspecting the wares and each time that i made as if to do so the obsequious peasantry fell away before me making way invitingly but messer arcolano urged me along saying that we had far to go and that in piacenza there were better shops and that i should have more time to view them  then it was the fountain with its surmounting statues that caught my eyedurfrenos arresting vigorous group of the laocoonand i must draw rein and cry out in my amazement at so wonderful a piece of work plaguing arcolano with a score of questions concerning the identity of the main figure and how he came beset by so monstrous a reptile and whether he had succeeded in the end in his attempt to strangle it  arcolano out of patience by now answered me shortly that the reptile was the sculptors pious symbolization of sin which st hercules was overcoming  i am by no means sure that such was not indeed his own conception of the matter and that there did not exist in his mind some confusion as to whether the pagan demigod had a place in the calendar or not for he was an uncultured plebeian fellow and what my mother should have found in him to induce her to prefer him for her confessor and spiritual counsellor to the learned fra gervasio is one more of the many mysteries which an attempt to understand her must ever present to me  then there were the young peasant girls who thronged about and stood in groups blushing furiously under my glance which arcolano vainly bade me lower a score of times did it seem to me that one of these brownlegged lithe comely creatures was my little luisina and more than once i was on the point of addressing one or another to discover my mistake and be admonished for my astounding frivolousness by messer arcolano  and when once or twice i returned the friendly laughter of these girls whilst the grinning servingmen behind me would nudge one another and wink to see meas they thoughtso very far off the road to priesthood to which i was vowed hot anathema poured from the fat clerics lips and he urged me roughly to go faster  his tortures ended at last when we came into the open country we rode in silence for a mile or two i being full of thought of all that i had seen and infected a little by the fever of life through which i had just passed at last i remember that i turned to arcolano who was riding with the ears of his mule in line with my saddlebow and asked him to point out to me where my dominions ended  the meek question provoked an astonishingly churlish answer i was shortly bidden to give my mind to other than worldly things and with that he began a homily which lasted for many a weary mile upon the vanities of the world and the glories of paradisea homily of the very tritest upon subjects whereupon i myself could have dilated to better purpose than could his ignorance  the distance from mondolfo to piacenza is a good eight leagues and though we had set out very early it was past noon before we caught our first glimpse of the city by the po lying low as it does in the vast aemilian plain and arcolano set himself to name to me this church and that whose spires stood out against the cobalt background of the sky  an hour or so after our first glimpse of the city our weary beasts brought us up to the gate of san lazzaro but we did not enter as i had hoped messer arcolano had had enough of me and my questions at mondolfo and he was not minded to expose himself to worse behaviour on my part in the more interesting thoroughfares of this great city  so we passed it by and rode under the very walls by way of an avenue of flowering chestnuts round to the northern side until we emerged suddenly upon the sands of po and i had my first view at close quarters of that mighty river flowing gently about the islands all thick with willows that seemed to float upon its gleaming waters  fishermen were at work in a boat out in midstream heaving their nets to the sound of the oddest cantilena and i was all for pausing there to watch their operations but arcolano urged me onward with that impatience of his which took no account of my very natural curiosity presently i drew rein again with exclamations of delight and surprise to see the wonderful bridge of boats that spanned the river a little higher up  but we had reached our destination arcolano called a halt at the gates of a villa that stood a little way back from the road on slightly rising ground near the fodesta gate he bade one of the grooms get down and open and presently we ambled up a short avenue between tall banks of laurel to the steps of the villa itself  it was a house of fair proportions though to me at the time accustomed to the vast spaces of mondolfo it seemed the merest hut it was painted white and it had green venetian shutters which gave it a cool and pleasant air and through one of the open windows floated a sound of merry voices in which a womans laugh was predominant  the double doors stood open and through these there emerged a moment after our halting a tall thin man whose restless eyes surveyed us swiftly whose thinlipped mouth smiled a greeting to messer arcolano in the pause he made before hurrying down the steps with a slipslop of illfitting shoes  this was messer astorre fifanti the pedant under whom i was to study and with whom i was to take up my residence for some months to come  seeing in him one who was to be set in authority over me i surveyed him with the profoundest interest and from that instant i disliked him  he was as i have said a tall thin man and he had long hands that were very big and bony in the knuckles indeed they looked like monstrous skeleton hands with a glove of skin stretched over them he was quite bald save for a curly grizzled fringe that surrounded the back of his head on a level with his enormous ears and his forehead ran up to the summit of his eggshaped head his nose was pendulous and his eyes were closely set with too crafty a look for honesty he wore no beard and his leathery cheeks were blue from the razor his age may have been fifty his air was mean and sycophantic finally he was dressed in a black gaberdine that descended to his knees and he ended in a pair of the leanest shanks and largest feet conceivable  to greet us he fawned and washed his bony hands in the air  you have made a safe journey then he purred benedicamus dominum  deo gratias rumbled the fat priest as he heaved his rotundity from the saddle with the assistance of one of the grooms  they shook hands and fifanti turned to survey me for the second time  and this is my noble charge said he salve be welcome to my house messer agostino  i got to earth accepted his proffered hand and thanked him  meanwhile the grooms were unpacking my baggage and from the house came hurrying an elderly servant to receive it and convey it within doors  i stood there a little awkwardly shifting from leg to leg what time doctor fifanti pressed arcolano to come within and rest he spoke too of some vesuvian wine that had been sent him from the south and upon which he desired the priests rare judgment  arcolano hesitated and his gluttonous mouth quivered and twitched but he excused himself in the end he must on he had business to discharge in the town and he must return at once and render an account of our safe journey to the countess at mondolfo if he tarried now it would grow late ere he reached mondolfo and late travelling pleased him not at all as it was his bones would be weary and his flesh tender from so much riding but he would offer it up to heaven for his sins  and when the tooamiable fifanti had protested how little there could be the need in the case of one so saintly as messer arcolano the priest made his farewells he gave me his blessing and enjoined upon me obedience to one who stood to me in loco parentis heaved himself back on to his mule and departed with the grooms at his heels  then doctor fifanti set a bony hand upon my shoulder and opined that after my journey i must be in need of refreshment and with that he led me within doors assuring me that in his house the needs of the body were as closely cared for as the needs of the mind  for an empty belly he ended with his odious sycophantic geniality makes an empty heart and an empty head  we passed through a hall that was prettily paved in mosaics into a chamber of good proportions which seemed gay to me after the gloom by which i had been surrounded  the ceiling was painted blue and flecked with golden stars whilst the walls were hung with deep blue tapestries on which was figured in grey and brownish red a scene which i was subsequently to learn represented the metamorphosis of actaeon at the moment i did not look too closely the figures of diana in her bath with her plump attendant nymphs caused me quickly to withdraw my bashful eyes  a goodsized table stood in the middle of the floor bearing upon a broad strip of embroidered white napery sparkling crystal and silver vessels of wine and platters of early fruits about it sat a very noble company of some halfdozen men and two very resplendent women one of these was slight and little very dark and vivacious with eyes full of a malicious humour the other of very noble proportions of a fine willowy height with coiled ropes of hair of a colour such as i had never dreamed could be found upon human being it was ruddy and glowed like metal her face and neckand of the latter there was a very considerable displaywere of the warm pale tint of old ivory she had large lowlidded eyes which lent her face a languid air her brow was low and broad and her lips of a most startling red against the pallor of the rest  she rose instantly upon my entrance and came towards me with a slow smile holding out her hand and murmuring words of most courteous welcome  this ser agostino said fifanti is my wife  had he announced her to be his daughter it would have been more credible on the score of their respective years though equally incredible on the score of their respective personalities  i gaped foolishly in my amazement a little dazzled too by the effulgence of her eyes which were now raised to the level of my own i lowered my glance abashed and answered her as courteously as i could then she led me to the table and presented me to the company naming each to me  the first was a slim and very dainty young gentleman in a scarlet walkingsuit over which he wore a long scarlet mantle a gold cross was suspended from his neck by a massive chain of gold he was delicately featured with a little pointed beard tiny mustachios and long fair hair that fell in waves about his effeminate face he had the whitest of hands very delicately veined in blue and it wasas i soon observedhis habit to carry them raised so that the blood might not flow into them to coarsen their beauty attached to his left wrist by a fine chain was a gold pomanderball of the size of a small apple very beautifully chiselled upon one of his fingers he wore the enormous sapphire ring of his rank  that he was a prince of the church i saw for myself but i was far from being prepared for the revelation of his true eminencenever dreaming that a man of the humble position of doctor fifanti would entertain a guest so exalted  he was no less a person than the lord egidio oberto gambara cardinal of brescia governor of piacenza and papal legate to cisalpine gaul  the revelation of the identity of this elegant effeminate perfumed personage was a shock to me for it was not thus by much that i had pictured the representative of our holy father the pope  he smiled upon me amiably and something wearily the satiate smile of the man of the world and he languidly held out to me the hand bearing his ring i knelt to kiss it overawed by his ecclesiastical rank however little awed by the man within it  as i rose again he looked up at me considering my inches  why said he here is a fine soldier lost to glory and as he spoke he half turned to a young man who sat beside him a man at whom i was eager to take a fuller look for his face was most strangely familiar to me  he was tall and graceful very beautifully dressed in purple and gold and his blueblack hair was held in a net or coif of finest gold thread his garments clung as tightly and smoothly as if he had been kneaded into themas indeed he had but it was his face that held my eyes it was a suntanned shaven hawkface with black level brows black eyes and a strong jaw handsome save for something displeasing in the lines of the mouth something sardonic proud and contemptuous  the cardinal addressed him you breed fine fellows in your family cosimo were the words with which he startled me and then i knew where i had seen that face before in my mirror  he was as like mesave that he was blacker and not so tallas if he had been own brother to me instead of merely cousin as i knew at once he was for he must be that guelphic anguissola renegade who served the pope and was high in favour with farnese and captain of justice in piacenza in age he may have been some seven or eight years older than myself  i stared at him now with interest and i found attractions in him the chief of which was his likeness to my father so must my father have looked when he was this fellows age he returned my glance with a smile that did not improve his countenance so contemptuously languid was it so very supercilious  you may stare cousin said he for i think i do you the honour to be something like you  you will find him lisped the cardinal to me the most selfcomplacent dog in italy when he sees in you a likeness to himself he flatters himself grossly which as you know him better you will discover to be his inveterate habit he is his own most assiduous courtier and my lord gambara sank back into his chair languishing the pomander to his nostrils  all laughed and messer cosimo with them still considering me  but messer fifantis wife had yet to make me known to three others who sat there beside the little sloeeyed lady this last was a cousin of her owndonna leocadia degli allogati whom i saw now for the first and last time  the three remaining men of the company are of little interest save one whose name was to be well knownnay was well known already though not to one who had lived in such seclusion as mine  this was that fine poet annibale caro whom i have heard judged to be all but the equal of the great petrarca himself a man who had less the air of a poet it would not be easy to conceive he was of middle height and of a habit of body inclining to portliness and his age may have been forty his face was bearded ruddy and smallfeatured and there was about him an air of smug prosperity he was dressed with care but he had none of the splendour of the cardinal or my cousin let me add that he was secretary to the duke pier luigi farnese and that he was here in piacenza on a mission to the governor in which his masters interests were concerned  the other two who completed that company are of no account and indeed their names escape me though i seem to remember that one was named pacini and that he was said to be a philosopher of considerable parts  bidden to table by messer fifanti i took the chair he offered me beside his lady and presently came the old servant whom already i had seen bearing meat for me i was hungry and i fell to with zest what time a pleasant ripple of talk ran round the board facing me sat my cousin and i never observed until my hunger was become less clamorous with what an insistence he regarded me at last however our eyes met across the board he smiled that crooked somewhat unpleasant smile of his  and so ser agostino they are to make a priest of you said he  god pleasing i answered soberly and perhaps shortly  and if his brains at all resemble his body lisped the cardinallegate you may live to see an anguissola pope my cosimo  my stare must have betrayed my amazement at such words not so magnificent i made answer i am destined for the life monastic  monastic quoth he in a sort of horror and looking as if a bad smell had suddenly been thrust under his nose he shrugged and pouted and had fresh recourse to his pomander o well friars have become popes before today  i am to enter the hermit order of st augustine i again corrected  ah said caro in his big full voice he aspires not to rome but to heaven my lord  then what the devil does he in your house fifanti quoth the cardinal are you to teach him sanctity  and the table shook with laughter at a jest i did not understand any more than i understood my lord cardinal  messer fifanti sitting at the tablehead shot me a glance of anxious inquiry he smiled foolishly and washed his hands in the air again his mind fumbling for an answer that should turn aside that barbed jest but he was forestalled by my cousin cosimo  the teaching might come more aptly from monna giuliana said he and smiled very boldly across at fifantis lady who sat beside me whilst a frown grew upon the prodigious brow of the pedant  indeed indeed the cardinal murmured considering her through halfclosed eyes there is no man but may enter paradise at her bidding and he sighed furiously whilst she chid him for his boldness and for all that much of what they said was in a language that might have been unknown to me yet was i lost in amazement to see a prelate made so free with she turned to me and the glory of her eyes fell about my soul like an effulgence  do not heed them ser agostino they are profane and wicked men she said and if you aspire to holiness the less you see of them the better will it be for you  i did not doubt it yet i dared not make so bold as to confess it and i wondered why they should laugh to hear her earnest censure of them  it is a thorny path this path of holiness said the cardinal sighing  your excellency has been told so we assume quoth caro who had a very bitter tongue for one who looked so wellnourished and contented  i might have found it so for myself but that my lot has been cast among sinners answered the cardinal comprehending the company in his glance and gesture as it is i do what i can to mend their lot  now here is gallantry of a different sort cried the little leocadia with a giggle  o as to that quoth cosimo showing his fine teeth in a smile there is a proverb as to the gallantry of priests it is like the love of women which again is like water in a basketas soon in as out and his eyes hung upon giuliana  when you are the basket sir captain shall anyone blame the women she countered with her lazy insolence  body of god cried the cardinal and laughed wholeheartedly whilst my cousin scowled there you have the truth cosimo and the truth is better than proverbs  it is unlucky to speak of the dead at table put in caro  and who spoke of the dead messer annibale quoth leocadia  did not my lord cardinal mention truth answered the brutal poet  you are a deridera gross sinner said the cardinal languidly stick to your verses man and leave truth alone  agreedif your excellency will stick to truth and quit writing verses i offer the compact in the interest of humanity which will be the gainer  the company shook with laughter at this direct and offensive hit but my lord gambara seemed nowise incensed indeed i was beginning to conclude that the man had a sweetness and tolerance of nature that bordered on the saintly  he sipped his wine thoughtfully and held it up to the light so that the deep ruby of it sparkled in the venetian crystal  you remind me that i have written a new song said he  then have i sinned indeed groaned caro  but gambara disregarding the interruption his glass still raised his mild eyes upon the wine began to recite       bacchus saepe visitans       mulierum genus       facit eas subditas       tibi o tu venus  without completely understanding it yet scandalized beyond measure at as much as i understood to hear such sentiments upon his priestly lips i stared at him in candid horror  but he got no farther caro smote the table with his fist  when wrote you that my lord he cried  when quoth the cardinal frowning at the interruption why yestereve  ha it was something between a bark and a laugh from messer caro in that case my lord memory usurped the place of invention that song was sung at pavia when i was a studentwhich is more years ago than i care to think of  the cardinal smiled upon him unabashed and what then pray can we avoid these things why the very virgil whom you plagiarize so freely was himself a plagiarist  now this as you may well conceive provoked a discussion about the board in which all joined not excepting fifantis lady and donna leocadia  i listened in some amazement and deep interest to matters that were entirely strange to me to the arguing of mysteries which seemed to meeven from what i heard of themto be strangely attractive  anon fifanti joined in the discussion and i observed how as soon as he began to speak they all fell silent all listened to him as to a master what time he delivered himself of his opinions and criticisms of this virgil with a force a lucidity and an eloquence that revealed his learning even to one so ignorant as myself  he was listened to with deference by all if we except perhaps my lord gambara who had no respect for anything and who preferred to whisper to leocadia under cover of his hand ogling her what time she simpered once or twice monna giuliana flashed him an unfriendly glance and this i accounted natural deeming that she resented this lack of attention to the erudite dissertation of her husband  but as for the others they were attentive as i have said and even messer caro who at the timeas i gathered thenwas engaged upon a translation of virgil into tuscan and who therefore might be accounted something of an authority held his peace and listened what time the doctor reasoned and discoursed  fifantis mean sycophantic air fell away from him as by magic warmed by his subject and his enthusiasm he seemed suddenly ennobled and i found him less antipathic indeed i began to see something admirable in the man some of that divine quality that only deep culture and learning can impart  i conceived that now at last i held the explanation of how it came to pass that so distinguished a company frequented his house and gathered on such familiar terms about his board  and i began to be less amazed at the circumstance that he should possess for wife so beautiful and superb a creature as madonna giuliana i thought that i obtained glimpses of the charm which that elderly man might be able to exert upon a fine and cultured young nature with aspirations for things above the commonplace     chapter ii humanities   as the days passed and swelled into weeks and these in their turn accumulated into months i grew rapidly learned in worldly matters at doctor fifantis house  the curriculum i now pursued was so vastly different from that which my mother had bidden fra gervasio to set me and my acquaintance with the profane writers advanced so swiftly once it was engaged upon that i acquired knowledge as a weed grows  fifanti flung into strange passions when he discovered the extent of my ignorance and the amazing circumstance that whilst fra gervasio had made of me a fluent latin scholar he had kept me in utter ignorance of the classic writers and almost in as great an ignorance of history itself this the pedant set himself at once to redress and amongst the earliest works he gave me as preparation were latin translations of thucydides and herodotus which i devouredespecially the glowing pages of the latterat a speed that alarmed my tutor  but mere studiousness was not my spur as he imagined i was enthralled by the novelty of the matters that i read so different from all those with which i had been allowed to become acquainted hitherto  there followed tacitus and after him cicero and livy which latter two i found less arresting then came lucretius and his de rerum naturae proved a succulent dish to my inquisitive appetite  but the cream and glory of the ancient writers i had yet to taste my first acquaintance with the poets came from the translation of virgil upon which messer caro was at the time engaged he had definitely taken up his residence in piacenza whither it was said that farnese his master who was to be made our duke would shortly come and in the interval of labouring for farnese as caro was doing he would toil at his translation and from time to time he would bring sheaves of his manuscript to the doctors house to read what he had accomplished  he came i remember one languid afternoon in august when i had been with messer fifanti for close upon three months during which time my mind had gradually yet swiftly been opening out like a bud under the sunlight of much new learning we sat in the fine garden behind the house on the lawn in the shade of mulberry trees laden with yellow translucent fruit by a pond that was all afloat with waterlilies  there was a crescentshaped seat of hewn marble over which messer gambara who was with us had thrown his scarlet cardinals cloak the day being oppressively hot he was as usual in plain walking clothes and save for the ring on his finger and the cross on his breast you had never conceived him an ecclesiastic he sat near his cloak upon the marble seat and beside him sat monna giuliana who was all in white save for the gold girdle at her waist  caro himself stood to read his bulky manuscript in his hands against the sundial facing the poet leaned the tall figure of messer fifanti his bald head uncovered and shining humidly his eyes ever and anon stealing a look at his splendid wife where she sat so demurely at the prelates side  myself i lay on the grass near the pond my hand trailing in the cool water and at first i was not greatly interested the heat of the day and the circumstance that we had dined when played upon by the poets booming and somewhat monotonous voice had a lulling effect from which i was in danger of falling asleep but anon as the narrative warmed and quickened the danger was well overpast i was very wideawake my pulses throbbing my imagination all on fire i sat up and listened with an enthralled attention unconscious of everything and everybody unconscious even of the very voice of the reader intent only upon the amazing tragic matter that he read  for it happened that this was the fourth book of the aeneid and the most lamentable heartrending story of didos love for aeneas of his desertion of her of her grief and death upon the funeral pyre  it held me spellbound it was more real then anything that i had ever read or heard and the fate of dido moved me as if i had known and loved her so that long ere messer caro came to an end i was weeping freely in a most exquisite misery  thereafter i was as one who has tasted strong wine and finds his thirst fired by it within a week i had read the aeneid through and was reading it a second time then came the comedies of terence the metamorphoses of ovid martial and the satires of juvenal and with those my transformation was complete no longer could i find satisfaction in the writings of the fathers of the church or in contemplating the lives of the saints after the pageantries which the eyes of my soul had looked upon in the profane authors  what instructions my mother supposed fifanti to have received concerning me from arcolano i cannot think but certain it is that she could never have dreamed under what influences i was so soon to come no more than she could conceive what havoc they played with all that hitherto i had learnt and with the resolutions that i had formedand that she had formed for meconcerning the future  all this reading perturbed me very oddly as one is perturbed who having long dwelt in darkness is suddenly brought into the sunlight and dazzled by it so that grown conscious of his sight he is more effectively blinded than he was before for the process that should have been a gradual one from tender years was carried through in what amounted to little more than a few weeks  my lord gambara took an odd interest in me he was something of a philosopher in his trivial way something of a student of his fellowman and he looked upon me as an odd human growth that was being subjected to an unusual experiment i think he took a certain delight in helping that experiment forward and certain it is that he had more to do with the debauching of my mind than any other or than any reading that i did  it was not that he told me more than elsewhere i could have learnt it was the cynical manner in which he conveyed his information he had a way of telling me of monstrous things as if they were purely normal and natural to a properly focussed eye and as if any monstrousness they might present to me were due to some distortion imparted to them solely by the imperfection of my intellectual vision  thus it was from him that i learnt certain unsuspected things concerning pier luigi farnese who it was said was coming to be our duke and on whose behalf the emperor was being importuned to invest him in the duchy of parma and piacenza  one day as we walked together in the gardenmy lord gambara and ii asked him plainly what was messer farneses claim  his claim quoth he checking to give me a long cool stare he laughed shortly and resumed his pacing i keeping step with him why is he not the popes son and is not that claim enough  the popes son i exclaimed but how is it possible that the holy father should have a son  how is it possible he echoed mockingly why i will tell you sir when our present holy father went as cardinallegate to the mark of ancona he met there a certain lady whose name was lola who pleased him and who was pleased with him alessandro farnese was a handsome man ser agostino she bore him three children of whom one is dead another is madonna costanza who is wed to sforza of santafiora and the thirdwho really happens to have been the firstbornis messer pier luigi present duke of castro and future duke of piacenza  it was some time ere i could speak  but his vows then i exclaimed at last  ah his vows said the cardinallegate true there were his vows i had forgotten that no doubt he did the same and he smiled sardonically sniffing at his pomanderball  from that beginning in a fresh branch of knowledge much followed quickly under my questionings messer gambara very readily made me acquainted through his unsparing eyes with that cesspool that was known as the roman curia and my horror my disillusionment increased at every word he said  i learnt from him that pope paul iii was no exception to the rule no such scandal as i had imagined that his own elevation to the purple was due in origin to the favour which his sister the beautiful giulia had found in the eyes of the borgia pope some fifty years ago through him i came to know the sacred college as it really was not the very home and fount of christianity as i had deemed it controlled and guided by men of a sublime saintliness of ways but a gathering of ambitious worldlings who had become so brazen in their greed of temporal power that they did not even trouble to cloak the sin and evil in which they lived men in whom the spirit that had actuated those saints the study of whose lives had been my early delight lived no more than it might live in the bosom of a harlot  i said so to him one day in a wild furious access of boldness in one of those passionate outbursts that are begotten of illusions blighted  he heard me through quite calmly without the least trace of anger smiling ever his quiet mocking smile and plucking at his little auburn beard  you are wrong i think he said say that the church has fallen a prey to selfseekers who have entered it under the cloak of the priesthood what then in their hands the church has been enriched she has gained power which she must retain and that is to the churchs good  and what of the scandal of it i stormed  o as to thatwhy boy have you never read boccaccio  never said i  read him then he urged me he will teach you much that you need to know and read in particular the story of abraam the jew who upon visiting rome was so scandalized by the licence and luxury of the clergy that he straightway had himself baptized and became a christian accounting that a religion that could survive such wiles of satan to destroy it must indeed be the true religion divinely inspired he laughed his little cynical laugh to see my confusion increased by that bitter paradox  it is little wonder that i was all bewildered that i was like some poor mariner upon unknown waters without stars or compass  thus that summer ebbed slowly and the time of my projected minor ordination approached messer gambaras visits to fifantis grew more and more frequent until they became a daily occurrence and now my cousin cosimo came oftener too but it was their custom to come in the forenoon when i was at work with fifanti and often i observed the doctor to be oddly preoccupied and to spend much time in creeping to the window that was all wreathed in clematis and in peeping through that purpledecked green curtain into the garden where his excellency and cosimo walked with monna giuliana  when both visitors were there his anxiety seemed less but if only one were present he would give himself no peace and once when messer gambara and she went together within doors he abruptly interrupted my studies saying that it was enough for that day and he went below to join them  half a year earlier i should have had no solution for his strange behaviour but i had learnt enough of the world by now to perceive what maggot was stirring in that eggshaped head yet i blushed for him and for his foul and unworthy suspicions as soon would i have suspected the painted madonna from the brush of raffaele santi that i had seen over the high altar of the church of san sisto as suspect the beautiful and noblesouled giuliana of giving that old pedant cause for his uneasiness still i conceived that this was the penalty that such a withered growth of humanity must pay for having presumed to marry a young wife  we were much together in those days monna giuliana and i our intimacy had grown over a little incident that it were well i should mention  a young painter gianantonio regillo better known to the world as il pordenone had come to piacenza that summer to decorate the church of santa maria della campagna he came furnished with letters to the governor and gambara had brought him to fifantis villa from monna giuliana the young painter heard the curious story of my having been vowed prenatally to the cloister by my mother learnt her name and mine and the hope that was entertained that i should walk in the ways of st augustine after whom i had been christened  it happened that he was about to paint a picture of st augustine as a fresco for the chapel of the magi of the church i have named and having seen me and heard that story of mine he conceived the curious notion of using me as the model for the figure of the saint i consented and daily for a week he came to us in the afternoons to paint and all the time monna giuliana would be with us deeply interested in his work  that picture he eventually transferred to his fresco and thereo bitter ironyyou may see me to this day as the saint in whose ways it was desired that i should follow  monna giuliana and i would linger together in talk after the painter had gone and this would be at about the time that i had my first lessons of curial life from my lord gambara you will remember that he mentioned boccaccio to me and i chanced to ask her was there in the library a copy of that authors tales  has that wicked priest bidden you to read them she inquired twixt seriousness and mockery her dark eyes upon me in one of those glances that never left me easy  i told her what had passed and with a sigh and a comment that i would get an indigestion from so much mental nourishment as i was consuming she led me to the little library to find the book  messer fifantis was a very choice collection of works and every one in manuscript for the doctor was something of an idealist and greatly averse to the printingpress and the wide dissemination of books to which it led out of his opposition to the machine grew a dislike to its productions which he denounced as vulgar and not even their comparative cheapness and the fact that when all was said he was a man of limited means would induce him to harbour a single volume that was so produced  along the shelves she sought and finally drew down four heavy tomes turning the pages of the first she found there with a readiness that argued a good acquaintance with the work the story of abraam the jew which i desired to read as it had been set down she bade me read it aloud which i did she seated in the window listening to me  at first i read with some constraint and shyness but presently warming to my task and growing interested i became animated and vivacious in my manner so that when i ceased i saw her sitting there her hands clasped about one knee her eyes upon my face her lips parted a little the very picture of interest  and with that it happened that we established a custom and very often almost daily after dinner we would repair together to the library and iwho hitherto had no acquaintance with any save latin worksbegan to make and soon to widen my knowledge of our tuscan writers we varied our reading we dipped into our poets dante we read and petrarca and both we loved though better than the works of eitherand this for the sake of the swift movement and action that is in his narrative though his melodies i realized were not so purethe orlando of ariosto  sometimes we would be joined by fifanti himself but he never stayed very long he had an oldfashioned contempt for writings in what he called the dialettale and he loved the solemn injuvenations of the latin tongue soon as he listened he would begin to yawn and presently grunt and rise and depart flinging a contemptuous word at the matter of my reading and telling me at times that i might find more profitable amusement  but i persisted in it guided ever by fifantis lady and whatever we read by way of divergence ever and anon we would come back to the stilted lucid vivid pages of boccaccio  one day i chanced upon the tragical story of isabetta and the pot of basil and whilst i read i was conscious that she had moved from where she had been sitting and had come to stand behind my chair and when i reached the point at which the heartbroken isabetta takes the head of her murdered lover to her room a tear fell suddenly upon my hand  i stopped and looked up at giuliana she smiled at me through unshed tears that magnified her matchless eyes  i will read no more i said it is too sad  ah no she begged read on agostino i love its sadness  so i read on to the storys cruel end and when it was done i sat quite still myself a little moved by the tragedy of it whilst giuliana continued to lean against my chair i was moved too in another way curiously and unaccountably and i could scarcely have defined what it was that moved me  i sought to break the spell of it and turned the pages let me read something else said i something more gay to dispel the sadness of this  but her hand fell suddenly upon mine enclasping and holding it ah no she begged me gently give me the book let us read no more today  i was trembling under her touchtrembling my every nerve aquiver and my breath shortenedand suddenly there flashed through my mind a line of dantes in the story of paolo and francesca       quel giorno piu non vi leggemo avanti  giulianas words let us read no more todayhad seemed an echo of that line and the echo made me of a sudden conscious of an unsuspected parallel all at once our position seemed to me strangely similar to that of the illstarred lovers of rimini  but the next moment i was sane again she had withdrawn her hand and had taken the volume to restore it to its shelf  ah no at rimini there had been two fools here there was but one let me make an end of him by persuading him of his folly  yet giuliana did nothing to assist me in that task she returned from the bookshelf and in passing lightly swept her fingers over my hair  come agostino let us walk in the garden said she  we went my mood now overpast i was as sober and selfcontained as was my habit and soon thereafter came my lord gambaraa rare thing to happen in the afternoon  awhile the three of us were together in the garden talking of trivial matters then she fell to wrangling with him concerning something that caro had written and of which she had the manuscript in the end she begged me would i go seek the writing in her chamber i went and hunted where she had bidden me and elsewhere and spent a good ten minutes vainly in the task chagrined that i could not discover the thing i went into the library thinking that it might be there  doctor fifanti was writing busily at the table when i intruded he looked up thrusting his hornrimmed spectacles high upon his peaked forehead  what the devil quoth he very testily i thought you were in the garden with madonna giuliana  my lord gambara is there said i  he crimsoned and banged the table with his bony hand do i not know that he roared though i could see no reason for all this heat and why are you not with them  you are not to suppose that i was still the meek sheepish lad who had come to piacenza three months ago i had not been learning my world and discovering man to no purpose all this while  it has yet to be explained to me said i under what obligation i am to be anywhere but where i please that firstly secondlybut of infinitely lesser momentmonna giuliana has sent me for the manuscript of messer caros gigli doro  i know not whether it was my cool firm tones that quieted him but quiet he became  i i was vexed by your interruption he said lamely to explain his late choler here is the thing i found it here when i came messer caro might discover better employment for his leisure but there therehe seemed in sudden haste again take it to her in gods name she will be impatient i thought he sneered o she will praise your diligence he added and this time i was sure that he sneered  i took it thanked him and left the room intrigued and when i rejoined them and handed her the manuscript the odd thing was that the subject of their discourse having meanwhile shifted it no longer interested her and she never once opened the pages she had been in such haste to have me procure  this too was puzzling even to one who was beginning to know his world  but i was not done with riddles for presently out came fifanti himself looking if possible yellower and more sour and lean than usual he was arrayed in his long rusty gown and there were the usual shabby slippers on his long lean feet he was ever a man of most indifferent personal habits  ah astorre his wife greeted him my lord cardinal brings you good tidings  does he so quoth fifanti sourly as i thought and he looked at the legate as though his excellency were the very reverse of a happy harbinger  you will rejoice i think doctor said the smiling prelate to hear that i have letters from my lord pier luigi appointing you one of the ducal secretaries and this i doubt not will be followed on his coming hither by an appointment to his council meanwhile the stipend is three hundred ducats and the work is light  there followed a long and baffling silence during which the doctor grew first red then pale then red again and messer gambara stood with his scarlet cloak sweeping about his shapely limbs sniffing his pomander and smiling almost insolently into the others face and some of the insolence of his look i thought was reflected upon the pale placid countenance of giuliana  at last fifanti spoke his little eyes narrowing  it is too much for my poor deserts he said curtly  you are too humble said the prelate your loyalty to the house of farnese and the hospitality which i its deputy have received  hospitality barked fifanti and looked very oddly at giuliana so oddly that a faint colour began to creep into her cheeks you would pay for that he questioned half mockingly oh but for that a stipend of three hundred ducats is too little  and all the time his eyes were upon his wife and i saw her stiffen as if she had been struck  but the cardinal laughed outright come now you use me with an amiable frankness he said the stipend shall be doubled when you join the council  doubled he said six hundred he checked the sum was vast i saw greed creep into his little eyes what had troubled him hitherto i could not fathom even yet he washed his bony hands in the air and looked at his wife again it it is a fair price no doubt my lord said he his tone contemptuous  the duke shall be informed of the value of your learning lisped the cardinal  fifanti knit his brows the value of my learning he echoed as if slowly puzzled my learning oh is that in question  why else should we give you the appointment smiled the cardinal with a smile that was full of significance  it is what the town will be asking no doubt said messer fifanti i hope you will be able to satisfy its curiosity my lord  and on that he turned and stalked off again very white and trembling as i could perceive  my lord gambara laughed carelessly again and over the pale face of monna giuliana there stole a slow smile the memory of which was to be hateful to me soon but which at the moment went to increase my already profound mystification     chapter iii preuxchevalier   in the days that followed i found messer fifanti in queerer moods than ever ever impatient he would be easily moved to anger now and not a day passed but he stormed at me over the greek with which under his guidance i was wrestling  and with giuliana his manner was the oddest thing conceivable at times he was mocking as an ape at times his manner had in it a suggestion of the serpent more rarely he was his usual vulturine self he watched her curiously ever between anger and derision to all of which she presented a calm front and a patience almost saintly he was as a man with some mighty burden on his mind undecided whether he shall bear it or cast it off  her patience moved me most oddly to pity and pity for so beautiful a creature is satans most subtle snare especially when you consider what a power her beauty had to move me as i had already discovered to my erstwhile terror she confided in me a little in those days but ever with a most saintly resignation she had been sold into wedlock she admitted with a man who might have been her father and she confessed to finding her lot a cruel one but confessed it with the air of one who intends none the less to bear her cross with fortitude  and then one day i did a very foolish thing we had been reading together she and i as was become our custom she had fetched me a volume of the lascivious verse of panormitano and we sat side by side on the marble seat in the garden what time i read to her her shoulder touching mine the fragrance of her all about me  she wore i remember a clinging gown of russet silk which did rare justice to the splendid beauty of her and her heavy ruddy hair was confined in a golden net that was set with gemsa gift from my lord gambara concerning this same gift words had passed but yesterday between giuliana and her husband and i deemed the doctors anger to be the fruit of a base and unworthy mind  i read curiously enthralledthough whether by the beauty of the lines or the beauty of the woman there beside me i could not then have told you  presently she checked me leave now panormitano she said here is something else upon which you shall give me your judgment and she set before me a sheet upon which there was a sonnet writ in her own hand which was as beautiful as any copyists that i have ever seen  i read the poem it was the tenderest and saddest little cry from a heart that ached and starved for an ideal love and good as the manner seemed the matter itself it was that chiefly moved me at my admission of its moving quality her white hand closed over mine as it had done that day in the library when we had read of isabetta and the pot of basil her hand was warm but not warm enough to burn me as it did  ah thanks agostino she murmured your praise is sweet to me the verses are my own  i was dumbfounded at this fresh and more intimate glimpse of her the beauty of her body was there for all to see and worship but here was my first glimpse of the rare beauties of her mind in what words i should have answered her i do not know for at that moment we suffered an interruption  sudden and harsh as the crackling of a twig came from behind us the voice of messer fifanti what do you read  we started apart and turned  either he of set purpose had crept up behind us so softly that we should not suspect his approach or else so engrossed were we that our ears had been deafened for the time he stood there now in his untidy gown of black and there was a leer of mockery on his long white face slowly he put a lean arm between us and took the sheet in his bony claw  he peered at it very closely being without glasses and screwed his eyes up until they all but disappeared  thus he stood and slowly read whilst i looked on a trifle uneasy and giulianas face wore an odd look of fear her bosom heaving unsteadily in its russet sheath  he sniffed contemptuously when he had read and looked at me  have i not bidden you leave the vulgarities of dialect to the vulgar quoth he is there not enough written for you in latin that you must be wasting your time and perverting your senses with such poor illiterate gibberish as this and what is it that you have there he took the book panormitano he roared now theres a fitting author for a saint in embryo theres a fine preparation for the cloister  he turned to giuliana he put forward his hand and touched her bare shoulder with his hideous forefinger she cringed under the touch as if it were barbed  there is not the need that you should render yourself his preceptress he said with his deadly smile  i do not she replied indignantly agostino has a taste for letters and  tcha tcha he interrupted tapping her shoulder sharply i had no thought for letters there is my lord gambara and there is messer cosimo danguissola and there is messer caro there is even pordenone the painter his lips writhed over their names you have friends enough i think leave then ser agostino here do not dispute him with god to whom he has been vowed  she rose in a fine anger and stood quivering there magnificently tall and juno i imagined must have looked to the poets as she looked then to me  this is too much she cried  it is madam he snapped i agree with you she considered him with eyes that held a loathing and contempt unutterable then she looked at me and shrugged her shoulders as who would say you see how i am used lastly she turned and took her way across the lawn towards the house  there was a little silence between us after she had gone i was on fire with indignation and yet i could think of no words in which i might express it realizing how utterly i lacked the right to be angry with a husband for the manner in which he chose to treat his wife  at last pondering me very gravely he spoke  it were best you read no more with madonna giuliana he said slowly her tastes are not the tastes that become a man who is about to enter holy orders he closed the book which hitherto he had held open closed it with an angry snap and held it out to me  restore it to its shelf he bade me  i took it and quite submissively i went to do his bidding but to gain the library i had to pass the door of giulianas room it stood open and giuliana herself in the doorway we looked at each other and seeing her so sorrowful with tears in her great dark eyes i stepped forward to speak to utter something of the deep sympathy that stirred me  she stretched forth a hand to me i took it and held it tight looking up into her eyes  dear agostino she murmured in gratitude for my sympathy and i distraught inflamed by tone and look answered by uttering her name for the first time  giuliana  having uttered it i dared not look at her but i stooped to kiss the hand which she had left in mine and having kissed it i started upright and made to advance again but she snatched her hand from my clasp and waved me away at once so imperiously and beseechingly that i turned and went to shut myself in the library with my bewilderment  for full two days thereafter for no reason that i could clearly give i avoided her and save at table and in her husbands presence we were never once together  the repasts were sullen things at which there was little said madonna sitting in a frozen dignity and the doctor a silent man at all times being now utterly and forbiddingly mute  but once my lord gambara supped with us and he was light and trivial as ever an incarnation of frivolity and questionable jests apparently entirely unconscious of fifantis chill reserve and frequent sneers indeed i greatly marvelled that a man of my lord gambaras eminence and governor of piacenza should so very amiably endure the boorishness of that pedant  explanation was about to be afforded me  on the third day as we were dining giuliana announced that she was going afoot into the town and solicited my escort it was an honour that never before had been offered me i reddened violently but accepted it and soon thereafter we set out just she and i together  we went by way of the fodesta gate and passed the old castle of sant antonio then in ruinsfor gambara was demolishing it and employing the material to construct a barrack for the pontifical troops that garrisoned piacenza and presently we came upon the works of this new building and stepped out into midstreet to avoid the scaffoldings and so pursued our way into the citys main squarethe piazza del commune overshadowed by the redandwhite bulk of the communal palace this was a noble building rather in the saracenic manner borrowing a very warlike air from the pointed battlements that crowned it  near the duomo we came upon a great concourse of people who were staring up at the iron cage attached to the square tower of the belfry near its summit in this cage there was what appeared at first to be a heap of rags but which presently resolved itself into a human shape crouching in that narrow cruel space exposed there to the pitiless beating of the sun and suffering heaven alone can say what agonies the murmuring crowd looked up in mingled fear and sympathy  he had been there since last night a peasant girl informed us and he had been confined there by order of my lord the cardinallegate for the odious sin of sacrilege  what i cried out in such a tone of astonished indignation that monna giuliana seized my arm and pressed it to enjoin prudence  it was not until she had made her purchases in a shop under the duomo and we were returning home that i touched upon the matter she chid me for the lack of caution that might have led me into some unpardonable indiscretions but for her warning  but the very thought of such a man as my lord gambara torturing a poor wretch for sacrilege i cried it is grotesque it is ludicrous it is infamous  not so loud she laughed you are being stared at and then she delivered herself of an amazing piece of casuistry if a man being a sinner himself shall on that account refrain from punishing sin in others then is he twice a sinner  it was my lord gambara taught you that said i and involuntarily i sneered  she considered me with a very searching look  now what precisely do you mean agostino  why that it is by just such sophistries that the cardinallegate seeks to cloak the disorders of his life video meliora proboque deteriora sequor is his philosophy if he would encage the most sacrilegious fellow in piacenza let him encage himself  you do not love him said she  oas to thatas a man he is well enough but as an ecclesiastico but there i broke off shortly and laughed the devil take messer gambara  she smiled it is greatly to be feared that he will  but my lord gambara was not so lightly to be dismissed that afternoon as we were passing the porta fodesta a little group of countryfolk that had gathered there fell away before us all eyes upon the dazzling beauty of giulianaas indeed had been the case ever since we had come into the town so that i had been singularly and sweetly proud of being her escort i had been conscious of the envious glances that many a tall fellow had sent after me though after all theirs was but as the jealousy of phoebus for adonis  wherever we had passed and eyes had followed us men and women had fallen to whispering and pointing after us and so did they now here at the fodesta gate but with this difference that at last i overheard for once what was said for there was one who did not whisper  there goes the leman of my lord gambara quoth a gruff sneering voice the light of love of the saintly legate who is starving domenico to death in a cage for the sin of sacrilege  not a doubt but that he would have added more but that at that moment a womans shrill voice drowned his utterance silence giuffre she admonished him fearfully silence on your life  i had halted in my stride suddenly cold from head to foot as on that day when i had flung rinolfo from top to bottom of the terrace steps at mondolfo it happened that i wore a sword for the first time in my lifea matter from which i gathered great satisfactionhaving been adjudged worthy of the honour by virtue that i was to be madonnas escort to the hilt i now set hand impetuously and would have turned to strike that foul slanderer dead but that giuliana restrained me a wild alarm in her eyes  come she panted in a whisper come away  so imperious was the command that it conveyed to my mind some notion of the folly i should commit did i not obey it i saw at once that did i make an ensample of this scurrilous scandalmonger i should thereby render her the talk of that vile town so i went on but very white and stiff and breathing somewhat hard for pentup passion is an evil thing to house  thus came we out of the town and to the shady banks of the gleaming po and then at last when we were quite alone and within two hundred yards of fifantis house i broke at last the silence  i had been thinking very busily and the peasants words had illumined for me a score of little obscure matters had explained to me the queer behaviour and the odd speeches of fifanti himself since that evening in the garden when the cardinallegate had announced to him his appointment as ducal secretary i checked now in my stride and turned to face her  was it true i asked rendered brutally direct by a queer pain i felt as a result of my thinking  she looked up into my face so sadly and wistfully that my suspicions fell from me upon the instant and i reddened from shame at having harboured them  agostino she cried such a poor little cry of pain that i set my teeth hard and bowed my head in selfcontempt  then i looked at her again  yet the foul suspicion of that lout is shared by your husband himself said i  the foul suspicionyes she answered her eyes downcast her cheeks faintly tinted and then quite suddenly she moved forward come she bade me you are being foolish  i shall be mad said i ere i have done with this and i fell into step again beside her if i could not avenge you there i can avenge you here and i pointed to the house i can smite this rumour at its foulest point  her hand fell on my arm what would you do she cried  bid your husband retract and sue to you for pardon or else tear out his lying throat i answered for i was in a great rage by now  she stiffened suddenly you go too fast messer agostino said she and you are overeager to enter into that which does not concern you i do not know that i have given you the right to demand of my husband reason of the manner in which he deals with me it is a thing that touches only my husband and myself  i was abashed i was humiliated i was nigh to tears i choked it all down and i strode on beside her my rage smouldering within me but it was flaring up again by the time we reached the house with no more words spoken between us she went to her room without another glance at me and i repaired straight in quest of fifanti  i found him in the library he had locked himself in as was his frequent habit when at his studies but he opened to my knock i stalked in unbuckled my sword and set it in a corner then i turned to him  you are doing your wife a shameful wrong sir doctor said i with all the directness of youth and indiscretion  he stared at me as if i had struck himas he might have stared rather at a child who had struck him undecided whether to strike back for the childs good or to be amused and smile  ah he said at last she has been talking to you and he clasped his hands behind him and stood before me his head thrust forward his legs wide apart his long gown which was open clinging to his ankles  no said i i have been thinking  in that case nothing will surprise me he said in his sour contemptuous manner and so you have concluded  that you are harbouring an infamous suspicion  your assurance that it is infamous would offend me did it not comfort me he sneered and what pray is this suspicion  you suspect that thato god i cant utter the thing  take courage he mocked me and he thrust his head farther forward he looked singularly like a vulture in that moment  you suspect that messer gambara that messer gambara and madonna that i clenched my hands together and looked into his leering face you understand me well enough i cried almost angrily  he looked at me seriously now a cold glitter in his small eyes  i wonder do you understand yourself he asked i think not i think not since god has made you a fool it but remains for man to make you a priest and thus complete gods work  you cannot move me by your taunts i said you have a foul mind messer fifanti  he approached me slowly his untidily shod feet slipslopping on the wooden floor  because said he i suspect that messer gambara that messer gambara and madonna that you understand me he mocked me with a mimicry of my own confusion and what affair may it be of yours whom i suspect or of what i suspect them where my own are concerned  it is my affair as it is the affair of every man who would be accounted gentle to defend the honour of a pure and saintly lady from the foul aspersions of slander  knighterrantry by the host quoth he and his brows shot up on his steep brow then they came down again to scowl no doubt my preuxchevalier you will have definite knowledge of the groundlessness of these same slanders he said moving backwards away from me towards the door and as he moved now his feet made no sound though i did not yet notice this nor indeed his movement at all  knowledge i roared at him what knowledge can you need beyond what is afforded by her face look in it messer fifanti if you would see innocence and purity and chastity look in it  very well said he let us look in it  and quite suddenly he pulled the door open to disclose giuliana standing there erect but in a listening attitude  look in it he mocked me and waved one of his bony hands towards that perfect countenance  there was shame and confusion in her face and some anger but she turned without a word and went quickly down the passage followed by his evil cackling laugh  then he looked at me quite solemnly i think said he you had best get to your studies you will find more than enough to engage you there leave my affairs to me boy  there was almost a menace in his voice and after what had happened it was impossible to pursue the matter  sheepishly overwhelmed with confusion i went outa knighterrant with a shorn crest     chapter iv my lord gambara clears the ground   i had angered her worse i had exposed her to humiliation at the hands of that unworthy animal who soiled her in thought with the slime of his suspicions through me she had been put to the shameful need of listening at a door and had been subjected to the ignominy of being so discovered through me she had been mocked and derided  it was all anguish to me for her there was no shame no humiliation no pain i would not suffer and take joy in the suffering so that it be for her but to have submitted that sweet angelic woman to sufferingto have incurred her just anger woe me  i came to the table that evening full of uneasiness very unhappy feeling it an effort to bring myself into her presence and endure be it her regard or her neglect to my relief she sent word that she was not well and would keep her chamber and fifanti smiled oddly as he stroked his blue chin and gave me a sidelong glance we ate in silence and when the meal was done i departed still without a word to my preceptor and went to shut myself up again in my room  i slept ill that night and very early next morning i was astir i went down into the garden somewhere about the hour of sunrise through the wet grass that was all scintillant with dew on the marble bench by the pond where the waterlilies were now rotting i flung myself down and there was i found a halfhour later by giuliana herself  she stole up gently behind me and all absorbed and moody as i was i had no knowledge of her presence until her crisp boyish voice startled me out of my musings  of what do we brood here so early sir saint quoth she  i turned to meet her laughing eyes you you can forgive me i faltered foolishly  she pouted tenderly should i not forgive one who has acted foolishly out of love for me  it was it was i cried and there stopped all confused feeling myself growing red under her lazy glance  i know it was she answered she set her elbows on the seats tall back until i could feel her sweet breath upon my brow and should i bear you a resentment then my poor agostino have i no heart to feel am i but a cold reasoning intelligence like that thing my husband o god to have been mated to that withered pedant to have been sacrificed to have been sold into such bondage me miserable  giuliana i murmured soothingly yet agonized myself  could none have foretold me that you must come some day  hush i implored her what are you saying  but though i begged her to be silent my soul was avid for more such words from herfrom her the most perfect and beautiful of women  why should i not said she is truth ever to be stifled ever  i was mad i knowquite mad her words had made me so and when to ask me that insistent question she brought her face still nearer i flung down the reins of my unreason and let it ride amain upon its desperate reckless course in short i too leaned forward i leaned forward and i kissed her full upon those scarlet parted lips  i kissed her and fell back with a cry that was of anguish almostso poignantly had the sweet fierce pain of that kiss run through my every fibre and as i cried out so too did she stepping back her hands suddenly to her face but the next moment she was peering up at the windows of the housethose inscrutable eyes that looked upon our deed that looked and of which it was impossible to discern how much they might have seen  if he should have seen us was her cry and it moved me unpleasantly that such should have been the first thought my kiss inspired in her if he should have seen us gesu i have enough to bear already  i care not said i let him see i am not messer gambara no man shall put an insult upon you on my account and live  i was become the very ranting roaring firebreathing type of lover who will slaughter a whole world to do pleasure to his mistress or to spare her painiii agostino danguissolawho was to be ordained next month and walk in the ways of st augustine  laugh as you readfor very pity laugh  nay nay she reassured herself he will be still abed he was snoring when i left and she dismissed her fears and looked at me again and returned to the matter of that kiss  what have you done to me agostino  i dropped my glance before her languid eyes what i have done to no other woman yet i answered a certain gloom creeping over the exultation that still thrilled me o giuliana what have you done to me you have bewitched me you have made me mad and i set my elbows on my knees and took my head in my hands and sat there overwhelmed now by the full consciousness of the irrevocable thing that i had done a thing that must brand my soul for ever so it seemed  to have kissed a maid would have been ill enough for one whose aims were mine but to kiss a wife to become a cicisbeo the thing assumed in my mind proportions foolishly extravagantly beyond its evil reality  you are cruel agostino she whispered behind me she had come to lean again upon the back of the bench am i alone to blame can the iron withstand the lodestone can the rain help falling upon the earth can the stream flow other than downhill she sighed woe me it is i who should be angered that you have made free of my lips and yet i am here wooing you to forgive me for the sin that is your own  i cried out at that and turned to her again and i was very white i know  you tempted me was my cowards cry  so said adam once yet god thought otherwise for adam was as fully punished as was eve she smiled wistfully into my eyes and my senses reeled again and then old busio the servant came suddenly forth from the house upon some domestic errand to giuliana and thus was that situation mercifully brought to an end  for the rest of the day i lived upon the memory of that morning reciting to myself each word that she had uttered conjuring up in memory the vision of her every look and my absentmindedness was visible to fifanti when i came to my studies with him later he grew more peevish with me than was habitual dubbed me dunce and woodenhead and commended the wisdom of those who had determined upon a claustral life for me admitting that i knew enough latin to enable me to celebrate as well as another without too clear a knowledge of the meaning of what i pattered all of which was grossly untrue for as none knew better than himself the fluency of my latin was above the common wont of students when i told him so he delivered himself of his opinion upon the common wont of students with all the sourness of his crabbed nature  ill write an ode for you upon any subject that you may set me i challenged him  then write one upon impudence said he it is a subject you should understand and upon that he got up and flung out of the room in a pet before i could think of an answer  left alone i began an ode which should prove to him his lack of justice but i got no further than two lines of it then for a spell i sat biting my quill my mind and the eyes of my soul full of giuliana  presently i began to write again it was not an ode but a prayer oddly profaneand it was in italian in the dialettale that provoked fifantis sneers how it ran i have forgotten these many years but i recall that in it i likened myself to a sailor navigating shoals and besought the pharos of giulianas eyes to bring me safely through besought her to anoint me with her glance and so hearten me to brave the dangers of that procellous sea  i read it first with satisfaction then with dismay as i realized to the full its amorous meaning lastly i tore it up and went below to dine  we were still at table when my lord gambara arrived he came on horseback attended by two grooms whom he left to await him he was all in black velvet i remember even to his thighboots which were laced up the sides with gold and on his breast gleamed a fine medallion of diamonds of the prelate there was about him as usual nothing but the scarlet cloak and the sapphire ring  fifanti rose and set a chair for him smiling a crooked smile that held more hostility than welcome none the less did his excellency pay madonna giuliana a thousand compliments as he took his seat supremely calm and easy in his manner i watched him closely and i watched giuliana a queer fresh uneasiness pervading me  the talk was trivial and chiefly concerned with the progress of the barracks the legate was building and the fine new road from the middle of the city to the church of santa chiara which he intended should be called the via gambara but which despite his intentions is known today as the stradone farnese  presently my cousin arrived fullarmed and very martial by contrast with the velvety cardinal he frowned to see messer gambara then effaced the frown and smiled as one by one he greeted us last of all he turned to me  and how fares his saintliness quoth he  indeed none too saintly said i speaking my thoughts aloud  he laughed why then the sooner we are in orders the sooner shall we be on the road to mending that is it not so messer fifanti  his ordination will profit you i nothing doubt said fifanti with his habitual discourtesy and acidity so you do well to urge it  the answer put my cousin entirely out of countenance a moment it was a blunt way of reminding me that in this cosimo i saw one who followed after me in the heirship to mondolfo and in whose interests it was that i should don the conventual scapulary  i looked at cosimos haughty face and cruel mouth and conjectured in that hour whether i should have found him so very civil and pleasant a cousin had things been other than they were  o a very serpent was messer fifanti and i have since wondered whether of intent he sought to sow in my heart hatred of my guelphic cousin that he might make of me a tool for his own serviceas you shall come to understand  meanwhile cosimo having recovered waved aside the imputation and smiled easily  nay there you wrong me the anguissola lose more than i shall gain by agostinos renunciation of the world and i am sorry for it you believe me cousin  i answered his courteous speech as it deserved in very courteous terms this set a pleasanter humour upon all yet some restraint abode each sat it seemed as a man upon his guard my cousin watched gambaras every look whenever the latter turned to speak to giuliana the cardinallegate did the like by him and messer fifanti watched them both  and meantime giuliana sat there listening now to one now to the other her lazy smile parting those scarlet lipsthose lips that i had kissed that morningi whom no one thought of watching  and soon came messer annibale caro with lines from the last pages of his translation oozing from him and when presently giuliana smote her hands together in ecstatic pleasure at one of those same lines and bade him repeat it to her he swore roundly by all the gods that are mentioned in virgil that he would dedicate the work to her upon its completion  at this the surliness became general once more and my lord gambara ventured the opinionand there was a note of promise almost of threat in his sleek tonesthat the duke would shortly be needing messer caros presence in parma whereupon messer caro cursed the duke roundly and with all a poets volubility of invective  they stayed late each intent no doubt upon outstaying the others but since none would give way they were forced in the end to depart together  and whilst messer fifanti as became a host was seeing them to their horses i was left alone with giuliana  why do you suffer those men i asked her bluntly her delicate brows were raised in surprise why what now they are very pleasant gentlemen agostino  too pleasant said i and rising i crossed to the window whence i could watch them getting to horse all save caro who had come afoot too pleasant by much that prelate out of hell now  sh she hissed at me smiling her hand raised should he hear you he might send you to the cage for sacrilege o agostino she cried and the smiles all vanished from her face will you grow cruel and suspicious too  i was disarmed i realized my meanness and unworthiness  have patience with me i implored her i i am not myself today i sighed ponderously and fell silent as i watched them ride away yet i hated them all and most of all i hated the dainty perfumed goldenheaded cardinallegate  he came again upon the morrow and we learnt from the news of which he was the bearer that he had carried out his threat concerning messer caro the poet was on his way to parma to duke pier luigi dispatched thither on a mission of importance by the cardinal he spoke too of sending my cousin to perugia where a strong hand was needed as the town showed signs of mutiny against the authority of the holy see  when he had departed messer fifanti permitted himself one of his bitter insinuations  he desires a clear field he said smiling his cold smile upon giuliana it but remains for him to discover that his duke has need of me as well  he spoke of it as a possible contingency but sarcastically as men speak of things too remote to be seriously considered he was to remember his words two days later when the very thing came to pass  we were at breakfast when the blow fell  there came a clatter of hooves under our windows which stood open to the tepid september morning and soon there was old busio ushering in an officer of the pontificals with a parchment tied in scarlet silk and sealed with the arms of piacenza  messer fifanti took the package and weighed it in his hand frowning perhaps already some foreboding of the nature of its contents was in his mind meanwhile giuliana poured wine for the officer and busio bore him the cup upon a salver  fifanti ripped away silk and seals and set himself to read i can see him now standing near the window to which he had moved to gain a better light the parchment under his very nose his shortsighted eyes screwed up as he acquainted himself with the letters contents then i saw him turn a sickly leaden hue he stared at the officer a moment and then at giuliana but i do not think that he saw either of them his look was the blank look of one whose thoughts are very distant  he thrust his hands behind him and with head forward in that curious attitude so reminiscent of a bird of prey he stepped slowly back to his place at the tablehead slowly his cheeks resumed their normal tint  very well sir he said addressing the officer inform his excellency that i shall obey the summons of the dukes magnificence without delay  the officer bowed to giuliana took his leave and went old busio escorting him  a summons from the duke cried giuliana and then the storm broke  ay he answered grimly quiet a summons from the duke and he tossed it across the table to her  i saw that fateful document float an instant in the air and then thrown out of poise by the blob of wax swoop slanting to her lap  it will come no doubt as a surprise to you he growled and upon that his hardheld passion burst all bonds that he could impose upon it his great bony fist crashed down upon the board and swept a precious venetian beaker to the ground where it burst into a thousand atoms spreading red wine like a bloodstain upon the floor  said i not that this rascal cardinal would make a clear field for himself said i not so he laughed shrill and fiercely he would send your husband packing as he has sent his other rivals o there is a stipend waitinga stipend of three hundred ducats yearly that shall be made into six hundred presently and all for my complaisance all that i may be a joyous and content cornuto  he strode to the window cursing horribly whilst giuliana sat white of face with lips compressed and heaving bosom her eyes upon her plate  my lord cardinal and his duke may take themselves together to hell ere i obey the summons that the one has sent me at the desire of the other here i stay to guard what is my own  you are a fool said giuliana at length and a knave too for you insult me without cause  without cause o without cause eh by the host yet you would not have me stay  i would not have you gaoled which is what will happen if you disobey the dukes magnificence said she  gaoled quoth he of a sudden trembling in the increasing intensity of his passion caged perhapsto die of hunger and thirst and exposure like that poor wretch domenico who perished yesterday at last because he dared to speak the truth gesu he groaned o miserable me and he sank into a chair  but the next instant he was up again and his long arms were waving fiercely by the eyes of god they shall have cause to cage me if i am to be horned like a bull ill use those same horns ill gore their vitals o madam since of your wantonness you inclined to harlotry you should have wedded another than astorre fifanti  it was too much i leapt to my feet  messer fifanti i blazed at him ill not remain to hear such words addressed to this sweet lady  ah yes he snarled wheeling suddenly upon me as if he would strike me i had forgot the champion the preuxchevalier the saint in embryo you will not remain to hear the truth sir eh and he strode mouthing to the door and flung it wide so that it crashed against the wall this is your remedy get you hence go what passes here concerns you not go he roared like a mad beast his rage a thing terrific  i looked at him and from him to giuliana and my eyes most clearly invited her to tell me how she would have me act  indeed you had best go agostino she answered sadly i shall bear his insults easier if there be no witness yes go  since it is your wish madonna i bowed to her and very erect very defiant of mien i went slowly past the livid fifanti and so out i heard the door slammed after me and in the little hall i came upon busio who was wringing his hand and looking very white he ran to me  he will murder her messer agostino moaned the old man he can be a devil in his anger  he is a devil always in anger and out of it said i he needs an exorcist it is a task that i should relish id beat the devils out of him busio and she would let me meanwhile stay we here and if she needs our help it shall be hers  i dropped on to the carved settle that stood there old busio standing at my elbow more tranquil now that there was help at hand for madonna in case of need and through the door came the sound of his storming and presently the crash of more broken glassware as once more he thumped the table for wellhigh half an hour his fury lasted and it was seldom that her voice was interposed once we heard her laugh cold and cutting as a swords edge and i shivered at the sound for it was not good to hear  at last the door was opened and he came forth his face was inflamed his eyes wild and bloodinjected he paused for a moment on the threshold but i do not think that he noticed us at first he looked back at her over his shoulder still sitting at table the outline of her whitegowned body sharply defined against the deep blue tapestry of the wall behind her  you are warned said he do you heed the warning and he came forward  perceiving me at last where i sat he bared his broken teeth in a snarling smile but it was to busio that he spoke have my mule saddled for me in an hour he said and passed on and up the stairs to make his preparations it seemed therefore that she had conquered his suspicions  i went in to offer her comfort for she was weeping and all shaken by that cruel encounter but she waved me away  not now agostino not now she implored me leave me to myself my friend  i had not been her friend had i not obeyed her without question     chapter v pabulum acherontis   it was late that afternoon when astorre fifanti set out he addressed a few brief words to me informing me that he should return within four days betide what might setting me tasks upon which i was meanwhile to work and bidding me keep the house and be circumspect during his absence  from the window of my room i saw the doctor get astride his mule he was girt with a big sword but he still wore his long absurd and shabby gown and his loose illfitting shoes so that it was very likely that the stirrupleathers would engage his thoughts ere he had ridden far  i saw him dig his heels into the beasts sides and go ambling down the little avenue and out at the gate in the road he drew rein and stood in talk some moments with a lad who idled there a lad whom he was wont to employ upon odd tasks about the garden and elsewhere  this madonna also saw for she was watching his departure from the window of a room below that she attached more importance to that little circumstance than did i i was to learn much later  at last he pushed on and i watched him as he dwindled down the long grey road that wound along the riverside until in the end he was lost to viewfor all time i hoped and well had it been for me had my idle hope been realized  i supped alone that night with no other company than busios who ministered to my needs  madonna sent word that she would keep her chamber when i had supped and after night had fallen i went upstairs to the library and shutting myself in i attempted to read lighted by the three beaks of the tall brass lamp that stood upon the table being plagued by moths i drew the curtains close across the open window and settled down to wrestle with the opening lines of the title in greek of aeschylus  but my thoughts wandered from the doings of the son of iapetus until at last i flung down the book and sat back in my chair all lost in thought in doubt and in conjecture i became seriously introspective i made an examination not only of conscience but of heart and mind and i found that i had gone woefully astray from the path that had been prepared for me very late i sat there and sought to determine upon what i should do  suddenly like a manna to my starving soul came the memory of the last talk i had with fra gervasio and the solemn warning he had given me that memory inspired me rightly tomorrowdespite messer fifantis ordersi would take horse and ride to mondolfo there to confess myself to fra gervasio and to be guided by his counsel my mothers vows concerning me i saw in their true light they were not binding upon me indeed i should be doing a hideous wrong were i to follow them against my inclinations i must not damn my soul for anything that my mother had vowed or ever i was born however much she might account that it would be no more than filial piety so to do  i was easier in mind after my resolve was taken and i allowed that mind of mine to stray thereafter as it listed it took to thoughts of giulianagiuliana for whom i ached in every nerve although i still sought to conceal from myself the true cause of my suffering better a thousand times had i envisaged that sinful fact and wrestled with it boldly thus should i have had a chance of conquering myself and winning clear of all the horror that lay before me  that i was weak and irresolute at such a time when i most needed strength i still think todaywhen i can take a calm survey of allwas the fault of the outrageous rearing that was mine at mondolfo they had so nurtured me and so sheltered me from the stinging blasts of the world that i was grown into a very ripe and succulent fruit for the devils mouth the things to whose temptation usage would have rendered me in some degree immune were irresistible to one who had been tutored as had i  let youth know wickedness lest when wickedness seeks a man out in his riper years he shall be fooled and conquered by the beauteous garb in which the devil has the cunning to array it  and yet to pretend that i was entirely innocent of where i stood and in what perils were to play the hypocrite largely i knew just as i knew that lacking strength to resist i must seek safety in flight and tomorrow i would go that point was settled and the page meanwhile turned down and for tonight i delivered myself up to the savouring of this hunger that was upon me  and then towards the third hour of night as i still sat there the door was very gently opened and i beheld giuliana standing before me she detached from the black background of the passage and the light of my threebeaked lamp set her ruddy hair aglow so that it seemed there was a luminous nimbus all about her head for a moment this gave colour to my fancy that i beheld a vision evoked by the too great intentness of my thoughts the pale face seemed so transparent the white robe was almost diaphanous and the great dark eyes looked so sad and wistful only in the vivid scarlet of her lips was there life and blood  i stared at her giuliana i murmured  why do you sit so late she asked me and closed the door as she spoke  i have been thinking giuliana i answered wearily and i passed a hand over my brow to find it moist and clammy tomorrow i go hence  she started round and her eyes grew distended her hand clutched her breast you go hence she cried a note as of fear in her deep voice hence whither  back to mondolfo to tell my mother that her dream is at an end  she came slowly towards me and and then she asked  and then i do not know what god wills but the scapulary is not for me i am unworthy i have no call this i now know and sooner than be such a priest as messer gambaraof whom there are too many in the church todayi will find some other way of serving god  since since when have you thought thus  since this morning when i kissed you i answered fiercely  she sank into a chair beyond the table and stretched a hand across it to me inviting the clasp of mine but if this is so why leave us  because i am afraid i answered because o god giuliana do you not see and i sank my head into my hands  steps shuffled along the corridor i looked up sharply she set a finger to her lips there fell a knock and old busio stood before us  madonna he announced my lord the cardinallegate is below and asks for you  i started up as if i had been stung so at this hour then messer fifantis suspicions did not entirely lack for grounds  giuliana flashed me a glance ere she made answer  you will tell my lord gambara that i have retired for the night and that but stay she caught up a quill and dipped it in the inkhorn drew paper to herself and swiftly wrote three lines then dusted it with sand and proffered that brief epistle to the servant  give this to my lord  busio took the note bowed and departed  after the door had closed a silence followed in which i paced the room in long strides aflame now with the allconsuming fire of jealousy i do believe that satan had set all the legions of hell to achieve my overthrow that night naught more had been needed to undo me than this spur of jealousy it brought me now to her side i stood over her looking down at her between tenderness and fierceness she returning my glance with such a look as may haunt the eyes of sacrificial victims  why dared he come i asked  perhaps perhaps some affair connected with astorre she faltered  i sneered that would be natural seeing that he has sent astorre to parma  if there was aught else i am no party to it she assured me  how could i do other than believe her how could i gauge the turpitude of that beautys mindi all unversed in the wiles that satan teaches women how could i have guessed that when she saw fifanti speak to that lad at the gate that afternoon she had feared that he had set a spy upon the house and that fearing this she had bidden the cardinal begone i knew it later but not then  will you swear that it is as you say i asked her white with passion  as i have said i was standing over her and very close her answer now was suddenly to rise like a snake came she gliding upwards into my arms until she lay against my breast her face upturned her eyes languidly veiled her lips apout  can you do me so great a wrong thinking you love me knowing that i love you she asked me  for an instant we swayed together in that sweetly hideous embrace i was as a man sapped of all strength by some portentous struggle i trembled from head to foot i cried out oncea despairing prayer for help i think it wasand then i seemed to plunge headlong down through an immensity of space until my lips found hers the ecstasy the living fire the anguish and the torture of it have left their indelible scars upon my memory even as i write the cruelly sweet poignancy of that moment is with me againthough very hateful now  thus i blindly and recklessly under the sway and thrall of that terrific and overpowering temptation and then there leapt in my mind a glimmer of returning consciousness a glimmer that grew rapidly to be a blazing light in which i saw revealed the hideousness of the thing i did i tore myself away from her in that second of revulsion and hurled her from me fiercely and violently so that staggering to the seat from which she had risen she fell into it rather than sat down  and whilst breathless with parted lips and galloping bosom she observed me something near akin to terror in her eyes i stamped about that room and raved and heaped abuse and recriminations upon myself ending by going down upon my knees to her imploring her forgiveness for the thing i had donebelieving like a fatuous fool that it was all my doingand imploring her still more passionately to leave me and to go  she set a trembling hand upon my head she took my chin in the other and raised my face until she could look into it  if it be your willif it will bring you peace and happiness i will leave you now and never see you more but are you not deluded my agostino  and then as if her selfcontrol gave way she fell to weeping  and what of me if you go what of me wedded to that monster to that cruel and inhuman pedant who tortures and insults me as you have seen  beloved will another wrong cure the wrong of that i pleaded o if you love me gogo leave me it is too latetoo late  i drew away from her touch and crossed the room to fling myself upon the windowseat for a space we sat apart thus panting like wrestlers who have flung away from each other at lengthlisten giuliana i said more calmly were i to heed you were i to obey my own desires i should bid you come away with me from this tomorrow  if you but would she sighed you would be taking me out of hell  into another worse i countered swiftly i should do you such a wrong as naught could ever right again  she looked at me for a spell in silence her back was to the light and her face in shadow so that i could not read what passed there then very slowly like one utterly weary she got to her feet  i will do your will beloved but i do it not for the wrong that i should sufferfor that i should count no wrongbut for the wrong that i should be doing you  she paused as if for an answer i had none for her i raised my arms then let them fall again and bowed my head i heard the gentle rustle of her robe and i looked up to see her staggering towards the door her arms in front of her like one who is blind she reached it pulled it open and from the threshold gave me one last ineffable look of her great eyes heavy now with tears then the door closed again and i was alone  from my heart there rose a great surge of thankfulness i fell upon my knees and prayed for an hour at least i must have knelt there seeking grace and strength and comforted at last my calm restored i rose and went to the window i drew back the curtains and leaned out to breathe the physical calm of that tepid september night  and presently out of the gloom a great grey shape came winging towards the window the heavy pinions moving ponderously with their uncanny sough it was an owl attracted by the light before that bird of evil omen that harbinger of death i drew back and crossed myself i had a sight of its sphinxlike face and round impassive eyes ere it circled to melt again into the darkness startled by any sudden movement i closed the window and left the room  very softly i crept down the passage towards my chamber leaving the light burning in the library for it was not my habit to extinguish it and i gave no thought to the lateness of the hour  midway down the passage i halted i was level with giulianas door and from under it there came a slender blade of light but it was not this that checked me she was singing such a pitiful little heartbroken song it was       amor mi muojo mi muojo amore mio  ran its last line  i leaned against the wall and a sob broke from me then in an instant the passage was flooded with light and in the open doorway giuliana stood all white before me her arms held out     chapter vi the iron girdle   from the distance drawing rapidly nearer and ringing sharply in the stillness of the night came the clatter of a mules hooves  but though heard it was scarcely heard consciously and it certainly went unheeded until it was beneath the window and ceasing at the door  giulianas fingers locked themselves upon my arm in a grip of fear  who comes she asked below her breath fearfully i sprang from the bed and crouched listening by the window and so lost precious time  out of the darkness giulianas voice spoke again hoarsely now and trembling  it will be astorre she said with conviction at this hour it can be none else i suspected when i saw him talking to that boy at the gate this afternoon that he was setting a spy upon me to warn him wherever he was lurking did the need arise  but how should the boy know i began when she interrupted me almost impatiently  the boy saw messer gambara ride up he waited for no more but went at once to warn astorre he has been long in coming she added in the tone of one who is still searching for the exact explanation of the thing that is happening and then suddenly and very urgently go gogo quickly she bade me  as in the dark i was groping my way towards the door she spoke again  why does he not knock for what does he wait immediately from the stairs came a terrific answer to her questionthe unmistakable slipslopping footstep of the doctor  i halted and for an instant stood powerless to move how he had entered i could not guess nor did i ever discover sufficient was the awful fact that he was in  i was icecold from head to foot then i was all on fire and groping forward once more whilst those footsteps sinister and menacing as the very steps of doom came higher and nearer  at last i found the door and wrenched it open i stayed to close it after me and already at the end of the passage beat the reflection of the light fifanti carried a second i stood there hesitating which way to turn my first thought was to gain my own chamber but to attempt it were assuredly to run into his arms so i turned and went as swiftly and stealthily as possible towards the library  i was all but in when he turned the corner of the passage and so caught sight of me before i had closed the door  i stood in the library where the lamp still burned sweating panting and trembling for even as he had had a glimpse of me so had i had a glimpse of him and the sight was terrifying to one in my situation  i had seen his tall gaunt figure bending forward in his eager angry haste in one hand he carried a lanthorn a naked sword in the other his face was malign and ghastly and his bald egglike head shone yellow the fleeting glimpse he had of me drew from him a sound between a roar and a snarl and with quickened feet he came slipslopping down the passage  i had meant i think to play the fox to seat myself at the table a book before me and feigning slumber present the appearance of one who had been overcome by weariness at his labours but now all thought of that was at an end i had been seen and that i fled was all too apparent so that in every way i was betrayed  the thing i did i did upon instinct rather than reason and this again was not well done i slammed the door and turned the key placing at least that poor barrier between myself and the man i had so deeply wronged the man whom i had given the right to slay me a second later the door shook as if a hurricane had smitten it he had seized the handle and he was pulling at it frenziedly with a maniacal strength  open he thundered and fell to snarling and whimpering horribly open  then quite abruptly he became oddly calm it was as if his rage grew coldly purposeful and the next words he uttered acted upon me as a daggerprod and reawakened my mind from its momentary stupefaction  do you think these poor laths can save you from my vengeance my lord gambara quoth he with a chuckle horrible to hear  my lord gambara he mistook me for the legate in an instant i saw the reason of this it was as giuliana had conceived the boy had run to warn him wherever he wasat roncaglia perhaps a league away upon the road to parma and the boys news was that my lord the governor had gone to fifantis house the boy had never waited to see the legate come forth again but had obeyed his instructions to the letter and it was gambara whom fifanti came to take redhanded and to kill as he had the right to do  when he had espied my flying shape the length of the corridor had lain between us fifanti was shortsighted and since it was gambara whom he expected to find gambara at once he concluded it to be who fled before him  there was no villainy for which i was not ripe that night it seemed for no sooner did i perceive this error than i set myself to scheme how i might profit by it let gambara by all means suffer in my place if the thing could be contrived if not in fact at least in intent the cardinallegate had certainly sinned if he was not in my place now it was through the too great good fortune that attended him besides gambara would be in better case to protect himself from the consequences and from fifantis anger  thus cravenly i reasoned and reasoning thus i reached the window if i could climb down to the garden and then perhaps up again to my own chamber i might get me to bed what time fifanti still hammered at that door meanwhile his voice came rasping through those slender timbers as he mocked the lord cardinal he supposed me  you would not be warned my lord and yet i warned you enough you would plant horns upon my head well well do not complain if you are gored by them  then he laughed hideously this poor astorre fifanti is blind and a fool he is to be sent packing on a journey to the duke devised to suit my lord cardinals convenience but you should have bethought you that suspicious husbands have a trick of pretending to depart whilst they remain  next his voice swelled up again in passion and again the door was shaken  will you open then or must i break down the door there is no barrier in the world shall keep me from you there is no power can save you i have the right to kill you by every law of god and man shall i forgo that right he laughed snarlingly  three hundred ducats yearly to recompense the hospitality i have given youand six hundred later upon the coming of the duke he mocked that was the price my lord of my hospitalitywhich was to include my wifes harlotry three hundred ducats ha ha three hundred thousand million years in hell that is the price my lordthe price that you shall pay for i present the reckoning and enforce it you shall be shriven in ironyou and your wanton after you  shall i be caged for having shed a prelates sacred blood for having sent a prelates soul to hell with all its filth of sin upon it shall i speak magnificent out of the fullness of your theological knowledge inform me  i had listened in a sort of fascination to that tirade of venomous mockery but now i stirred and pulled the casement open i peered down into the darkness and hesitated the wall was creeperclad to the windows height but i feared the frail tendrils of the clematis would never bear me i hesitated then i resolved to jump it was but little more than some twelve feet to the ground and that was nothing to daunt an active lad of my own build with the soft turf to land upon below it should have been done without hesitation for that moments hesitation was my ruin  fifanti had heard the opening of the casement and fearing that after all his prey might yet escape him he suddenly charged the door like an infuriated bull and borrowing from his rage a strength far greater than his usual he burst away the fastenings of that crazy door  into the room hurtled the doctor to check and stand there blinking at me too much surprised for a moment to grasp the situation  when at last he understood the returning flow of rage was overwhelming  you he gasped and then his voice mountingyou dog he screamed so it was you you  he crouched and his little eyes all bloodinjected peered at me with horrid malice he grew cold again as he mastered his surprise you he repeated blind fool that i have been you the walker in the ways of st augustinein his early ways i think you saint in embryo you postulant for holy orders you shall be ordained this nightwith this and he raised his sword so that little yellow runnels of light sped down the livid blade  i will ordain you into hell you hound and thereupon he leapt at me  i sprang away from the window urged by fear of him into a very sudden activity as i crossed the room i had a glimpse of the white figure of giuliana in the gloom of the passage watching  he came after me snarling i seized a stool and hurled it at him he avoided it nimbly and it went crashing through the half of the casement that was still closed  and as he avoided it grown suddenly cunning he turned back towards the door to bar my exit should i attempt to lead him round the table  we stood at gaze the length of the little lowceilinged chamber between us both of us breathing hard  then i looked round for something with which to defend myself for it was plain that he meant to have my life by a great illchance it happened that the sword which i had worn upon that day when i went as giulianas escort into piacenza was still standing in the very corner where i had set it down instinctively i sprang for it and fifanti never suspecting my quest until he saw me with a naked iron in my hand did nothing to prevent my reaching it  seeing me armed he laughed ho ho the saintatarms he mocked youll be as skilled with weapons as with holiness and he advanced upon me in long stealthy strides the width of the table was between us and he smote at me across it i parried and cut back at him for being armed now i no more feared him than i should have feared a child little he knew of the swordcraft i had learnt from old falcone a thing which once learnt is never forgotten though lack of exercise may make us slow  he cut at me again and narrowly missed the lamp in his stroke and now i can most solemnly make oath that in the thing that followed there was no intent it was over and done before i was conscious of the happening i had acted purely upon instinct as men will in performing what they have been taught  to ward his blow i came almost unconsciously into that guard of marozzos which is known as the iron girdle i parried and on the stroke i lunged and so taking the poor wretch entirely unawares i sank the half of my iron into his vitals ere he or i had any thought that the thing was possible  i saw his little eyes grow very wide and the whole expression of his face become one of intense astonishment  he moved his lips as if to speak and then the sword clattered from his one hand the lanthorn from his other he sank forward quietly still looking at me with the same surprised glance and so came further on to my rigidly held blade until his breast brought up against the quillons for a moment he remained supported thus by just that rigid arm of mine and the table against which his weight was leaning then i withdrew the blade and in the same movement flung the weapon from me before the sword had rattled to the floor his body had sunk down into a heap beyond the table so that i could see no more than the yellow egglike top of his bald head  awhile i stood watching it filled with an extraordinary curiosity and a queer awe very slowly was it that i began to realize the thing i had done it might be that i had killed fifanti it might be and slowly gradually i grew cold with the thought and the apprehension of its horrid meaning  then from the passage came a stifled scream and giuliana staggered forward one hand holding flimsy draperies to her heaving bosom the other at her mouth which had grown hideously loose and uncontrolled her glowing copper hair all unbound fell about her shoulders like a mantle  behind her with ashen face and trembling limbs came old busio he was groaning and ringing his hands thus i saw the pair of them creep forward to approach fifanti who had made no sound since my sword had gone through him  but fifanti was no longer there to heed themthe faithful servant and the unfaithful wife all that remained huddled there at the foot of the table was a heap of bleeding flesh and shabby garments  it was giuliana who gave me the information with a courage that was almost stupendous she looked down into his face then up into mine which i doubt not was as livid  you have killed him she whispered he is dead  he was dead and i had killed him my lips moved  he would have killed me i answered in a strangled voice and knew that what i said was a sort of lie to cloak the foulness of my deed  old busio uttered a long croaking wail and went down on his knees beside the master he had served so longthe master who would never more need servant in this world  it was upon the wings of that pitiful cry that the full understanding of the thing i had done was borne in upon my soul i bowed my head and took my face in my hands i saw myself in that moment for what i was i accounted myself wholly and irrevocably damned be god never so clement surely here was something for which even his illimitable clemency could find no pardon  i had come to fifantis house as a student of humanities and divinities all that i had learnt there had been devilries culminating in this hours work and all through no fault of that poor mean ugly pedant who indeed had been my victimwhom i had robbed of honour and of life  never man felt selfhorror as i felt it then selfloathing and selfcontempt and then whilst the burden of it all the horror of it all was full upon me a soft hand touched my shoulder and a soft quivering voice murmured urgently in my ear  agostino we must go we must go  i plucked away my hands and showed her a countenance before which she shrank in fear  we i snarled at her we i repeated still more fiercely and drove her back before me as if i had done her a bodily hurt  o i should have imaginedhad i had time in which to imagine anythingthat already i had descended to the very bottom of the pit of infamy but it seems that one more downward step remained me and that step i took not by act nor yet by speech but just by thought  for without the manliness to take the whole blame of this great crime upon myself i must in my soul and mind fling the burden of it upon her like adam of old i blamed the woman and charged her in my thoughts with having tempted me charging her thus i loathed her as the cause of all this sin that had engulfed me loathed her in that moment as a thing unclean and hideous loathed her with a completeness of loathing such as i had never experienced before for any fellowcreature  instead of beholding in her one whom i had dragged with me into my pit of sin and whom it was incumbent upon my manhood thenceforth to shelter and protect from the consequences of my own iniquity i attributed to her the blame of all that had befallen  today i know that in so doing i did no more than justice but it was not justly done i had then no such knowledge as i have today by which to correct my judgment the worst i had the right to think of her in that hour was that her guilt was something less than mine in thinking otherwise was it that i took that last step to the very bottom of the hell that i had myself created for myself that night  the rest was as nothing by comparison i have said that it was not by act or speech that i added to the sum of my iniquities and yet it was by both first in that fiercely echoed we that i hurled at her to strike her from me then in my precipitate flight alone  how i stumbled from that room i scarcely know the events of the time that followed immediately upon fifantis death are all blurred as the impressions of a sick mans dream  i dimly remember that as she backed away from me until her shoulders touched the wall that as she stood so all white and lovely as any snare that satan ever devised for mans ruin staring at me with mutely pleading eyes i staggered forward avoiding the sight of that dreadful huddle on the floor over which busio was weeping foolishly  as i stepped a sudden moisture struck my stockinged feet its nature i knew by instinct upon the instant and filled by it with a sudden unreasoning terror i dashed with a loud cry from the room  along the passage and down the dark stairs i plunged until i reached the door of the house it stood open and i went heedlessly forth from overhead i heard giuliana calling me in a voice that held a note of despair but i never checked in my headlong career  fifantis mule i have since reflected was tethered near the steps i saw the beast but it conveyed no meaning to my mind which i think was numbed i sped past it and on through the gate round the road by the po under the walls of the city and so away into the open country  without cap without doublet without shoes just in my trunks and shirt and hose as i was i ran heading by instinct for home as heads the animal that has been overtaken by danger whilst abroad never since phidippides the athenian courier do i believe that any man had run as desperately and doggedly as i ran that night  by dawn having in some three hours put twenty miles or so between myself and piacenza i staggered exhausted and with cut and bleeding feet through the open door of a peasants house  the family sat at breakfast in the stoneflagged room into which i stumbled i halted under their astonished eyes  i am the lord of mondolfo i panted hoarsely and i need a beast to carry me home  the head of that considerable family a grizzled suntanned peasant rose from his seat and pondered my condition with a glance that was laden with mistrust  the lord of mondolfoyou thus quoth he now by bacchus i am the pope of rome  but his wife more tenderhearted saw in my disorder cause for pity rather than irony  poor lad she murmured as i staggered and fell into a chair unable longer to retain my feet she rose immediately and came hurrying towards me with a basin of goats milk the draught refreshed my body as her gentle words of comfort soothed my troubled soul seated there her stout arm about my shoulders my head pillowed upon her ample motherly breast i was very near to tears loosened in my overwrought state by the sweet touch of sympathy for which may god reward her  i rested in that place awhile three hours i slept upon a litter of straw in an outhouse whereupon strengthened by my repose i renewed my claim to be the lord of mondolfo and my demand for a horse to carry me to my fortress  still doubting me too much to trust me alone with any beast of his the peasant nevertheless fetched out a couple of mules and set out with me for mondolfo      book iii the wilderness     chapter i the homecoming   it was still early morning when we came into the town of mondolfo my peasant escort and i  the day being sunday there was little stir in the town at such an hour and it presented a very different appearance from that which it had worn when last i had seen it but the difference lay not only in the absence of bustle and the few folk abroad now as compared with that marketday on which departing i had ridden through it i viewed the place today with eyes that were able to draw comparisons and after the wide streets and imposing buildings of piacenza i found my little township mean and rustic  we passed the duomo consecrated to our lady of mondolfo its portals stood wide and in the opening swung a heavy crimson curtain embroidered with a huge golden cross which was bellying outward like an enormous gonfalon on the steps a few crippled beggars whined and a few faithful took their way to early mass  on up the steep illpaved street we climbed to the mighty grey citadel looming on the hills crest like a gigantic guardian brooding over the city of his trust we crossed the drawbridge unchallenged passed under the tunnel of the gateway and so came into the vast untenanted bailey of the fortress  i looked about me beat my hands together and raised my voice to shout  ola ola  in answer to my call the door of the guardhouse opened presently and a man looked out he frowned at first then his brows went up and his mouth fell open  it is the madonnino he shouted over his shoulder and hurried forward to take my reins uttering words of respectful welcome which seemed to relieve the fears of my peasant who had never quite believed me what i proclaimed myself  there was a stir in the guardhouse and two or three men of the absurd garrison my mother kept there shuffled in the doorway whilst a burly fellow in leather with a sword girt on him thrust his way through and hurried forward limping slightly in the dark lowering face i recognized my old friend rinolfo and i marvelled to see him thus accoutred  he halted before me and gave me a stiff and unfriendly salute then he bade the manatarms to hold my stirrup  what is your authority here rinolfo i asked him shortly  i am the castellan he informed me  the castellan but what of messer giorgio  he died a month ago  and who gave you this authority  madonna the countess in some recompense for the hurt you did me he replied thrusting forward his lame leg  his tone was surly and hostile but it provoked no resentment in me now i deserved his unfriendliness i had crippled him at the moment i forgot the provocation i had receivedforgot that since he had raised his hand to his lord it would have been no great harshness to have hanged him i saw in him but another instance of my wickedness another sufferer at my hands and i hung my head under the rebuke implicit in his surly tone and glance  i had not thought rinolfo to do you an abiding hurt said i and here checked bethinking me that i lied for had i not expressed regret that i had not broken his neck  i got down slowly and painfully for my limbs were stiff and my feet very sore he smiled darkly at my words and my sudden faltering but i affected not to see  where is madonna i asked  she will have returned by now from chapel he answered  i turned to the manatarms you will announce me i bade him and you rinolfo see to these beasts and to this good fellow here let him have wine and food and what he needs i will see him again ere he sets forth  rinolfo muttered that all should be done as i ordered and i signed to the manatarms to lead the way  we went up the steps and into the cool of the great hall there the soldier whose every feeling had been outraged no doubt by rinolfos attitude towards his lord ventured to express his sympathy and indignation  rinolfo is a black beast madonnino he muttered  we are all black beasts eugenio i answered heavily and so startled him by words and tone that he ventured upon no further speech but led me straight to my mothers private diningroom opened the door and calmly announced me  madonna here is my lord agostino  i heard the gasp she uttered before i caught sight of her she was seated at the tables head in her great wooden chair and fra gervasio was pacing the rushstrewn floor in talk with her his hands behind his back his head thrust forward  at the announcement he straightened suddenly and wheeled round to face me inquiry in his glance my mother too half rose and remained so staring at me her amazement at seeing me increased by the strange appearance i presented  eugenio closed the door and departed leaving me standing there just within it and for a moment no word was spoken  the cheerless familiar room looking more cheerless than it had done of old with its highset windows and ghastly crucifix affected me in a singular manner in this room i had known a sort of peacethe peace that is peculiarly childhoods own whatever the troubles that may haunt it i came into it now with hell in my soul sinblackened before god and man a fugitive in quest of sanctuary  a knot rose in my throat and paralysed awhile my speech then with a sudden sob i sprang forward and hobbled to her upon my wounded feet i flung myself down upon my knees buried my head in her lap and all that i could cry was  mother mother  whether perceiving my disorder my distraught and suffering condition what remained of the woman in her was moved to pity whether my cry acting like a rod of moses upon that rock of her heart which excess of piety had long since sterilized touched into fresh life the springs that had long since been dry and reminded her of the actual bond between us her tone was more kindly and gentle than i had ever known it  agostino my child why are you here and her waxlike fingers very gently touched my head why are you hereand thus what has happened to you  me miserable i groaned  what is it she pressed me an increasing anxiety in her voice  at last i found courage to tell her sufficient to prepare her mind  mother i am a sinner i faltered miserably  i felt her recoiling from me as from the touch of something unclean and contagious her mind conceiving already by some subtle premonition some shadow of the thing that i had done and then gervasio spoke and his voice was soothing as oil upon troubled waters  sinners are we all agostino but repentance purges sin do not abandon yourself to despair my son  but the mother who bore me took no such charitable and christian view  what is it wretched boy what have you done and the cold repugnance in her voice froze anew the courage i was forming  o god help me god help me i groaned miserably  gervasio seeing my condition with that quick and saintly sympathy that was his came softly towards me and set a hand upon my shoulder  dear agostino he murmured would you find it easier to tell me first will you confess to me my son will you let me lift this burden from your soul  still on my knees i turned and looked up into that pale kindly face i caught his thin hand and kissed it ere he could snatch it away if there were more priests like you i cried there would be fewer sinners like me  a shadow crossed his face he smiled very wanly a smile that was like a gleam of pale sunshine from an overclouded sky and he spoke in gentle soothing words of the divine mercy  i staggered to my bruised feet i will confess to you fra gervasio i said and afterwards we will tell my mother  she looked as she would make demur but fra gervasio checked any such intent  it is best so madonna he said gravely his most urgent need is the consolation that the church alone can give  he took me by the arm very gently and led me forth we went to his modest chamber with its waxed floor the hard narrow pallet upon which he slept the blue and gold image of the virgin and the little writingpulpit upon which lay open a manuscript he was illuminating for he was very skilled in that art which already was falling into desuetude  at this pulpit by the window he took his seat and signed to me to kneel i recited the confiteor thereafter with my face buried in my hands my soul writhing in an agony of penitence and shame i poured out the hideous tale of the evil i had wrought  rarely did he speak while i was at that recitation save when i halted or hesitated he would interject a word of pity and of comfort that fell like a blessed balsam upon my spiritual wounds and gave me strength to pursue my awful story  when i had done and he knew me to the full for the murderer and adulterer that i was there fell a long pause during which i waited as a felon awaits sentence but it did not come instead he set himself to examine more closely the thing i had told him he probed it with a question here and a question there and all of a shrewdness that revealed the extent of his knowledge of humanity and the infinite compassion and gentleness that must be the inevitable fruits of such sad knowledge  he caused me to go back to the very day of my arrival at fifantis and thence step by step he led me again over the road that in the past four months i had trodden until he had traced the evil to its very source and could see the tiny spring that had formed the brook which gathering volume as it went had swollen at last into a raging torrent that had laid waste its narrow confines  who that knows all that goes to the making of a sin shall dare to condemn a sinner he cried at last so that i looked up at him startled and penetrated by a ray of hope and comfort he returned my glance with one of infinite pity  it is the woman here upon whom must fall the greater blame said he  but at that i cried out in hot remonstrance adding that i had yet another vileness to confessfor it was now that for the first time i realized it and i related to him how last night i had repudiated her cast her off and fled leaving her to bear the punishment alone  of my conduct in that he withheld his criticism the sin is hers he repeated she was a wife and the adultery is hers more she was the seducer it was she who debauched your mind with lascivious readings and tore away the foundations of virtue from your soul if in the cataclysm that followed she was crushed and smothered it is no more than she had incurred  i still protested that this view was all too lenient to me that it sprang of his love for me that it was not just thereupon he began to make clear to me many things that may have been clear to you worldly ones who have read my scrupulous and exact confessions but which at the time were still all wrapped in obscurity for me  it was as if he held up a mirroran intelligent and informing mirrorin which my deeds were reflected by the light of his own deep knowledge he showed me the gradual seduction to which i had been subjected he showed me giuliana as she really was as she must be from what i had told him he reminded me that she was older by ten years than i and greatly skilled in men and worldliness that where i had gone blindly never seeing what was the inevitable goal and end of the road i trod she had consciously been leading me thither knowing full well what the end must be and desiring it  as for the murder of fifanti the thing was grievous but it had been done in the heat of combat and he could not think that i had meant the poor mans death and fifanti himself was not entirely without blame largely had he contributed to the tragedy there had been evil in his heart a good man would have withdrawn his wife from surroundings which he knew to be perilous and foul not used her as a decoy to enable him to trap and slay his enemy  and the greatest blame of all he attached to that messer arcolano who had recommended fifanti to my mother as a tutor for me knowing full wellas he must have knownwhat manner of house the doctor kept and what manner of wanton was giuliana arcolano had sought to serve fifantis interests in pretending to serve mine and my mothers and my mother should be enlightened that at last she might know that evil man for what he really was  but all this he concluded does not mean agostino that you are to regard yourself as other than a great sinner you have sinned monstrously even when all these extenuations are considered  i know i know i groaned  but beyond forgiveness no man has ever sinned nor have you now so that your repentance is deep and real and when by some penance that i shall impose you shall have cleansed yourself of all this mire that clings to your poor soul you shall have absolution from me  impose your penance i cried eagerly there is none i will not undertake to purchase pardon and some little peace of mind  i will consider it he answered gravely and now let us seek your mother she must be told for a great deals hangs upon this agostino the career to which you were destined is no longer for you my son  my spirit quailed under those last words and yet i felt an immense relief at the same time as if some overwhelming burden had been lifted from me  i am indeed unworthy i said  it is not your unworthiness that i am considering my son but your nature the world calls you overstrongly it is not for nothing that you are the child of giovanni danguissola his blood runs thick in your veins and it is very human blood for such as you there is no hope in the cloister your mother must be made to realize it and she must abandon her dreams concerning you it will wound her very sorely but better that than he shrugged and rose come agostino  and i rose too immensely comforted and soothed already for all that i was yet very far from ease or peace of mind outside his room he set a hand upon my arm  wait he said we have ministered in some degree to your poor spirit let us take thought for the body too you need garments and other things come with me  he led me up to my own little chamber took fresh raiment for me from a press called lorenza and bade her bring bread and wine vinegar and warm water  in a very weak dilution of the latter he bade me bathe my lacerated feet and then he found fine strips of linen in which to bind them ere i drew fresh hose and shoes and meanwhile munching my bread and salt and taking great draughts of the pure if somewhat sour wine my mental peace was increased by the refreshment of my body  at last i stood up more myself than i had been in these last twelve awful hoursfor it was just noon and into twelve hours had been packed the events that well might have filled a lifetime  he put an arm about my shoulder fondly as a father might have done and so led me below again and into my mothers presence  we found her kneeling before the crucifix telling her beads and we stood waiting a few moments in silence until with a sigh and a rustle of her stiff black dress she rose gently and turned to face us  my heart thudded violently in that moment as i looked into that pale face of sorrow then fra gervasio began to speak very gently and softly  your son madonna has been lured into sin by a wanton woman he began and there she interrupted him with a sudden and very piteous cry  not that ah not that she exclaimed putting out hands gropingly before her  that and more madonna he answered gravely be brave to hear the rest it is a very piteous story but the founts of divine mercy are inexhaustible and agostino shall drink therefrom when by penitence he shall have cleansed his lips  very erect she stood there silent and ghostly her face looking diaphanous by contrast with the black draperies that enshrouded her whilst her eyes were great pools of sorrow poor poor mother it is the last recollection i have of her for after that day we never met again and i would give ten years to purgatory if i might recall the last words that passed between us  as briefly as possible and ever thrusting into the foreground the immensity of the snare that had been spread for me and the temptation that had enmeshed me gervasio told her the story of my sin  she heard him through in that immovable attitude one hand pressed to her heart her poor pale lips moving now and again but no sound coming from them her face a white mask of pain and horror  when he had done so wrought upon was i by the sorrow of that countenance that i went forward again to fling myself upon my knees before her  mother forgive i pleaded and getting no answer i put up my hands to take hers mother i cried and the tears were streaming down my face  but she recoiled before me  are you my child she asked in a voice of horror are you the thing that has grown out of that little child i vowed to chastity and to god then has my sin overtaken methe sin of bearing a son to giovanni danguissola that enemy of god  ah mother mother i cried again thinking perhaps by that allpowerful word to move her yet to pity and to gentleness  madonna cried gervasio be merciful if you would look for mercy  he has falsified my vows she answered stonily he was my votive offering for the life of his impious father i am punished for the unworthiness of my offering and the unworthiness of the cause in which i offered it accursed is the fruit of my womb she moaned and sank her head upon her breast  i will atone i cried overwhelmed to see her so distraught  she wrung her pale hands  atone she cried and her voice trembled go then and atone but never let me see you more never let me be reminded of the sinner to whom i have given life go begone and she raised a hand in tragical dismissal  i shrank back and came slowly to my feet and then gervasio spoke and his voice boomed and thundered with righteous indignation  madonna this is inhuman he denounced shall you dare to hope for mercy being yourself unmerciful  i shall pray for strength to forgive him but the sight of him might tempt me back with the memory of the thing that he has done she answered and she had returned to that cold and terrible reserve of hers  and then things that fra gervasio had repressed for years welled up in a mighty flood he is your son and he is as you have made him  as i have made him quoth she and her glance challenged the friar  by what right did you make of him a votive offering by what right did you seek to consecrate a child unborn to a claustral life without thought of his character without reck of the desires that should be his by what right did you make yourself the arbiter of the future of a man unborn  by what right quoth she are you a priest and do you ask me by what right i vowed him to the service of god  and is there think you no way of serving god but in the sterility of the cloister he demanded why since no man is born to damnation and since by your reasoning the world must mean damnation then all men should be encloistered and soon thus there would be an end to man you are too arrogant madonna when you presume to judge what pleases god beware lest you fall into the sin of the pharisee for often have i seen you stand in danger of it  she swayed as if her strength were failing her and again her pale lips moved  enough fra gervasio i will go i cried  nay it is not yet enough he answered and strode down the room until he stood between her and me he is what you have made him he repeated in denunciation had you studied his nature and his inclinations had you left them free to develop along the way that god intended you would have seen whether or not the cloister called him and then would have been the time to have taken a resolve but you thought to change his nature by repressing it and you never saw that if he was not such as you would have him be then most surely would you doom him to damnation by making an evil priest of him  in your pharisaic arrogance madonna you sought to superimpose your will to gods will concerning himyou confounded gods will with your own and so his sins recoil upon you as much as upon any therefore madonna do i bid you beware take a humbler view if you would be acceptable in the divine sight learn to forgive for i say to you today that you stand as greatly in need of forgiveness for the thing that agostino has done as does agostino himself  he paused at last and stood trembling before her his eyes aflame his high cheekbones faintly tinted and she measured him very calmly and coldly with her sombre eyes  are you a priest she asked with steady scorn are you indeed a priest and then her invective was loosened and her voice shrilled and mounted as her anger swayed her what a snake have i harboured here she cried blasphemer you show me clearly whence came the impiety and ungodliness of giovanni danguissola it had the same source as your own it was suckled at your mothers breast  a sob shook him my mother is dead madonna he rebuked her  she is more blessed then than i since she has not lived to see what a power for sin she has brought forth go pitiful friar go both of you you are very choicely mated begone from mondolfo and never let me see either of you more  she staggered to her great chair and sank into it whilst we stood there mute regarding her for myself it was with difficulty that i repressed the burning things that rose to my lips had i given free rein to my tongue i had made of it a whip of scorpions and my anger sprang not from the things she said to me but from what she said to that saintly man who held out a hand to help me out of the morass of sin in which i was being sunk that he that sweet and charitable follower of his master should be abused by her should be dubbed blasphemer and have the cherished memory of his mother defiled by her pietistic utterances was something that inflamed me horribly  but he set a hand upon my shoulder  come agostino he said very gently he was calm once more we will go as we are bidden you and i  and then out of the sweetness of his nature he forged all unwittingly the very iron that should penetrate most surely into her soul  forgive her my son forgive her as you need forgiveness she does not understand the thing she does come we will pray for her that god in his infinite mercy may teach her humility and true knowledge of him  i saw her start as if she had been stung  blasphemer begone she cried again and her voice was hoarse with suppressed anger  and then the door was suddenly flung open and rinolfo clanked in very martial and important his hand thrusting up his sword behind him  madonna he announced the captain of justice from piacenza is here     chapter ii the captain of justice   there was a moments silence after rinolfo had flung that announcement  the captain of justice quoth my mother at length her voice startled what does he seek  the person of my lord agostino danguissola said rinolfo steadily  she sighed very heavily a felons end she murmured and turned to me if thus you may expiate your sins she said speaking more gently let the will of heaven be done admit the captain ser rinolfo  he bowed and turned sharply to depart  stay i cried and rooted him there by the imperative note of my command  fra gervasio was more than right when he said that mine was not a nature for the cloister in that moment i might have realized it to the full by the readiness with which the thought of battle occurred to me and more by the anticipatory glow that warmed me at the very thought of it i was the very son of giovanni danguissola  what force attends the captain i inquired  he has six mounted men with him replied rinolfo in that case i answered you will bid him begone in my name  and if he should not go was rinolfos impudent question  you will tell him that i will drive him hencehim and his braves we keep a garrison of a score of men at leastsufficient to compel him to depart  he will return again with more said rinolfo  does that concern you i snapped let him return with what he pleases today i enrol more forces from the countryside take up the bridge and mount our cannon this is my lair and fortress and ill defend it and myself as becomes my name and blood for i am the lord and master here and the lord of mondolfo is not to be dragged away thus at the heels of a captain of justice you have my orders obey them about it sir  circumstances had shown me the way that i must take and the folly of going forth a fugitive outcast at my mothers bidding i was lord of mondolfo as i had said and they should know and feel it from this hourall of them not excepting my mother  but i reckoned without the hatred rinolfo bore me instead of the prompt obedience that i had looked for he had turned again to my mother  is it your wish madonna he inquired  it is my wish that counts you knave i thundered and advanced upon him  but he fronted me intrepidly i hold my office from my lady the countess i obey none other here  body of god do you defy me i cried am i lord of mondolfo or am i a lackey in my own house yould best obey me ere i break you ser rinolfo we shall see whether the men will take my orders i added confidently  the faintest smile illumined his dark face the men will not stir a finger at the bidding of any but madonna the countess and myself he answered hardily  it was by an effort that i refrained from striking him and then my mother spoke again  it is as ser rinolfo says she informed me so cease this futile resistance sir son and accept the expiation that is offered you  i looked at her she avoiding my glance  madonna i cannot think that it is so said i these men have known me since i was a little lad many of them have followed the fortunes of my father theyll never turn their backs upon his son in the hour of his need they are not all so inhuman as my mother  you mistake sir said rinolfo of the men you knew but one or two remain most of our present force has been enrolled by me in the past month  this was defeat utter and pitiful his tone was too confident he was too sure of his ground to leave me a doubt as to what would befall if i made appeal to his knavish followers my arms fell to my sides and i looked at gervasio his face was haggard and his eyes were very full of sorrow as they rested on me  it is true agostino he said  and as he spoke rinolfo limped out of the room to fetch the captain of justice as my mother had bidden him and his lips smiled cruelly  madam mother i said bitterly you do a monstrous thing you usurp the power that is mine and you deliver meme your sonto the gallows i hope that hereafter when you come to realize to the full your deed you will be able to give your conscience peace  my first duty is to god she answered and to that pitiable answer there was nothing to be rejoined  so i turned my shoulder to her and stood waiting fra gervasio beside me clenching his hands in his impotence and mute despair and then an approaching clank of mail heralded the coming of the captain  rinolfo held the door and cosimo danguissola entered with a firm proud tread two of his men following at his heels  he wore a buffcoat under which no doubt there would be a shirt of mail his gorget and wristlets were of polished steel and his headgear was a steel cap under a cover of peachcoloured velvet thighboots encased his legs sword and dagger hung in the silver carriages at his belt his handsome aquiline face was very solemn  he bowed profoundly to my mother who rose to respond and then he flashed me one swift glance of his piercing eyes  i deplore my business here he announced shortly no doubt it will be known to you already and he looked at me again allowing his eyes to linger on my face  i am ready sir i said  then we had best be going for i understand that none could be less welcome here than i yet in this madonna let me assure you that there is nothing personal to myself i am the slave of my office i do but perform it  so much protesting where no doubt has been expressed said fra gervasio in itself casts a doubt upon your good faith are you not cosimo danguissolamy lords cousin and heir  i am said he yet that has no part in this sir friar  then let it have part let it have the part it should have will you bear one of your own name and blood to the gallows what will men say of that when they perceive your profit in the deed  cosimo looked him boldly between the eyes his hawkface very white  sir priest i know not by what right you address me so but you do me wrong i am the podesta of piacenza bound by an oath that it would dishonour me to break and break it i must or else fulfil my duty here enough he added in his haughty peremptory fashion ser agostino i await your pleasure  i will appeal to rome cried fra gervasio now beside himself with grief  cosimo smiled darkly pityingly it is to be feared that rome will turn a deaf ear to appeals on behalf of the son of giovanni danguissola  and with that he motioned me to precede him silently i pressed fra gervasios hand and on that departed without so much as another look at my mother who sat there a silent witness of a scene which she approved  the menatarms fell into step one on either side of me and so we passed out into the courtyard where cosimos other men were waiting and where was gathered the entire family of the castlea gaping rather frightened little crowd  they brought forth a mule for me and i mounted then suddenly there was fra gervasio at my side again  i too am going hence he said be of good courage agostino there is no effort i will not make on your behalf in a broken voice he added his farewells ere he stood back at the captains peremptory bidding the little troop closed round me and thus within a couple of hours of my coming i departed again from mondolfo surrendered to the hangman by the pious hands of my mother who on her knees no doubt would be thanking god for having afforded her the grace to act in so righteous a manner  once only did my cousin address me and that was soon after we had left the town behind us he motioned the men away and rode to my side then he looked at me with mocking hating eyes  you had done better to have continued in your saints trade than have become so very magnificent a sinner said he  i did not answer him and he rode on beside me in silence some little way  ah well he sighed at last your course has been a brief one but very eventful and who would have suspected so very fierce a wolf under so sheepish an outside body of god you fooled us all you and that whitefaced trull  he said it through his teeth with such a concentration of rage in his tones that it was easy to guess where the sore rankled  i looked at him gravely does it become you sir do you think to gird at one who is your prisoner  and did you not gird at me when it was your turn he flashed back fiercely did not you and she laugh together over that poor fond fool cosimo whose money she took so very freely and yet who seems to have been the only one excluded from her favours  you lie you dog i blazed at him so fiercely that the men turned in their saddles he paled and half raised the gauntleted hand in which he carried his whip but he controlled himself and barked an order to his followers  ride on there  when they had drawn off a little and we were alone again i do not lie sir he said it is a practice which i leave to shavelings of all degrees  if you say that she took aught from you then you lie i repeated  he considered me steadily fool he said at last whence else came her jewels and fine clothes from fifanti do you thinkthat impecunious pedant or perhaps you imagine that it was from gambara in time that grasping prelate might have made the duke pay but pay himself by the blood of god he was never known to pay for anything  or yet again do you suppose her finery was afforded her by caromesser annibale carowho is so much in debt that he is never like to return to piacenza unless some dolt of a patron rewards him for his poetasters labours  no no my shaveling it was i who paidi who was the fool god i more than suspected the others but you you saint you  he flung up his head and laughed bitterly and unpleasantly ah well he ended you are to pay though in different kind it is in the family you see and abruptly raising his voice he shouted to the men to wait  thereafter he rode ahead alone and gloomy whilst no less alone and gloomy rode i amid my guards the thing he had revealed to me had torn away a veil from my silly eyes it had made me understand a hundred little matters that hitherto had been puzzling me and i saw how utterly and fatuously blind i had been to things which even fra gervasio had apprehended from just the relation he had drawn from me  it was as we were entering piacenza by the gate of san lazzaro that i again drew my cousin to my side  sir captain i called to him for i could not bring myself to address him as cousin now he came inquiry in his eyes  where is she now i asked  he stared at me a moment as if my effrontery astonished him then he shrugged and sneered i would i knew for certain was his fierce answer i would i knew then should i have the pair of you and i saw it in his face how unforgivingly he hated me out of his savage jealousy my lord gambara might tell you i scarcely doubt it were i but certain what a reckoning should i not present he may be governor of piacenza but were he governor of hell he should not escape me and with that he rode ahead again and left me  the rumour of our coming sped through the streets ahead of us and out of the houses poured the townsfolk to watch our passage and to point me out one to another with many whisperings and solemn headwaggings and the farther we advanced the greater was the concourse until by the time we reached the square before the communal palace we found there what amounted to a mob awaiting us  my guards closed round me as if to protect me from that crowd but i was strangely without fear and presently i was to see how little cause there was for any and to realize that the action of my guards was sprung from a very different motive  the people stood silent and on every upturned face of which i caught a glimpse i saw something that was akin to pity presently however as we drew nearer to the palace a murmur began to rise it swelled and grew fierce suddenly a cry rose vehement and clear  rescue rescue  he is the lord of mondolfo shouted one tall fellow and the cardinallegate makes a catspaw of him he is to suffer for messer gambaras villainy  again he was answered by the cryrescue rescue whilst some added an angrydeath to the legate  whilst i was deeply marvelling at all this cosimo looked at me over his shoulder and though his lips were steady his eyes seemed to smile charged with a message of derisionand something more something that i could not read then i heard his hard metallic voice  back there you curs to your kennels out of the way or we ride you down  he had drawn his sword and his white hawkface was so cruel and determined that they fell away before him and their cries died down  we passed into the courtyard of the communal palace and the great studded gates were slammed in the faces of the mob and barred  i got down from my mule and was conducted at cosimos bidding to one of the dungeons under the palace where i was left with the announcement that i must present myself tomorrow before the tribunal of the ruota  i flung myself down upon the dried rushes that had been heaped in a corner to do duty for a bed and i abandoned myself to my bitter thoughts in particular i pondered the meaning of the crowds strange attitude nor was it a riddle difficult to resolve it was evident that believing gambara as they did to be giulianas lover and informed perhapsinvention swelling rumour as it willthat the cardinallegate had ridden late last night to fifantis house it had been put about that the foul murder done there was messer gambaras work  thus was the legate reaping the harvest of all the hatred he had sown of all the tyranny and extortion of his iron rule in piacenza and willing to believe any evil of the man they hated they not only laid fifantis death at his door but they went to further lengths and accounted that i was the catspaw that i was to be sacrificed to save the legates face and reputation they remembered perhaps the illodour in which we anguissola of mondolfo had been at rome for the ghibelline leanings that ever had been ours and for the rebellion of my father against the pontifical sway and their conclusions gathered a sort of confirmation from that circumstance  long upon the very edge of mutiny and revolt against gambaras injustice it had needed but what seemed a crowning one such as this to quicken their hatred into expression  it was all very clear and obvious and it seemed to me that tomorrows trial should be very interesting i had but to deny i had but to make myself the mouthpiece of the rumour that was abroad and heaven alone could foretell what the consequences might be  then i smiled bitterly to myself deny o no that was a last vileness i could not perpetrate the ruota should hear the truth and gambara should be left to shelter giuliana whocosimo was assuredhad fled to him in her need as to a natural protector  it was a bitter thought the intensity of that bitterness made me realize with alarm how it still was with me and pondering this i fell asleep utterly worn out in body and in mind by the awful turmoil of that day     chapter iii gambaras interests   i awakened to find a man standing beside me he was muffled in a black cloak and carried a lanthorn behind him the door gaped as he had left it  instantly i sat up conscious of my circumstance and surroundings and at my movement this visitor spoke  you sleep very soundly for a man in your case said he and the voice was that of my lord gambara its tone quite coldly critical  he set down the lanthorn on a stool whence it shed a wheel of yellow light intersected with black beams his cloak fell apart and i saw that he was dressed for riding very plainly in sombre garments and that he was armed  he stood slightly to one side that the light might fall upon my face leaving his own in shadow thus he considered me for some moments in silence at last very slowly very bitterly shaking his head as he spoke  you fool you clumsy fool he said  having drawn as you have seen my own conclusions from the attitude of the mob i was in little doubt as to the precise bearing of his words  i answered him sincerely if folly were all my guilt said i it would be well  he sniffed impatiently still sanctimonious he sneered tcha up now and play the man at least you have shed your robe of sanctity messer agostino have done with pretence  i do not pretend i answered him and as for playing the man i shall accept what punishment the law may have for me with fortitude at least if i can but expiate  expiate a fig he snapped interrupting me why do you suppose that i am here  i wait to learn  i am here because through your folly you have undone us all what need he cried the anger of expostulation quivering in his voice what need was there to kill that oaf fifanti  he would have killed me said i i slew him in selfdefence  ha and do you hope to save your neck with such a plea  nay i have no thought of urging it i but tell it you  there is not the need to tell me anything he answered his anger very plain i am very well informed of all rather let me tell you something do you realize sir that you have made it impossible for me to abide another day in piacenza  i am sorry i began lamely  present your regrets to satan he snapped me they avail nothing i am put to the necessity of abandoning my governorship and fleeing by night like a hunted thief and i have you to thank for it you see me on the point of departure my horses wait above so you may add my ruin to the other fine things you accomplished yesternight for a saint you are overbusy sir and he turned away and strode the length of my cell and back so that at last i had a glimpse of his face which was drawn and scowling gone now was the last vestige of his habitual silkiness the pomanderball hung neglected and his delicate fingers tugged viciously at his little pointed beard his great sapphire ring flashing sombrely  look you ser agostino i could kill you and take joy in it i could by god  his eyes upon me he drew from his breast a folded paper instead i bring you liberty i open your doors for you and bid you escape here man take this paper present it to the officer at the fodesta gate he will let you pass and then away with you out of the territory of piacenza  for an instant my heartbeats seemed suspended by astonishment i swung my legs round and half rose excitedly then i sank back again my mind was made up i was tired of the world sick of life the first draught of which had turned so bitter in my throat if by my death i might expiate my sins and win pardon by my submission and humility it was all i could desire i should be glad to be released from all the misery and sorrow into which i had been born  i told him so in some few words you mean me well my lord i ended and i thank you but  by god and the saints he blazed i do not mean you well at all i mean you anything but well have i not said that i could kill you with satisfaction whatever be the sins of egidio gambara he is no hypocrite and he lets his enemies see his face unmasked  but then i cried amazed why do you offer me my freedom  because this cursed populace is in such a temper that if you are brought to trial i know not what may happen as likely as not we shall have an insurrection open revolt against the pontifical authority and red war in the streets and this is not the time for it  the holy father requires the submission of these people we are upon the eve of duke pier luigis coming to occupy his new states and it imports that he should be well received that he should be given a loving welcome by his subjects if instead they meet him with revolt and defiance the reasons will be sought and the blame of the affair will recoil upon me your cousin cosimo will see to that he is a very subtle gentleman this cousin of yours and he has a way of working to his own profit so now you understand i have no mind to be crushed in this business enough have i suffered already through you enough am i suffering in resigning my governorship so there is but one way out there must be no trial tomorrow it must be known that you have escaped thus they will be quieted and the matter will blow over so now ser agostino we understand each other you must go  and whither am i to go i cried remembering my mother and that mondolfothe only place of safetywas closed to me by her cruelly pious hands  whither he echoed what do i care to hellanywhere so that you get out of this  id sooner hang said i quite seriously  yould hang and welcome for all the love i bear you he answered his impatience growing but if you hang blood will be shed innocent lives will be lost and i myself may come to suffer  for you sir i care nothing i answered him taking his own tone and returning him the same brutal frankness that he used with me that you deserve to suffer i do not doubt but since other blood than yours might be shed as you say since innocent lives might be lost give me the paper  he was frowning upon me and smiling viperishly at the same time i like your frankness better than your piety said he so now we understand each other and know that neither is in the others debt hereafter beware of egidio gambara i give you this last loyal warning see that you do not come into my way again  i rose and looked at himlooked down from my greater height i knew well the source of this last parting show of hatred like cosimos it sprang from jealousy and a growth more potential of evil does not exist  he bore my glance a moment then turned and took up the lanthorn come he said and obediently i followed him up the winding stone staircase and so to the very gates of the palace  we met no one what had become of the guards i cannot think but i am satisfied that gambara himself had removed them he opened the wicket for me and as i stepped out he gave me the paper and whistled softly almost at once i heard a sound of muffled hooves under the colonnade and presently loomed the figures of a man and a mule both dim and ghostly in the pearly light of dawnfor that was the hour  gambara followed me out and pulled the wicket after him  that beast is for you he said curtly it will the better enable you to get away  as curtly i acknowledged the gift and mounted whilst the groom held the stirrup for me  o it was the oddest of transactions my lord gambara with death in his heart very reluctantly giving me a life i did not want  i dug my heels into the mules sides and started across the silent empty square then plunged into a narrow street where the gloom was almost as of midnight and so pushed on  i came out into the open space before the porta fodesta and so to the gate itself from one of the windows of the gatehouse a light shone yellow and presently in answer to my call out came an officer followed by two men one of whom carried a lanthorn swinging from his pike he held this light aloft whilst the officer surveyed me  what now he challenged none passes out tonight  for answer i thrust the paper under his nose orders from my lord gambara said i  but he never looked at it none passes out tonight he repeated imperturbably so run my orders  orders from whom quoth i surprised by his tone and manner  from the captain of justice if you must know so you may get you back whence you came and wait till daylight  ah but stay i said i do not think you can have heard me i carry orders from my lord the governor the captain of justice cannot overbear these and i shook the paper insistently  my orders are that none is to passnot even the governor himself he answered firmly  it was very daring of cosimo and i saw his aim he was as gambara had said a very subtle gentleman he too had set his finger upon the pulse of the populace and perceived what might be expected of it he was athirst for vengeance as he had shown me and determined that neither i nor gambara should escape first i must be tried condemned and hanged and then he trusted no doubt that gambara would be torn in pieces and it was quite possible that messer cosimo himself would secretly find means to fan the mobs indignation against the legate into fierce activity and it seemed that the game was in his hands for this officers resoluteness showed how implicitly my cousin was obeyed  of that same resoluteness of the lieutenants i was to have a yet more signal proof for presently whilst still i stood there vainly remonstrating down the street behind me rode gambara himself on a tall horse followed by a mulelitter and an escort of half a score of armed grooms  he uttered an exclamation when he saw me still there the gate shut and the officer in talk with me he spurred quickly forward  how is this he demanded haughtily and angrily this man rides upon the business of the state why this delay to open for him  my orders said the lieutenant civilly but firmly are that none passes out tonight  do you know me demanded gambara  yes my lord  and you dare talk to me of your orders there are no orders here in piacenza but my orders set me wide the wicket of that gate i myself must pass  my lord i dare not  you are insubordinate said the legate of a sudden very cold  he had no need to ask whose orders were these at once he saw the trammel spread for him but if messer cosimo was subtle so too was messer gambara by not so much as a word did he set his authority in question with the officer  you are insubordinate was all he answered him and then to the two menatarms behind the lieutenantho there he called bring out the guard i am egidio gambara your governor  so calm and firm and full of assurance was his tone so unquestionable his right to command them that the men sprang instantly to obey him  what would you do my lord quoth the officer and he seemed daunted  buffoon said gambara between his teeth you shall see  six men came hurrying from the gatehouse and the cardinal called to them  let the corporal stand forth he said  a man advanced a pace from the rank they had hastily formed and saluted  place me your officer under arrest said the legate coldly advancing no reason for the order let him be locked in the gatehouse until my return and do you sir corporal take command here meanwhile  the startled fellow saluted again and advanced upon his officer the lieutenant looked up with sudden uneasiness in his eyes he had gone too far he had not reckoned upon being dealt with in this summary fashion he had been bold so long as he conceived himself no more than cosimos mouthpiece obeying orders for the issuing of which cosimo must answer instead it seemed the governor intended that he should answer for them himself whatever he now dared he knewas gambara knewthat his men would never dare to disobey the governor who was the supreme authority there under the pope  my lord he exclaimed i had my orders from the captain of justice  and dare you to say that your orders included my messengers and my own self thundered the dainty prelate  explicitly my lord answered the lieutenant  it shall be dealt with on my return and if what you say is proved true the captain of justice shall suffer with yourself for this treasonfor that is the offence take him away and someone open me that gate  there was an end to disobedience and a moment or two later we stood outside the town on the bank of the river which gurgled and flowed away smoothly and mistily in the growing light between the rows of stalwart poplars that stood like sentinels to guard it  and now begone said gambara curtly to me and wheeling my mule i rode for the bridge of boats crossed it and set myself to breast the slopes beyond  midway up i checked and looked back across the wide water the light had grown quite strong by now and in the east there was a faint pink flush to herald the approaching sun away beyond the river moving southward i could just make out the legates little cavalcade and then for the first time a question leapt in my mind concerning the litter whose leathern curtains had remained so closely drawn whom did it contain could it be giuliana had cosimo spoken the truth when he said that she had gone to gambara for shelter  a little while ago i had sighed for death and exulted in the chance of expiation and of purging myself of the foulness of sin and now at the sudden thought that occurred to me i fell a prey to an insensate jealousy touching the woman whom i had lately loathed as the cause of my downfall o the inconstancy of the human heart and the eternal battles in such poor natures as mine between the knowledge of right and the desire for wrong  it was in vain that i sought to turn my thoughts to other things in vain that i cast them back upon my recent condition and my recent resolves in vain that i remembered the penitence of yestermorn the confession at fra gervasios knee and the strong resolve to do penance and make amends by the purity of all my afterlife vain was it all  i turned my mule about and still wrestling with my conscience choking it i rode down the hill again and back across the bridge and then away to the south to follow messer gambara and set an end to doubt  i must know i must it was no matter that conscience told me that here was no affair of mine that giuliana belonged to the past from which i was divorced the past for which i must atone and seek forgiveness i must know and so i rode along the dusty highway in pursuit of messer gambara who was proceeding i imagined to join the duke at parma  i had no difficulty in following them a question here and a question there accompanied by a description of the party was all that was necessary to keep me on their track and ever it seemed to me from the answers that i got was i lessening the distance that separated us  i was weak for want of food for the last time that i had eaten was yesterday at noon at mondolfo and then but little yet all i had this day were some bunches of grapes that i stole in passing from a vineyard and ate as i trotted on along that eternal via aemilia  it was towards noon at last that a taverner at castel guelfo informed me that my party had passed through the town but half an hour ahead of me at the news i urged my already weary beast along for unless i made good haste now it might well happen that parma should swallow up gambara and his party ere i overtook them and then some ten minutes later i caught a flutter of garments half a mile or so ahead of me amid the elms i quitted the road and entered the woodland a little way i still rode then dismounting i tethered my mule and went forward cautiously on foot  i found them in a little sunken dell by a tiny rivulet lying on my belly in the long grass above i looked down upon them with a black hatred of jealousy in my heart  they were reclining there in that cool fragrant spot in the shadow of a great beechtree a cloth had been spread upon the ground and upon this were platters of roast meats white bread and fruits and a flagon of wine a second flagon standing in the brook to cool  my lord gambara was talking and she was regarding him with eyes that were half veiled a slow insolent smile upon her matchless face presently at something that he said she laughed outright a laugh so tuneful and lighthearted that i thought i must be dreaming all this it was the gay frank innocent laughter of a child and i never heard in all my life a sound that caused me so much horror he leaned across to her and stroked her velvet cheek with his delicate hand whilst she suffered it in that lazy fashion that was so peculiarly her own  i stayed for no more i wriggled back a little way to where a clump of hazel permitted me to rise without being seen thence i fled the spot and as i went my heart seemed as it must burst and my lips could frame but one word which i kept hurling out of me like an imprecation and that word was trull  two nights ago had happened enough to stamp her soul for ever with sorrow and despair yet she could sit there laughing and feasting and trulling it lightly with the legate  the little that remained me of my illusions was shivered in that hour there was i swore no good in all the world for even where goodness sought to find a way it grew distorted as in my mothers case and yet through all her pietism surely she had been right there was no peace no happiness save in the cloister and at last the full bitterness of penitence and regret overtook me when i reflected that by my own act i had rendered myself for ever unworthy of the cloisters benign shelter     chapter iv the anchorite of monte orsaro   i went blindly through the tangle of undergrowth stumbling at every step and scarce noticing that i stumbled and in this fashion i came presently back to my mule  i mounted and rode amain not by the way that i had come but westward not by road but by bridlepaths through meadowland and forest up hill and down like a man entranced not knowing whither i went nor caring  besides whither was i to go like my father before me i was an outcast a fugitive outlaw but this troubled me not yet my mind my wounded tortured mind was all upon the past it was of giuliana that i thought as i rode in the noontide warmth of that september day and never can human brain have held a sorer conflict of reflection than was mine  no shadow now remained of the humour that had possessed me in the hour in which i had repudiated her after the murder of fifanti i had heard fra gervasio deliver judgment upon her and i had doubted his justice felt that he used her mercilessly my own sight had now confirmed to me the truth of what he had said but in doing soin allowing me to see her in another mans possessiona very rage of jealousy had been stirred in me and a greater rage of longing  this longing followed upon my first bitter denunciation of her and it followed soon it is in our natures as i then experienced never more to desire a thing than when we see it lost to us bitterly now did i reproach myself for not having borne her off with me two nights ago when i had fled fifantis house when she herself had urged that course upon me i despised myself out of my present want for my repudiation of hera hundred times more bitterly than i had despised myself when i imagined that i had done a vileness by that repudiation  never until now did it seem to me had i known how deeply i loved her how deeply the roots of our passion had burrowed down into my heart and fastened there to be eradicated only with life itself so thought i then and thinking so i cried her name aloud called to her through the scented pinewoods thus voicing my longing and my despair  and swift on the heels of this would come another mood there would come the consciousness of the sin of it all the imperative need to cleanse myself of this to efface her memory from my soul which could not hold it without sinning anew in fierce desire i strove to do so with all my poor weak might i denounced her to myself again for a soulless harlot blamed her for all the ill that had befallen me accounted her the very hand that had wielded me a senseless instrument to slay her importunate husband  and then i perceived that this was as pitiful a ruse of selfdeception as that of the fox in the fable unable to reach the luscious grapes above him for as well might a starving man seek to compel by an effort of his will the hunger to cease from gnawing at his vitals  thus were desire and conscience locked in conflict and each held the ascendancy alternately what time i pushed onward aimlessly until i came to the broad bed of a river  a grey waste of sunparched boulders spread away to the stream which was diminished by the long drought beyond the narrow sheen of water stretched another rocky space and then came the green of meadows and a brown city upon the rising ground  the city was fornovo and the diminished river was the taro the ancient boundary between the gaulish and ligurian folk i stood upon the historic spot where charles viii had cut his way through the allies to win back to france after the occupation of naples but the grotesque little king who had been dust for a quarter of a century troubled my thoughts not at all just then the taro brought me memories not of battle but of home to reach mondolfo i had but to follow the river up the valley towards that long ridge of the apennines arrayed before me with the tall bulks of mount giso and mount orsaro their snowcaps sparkling in the flood of sunshine that poured down upon them two hours or perhaps three at most along the track of that cool glittering water and the grey citadel of mondolfo would come into view  it was this very reflection that brought me now to consider my condition to ask myself whither i should turn money i had nonenot so much as a single copper grosso to sell i had nothing but the clothes i stood inblack clerkly garments that i had got yesterday at mondolfo not so much as a weapon had i that i might have bartered for a few coins there was the mule that should yield a ducat or two but when this was spent what then to go a suppliant to that pious icicle my mother were worse than useless  whither was i to turni lord of mondolfo and carmina one of the wealthiest and most puissant tyrants of this val di taro it provoked me almost to laughter of a fierce and bitter sort perhaps some peasant of the contado would take pity on his lord and give him shelter and nourishment in exchange for such labour as his lord might turn his stout limbs to upon that peasants land which was my own  i might perhaps essay it certainly it was the only thing that was left me for against my mother and to support my rights i might not invoke a law which had placed me under a ban a law that would deal me out its rigours did i reveal myself  then i had thoughts of seeking sanctuary in some monastery of offering myself as a laybrother to do menial work and in this way perhaps i might find peace and in a lesser degree than was originally intended the comforts of the religion to which i had been so grossly unfaithful the thought grew and developed into a resolve it brought me some comfort it became a desire  i pushed on following the river along ground that grew swiftly steeper conscious that perforce my journey must end soon for my mule was showing signs of weariness  some three miles farther having by then penetrated the green rampart of the foothills i came upon the little village of pojetta it is a village composed of a single street throwing out as its branches a few narrow alleys possessing a dingy church and a dingier tavern this last had for only sign a bunch of withered rosemary that hung above its grimy doors  i drew rein there as utterly weary as my mule hungry and thirsty and weak i got down and invited the suspicious scrutiny of the lanternjawed taverner who for all that my appearance was humble enough in such garments as i wore must have accounted me none the less of too fine an air for such a house as his  care for my beast i bade him i shall stay here an hour or two  he nodded surlily and led the mule away whilst i entered the taverns single room coming into it from the sunlight i could scarcely see anything at first so dark did the place seem what light there was came through the open door for the chambers single window had long since been rendered opaque by a screen of accumulated dust and cobwebs it was a roomy place lowceilinged with blackened rafters running parallel across its dirty yellow wash  the floor was strewn with foul rushes that must have lain unchanged for months slippery with grease and littered with bones that had been flung there by the polite guests the place was wont to entertain and it stank most vilely of rancid oil and burnt meats and other things indefinable in all but their acrid nauseating unclean pungency  a fire was burning low at the rooms far end and over this a girl was stooping tending something in a stewpot she looked round at my advent and revealed herself for a tall blackhaired sloeeyed wench comely in a rude brown way and strong to judge by the muscular arms which were bared to the elbow  interest quickened her face at sight of so unusual a patron she slouched forward wiping her hands upon her hips as she came and pulled out a stool for me at the long trestletable that ran down the middle of the floor  grouped about the upper end of this table sat four men of the peasant type suntanned bearded and rudely garbed in loose jerkins and cross gartered leg cloths  a silence had fallen upon them as i entered and they too were now inspecting me with a frank interest which in their simple way they made no attempt to conceal  i sank wearily to the stool paying little heed to them and in answer to the girls invitation to command her i begged for meat and bread and wine whilst she was preparing these one of the men addressed me civilly and i answered him as civilly but absently for i had enough of other matters to engage my thoughts then another of them questioned me in a friendly tone as to whence i came instinctively i concealed the truth answering vaguely that i was from castel guelfowhich was the neighbourhood in which i had overtaken my lord gambara and giuliana  and what do they say at castel guelfo of the things that are happening in piacenza asked another  in piacenza quoth i why what is happening in piacenza  eagerly with an ardour to show themselves intimate with the affairs of towns as is the way of rustics they related to me what already i had gathered to be the vulgar version of fifantis death each spoke in turn cutting in the moment another paused to breathe and sometimes they spoke together each anxious to have the extent of his information revealed and appreciated  and their tale of course was that gambara being the lover of fifantis wife had dispatched the doctor on a trumpedup mission and had gone to visit her by night but that the suspicious fifanti lying near by in wait and having seen the cardinal enter followed him soon after and attacked him whereupon the lord gambara had slain him and then that wily fiendish prelate had sought to impose the blame upon the young lord of mondolfo who was a student in the pedants house and he had caused the young mans arrest but this the piacentini would not endure they had risen and threatened the governors life and he was fled to rome or parma whilst the authorities to avoid a scandal had connived at the escape of messer danguissola who was also gone no man knew whither  the news had travelled speedily into that mountain fastness it seemed but it had been garbled at its source the piacentini conceived that they held some evidence of what they believedthe evidence of the lad whom fifanti had left to spy and who had borne him the tale that the cardinal was within this evidence they accounted wellconfirmed by the legates flight  thus is history written not a doubt but that some industrious scribe in piacenza with a grudge against gambara would set down what was the talk of the town and hereafter it is not to be doubted the murder of astorre fifanti for the vilest of all motives will be added to the many crimes of egidio gambara that posterity may execrate his name even beyond its already rich enough deserts  i heard them in silence and but little moved yet with a question now and then to probe how far this silly story went in detail and whilst they were still heaping abuse upon the legateof whom they spoke as jews may speak of porkcame the lanternjawed host with a dish of broiled goat some bread and a jug of wine this he set before me then joined them in their vituperation of messer gambara  i ate ravenously and for all that i do not doubt the meat was tough and burnt yet at the time those pieces of broiled goat upon that dirty table seemed the sweetest food that ever had been set before me  finding that i was but indifferently communicative and had little news to give them the peasants fell to gossiping among themselves and they were presently joined by the girl whose name it seemed was giovannozza she came to startle them with the rumour of a fresh miracle attributed to the hermit of monte orsaro  i looked up with more interest than i had hitherto shown in anything that had been said and i inquired who might be this anchorite  sainted virgin cried the girl setting her hands upon her generous hips and turning her bold sloeeyes upon me in a stare of incredulity whence are you sir that you seem to know nothing of the world you had not heard the news of piacenza which must be known to everyone by now and you have never heard of the anchorite of monte orsaro she appealed by a gesture to heaven against the stygian darkness of my mind  he is a very holy man said one of the peasants  and he dwells alone in a hut midway up the mountain added a second  in a hut which he built for himself with his own hands a third explained  and he lives on nuts and herbs and such scraps of food as are left him by the charitable put in the fourth to show himself as full of knowledge as his fellows  but now it was giovannozza who took up the story firmly and resolutely and being a woman she easily kept her tongue going and overbore the peasants so that they had no further share in the tale until it was entirely told from her i learnt that the anchorite one fra sebastiano possessed a miraculous image of the blessed martyr st sebastian whose wounds miraculously bled during passion week and that there were no ills in the world that this blood would not cure provided that those to whom it was applied were clean of mortal sin and imbued with the spirit of grace and faith  no pious wayfarer going over the pass of cisa into tuscany but would turn aside to kiss the image and ask a blessing at the hands of the anchorite and yearly in the season of the miraculous manifestation great pilgrimages were made to the hermitage by folk from the valleys of the taro and bagnanza and even from beyond the apennines so that fra sebastiano gathered great store of alms part of which he redistributed amongst the poor part of which he was saving to build a bridge over the bagnanza torrent in crossing which so many poor folk had lost their lives  i listened intently to the tale of wonders that followed and now the peasants joined in again each with a story of some marvellous cure of which he had direct knowledge and many and amazing were the details they gave me of the saintfor they spoke of him as a saint alreadyso that no doubt lingered in my mind of the holiness of this anchorite  giovannozza related how a goatherd coming one night over the pass had heard from the neighbourhood of the hut the sounds of singing and the music was the strangest and sweetest ever sounded on earth so that it threw the poor fellow into a strange ecstasy and it was beyond doubt that what he had heard was an angel choir and then one of the peasants the tallest and blackest of the four swore with a great oath that one night when he himself had been in the hills he had seen the hermits hut all aglow with heavenly light against the black mass of the mountain  all this left me presently very thoughtful filled with wonder and amazement then their talk shifted again and it was of the vintage they discoursed the fine yield of grapes about fontana fredda and the heavy crop of oil that there would be that year and then with the hum of their voices gradually receding it ceased altogether for me and i was asleep with my head pillowed upon my arms  it would be an hour later when i awakened a little stiff and cramped from the uncomfortable position in which i had rested the peasants had departed and the surlyfaced host was standing at my side  you should be resuming your journey said he seeing me awake it wants but a couple of hours to sunset and if you are going over the pass it were well not to let the night overtake you  my journey said i aloud and looked askance at him  whither in heavens name was i journeying  then i bethought me of my earlier resolve to seek shelter in some convent and his mention of the pass caused me to think now that it would be wiser to cross the mountains into tuscany there i should be beyond the reach of the talons of the farnese law which might close upon me again at any time so long as i was upon pontifical territory  i rose heavily and suddenly bethought me of my utter lack of money it dismayed me for a moment then i remembered the mule and determined that i must go afoot  i have a mule to sell said i the beast in your stables  he scratched his ear reflecting no doubt upon the drift of my announcement yes he said dubiously and to what market are you taking it  i am offering it to you said i  to me he cried and instantly suspicion entered his crafty eye and darkened his brow where got you the mule he asked and snapped his lips together  the girl entering at that moment stood at gaze listening  where did i get it i echoed what is that to you  he smiled unpleasantly it is this to me that if the bargelli were to come up here and discover a stolen mule in my stables it would be an ill thing for me  i flushed angrily do you imply that i stole the mule said i so fiercely that he changed his air  nay now nay now he soothed me and after all it happens that i do not want a mule i have one mule already and i am a poor man and  a fig for your whines said i here is the case i have no moneynot a grosso so the mule must pay for my dinner name your price and let us have done  ha he fumed at me i am to buy your stolen beast am i i am to be frightened by your violence into buying it be off you rogue or ill raise the village and make short work of you be off i say  he backed away as he spoke towards the fireplace and from the corner took a stout oaken staff he was a villain a thieving rogue that much was plain and it was no less plain that i must submit and leave my beast to him or else perhaps suffer a worse alternative  had those four honest peasants still been there he would not have dared to have so borne himself but as it was without witnesses to say how the thing had truly happened if he raised the village against me how should they believe a man who confessed that he had eaten a dinner for which he could not pay it must go very ill with me  if i tried conclusions with him i could break him in two notwithstanding his staff but there would remain the girl to give the alarm and when to dishonesty i should have added violence my case would be that of any common bandit  very well i said you are a dirty thieving rascal and a vile one to take advantage of one in my position i shall return for the mule another day meanwhile consider it in pledge for what i owe you but see that you are ready for the reckoning when i present it  with that i swung on my heel strode past the bigeyed girl out of that foul kennel into gods sweet air followed by the ordures of speech which that knave flung after me  i turned up the street setting my face towards the mountains and trudged amain  soon i was out of the village and ascending the steep road towards the pass of cisa that leads over the apennines to pontremoli this way had hannibal come when he penetrated into etruria some two thousand years ago i quitted the road and took to bridlepaths under the shoulder of the mighty mount prinzera thus i pushed on and upward through greygreen of olive and deep enamelled green of figtrees and came at last into a narrow gorge between two great mountains a place of ferns and moisture where all was shadow and the air felt chill  above me the mountains towered to the blue heavens their flanks of a green that was in places turned to golden where autumns fingers had already touched those heights in places gashed with grey and purple wounds where the bare rock thrust through  i went on aimlessly and came presently upon a little fir thicket through which i pushed towards a sound of tumbling waters i stood at last upon the rocks above a torrent that went thundering down the mighty gorge which it had cloven itself between the hills thence i looked down a long wavering valley over which the rays of the evening sun were slanting and hazily in the distance i could see the russet city of fornovo which i had earlier passed that day this torrent was the bagnanza and it effectively barred all passage so i went up along its bed scrambling over lichened rocks or sinking my feet into carpets of soft yielding moss  at length grown weary and uncertain of my way i sank down to rest and think and my thoughts were chiefly of that hermit somewhere above me in these hills and of the blessedness of such a life remote from the world that man had made so evil and then with thinking of the world came thoughts of giuliana two nights ago i had held her in my arms two nights ago and already it seemed a century remoteas remote as all the rest of that life of which it seemed a part for there had been a break in my existence with the murder of fifanti and in the past two days i had done more living and i had aged more than in all the eighteen years before  thinking of giuliana i evoked her image the glowing ruddy copper of her hair the dark mystery of her eyes so heavylidded and languorous in their smile my spirit conjured her to stand before me all white and seductive as i had known her and my longings were again upon me like a searing torture  i fought them hard i sought to shut that image out but it abode to mock me and then faintly from the valley borne upon the breeze that came sighing through the firtrees rose the tinkle of an angelus bell  i fell upon my knees and prayed to the mother of purity for strength and thus i came once more to peace that done i crept under the shelter of a projecting rock wrapped my cloak tightly about me and lay down upon the hard ground to rest for i was very weary  lying there i watched the colour fading from the sky i saw the purple lights in the east turn to an orange that paled into faintest yellow and this again into turquoise the shadows crept up those heights a star came out overhead then another then a score of stars to sparkle silvery in the blueblack heavens  i turned on my side and closed my eyes seeking to sleep and then quite suddenly i heard a sound of unutterable sweetnessa melody so faint and subtle that it had none of the form and rhythm of earthly music i sat up my breath almost arrested and listened more intently i could still hear it but very faint and distant it was as a sound of silver bells and yet it was not quite that i remembered the stories i had heard that day in the tavern at pojetta and the talk of the mystic melodies by which travellers had been drawn to the anchorites abode i noted the direction of the sound and i determined to be guided by it and to cast myself at the feet of that holy man to implore of him who could heal bodies the miracle of my souls healing and my minds purging from its torment  i pushed on then through the luminous night keeping as much as possible to the open for under trees lesser obstacles were not to be discerned the melody grew louder as i advanced ever following the bagnanza towards its source and the stream too being much less turbulent now did not overbear that other sound  it was a melody on long humming notes chiefly it seemed to me upon two notes with the occasional interjection of a third and fourth and at long and rare intervals of a fifth it was harmonious beyond all description just as it was weird and unearthly but now that i heard it more distinctly it had much more the sound of bellsvery sweet and silvery  and then quite suddenly i was startled by a human crya piteous wailing cry that told of helplessness and pain i went forward more quickly in the direction whence it came rounded a stout hazel coppice and stood suddenly before a rude hut of pine logs built against the side of the rock through a small unglazed window came a feeble shaft of light  i halted there breathless and a little afraid this must be the dwelling of the anchorite i stood upon holy ground  and then the cry was repeated it proceeded from the hut i advanced to the window took courage and peered in by the light of a little brass oil lamp with a single wick i could faintly make out the interior  the rock itself formed the far wall of it and in this a niche was carveda deep capacious niche in the shadows of which i could faintly discern a figure some two feet in height which i doubted not would be the miraculous image of st sebastian in front of this was a rude wooden pulpit set very low and upon it a great book with iron clasps and a yellow grinning skull  all this i beheld at a single glance there was no other furniture in that little place neither chair nor table and the brass lamp was set upon the floor near a heapedup bed of rushes and dried leaves upon which i beheld the anchorite himself he was lying upon his back and seemed a vigorous ablebodied man of a good length  he wore a loose brown habit roughly tied about his middle by a piece of rope from which was suspended an enormous string of beads his beard and hair were black but his face was livid as a corpses and as i looked at him he emitted a fresh groan and writhed as if in mortal suffering  o my god my god i heard him crying am i to die alone mercy i repent me and he writhed moaning and rolled over on his side so that he faced me and i saw that his livid countenance was glistening with sweat  i stepped aside and lifted the latch of the rude door  are you suffering father i asked almost fearfully at the sound of my voice he suddenly sat up and there was a great fear in his eyes then he fell back again with a cry  i thank thee my god i thank thee  i entered and crossing to his side i went down on my knees beside him  without giving me time to speak he clutched my arm with one of his clammy hands and raised himself painfully upon his elbow his eyes burning with the fever that was in him  a priest he gasped get me a priest oh if you would be saved from the flames of everlasting hell get me a priest to shrive me i am dying and i would not go hence with the burden of all this sin upon my soul  i could feel the heat of his hand through the sleeve of my coat his condition was plain a raging fever was burning out his life  be comforted i said i will go at once and i rose whilst he poured forth his blessings upon me  at the door i checked to ask what was the nearest place  casi he said hoarsely to your right you will see the path down the hillside you cannot miss it in half an hour you should be there and return at once for i have not long i feel it  with a last word of reassurance and comfort i closed the door and plunged away into the darkness     chapter v the renunciation   i found the path the hermit spoke of and followed its sinuous downhill course now running when the ground was open now moving more cautiously yet always swiftly when it led me through places darkened by trees  at the end of a halfhour i espied below me the twinkling lights of a village on the hillside and a few minutes later i was among the houses of casi to find the priest in his little cottage by the church was an easy matter to tell him my errand and to induce him to come with me to tend the holy man who lay dying alone in the mountain was as easy to return however was the most difficult part of the undertaking for the upward path was steep and the priest was old and needed such assistance as my own very weary limbs could scarcely render him we had the advantage of a lanthorn which he insisted upon bringing and we made as good progress as could be expected but it was best part of two hours after my setting out before we stood once more upon the little platform where the hermit had his hut  we found the place in utter darkness through lack of oil his little lamp had burned itself out and when we entered the man on the bed of wattles lay singing a lewd tavernsong which coming from such holy lips filled me with horror and amazement  but the old priest with that vast and doleful experience of deathbeds which belongs to men of his class was quick to perceive the cause of this the fever was flickering up before lifes final extinction and the poor moribund was delirious and knew not what he said  for an hour we watched beside him waiting the priest was confident that there would be a return of consciousness and a spell of lucidity before the end  through that lugubrious hour i squatted there watching the awful process of human dissolution for the first time  save in the case of fifanti i had never yet seen death nor could it be said that i had really seen it then with the pedant death had been a sudden sharp severing of the thread of life and i had been conscious that he was dead without any appreciation of death itself blinded in part by my own exalted condition at the time  but in this death of fra sebastiano i was heated by no participation i was an unwilling and detached spectator brought there by force of circumstance and my mind received from the spectacle an impression not easily to be effaced an impression which may have been answerable in part for that which followed  towards dawn at last the sick mans babblingsand they were mostly as profane and lewd as his occasional bursts of songwere quieted the unseeing glitter of his eyes that had ever and anon been turned upon us was changed to a dull and heavy consciousness and he struggled to rise but his limbs refused their office  the priest leaned over him with a whispered word of comfort then turned and signed to me to leave the hut i rose and went towards the door but i had scarcely reached it when there was a hoarse cry behind me followed by a gasping sob from the priest i started round to see the hermit lying on his back his face rigid his mouth open and idiotic his eyes more leaden than they had been a moment since  what is it i cried despite myself  he has gone my son answered the old priest sorrowfully but he was contrite and he had lived a saint and drawing from his breast a little silver box he proceeded to perform the last rites upon the body from which the soul was already fled  i came slowly back and knelt beside him and long we remained there in silent prayer for the repose of that blessed spirit and whilst we prayed the wind rose outside and a storm grew in the bosom of the night that had been so fair and tranquil the lightning flashed and illumined the interior of that hut with a vividness as of broad daylight throwing into livid relief the arrowpierced st sebastian in the niche and the ghastly grinning skull upon the hermits pulpit  the thunder crashed and crackled and the echoes of its artillery went booming and rolling round the hills whilst the rain fell in a terrific lashing downpour some of it finding a weakness in the roof trickled and dripped and formed a puddle in the middle of the hut  for upwards of an hour the storm raged and all the while we remained upon our knees beside the dead anchorite then the thunder receded and gradually died away in the distance the rain ceased and the dawn crept pale as a moonstone adown the valley  we went out to breathe the freshened air just as the first touches of the sun quickened to an opal splendour the pallor of that daybreak all the earth was steaming and the bagnanza suddenly swollen went thundering down the gorge  at sunrise we dug a grave just below the platform with a spade which i found in the hut there we buried the hermit and over the spot i made a great cross with the largest stones that i could find the priest would have given him burial in the hut itself but i suggested that perhaps there might be some other who would be willing to take the hermits place and consecrate his life to carrying on the mans pious work of guarding that shrine and collecting alms for the poor and for the building of the bridge  my tone caused the priest to look at me with sharp kindly eyes  have you such thoughts for yourself perchance he asked me  unless you should adjudge me too unworthy for the office i answered humbly  but you are very young my son he said and laid a kindly hand upon my shoulder have you suffered then so sorely at the hands of the world that you should wish to renounce it and to take up this lonely life  i was intended for the priesthood father i replied i aspired to holy orders but through the sins of the flesh i have rendered myself unworthy here perhaps i can expiate and cleanse my heart of all the foulness it gathered in the world  he left me an hour or so later to make his way back to casi having heard enough of my past and having judged sufficiently of my attitude of mind to approve me in my determination to do penance and seek peace in that isolation before going he bade me seek him out at casi at any time should any doubts assail me or should i find that the burden i had taken up was too heavy for my shoulders  i watched him go down the winding mountain path watched the bent old figure in his long black gaberdine until a turn in the path and a clump of chestnuts hid him from my sight  then i first tasted the loneliness to which on that fair morning i had vowed myself the desolation of it touched me and awoke selfpity in my heart to extinguish utterly the faint flame of ecstasy that had warmed me when first i thought of taking the dead anchorites place  i was not yet twenty i was lord of great possessions and of life i had tasted no more than one poisonous reckless draught yet i was done with the worlddriven out of it by penitence it was just but it was bitter and then i felt again that touch of ecstasy to reflect that it was the bitterness of the resolve that made it worthy that through its very harshness was it that this path should lead to grace  later on i busied myself with an inspection of the hut and my first attentions were for the miraculous image i looked upon it with awe and i knelt to it in prayer for forgiveness for the unworthiness i brought to the service of the shrine  the image itself was very crude of workmanship and singularly ghastly it reminded me poignantly of the crucifix that had hung upon the whitewashed wall of my mothers private diningroom and had been so repellent to my young eyes  from two arrow wounds in the breast descended two brown streaks relics of the last miraculous manifestation the face of the young roman centurion who had suffered martyrdom for his conversion to christianity was smiling very sweetly and looking upwards and in that part of his work the sculptor had been very happy but the rest of the carving was gruesome and the anatomy was gross and bad the figure being so disproportionately broad as to convey the impression of a stunted dwarf  the big book standing upon the pulpit of plain deal proved as i had expected to be a missal and it became my custom to recite from it each morning thereafter the office for the day  in a rude cupboard i found a jar of baked earth that was half full of oil and another larger jar containing some cakes of maize bread and a handful of chestnuts there was also a brown bundle which resolved itself into a monkish habit within which was rolled a hairshirt  i took pleasure in this discovery and i set myself at once to strip off my secular garments and to don this coarse brown habit which by reason of my great height descended but midway down my calves for lack of sandals i went barefoot and having made a bundle of the clothes i had removed i thrust them into the cupboard in the place of those which i had taken thence  thus did i who had been vowed to the anchorite order of st augustine enter upon my life as an unordained anchorite i dragged out the wattles upon which my blessed predecessor had breathed his last and having swept the place clean with a bundle of hazelswitches which i cut for the purpose i went to gather fresh boughs and rushes by the swollen torrent and with these i made myself a bed  my existence became not only one of loneliness but of grim privation people rarely came my way save for a few faithful women from casi or fiori who solicited my prayers in return for the oil and maizecakes which they left me and sometimes whole days would pass without the sight of a single human being these maizecakes formed my chief nourishment together with a store or nuts from the hazel coppice that grew before my door and some chestnuts which i went further afield to gather in the woods occasionally as a gift there would be a jar of olives which was the greatest delicacy that i savoured in those days no fleshfood or fish did i ever taste so that i grew very lean and often suffered hunger  my days were spent partly in prayer and partly in meditation and i pondered much upon what i could remember of the confessions of st augustine deriving great consolation from the thought that if that great father of the church had been able to win to grace out of so much sin as had befouled his youth i had no reason to despair and as yet i had received no absolution for the mortal offences i had committed at piacenza i had confessed to fra gervasio and he had bidden me do penance first but the penance had never been imposed i was imposing it now all my life should i impose it thus  yet ere it was consummated i might come to die and the thought appalled me for i must not die in sin  so i resolved that when i should have spent a year in that fastness i would send word to the priest at casi by some of those who visited my hermitage and desire him to come to me that i might seek absolution at his hands     chapter vi hypnerotomachia   at first i seemed to make good progress in my quest after grace and a certain solatium of peace descended upon me beneficent as the dew of a summer night upon the parched and thirsty earth but anon this changed and i would catch the thoughts that should have been bent upon pious meditation glancing backward with regretful longings at that life out of which i had departed  i would start up in a pious rage and cast out such thoughts by more strenuous prayer and still more strenuous fasting but as my body grew accustomed to the discomforts to which it was subjected my mind assumed a rebellious freedom that clogged the work of purification upon which i strove to engage it my stomach out of its very emptiness conjured up evil visions to torment me in the night and with these i vainly wrestled until i remembered the measures which fra gervasio told me that he had taken in like case i had then the happy inspiration to have recourse to the hairshirt which hitherto i had dreaded  it would be towards the end of october as the days were growing colder that i first put on that armour against the shafts of satan it galled me horribly and fretted my tender flesh at almost every movement but so at least at the expense of the body i won back to some peace of mind and the flesh being quelled and subdued no longer interposed its evil humours to the purity i desired for my meditations  for upwards of a month then the mild torture of the goatshair cilice did the office i required of it but towards december my skin having grown tough and callous from the perpetual irritation and inured to the fretting of the sharp hair my mind once more began to wander mutinously to check it again i put off the cilice and with it all other undergarments retaining no more clothing than just the rough brown monkish habit thus i exposed myself to the rigours of the weather for it had grown very cold in those heights where i dwelt and the snows were creeping nearer adown the mountainside  i had seen the green of the valley turn to gold and then to flaming brown i had seen the fire perish out of those autumnal tints and with the falling of the leaves a slow grey bald decrepitude covering the world and to this had now succeeded chill wintry gales that howled and whistled through the logs of my wretched hut whilst the western wind coming down over the frozen zone above cut into me like a knifes edge  and famished as i was i felt this coldness the more and daily i grew leaner until there was little left of my erstwhile lusty vigour and i was reduced to a parcel of bones held together in a bag of skin so that it almost seemed that i must rattle as i walked  i suffered and yet i was glad to suffer and took a joy in my pain thanking god for the grace of permitting me to endure it since the greater the discomforts of my body the more numbed became the pain of my mind the more removed from me were the lures of longing with which satan still did battle for my soul in pain itself i seemed to find the nepenthes that others seek from pain in suffering was my lethean draught that brought the only oblivion that i craved  i think that in those months my reason wandered a little under all this strain and i think today that the long ecstasies into which i fell were largely the result of a feverishness that burned in me as a consequence of a chill that i had taken  i would spend long hours upon my knees in prayer and meditation and remembering how others in such case as mine had known the great boon and blessing of heavenly visions i prayed and hoped for some such sign of grace confident in its power to sustain me thereafter against all possible temptation  and then one night as the year was touching its end it seemed to me that my prayer was answered i do not think that my vision was a dream leastways i do not think that i was asleep when it visited me i was on my knees at the time beside my bed of wattles and it was very late at night suddenly the far end of my hut grew palely lucent as if a phosphorescent vapour were rising from the ground it waved and rolled as it ascended in billows of incandescence and then out of the heart of it there gradually grew a figure all in white over which there was a cloak of deepest blue all flecked with golden stars and in the folded hands a sheaf of silver lilies  i knew no fear my pulses throbbed and my heart beat ponderously but rapturously as i watched the vision growing more and more distinct until i could make out the pale face of ineffable sweetness and the veiled eyes  it was the blessed madonna as messer pordenone had painted her in the church of santa chiara at piacenza the dress the lilies the sweet pale visage all were known to me even the billowing cloud upon which one little naked foot was resting  i cried out in longing and in rapture and i held out my arms to that sweet vision but even as i did so its aspect gradually changed under the upper part of the blue mantle which formed a veil was spread a mass of ruddy gleaming hair the snowy pallor of the face was warmed to the tint of ivory and the lips deepened to scarlet and writhed in a voluptuous smile the dark eyes glowed languidly the lilies faded away and the pale hands were held out to me  giuliana i cried and my pure and piously joyous ecstasy was changed upon the instant to fierce carnal longings  giuliana i held out my arms and slowly she floated towards me over the rough earthen floor of my cell  a frenzy of craving seized me i was impatient to lock my arms once more about that fair sleek body i sought to rise to go to meet her slow approach to lessen by a second this agony of waiting but my limbs were powerless i was as if cast in lead whilst more and more slowly she approached me so languorously mocking  and then revulsion took me suddenly and without any cause or warning i put my hands to my face to shut out a vision whose true significance i realized as in a flash  retro me sathanas i thundered jesus maria  i rose at last numbed and stiff i looked again the vision had departed i was alone in my cell and the rain was falling steadily outside i groaned despairingly then i swayed reeled sideways and lost all consciousness  when i awoke it was broad day and the pale wintry sun shone silvery from a winter sky i was very weak and very cold and when i attempted to rise all things swam round me and the floor of my cell appeared to heave like the deck of a ship upon a rolling sea  for days thereafter i was as a man entranced alternately frozen with cold and burning with fever and but that a shepherd who had turned aside to ask the hermits blessing discovered me in that condition and remained out of his charity for some three days to tend me it is more than likely i should have died  he nourished me with the milk of goats a luxury upon which my strength grew swiftly and even after he had quitted my hut he still came daily for a week to visit me and daily he insisted that i should consume the milk he brought me overruling my protests that my need being overpast there was no longer the necessity to pamper me  thereafter i knew a season of peace  it was i then reasoned as if the devil having tried me with a masterstroke of temptation and having suffered defeat had abandoned the contest yet i was careful not to harbour that thought unduly nor glory in my power lest such presumption should lead to worse i thanked heaven for the strength it had lent me and implored a continuance of its protection for a vessel so weak  and now the hillside and valley began to put on the raiment of a new year february like a benignant nymph tripped down by meadow and stream and touched the slumbering earth with gentler breezes and soon where she had passed the crocus reared its yellow head anemones scarlet blue and purple tossed from her lap sang the glories of spring in their tender harmonies of hue coy violet and sweetsmelling nardosmia waved their incense on her altars and the hellebore sprouted by the streams  then as birch and beech and oak and chestnut put forth a garb of tender pallid green march advanced and easter came on apace  but the approach of easter filled me with a staggering dread it was in passion week that the miracle of the image that i guarded was wont to manifest itself what if through my unworthiness it should fail the fear appalled me and i redoubled my prayers there was need for spring which touched the earth so benignly had not passed me by and at moments certain longings for the world would stir in me again and again would come those agonizing thoughts of giuliana which i had conceived were for ever laid to rest so that i sought refuge once more in the hairshirt and when this had once more lost its efficacy i took long whiplike branches of tender eglantine to fashion a scourge with which i flagellated my naked body so that the thorns tore my flesh and set my rebellious blood to flow  one evening at last as i sat outside my hut gazing over the rolling emerald uplands i had my reward i almost fainted when first i realized it in the extremity of my joy and thankfulness very faintly just as i had heard it that night when first i came to the hermitage i heard now the mystic belllike music that had guided my footsteps thither never since that night had the sound of it reached me though often i had listened for it  it came now wafted down to me it seemed upon the evening breeze a sound of angelic chimes infinitely ravishing to my senses and stirring my heart to such an ecstasy of faith and happiness as i had never yet known since my coming thither  it was a signa sign of pardon a sign of grace it could be naught else i fell upon my knees and rendered my deep and joyous thanks  and in all the week that followed that unearthly silver music was with me infinitely soothing and solacing i could wander afield yet it never left me unless i chanced to go so near the tumbling waters of the bagnanza that their thunder drowned that other blessed sound i took courage and confidence passion week drew nigh but it no longer had any terrors for me i was adjudged worthy of the guardianship of the shrine yet i prayed and made st sebastian the special object of my devotions that he should not fail me  april came as i learnt of the stray visitors who of their charity brought me the alms of bread and the second day of it was the first of holy week     chapter vii intruders   it was on holy thursday that the image usually began to bleed and it would continue so to do until the dawn of easter sunday  each day now as the time drew nearer i watched the image closely and on the wednesday i watched it with a dread anxiety i could not repress for as yet there was no faintest sign the brown streaks that marked the course of the last bleeding continued dry all that night i prayed intently in a torture of doubt yet soothed a little by the gentle music that was never absent now  with the first glint of dawn i heard steps outside the hut but i did not stir by sunrise there was a murmur of voices like the muttering of a sea upon its shore i rose and peered more closely at the saint he was just wood inanimate and insensible and there was still no sign outside i knew a crowd of pilgrims was already gathered they were waiting poor souls but what was their waiting compared with mine  another hour i knelt there still beseeching heaven to take mercy upon me but heaven remained unresponsive and the wounds of the image continued dry  i rose at last in a sort of despair and going to the door of the hut i flung it wide  the platform was filled with a great crowd of peasantry and an overflow poured down the sides of it and surged up the hill on the right and the left at sight of me so gaunt and worn my eyes wild with despair and feverish from sleeplessness a tangled growth of beard upon my hollow cheeks they uttered as with one voice a great cry of awe the multitude swayed and rippled and then with a curious sound as that of a great wind all went down upon their knees before meall save the array of cripples huddled in the foreground brought thither poor wretches in the hope of a miraculous healing  as i was looking round upon that assembly my eyes were caught by a flash and glitter on the road above us leading to the cisa pass a little troop of menatarms was descending that way a score of them there would be and from their lanceheads fluttered scarlet bannerols bearing a white device which at that distance i could not make out  the troop had halted and one upon a great black horse a man whose armour shone like the sun itself was pointing down with his mailclad hand then they began to move again and the brightness of their armour the fluttering pennons on their lances stirred me strangely in that fleeting moment ere i turned again to the faithful who knelt there waiting for my words dolefully with hanging head and downcast eyes i made the dread announcement  my children there is yet no miracle  a deathly stillness followed the words then came an uproar a clamour a wailing one bold mountaineer thrust forward to the foremost ranks though without rising from his knees  father he cried how can that be the saint has never failed to bleed by dawn on holy thursday these five years past  alas i groaned i do not know i but tell you what is all night have i held vigil but all has been vain i will go pray again and do you too pray  i dared not tell them of my growing suspicion and fear that the fault was in myself that here was a sign of heavens displeasure at the impurity of the guardian of that holy place  but the music cried one of the cripples raucously i hear the blessed music  i halted and the crowd fell very still to listen we all heard it pealing softly soothingly as from the womb of the mountain and a great cry went up once more from that vast assembly a hopeful cry that where one miracle was happening another must happen that where the angelic choirs were singing all must be well  and then with a thunder of hooves and clank of metal the troop that i had seen came over the pasturelands heading straight for my hermitage having turned aside from the road at the foot of the hillock upon which my hut was perched they halted at a word from their leader  i stood at gaze and most of the people too craned their necks to see what unusual pilgrim was this who came to the shrine of st sebastian  the leader swung himself unaided from the saddle fullarmed as he was then going to a litter in the rear he assisted a woman to alight from it  all this i watched and i observed too that the device upon the bannerols was the head of a white horse by that device i knew them they were of the house of cavalcantia house that had as i had heard been in alliance and great friendship with my father but that their coming hither should have anything to do with me or with that friendship i was assured was impossible not a single soul could know of my whereabouts or the identity of the present hermit of monte orsaro  the pair advanced leaving the troop below to await their return and as they came i considered them as did too the multitude  the man was of middle height very broad and active with long arms to one of which the little lady clung for help up the steep path he had a proud stern aquiline face that was shaven so that the straight lines of his strong mouth and powerful length of jaw looked as if chiselled out of stone it was only at closer quarters that i observed how the general hardness of that countenance was softened by the kindliness of his deep brown eyes in age i judged him to be forty though in reality he was nearer fifty  the little lady at his side was the daintiest maid that i had ever seen the skin white as a waterlily was very gently flushed upon her cheeks the face was delicately oval the little mouth the tenderest in all the world the forehead low and broad and the slightly slanting eyeswhen she raised the lashes that hung over them like long shadowswere of the deep blue of sapphires her dark brown hair was coifed in a jewelled net of thread of gold and on her white neck a chain of emeralds sparkled sombrely her closefitting robe and her mantle were of the hue of bronze and the light shifted along the silken fabric as she moved so that it gleamed like metal about her waist there was a girdle of hammered gold and pearls were sewn upon the back of her brown velvet gloves  one glance of her deep blue eyes she gave me as she approached then she lowered them instantly and so weakso full of worldly vanities was i still that in that moment i took shame at the thought that she should see me thus in this rough hermits habit my face a tangle of unshorn beard my hair long and unkempt and the shame of it dyed my gaunt cheeks and then i turned pale again for it seemed to me that out of nowhere a voice had asked me  do you still marvel that the image will not bleed  so sharp and clear did those words arise from the lips of conscience that it seemed to me as if they had been uttered aloud and i looked almost in alarm to see if any other had overheard them  the cavalier was standing before me and his brows were knit a deep amazement in his eyes thus awhile in utter silence then quite suddenly his voice a ringing challenge  what is your name he said  my name quoth i astonished by such a question and remarking now the intentness and surprise of his own glance it is sebastian i answered and truthfully for that was the name of my adoption the name i had taken when i entered upon my hermitage  sebastian of what and where quoth he  he stood before me his back to the peasant crowd ignoring them as completely as if they had no existence supremely master of himself and meanwhile the little lady on his arm stole furtive upward glances at me  sebastian of nowhere i answered sebastian the hermit the guardian of this shrine if you are come to  what was your name in the world he interrupted impatiently and all the time his eyes were devouring my gaunt face  the name of a sinner answered i i have stripped it off and cast it from me  an expression of impatience rippled across the white face  but the name of your father he insisted  i have none answered i i have no kin or ties of any sort i am sebastian the hermit  his lips smacked testily were you baptized sebastian he inquired  no i answered him i took the name when i became the guardian of this shrine  and when was that  in september of last year when the holy man who was here before me died  i saw a sudden light leap to his eyes and a faint smile to his lips he leaned towards me heard you ever of the name of anguissola he inquired and watched me closely his face within a foot of mine  but i did not betray myself for the question no longer took me by surprise i was accounted to be very like my father and that a member of the house of cavalcanti with which giovanni danguissola had been so intimate should detect the likeness was not unnatural i was convinced moreover that he had been guided thither by merest curiosity at the sight of that crowd of pilgrims  sir i said i know not your intentions but in all humility let me say that i am not here to answer questions of worldly import the world has done with me and i with the world so that unless you are come hither out of piety for this shrine i beg that you will depart with god and molest me no further you come at a singularly inauspicious time when i need all my strength to forget the world and my sinful past that through me the will of heaven may be done here  i saw the maids tender eyes raised to my face with a look of great compassion and sweetness whilst i spoke i observed the pressure which she put on his arm whether he gave way to that or whether it was the sad firmness of my tone that prevailed upon him i cannot say but he nodded shortly  well well he said and with a final searching look he turned the little lady with him and went clanking off through the lane which the crowd opened out for him  that they resented his presence since it was not due to motives of piety they very plainly signified they feared that the intrusion at such a time of a personality so worldly must raise fresh difficulties against the performance of the expected miracle  nor were matters improved when at the crowds edge he halted and questioned one of them as to the meaning of this pilgrimage i did not hear the peasants answer but i saw the white haughty face suddenly thrown up and i caught his next question  when did it last bleed  again an inaudible reply and again his ringing voicethat would be before this young hermit came and today it will not bleed you say  he flashed me a last keen glance of his eyes which had grown narrow and seemed laden with mockery the little lady whispered something to him in answer to which he laughed contemptuously  fools mummery he snapped and drew her on she going it seemed to me reluctantly  but the crowd had heard him and the insult offered to the shrine a deepthroated bay rose up in menace and some leapt to their feet as if they would attack him  he checked and wheeled at the sound how now he cried his voice a trumpetcall his eyes flashing terribly upon them and as dogs crouch to heel at the angry bidding of their master the multitude grew silent and afraid under the eyes of that single steelclad man  he laughed a deepthroated laugh and strode down the hill with his little lady on his arm  but when he had mounted and was riding off the crowd recovering courage from his remoteness hurled its curses after him and shrilly branded him derider and blasphemer  he rode contemptuously amain however looking back but once and then to laugh at them  soon he had dipped out of sight and of his company nothing was visible but the fluttering red pennons with the device of the white horsehead gradually these also sank and vanished and once more i was alone with the crowd of pilgrims  enjoining prayer upon them again i turned and reentered the hut     chapter viii the vision   pray as we might night came and still the image gave no sign the crowd melted away with promises to return at dawnpromises that sounded almost like a menace in my ears  i was alone once more alone with my thoughts and these made sport of me it was not only upon the unresponsiveness of st sebastian that my mind now dwelt nor yet upon the horrid dread that this unresponsiveness might be a sign of heavens displeasure an indication that as a custodian of that shrine i was unacceptable through the mire of sin that still clung to me rather my thoughts went straying down the mountainside in the wake of that gallant company that sternfaced man and that gentleeyed little lady who had hung upon his arm before the eyes of my mind there flashed again the brilliance of their arms in my ears rang the thunder of their chargers hooves whilst the image of the girl in her shimmering bronzehued robe remained insistently  theirs the life that should have been mine she such a companion as should have shared my life and borne me children of my own and i would burn with shame again in memory as i had burnt in actual fact to think that she should have beheld me in so unkempt and bedraggled a condition  how must i compare in her eyes with the gay courtiers who would daily hover in her presence and hang upon her gentle speech what thought of me could i hope should ever abide with her as the image of her abode with me or if she thought of me at all she must think of me just as a poor hermit a man who had donned the anchorites sackcloth and turned his back upon a world that for him was empty  it is very easy for you worldly ones who read to conjecture what had befallen me i was enamoured in a meeting of eyes had the thing come to me and you will say that it is little marvel considering the seclusion of all my life and particularly that of the past few months that the first sweet maid i beheld should have wrought such havoc and conquered my heart by the mere flicker of her lashes  yet so much i cannot grant your shrewdness  that meeting was predestined it was written that she should come and tear the foolish bandage from my eyes allowing me to see for myself that as fra gervasio had opined my vocation was neither for hermitage nor cloister that what called me was the world and that in the world must i find salvation since i was needed for the worlds work  and none but she could have done that of this i am persuaded as you shall be when you have read on  the yearnings with which she filled my soul were very different from those inspired by the memory of giuliana that other sinful longing she entirely effaced at last thereby achieving something that had been impossible to prayers and fasting to scourge and cilice i longed for her almost beatifically as those whose natures are truly saintly long for the presence of the blessed ones of heaven by the sight of her i was purified and sanctified washed clean of all that murk of sinful desire in which i had lain despite myself for my desire of her was the blessed noble desire to serve to guard to cherish  pure was she as the pale narcissus by the streams and serving her what could i be but pure  and then quite suddenly upon the heels of such thoughts came the reaction horror and revulsion were upon me this was but a fresh snare of satans baiting to lure me to destruction where the memory of giuliana had failed to move me to aught but penance and increasing rigours the foul fiend sought to engage me with a seeming purity to my ultimate destruction thus had anthony the egyptian monk been tempted and under one guise or another it was ever the same circean lure  i would make an end i swore it in a mighty frenzy of repentance in a very lust to do battle with satan and with my own flesh and a phrenetic joy to engage in the awful combat  i stripped off my ragged habit and standing naked i took up my scourge of eglantine and beat myself until the blood flowed freely but that was not enough all naked as i was i went forth into the blue night and ran to a pool of the bagnanza going of intent through thickets of bramble and briarrose that gripped and tore my flesh and lacerated me so that at times i screamed aloud in pain to laugh ecstatically the next moment and joyfully taunt satan with his defeat  thus i tore on my very body ragged and bleeding from head to foot and thus i came to the pool in the torrents course into this i plunged and stood with the icy waters almost to my neck to purge the unholy fevers out of me the snows above were melting at the time and the pool was little more than liquid ice the chill of it struck through me to the very marrow and i felt my flesh creep and contract until it seemed like the rough hide of some fabled monster and my wounds stung as if fire were being poured into them  thus awhile then all feeling passed and a complete insensibility to the cold of the water or the fire of the wounds succeeded all was numbed and every nerve asleep at last i had conquered i laughed aloud and in a great voice of triumph i shouted so that the shout went echoing round the hills in the stillness of the night  satan thou art defeated  and upon that i crawled up the mossy bank the water gliding from my long limbs i attempted to stand but the earth rocked under my feet the blueness of the night deepened into black and consciousness was extinguished like a candle that is blown out                             she appeared above me in a great effulgence that emanated from herself as if she were grown luminous her robe was of cloth of silver and of a dazzling sheen and it hung closely to her lissom virginal form defining every line and curve of it and by the chaste beauty of her i was moved to purest ecstasy of awe and worship  the pale oval face was infinitely sweet the slanting eyes of heavenly blue were infinitely tender the brown hair was plaited into two long tresses that hung forward upon either breast and were entwined with threads of gold and shimmering jewels on the pale brow a brilliant glowed with pure white fires and her hands were held out to me in welcome  her lips parted to breathe my name  agostino danguissola there were whole tomes of tender meaning in those syllables so that hearing her utter them i seemed to learn all that was in her heart  and then her shining whiteness suggested to me the name that must be hers  bianca i cried and in my turn held out my arms and made as if to advance towards her but i was held back in icy clinging bonds whose relentlessness drew from me a groan of misery  agostino i am waiting for you at pagliano she said and it did not occur to me to wonder where might be this pagliano of which i could not remember ever to have heard come to me soon  i may not come i answered miserably i am an anchorite the guardian of a shrine and my life that has been full of sin must be given henceforth to expiation it is the will of heaven  she smiled all undismayed smiled confidently and tenderly  presumptuous she gently chid me what know you of the will of heaven the will of heaven is inscrutable if you have sinned in the world in the world must you atone by deeds that shall serve the worldgods world in your hermitage you are become barren soil that will yield naught to yourself or any come then from the wilderness come soon i am waiting  and on that the splendid vision faded and utter darkness once more encompassed me a darkness through which still boomed repeatedly the fading echo of the words  come soon i am waiting                                i lay upon my bed of wattles in the hut and through the little unglazed windows the sun was pouring but the dripping eaves told of rain that had lately ceased  over me was bending a kindly faced old man in whom i recognized the good priest of casi  i lay quite still for a long while just gazing up at him soon my memory got to work of its own accord and i bethought me of the pilgrims who must by now have come and who must be impatiently awaiting news  how came i to have slept so long vaguely i remembered my last nights penance and then came a black gulf in my memory a gap i could not bridge but uppermost leapt the anxieties concerning the image of st sebastian  i struggled up to discover that i was very weak so weak that i was glad to sink back again  does it bleed does it bleed yet i asked and my voice was so small and feeble that the sound of it startled me  the old priest shook his head and his eyes were very full of compassion  poor youth poor youth he sighed  without all was silent there was no such rustle of a multitude as i listened for and then i observed in my cell a little shepherdlad who had been wont to come that way for my blessing upon occasions he was half naked as lithe as a snake and almost as brown what did he there and then someone else stirredan elderly peasantwoman with a wrinkled kindly face and soft dark eyes whom i did not know at all  somehow as my mind grew clearer last night seemed ages remote i looked at the priest again  father i murmured what has happened  his answer amazed me he started violently looked more closely and suddenly cried out  he knows me he knows me deo gratias and he fell upon his knees  now here it seemed to me was a sort of madness why should i not know you quoth i  the old woman peered at me ay blessed be heaven he is awake at last and himself again she turned to the lad who was staring at me grinning go tell them beppo haste  tell them i cried the pilgrims ah no nonot unless the miracle has come to pass  there are no pilgrims here my son said the priest  not i cried and cold horror descended upon me but they should have come this is holy friday father  nay my son holy friday was a fortnight ago  i stared askance at him in utter silence then i smiled half tolerantly but father yesterday they were all here yesterday was  your yesterday my son is sped these fifteen days he answered all that long while since the night you wrestled with the devil you have lain exhausted by that awful combat lying there betwixt life and death all that time we have watched by you leocadia here and i and the lad beppo  now here was news that left me speechless for some little while my amazement and slow understanding were spurred on by a sight of my hands lying on the rude coverlet which had been flung over me emaciated they had been for some months now but at present they were as white as snow and almost as translucent in their extraordinary frailty i became increasingly conscious too of the great weakness of my body and the great lassitude that filled me  have i had the fever i asked him presently  ay my son and who would not blessed virgin who would not after what you underwent  and now he poured into my astonished ears the amazing story that had overrun the countryside it would seem that my cry in the night my exultant cry to satan that i had defeated him had been overheard by a goatherd who guarded his flock in the hills in the stillness he distinctly heard the words that i had uttered and he came trembling down drawn by a sort of pious curiosity to the spot whence it had seemed to him that the cry had proceeded  and there by a pool of the bagnanza he had found me lying prone my white body glistening like marble and almost as cold recognizing in me the anchorite of monte orsaro he had taken me up in his strong arms and had carried me back to my hut there he had set about reviving me by friction and by forcing between my teeth some of the grapespirit that he carried in a gourd  finding that i lived but that he could not arouse me and that my icy coldness was succeeded by the fire of fever he had covered me with my habit and his own cloak and had gone down to casi to fetch the priest and relate his story  this story was no less than that the hermit of monte orsaro had been fighting with the devil who had dragged him naked from his hut and had sought to hurl him into the torrent but that on the very edge of the river the anchorite had found strength by the grace of god to overthrow the tormentor and to render him powerless and in proof of it there was my body all covered with satans clawmarks by which i had been torn most cruelly  the priest had come at once bringing with him such restoratives as he needed and it is a thousand mercies that he did not bring a leech or else i might have been bled of the last drops remaining in my shrunken veins  and meanwhile the goatherds story had gone abroad by morning it was on the lips of all the countryside so that explanations were not lacking to account for st sebastians refusal to perform the usual miracle and no miracle was expectednor had the image yielded any  the priest was mistaken a miracle there had been but for what had chanced the multitude must have come again confidently expecting the bleeding of the image which had never failed in five years and had the image not bled it must have fared ill with the guardian of the shrine in punishment for his sacrilegious ministry which must be held responsible for the absence of the miracle they so eagerly awaited well might the crowd have torn me limb from limb  next the old man went on to tell me how three days ago there had come to the hermitage a little troop of menatarms led by a tall bearded man whose device was a sable band upon an argent field and accompanied by a friar of the order of st francis a tall gaunt fellow who had wept at sight of me  that would be fra gervasio i exclaimed how came he to discover me  yesfra gervasio is his name replied the priest  where is he now i asked  i think he is here  in that moment i caught the sound of approaching steps the door opened and before me stood the tall figure of my best friend his eyes all eagerness his pale face flushed with joyous excitement  i smiled my welcome  agostino agostino he cried and ran to kneel beside me and take my hand in his o blessed be god he murmured  in the doorway stood now another man who had followed himone whose face i had seen somewhere yet could not at first remember where he was very tall so that he was forced to stoop to avoid the lintel of the low dooras tall as gervasio or myselfand the tanned face was bearded by a heavy brown beard in which a few strands of grey were showing across his face there ran the hideous livid scar of a blow that must have crushed the bridge of his nose it began just under the left eye and crossed the face downwards until it was lost in the beard on the right side almost in line with the mouth yet notwithstanding that disfigurement he still possessed a certain beauty and the deepset clear greyblue eyes were the eyes of a brave and kindly man  he wore a leather jerkin and great thighboots of grey leather and from his girdle of hammered steel hung a dagger and the empty carriages of a sword his cropped black head was bare and in his hand he carried a cap of black velvet  we looked at each other awhile and his eyes were sad and wistful laden with pity as i thought for my condition then he moved forward with a creak of leather and jingle of spurs that made pleasant music  he set a hand upon the shoulder of the kneeling gervasio  he will live now gervasio he asked  o he will live answered the friar with an almost fierce satisfaction in his positive assurance he will live and in a week we can move him hence meanwhile he must be nourished he rose my good leocadia have you the broth come then let us build up this strength of his there is haste good soul great haste she bustled at his bidding and soon outside the door there was a crackling of twigs to announce the lighting of a fire and then gervasio made known to me the stranger  this is galeotto he said he was your fathers friend and would be yours  sir said i i could not desire otherwise with any who was my fathers friend you are not perchance the gran galeotto i inquired remembering the sable device on argent of which the priest had told me  i am that same he answered and i looked with interest upon one whose name had been ringing through italy these last few years and then i suddenly realized why his face was familiar to me this was the man who in a monkish robe had stared so insistently at me that day at mondolfo five years ago  he was a sort of outlaw a remnant of the days of chivalry and freelances whose sword was at the disposal of any purchaser he rode at the head of a last fragment of the famous company that giovanni de medici had raised and captained until his death the sable band which they adopted in mourning for that warrior earned for their founder the posthumous title of giovanni delle bande nere  he was called il gran galeotto as another was called il gran diavolo in play upon the name he bore and the life he followed he had been in bad odour with the pope for his sometime association with my father and he was not wellviewed in the pontifical domains until as i was soon to learn he had patched up a sort of peace with pier luigi farnese who thought that the day might come when he should need the support of galeottos freelances  i was he said your fathers closest friend i took this at perugia where he fell he added and pointed to his terrific scar then he laughed i wear it gladly in memory of him  he turned to gervasio smiling i hope that giovanni danguissolas son will hold me in some affection for his fathers sake when he shall come to know me better  sir i said from my heart i thank you for that pious kindly wish and i would that i might fully correspond to it but agostino danguissola who has been so near to death in the body is indeed dead to the world already here you see but a poor hermit named sebastian who is the guardian of this shrine  gervasio rose suddenly this shrine he began in a fierce voice his face inflamed as with sudden wrath and there he stopped short the priest was staring at him and through the open door came leocadia with a bowl of steaming broth well talk of this again he said and there was a sort of thunder rumbling in the promise     chapter ix the iconoclast   it was a week later before we returned to the subject  meanwhile the good priest of casi and leocadia had departed bearing with them a princely reward from the silent kindly eyed galeotto  to tend me there remained only the boy beppo and after my long six months of lenten fare there followed now a period of feasting that began to trouble me as my strength returned when finally on the seventh day i was able to stand and by leaning on gervasios arm to reach the door of the hut and to look out upon the sweet spring landscape and the green tents that galeottos followers had pitched for themselves in the dell below my platform i vowed that i would make an end of broths and capons breasts and trout and white bread and red wine and all such succulences  but when i spoke so to gervasio he grew very grave  there has been enough of this agostino said he you have gone near your death and had you died you had died a suicide and had been damneddeserving it for your folly if for naught else  i looked at him with surprise and reproach how fra gervasio i said  how he answered do you conceive that i am to be fooled by tales of fights with satan in the night and the marks of the fiends claws upon your body is this your sense of piety to add to the other foul impostures of this place by allowing such a story to run the breadth of the countryside  foul impostures i echoed aghast fra gervasio your words are sacrilege  sacrilege he cried and laughed bitterly sacrilege and what of that and he flung out a stern rigid accusing arm at the image of st sebastian in its niche  you think because it did not bleed i began  it did not bleed he cut in because you are not a knave that is the only reason this man who was here before you was an impious rogue he was no priest he was a follower of simon mage trafficking in holy things battening upon the superstition of poor humble folk a black villain who is deaddead and damned for he was not allowed time when the end took him to confess his ghastly sin of sacrilege and the money that he had extorted by his simonies  my god fra gervasio what do you say how dare you say so much  where is the money that he took to build his precious bridge he asked me sharply did you find any when you came hither no ill take oath that you did not a little longer and this brigand had grown rich and had vanished in the nightcarried off by the devil or borne away to realms of bliss by the angels the poor rustics would have said  amazed at his vehemence i sank to a treebole that stood near the door to do the office of a stool  but he gave alms i cried my senses all bewildered  dust in the eyes of fools no more than that that image his scorn became tremendousis an impious fraud agostino  could the monstrous thing that he suggested be possible could any man be so lost to all sense of god as to perpetrate such a deed as that without fear that the lightnings of heaven would blast him  i asked the question gervasio smiled  your notions of god are heathen notions he said more quietly you confound him with jupiter the thunderer but he does not use his lightnings as did the father of olympus and yetreflect consider the manner in which that brigand met his death  but but i stammered and then quite suddenly i stopped short and listened hark fra gervasio do you not hear it  hear it hear what  the musicthe angelic melodies and you can say that this place is a foul imposture this holy image an impious fraud and you a priest listen it is a sign to warn you against stubborn unbelief  he listened with frowning brows a moment then he smiled  angelic melodies he echoed with gentlest scorn by what snares does the devil delude men using even suggested holiness for his purpose that boythat is no more than the dripping of water into little wells of different depths producing different notes it is in there in some cave in the mountain where the bagnanza springs from the earth  i listened half disillusioned by his explanation yet fearing that my senses were too slavishly obeying his suggestion the proof of that the proof i cried  the proof is that you have never heard it after heavy rain or while the river was swollen  that answer shattered my last illusion i looked back upon the time i had spent there upon the despair that had beset me when the music ceased upon the joy that had been mine when again i heard it accepting it always as a sign of grace and it was as he said not my unworthiness but the rain had ever silenced it in memory i ran over the occasions and so clearly did i perceive the truth of this that i marvelled the coincidence should not earlier have discovered it to me  moreover now that my illusions concerning it were gone the sound was clearly no more than he had said i recognized its nature it might have intrigued a sane man for a day or a night but it could never longer have deceived any but one whose mind was become fevered with fanatic ecstasy  then i looked again at the image in the niche and the pendulum of my faith was suddenly checked in its counterswing about that image there could be no delusions the whole countryside had witnessed the miracle of the bleeding and it had wrought cures wondrous cures among the faithful they could not all have been deceived besides from the wounds in the breast there were still the brown signs of the last manifestation  but when i had given some utterance to these thoughts gervasio for only answer stooped and picked up a woodmans axe that stood against the wall with this he went straight towards the image  fra gervasio i cried leaping to my feet a premonition of what he was about turning me cold with horror stay i almost screamed  but too late my answer was a crashing blow the next instant as i sank back to my seat and covered my face the two halves of the image fell at my feet flung there by the friar  look he bade me in a roar  fearfully i looked i saw and yet i could not believe  he came quickly back and picked up the two halves the oracle of delphi was not more impudently worked he said observe this sponge these plates of metal that close down upon it and exert the pressure necessary to send the liquid with which it is laden oozing forth as he spoke he tore out the fiendish mechanism and see now how ingeniously it was made to workby pressure upon this arrow in the flank  there was a burst of laughter from the door i looked up startled to find galeotto standing at my elbow so engrossed had i been that i had never heard his soft approach over the turf  body of bacchus said he here is gervasio become an image breaker to some purpose what now of your miraculous saint agostino  my answer was first a groan over my shattered illusion and then a deepthroated curse at the folly that had made a mock of me  the friar set a hand upon my shoulder you see agostino that your excursions into holy things do not promise well away with you boy off with this hypocrite robe and get you out into the world to do useful work for god and man had your heart truly called you to the priesthood i had been the first to have guided your steps thither but your mind upon such matters has been warped and your views are all false you confound mysticism with true religion and mouldering in a hermitage with the service of god how can you serve god here is not the world gods world that you must shun it as if the devil had fashioned it go i sayand i say it with the authority of the orders that i beargo and serve man and thus shall you best serve god all else are but snares to such a nature as yours  i looked at him helplessly and from him to galeotto who stood there his black brows knit watching me with intentness as if great issues hung upon my answer and gervasios words touched in my mind some chord of memory they were words that i had heard beforeor something very like them something whose import was the same  then i groaned miserably and took my head in my hands whither am i to go i cried what place is there in all the world for me i am an outcast my very home is held against me whither then shall i go  if that is all that troubles you said galeotto his tone unctuously humorous why we will ride to pagliano  i leapt at the wordliterally leapt to my feet and stared at him with blazing eyes  why what ails him now quoth he  well might he ask that namepaglianohad stirred my memory so violently that of a sudden as in a flash i had seen again the strange vision that visited my delirium i had seen again the inviting eyes the beckoning hands and heard again the gentle voice saying come to pagliano come soon  and now i knew too where i had heard words urging my return to the world that were of the same import as those which gervasio used  what magic was there here what wizardry was at play i knewfor they had told methat it had been that cavalier who had visited me that man whose name was ettore de cavalcanti who had borne news to them of one who was strangely like what giovanni danguissola had been but pagliano had never yet been mentioned  where is pagliano i asked  in lombardyin the milanes replied galeotto  it is the home of cavalcanti  you are faint agostino cried gervasio with a sudden solicitude and put an arm about my shoulders as i staggered  no no said i it is nothing tell me and i paused almost afraid to put the question lest the answer should dash my sudden hope for it seemed to me that in this place of false miracles one true miracle at least had been wrought if it should be proved so indeed then would i accept it as a sign that my salvation lay indeed in the world if not  tell me i began again this cavalcanti has a daughter she was with him upon that day when he came here what is her name  galeotto looked at me out of narrowing eyes  why what has that to do with anything quoth gervasio  more than you think answer me then what is her name  her name is bianca said caleotto  something within me seemed to give way so that i fell to laughing foolishly as women laugh who are on the verge of tears by an effort i regained my selfcontrol  it is very well i said i will ride with you to pagliano  both stared at me in utter amazement at the suddenness of my consent following upon information that in their minds could have no possible bearing upon the matter at issue  is he quite sane do you think cried galeotto gruffly  i think he has just become so said fra gervasio after a pause  god give me patience then grumbled the soldier and left me puzzled by the words      book iv the world     chapter i pagliano   the lilac was in bloom when we came to the grey walls of pagliano in that may of 45 and its scent arousing the memory of my return to the world has ever since been to me symbolical of the world itself  mine was no halfhearted backwardglancing return having determined upon the step i took it resolutely and completely at a single stride since galeotto placed his resources at my disposal to be repaid him later when i should have entered upon the enjoyment of my heritage of mondolfo i did not scruple to draw upon them for my needs  i accepted the fine linen and noble raiment that he offered and i took pleasure in the brave appearance that i made in them my face shorn now of its beard and my hair trimmed to a proper length similarly i accepted weapons money and a horse and thus equipped looking for the first time in my life like a patrician of my own lofty station i rode forth from monte orsaro with galeotto and gervasio attended by the formers troop of twenty lances  and from the moment of our setting out there came upon me a curious peace a happiness and a great sense of expectancy no longer was i oppressed by the fear of proving unworthy of the life which i had chosenas had been the case when that life had been monastic  galeotto was in high spirits to see me so blithe and he surveyed with pride the figure that i made vowing that i should prove a worthy son of my father ere all was done  the first act of my new life was performed as we were passing through the village of pojetta  i called a halt before the doors of that mean hostelry over which hung what no doubt would still be the same withered bunch of rosemary that had been there in autumn when last i went that way  to the sloeeyed deepbosomed girl who lounged against the doorpost to see so fine a company ride by i gave an order to fetch the taverner he came with a slouch a bent back and humble timid eyesa very different attitude from that which he had last adopted towards me  where is my mule you rogue quoth i  he looked at me askance your mule magnificent said he  you have forgotten me i thinkforgotten the lad in rusty black who rode this way last autumn and whom you robbed  at the words be turned a sickly yellow and fell to trembling and babbling protestations and excuses  have done i broke in you would not buy the mule then you shall buy it now and pay for it with interest  what is this agostino quoth galeotto at my elbow an act of justice sir i answered shortly whereupon he questioned me no further but looked on with a grim smile then to the taverner your manners today are not quite the same as on the last occasion when we met i spare you the gallows that you may live to profit by the lesson of your present near escape and now rogue ten ducats for that mule and i held out my hand  ten ducats he cried and gathering courage perhaps since he was not to hang it is twice the value of the beast he protested  i know i said it will be five ducats for the mule and five for your life i am merciful to rate the latter as cheaply as it deserves come thief the ten ducats without more ado or ill burn your nest of infamy and hang you above the ruins  he cowered and shrivelled then he scuttled within doors to fetch the money whilst galeotto laughed deep in his throat  you are welladvised said i when the rogue returned and handed me the ducats i told you i should come back to present my reckoning be warned by this  as we rode on galeotto laughed again body of satan there is a thoroughness about you agustino as a hermit you did not spare yourself and now as a tyrant you do not seem likely to spare others  it is the anguissola way said gervasio quietly  you mistake said i i conceive myself in the world for some good purpose and the act you have witnessed is a part of it it was not a revengeful deed vengeance would have taken a harsher course it was justice and justice is righteous  particularly a justice that puts ten ducats in your pocket laughed galeotto  there again you mistake me said i my aim is that thieves be mulcted to the end that the poor shall profit and i drew rein again  a little crowd had gathered about us mostly of very ragged halfclad people for this village of pojetta was a very povertystricken place into that little crowd i flung the ten ducatswith the consequence that on the instant it became a seething howling snarling quarrelling mass in the twinkling of an eye a couple of heads were cracked and blood was flowing so that to quell the riot my charity had provoked i was forced to spur my horse forward and bid them with threats disperse  and i think now said galeotto when it was done that you are just as reckless in the manner of doing charity for the future agostino you would do well to appoint an almoner  i bit my lip in vexation but soon i smiled again were such little things to fret me did we not ride to pagliano and to bianca de cavalcanti at the very thought my pulses would quicken and a sweetness of anticipation would invade my soul to be clouded at moments by an indefinable dread  and thus we came to pagliano in that month of may when the lilac was in bloom as i have said and after fra gervasio had left us to return to his convent at piacenza  we were received in the courtyard of that mighty fortress by that sturdy hawkfaced man who had recognized me in the hermitage on monte orsaro but he was no longer in armour he wore a surcoat of yellow velvet and his eyes were very kindly and affectionate when they rested on galeotto and from galeotto passed on to take survey of me  so this is our hermit quoth he a note of some surprise in his crisp tones somewhat changed  by a change that goes deeper than his pretty doublet said galeotto  we dismounted and grooms in the cavalcanti livery of scarlet with the horsehead in white upon their breasts led away our horses the seneschal acted as quartermaster to our lances whilst cavalcanti himself led us up the great stone staircase with its carved balustrade of marble from which rose a file of pillars to support the groined ceiling this last was frescoed in dull red with the white horsehead at intervals on our right on every third step stood orangetrees in tubs all flowering and shedding the most fragrant perfume  thus we ascended to a spacious gallery and through a succession of magnificent rooms we came to the noble apartments that had been made ready for us  a couple of pages came to tend me bringing perfumed water and macerated herbs for my ablutions these performed they helped me into fresh garments that awaited meblack hose of finest silk and velvet trunks of the same sable hue and for my body a fine closefitting doublet of cloth of gold caught at the waist by a jewelled girdle from which hung a dagger that was the merest toy  when i was ready they went before me to lead the way to what they called the private diningroom where supper awaited us at the very mention of a private diningroom i had a vision of whitewashed walls and highset windows and a floor strewn with rushes instead we came into the most beautiful chamber that i had ever seen from floor to ceiling it was hung with arras of purple brocade alternating with cloth of gold thus on three sides on the fourth there was an opening for the embayed window which glowed like a gigantic sapphire in the deepening twilight  the floor was spread with a carpet of the ruddy purple of porphyry very soft and silent to the feet from the frescoed ceiling where a joyous phoebus drove a team of spirited white stallions hung a chain that was carved in the semblance of interlocked titans to support a great candelabrum each branch of which was in the image of a titan holding a stout candle of scented wax it was all in gilded bronze and the workmanshipas i was presently to learnof that great artist and rogue benvenuto cellini from this candelabrum there fell upon the board a soft golden radiance that struck bright gleams from crystals and plate of gold and silver  by a buffet laden with meats stood the master of the household in black velvet his chain of office richly carved his badge a horses head in silver and he was flanked on either hand by a nimblelooking page  of all this my first glance gathered but the most fleeting of impressions for my eyes were instantly arrested by her who stood between cavalcanti and galeotto awaiting my arrival and miracle of miracles she was arrayed exactly as i had seen her in my vision  her supple maiden body was sheathed in a gown of cloth of silver her brown hair was dressed into two plaits interlaced with gold threads and set with tiny gems and these plaits hung one on either breast upon the low white brow a single jewel gleameda brilliant of the very whitest fire  her long blue eyes were raised to look at me as i entered and their glance grew startled when it encountered mine the delicate colour faded gradually from her cheeks and her eyes fell at last as she moved forward to bid me welcome to pagliano in her own name  they must have perceived her emotion as they perceived mine but they gave no sign we got to the round tablemyself upon cavalcantis left galeotto in the place of honour and bianca facing her father so that i was on her right  the seneschal bestirred himself and the silken ministering pages fluttered round us my lord of pagliano was one who kept a table as luxurious as all else in his splendid palace first came a broth of veal in silver basins then a stew of cocks combs and capons breasts then the ham of a roasted boar the flesh very lusciously saturated with the flavour of rosemary and there was venison that was as soft as velvet and other things that i no longer call to mind and to drink there was a fragrant wellsunned wine of lombardy that had been cooled in snow  galeotto ate enormously cavalcanti daintily i but little and bianca nothing her presence had set up such emotions in me that i had no thought for food but i drank deeply and so came presently to a spurious ease which enabled me to take my share in the talk that was toward though when all is said it was but a slight share since cavalcanti and galeotto discoursed of matters wherein my knowledge was not sufficient to enable me to bear a conspicuous part  more than once i was on the point of addressing bianca herself but always courage failed me i had ever in mind the memory she must have of me as she had last seen me to increase the painful diffidence which her presence itself imposed upon me nor did i hear her voice more than once or twice when she demurely answered such questions as her father set her and though once or twice i found her stealing a look at me she would instantly avert her eyes when our glances crossed  thus was our first meeting and for a little time it was to be our last because i lacked the courage to seek her out she had her own apartments at pagliano with her own maids of honour like a princess and the castle garden was entirely her domain into which even her father seldom intruded he gave me the freedom of it but it was a freedom of which i never took advantage in the week that we abode there several times was i on the point of doing so but i was ever restrained by my unconquerable diffidence  and there was something else to impose restraint upon me hitherto the memory of giuliana had come to haunt me in my hermitage by arousing in me yearnings which i had to combat with fasting and prayer with scourge and dice now the memory of her haunted me again but in a vastly different way it haunted me with the reminder of all the sin in which through her i had steeped myself and just as the memory of that sin had made me in purer moments deem myself unworthy to be the guardian of the shrine on monte orsaro so now did it cause me to deem myself all unworthy to enter the garden that enshrined madonna bianca de cavalcanti  before the purity that shone from her i recoiled in an awe whose nature was as the feelings of a religion i felt that to seek her presence would be almost to defile her and so i abstained my mind very full of her the while for all that the time was beguiled for me in daily exercise with horse and arms under the guidance of galeotto  i was not so tutored merely for the sake of repairing a grave omission in my education it had a definite scope as galeotto frankly told me informing me that the time approached in which to avenge my father and strike a blow for my own rights  and then at the end of a week a man rode into the courtyard of pagliano one day and flung down from his horse shouting to be led to messer galeotto there was something about this couriers mien and person that awoke a poignant memory i was walking in the gallery when the clatter of his advent drew my attention and his voice sent a strange thrill through me  one glance i gave to make quite sure and then i leapt down the broad steps four at a time and a moment later to the amazement of all present i had caught the dusty rider in my arms and i was kissing the wrinkled scarred and leathery old cheeks  falcone i cried falcone do you not know me  he was startled by the violence of my passionate onslaught indeed he was almost borne to the ground by it for his old legs were stiff now from riding  and thenhow he stared what oaths he swore  madonnino he babbled madonnino and he shook himself free of my embrace and stood back that he might view me body of satan but you are finely grown and how like to what your father was when he was no older than are you and they have not made a shaveling of you after all now blessed be god for that then he stopped short and his eyes went past me and he seemed to hesitate  i turned and there leaning on the balustrade of the staircase looking on with smiling eyes stood galeotto with messer cavalcanti at his elbow  i heard galeottos words to the lord of pagliano his heart is soundwhich is a miracle that woman it seems could not quite dehumanize him and he came down heavily to ask falcone what news he bore  the old equerry drew a letter from under his leathern jacket  from ferrante quoth the lord of pagliano eagerly peering over galeottos shoulder  ay said galeotto and he broke the seal he stood to read with knitted brows it is well he said at last and passed the sheet to cavalcanti farnese is in piacenza already and the pope will sway the college to give his bastard the ducal crown it is time we stirred  he turned to falcone whilst cavalcanti read the letter take food and rest good gino for tomorrow you ride again with me and so shall you agostino  i ride again i echoed my heart sinking and some of my dismay showing upon my face whither  to right the wrongs of mondolfo he answered shortly and turned away     chapter ii the governor of milan   we rode again upon the morrow as he had said and with us went falcone and the same goodly company of twenty lances that had escorted me from monte orsaro but i took little thought for them or pride in such an escort now my heart was leaden i had not seen bianca again ere i departed and heaven knew when we should return to pagliano thus at least was i answered by galeotto when i made bold to ask the question  two days we rode going by easy stages and came at last upon that wondrously fair and imposing city of milan in the very heart of the vast plain of lombardy with the distant alps for background and northern rampart  our destination was the castle and in a splendid antechamber packed with rustling silken courtiers and clanking captains in steel a sprinkling of prelates and handsome insolenteyed women more than one of whom reminded me of giuliana and every one of whom i disparaged by comparing her with bianca galeotto and i stood waiting  to many there he seemed known and several came to greet him and some to whisper in his ear at last a pert boy in a satin suit that was striped in the imperial livery of black and yellow pushed his way through the throng  messer galeotto his shrill voice announced his excellency awaits you  galeotto took my arm and drew me forward with him thus we went through a lane that opened out before us in that courtly throng and came to a curtained door an usher raised the curtain for us at a sign from the page who opening announced us to the personage within  we stood in a small closet whose tall slender windows overlooked the courtyard and from the table on which there was a wealth of parchments rose a very courtly gentleman to receive us out of a gilded chair the arms of which were curiously carved into the shape of serpents heads  he was a wellnourished florid man of middle height with a resolute mouth high cheekbones and crafty prominent eyes that reminded me vaguely of the eyes of the taverner of pojetta he was splendidly dressed in a long gown of crimson damask edged with lynx fur and the fingers of his fat hands and one of his thumbs were burdened with jewels  this was ferrante gonzaga prince of molfetta duke of ariano the emperors lieutenant and governor of the state of milan  the smile with which he had been ready to greet galeotto froze slightly at sight of me but before he could voice the question obviously in his mind my companion had presented me  here my lord is one upon whom i trust that we may count when the time comes this is agostino danguissola of mondolfo and carmina  surprise overspread gonzagas face he seemed about to speak and checked and his eyes were very searchingly bent upon galeottos face which remained inscrutable as stone then the governor looked at me and from me back again at galeotto at last he smiled whilst i bowed before him but very vaguely conscious of what might impend  the time he said seems to be none too distant the duke of castrothis pier luigi farneseis so confident of ultimate success that already he has taken up his residence in piacenza and already i am informed is being spoken of as duke of parma and piacenza  he has cause said galeotto who is to withstand his election since the emperor like pilate has washed his hands of the affair  a smile overspread gonzagas crafty face do not assume too much concerning the emperors wishes in the matter his answer to the pope was that if parma and piacenza are imperial fiefsintegral parts of the state of milanit would ill become the emperor to alienate them from an empire which he holds merely in trust whereas if they can be shown rightly to belong to the holy see why then the matter concerns him not and the holy see may settle it  galeotto shrugged and his face grew dark it amounts to an assent he said  not so purred gonzaga seating himself once more it amounts to nothing it is a sibylline answer which nowise prejudices what he may do in future we still hope he added that the sacred college may refuse the investiture pier luigi farnese is not in good odour in the curia  the sacred college cannot withstand the popes desires he has bribed it with the undertaking to restore nepi and camerino to the states of the church in exchange for parma and piacenza which are to form a state for his son how long my lord do you think the college will resist him  the spanish cardinals all have the emperors desires at heart  the spanish cardinals may oppose the measure until they choke themselves with their vehemence was the ready answer there are enough of the popes creatures to carry the election and if there were not it would be his to create more until there should be sufficient for his purpose it is an old subterfuge  well then said gonzaga smiling since you are so assured it is for you and the nobles of piacenza to be up and doing the emperor depends upon you and you may depend upon him  galeotto looked at the governor out of his scarred face and his eyes were very grave  i had hoped otherwise he said that is why i have been slow to move that is why i have waited why i have even committed the treachery of permitting pier luigi to suppose me ready at need to engage in his service  ah there you play a dangerous game said gonzaga frankly  ill play a more dangerous still ere i have done he answered stoutly neither pope nor devil shall dismay me i have great wrongs to right as none knows better than your excellency and if my life should go in the course of it whyhe shrugged and sneeredit is all that is left me and life is a little thing when a man has lost all else  i know i know said the sly governor wagging his big head else i had not warned you for we need you messer galeotto  ay you need me youll make a tool of meyou and your emperor youll use me as a catspaw to pull down this inconvenient duke  gonzaga rose frowning you go a little far messer galeotto he said  i go no farther than you urge me answered the other  but patience patience the lieutenant soothed him growing sleek again in tone and manner consider now the position what the emperor has answered the pope is no more than the bare and precise truth it is not clear whether the states of parma and piacenza belong to the empire or the holy see but let the people rise and show themselves illgoverned let them revolt against farnese once he has been created their duke and when thus the state shall have been alienated from the holy see and then you may count upon the emperor to step in as your liberator and to buttress up your revolt  do you promise us so much asked galeotto  explicitly was the ready answer upon my most sacred honour send me word that you are in arms that the first blow has been struck and i shall be with you with all the force that i can raise in the emperors name  your excellency has warrant for this demanded galeotto  should i promise it else about it sir you may work with confidence  with confidence yes replied galeotto gloomily but with no great hope the pontifical government has ground the spirit out of half the nobles of the val di taro they have suffered so much and so repeatedlyin property in liberty in life itselfthat they are grown rabbithearted and would sooner cling to the little liberty that is still theirs than strike a blow to gain what belongs to them by every right oh i know them of old what man can do i shall do but he shrugged and shook his head sorrowfully  can you count on none asked gonzaga very serious stroking his smooth fat chin  i can count upon one answered galeotto the lord of pagliano he is ghibelline to the very marrow and he belongs to me at my bidding there is nothing he will not do there is an old debt between us and he is a noble soul who will not leave his debts unpaid upon him i can count and he is rich and powerful but then he is not really a piacentino himself he holds his fief direct from the emperor pagliano is part of the state of milan and cavalcanti is no subject of farnese his case therefore is exceptional and he has less than the usual cause for timidity but the others again he shrugged what man can do to stir them that will i do you shall hear from me soon again my lord  gonzaga looked at me did you not say that here was another  galeotto smiled sadly ayjust one arm and one sword that is all unless this emprise succeeds he is never like to rule in mondolfo he may be counted upon but he brings no lances with him  i see said gonzaga his lip between thumb and forefinger but his name  that and his wrongs shall be used depend upon it my lordthe wrongs which are his by inheritance  i said no word a certain resentment filled me to hear myself so disposed of without being consulted and yet it was tempered by a certain trust in galeotto a faith that he would lead me into nothing unworthy  gonzaga conducted us to the door of the closet i shall look to hear from you ser galeotto he said and if at first the nobles of the val di taro are not to be moved perhaps after they have had a taste of messer pier luigis ways they will gather courage out of despair i think we may be hopeful if patient meanwhile my master the emperor shall be informed  another moment and we were out of that florid crafty wellnourished presence the curtains had dropped behind us and we were thrusting our way through the press in the antechamber galeotto muttering to himself things which as we gained the open air i gathered to be curses directed against the emperor and his milanese lieutenant  in the inn of the sign of the sun by the gigantic duomo of viscontis building he opened the gates to his anger and let it freely forth  it is a world of cravens he said a world of slothful selfseeking supine cowards agostino in the emperor at least i conceived that we should have found a man who would not be averse to acting boldly where his interests must be served more i had not expected of him but that at least and even in that he fails me oh this charles v he cried this prince upon whose dominions the sun never sets fortune has bestowed upon him all the favours in her gift yet for himself he can do nothing  he is crafty cruel irresolute and mistrustful of all he is without greatness of any sort and he is all but emperor of the world others must do his work for him others must compass the conquests which he is to enjoy  ah well he ended with a sneer perhaps as the world views these things there is a certain greatness in thatthe greatness of the fox  naturally there was much in this upon which i needed explanation and i made bold to intrude upon his anger to crave it and it was then that i learnt the true position of affairs  between france and the empire the state of milan had been in contention until quite lately when henri ii had abandoned it to charles v and in the state of milan were the states of parma and piacenza which pope julius ii had wrested from it and incorporated in the domain of the church the act however was unlawful and although these states had ever since been under pontifical rule it was to milan that they belonged though milan never yet had had the power to enforce her rights she had that power at last now that the emperors rule there was a thing determined and it was in this moment that papal nepotism was to make a further alienation of them by constituting them into a duchy for the farnese bastard pier luigi who was already duke of castro  under papal rule the noblesmore particularly the ghibellinesand the lesser tyrants of the val di taro had suffered rudely plundered by pontifical brigandage enduring confiscations and extortions until they were reduced to a miserable condition it was against the beginnings of this that my father had raised his standard to be crushed thorough the supineness of his peers who would not support him to save themselves from being consumed in the capacious maw of rome  but what they had suffered hitherto would be as nothing to what they must suffer if the pope now had his way and if pier luigi farnese were to become their dukean independent prince he would break the nobles utterly to remain undisputed master of the territory that was a conclusion foregone and yet our princelings saw the evil approaching them and cowered irresolute to await and suffer it  they had depended perhaps upon the emperor who it was known did not favour the investiture nor would confirm it it was remembered that ottavio farnesepier luigis sonwas married to margaret of austria the emperors daughter and that if a farnese dominion there was to be in parma and piacenza the emperor would prefer that it should be that of his own soninlaw who would hold the duchy as a fief of the empire further was it known that ottavio was intriguing with pope and emperor to gain the investiture in his own fathers stead  the unnatural son i exclaimed upon learning that  galeotto looked at me and smiled darkly stroking his great beard  say rather the unnatural father he replied more honour to ottavio farnese in that he has chosen to forget that he is pier luigis son it is not a parentage in which any manbe he the most abandonedcould take pride  how so quoth i  you have indeed lived out of the world if you know nothing of pier luigi farnese i should have imagined that some echo of his turpitudes must have penetrated even to a hermitagethat they would be written upon the very face of nature which he outrages at every step of his infamous life he is a monster a sort of antichrist the most ruthless bloody vicious man that ever drew the breath of life indeed there are not wanting those who call him a warlock a dealer in black magic who has sold his soul to the devil though for that matter they say the same of the pope his father and i doubt not that his magic is just the magic of a wickedness that is scarcely human  there is a fellow named paolo giovio bishop of nocera a charlatan and a wretched dabbler in necromancy and something of an alchemist who has lately written the life of another popes soncesare borgia who lived nigh upon half a century ago and who did more than any man to consolidate the states of the church though his true aim like pier luigis was to found a state for himself i am given to think that for his model of a popes bastard this giovio has taken the wretched farnese rogue and attributed to the son of alexander vi the vices and infamies of this son of paul iii  even to attempt to draw a parallel is to insult the memory of the borgia for he at least was a great captain and a great ruler and he knew how to endear to himself the fold that he governed so that when i was a ladthirty years agothere were still those in the romagna who awaited the borgias return and prayed for it as earnestly as pray the faithful for the second coming of the messiah refusing to believe that he was dead but this pier luigi he thrust out a lip contemptuously he is no better than a thief a murderer a defiler a bestial lecherous dog  and with that he began to relate some of the deeds of this man and his life it seemed was written in blood and filtha tale of murders and rapes and worse and when as a climax he told me of the horrible inhuman outrage done to cosimo gheri the young bishop of fano i begged him to cease for my horror turned me almost physically sick1  1 the incident to which agostino here alludes is fully set forth by benedetto varchi at the end of book xvi of his storia fiorentina   that bishop was a holy man of very saintly life galeotto insisted and the deed permitted the german lutherans to say that here was a new form of martyrdom for saints invented by the popes son and his father pardoned him the deed and others as bad by a secret bull absolving him from all pains and penalties that he might have incurred through youthful frailty or human incontinence  it was the relation of those horrors i think which stirring my indignation spurred me even more than the thought of redressing the wrongs which the pontifical or farnesian government would permit my mother to do me  i held out my hand to galeotto to the utmost of my little might said i you may depend upon me in this good cause in which you have engaged  there speaks the son of the house of anguissola said he a light of affection in his steelcoloured eyes and there are your fathers wrongs to right as well as the wrongs of humanity remember by this pier luigi was he crushed whilst those who bore arms with him at perugia and were taken alive he paused and turned livid great beads of perspiration standing upon his brow i cannot he faltered i cannot even now after all these years bear to think upon those horrors perpetrated by that monster  i was strangely moved at the sight of emotion in one who seemed emotionless as iron  i left the hermitage said i in the hope that i might the better be able to serve god in the world i think you are showing me the way ser galeotto     chapter iii pier luigi farnese   we left milan that same day and there followed for some months a season of wandering through lombardy going from castle to castle from tyranny to tyranny just the three of usgaleotto and myself with falcone for our equerry and attendant  surely something of the fanatics temperament there must have been in me for now that i had embraced a cause i served it with all the fanaticism with which on monte orsaro i sought to be worthy of the course i had taken then  i was become as an apostle preaching a crusade or holy war against the devils lieutenant on earth messer pier luigi farnese sometime duke of castro now duke of parma and piacenzafor the investiture duly followed in the august of that year and soon his iron hand began to be felt throughout the state of which the pope had constituted him a prince  and to the zest that was begotten of pure righteousness galeotto cunningly added yet another and more worldly spur we were riding one day in late september of that year from cortemaggiore where we had spent a month in seeking to stir the pallavicini to some spirit of resistance and we were making our way towards romagnese the stronghold of that great lombard family of dal verme  as we were ambling by a forest path galeotto abruptly turned to me falcone at the time being some little way in advance of us and startled me by his words  cavalcantis daughter seemed to move you strangely agostino he said and watched me turn pale under his keen glance  in my confusionmore or less at randomwhat should cavalcantis daughter be to me i asked  why what you will i think he answered taking my question literally cavalcanti would consider the lord of mondolfo and carmina a suitable mate for his daughter however he might hesitate to marry her to the landless agostino danguissola he loved your father better than any man that ever lived and such an alliance was mutually desired  do you think i need this added spur quoth i  nay i know that you do not but it is well to know what reward may wait upon our labour it makes that labour lighter and increases courage  i hung my head without answering him and we rode silently amain  he had touched me where the flesh was raw and tender bianca de cavalcanti it was a name i uttered like a prayer like a holy invocation just so had i been in a measure content to carry that name and the memory of her sweet face to consider her as the possible lady of mondolfo when i should once more have come into my own was to consider things that filled me almost with despair  again i experienced such hesitations as had kept me from ever seeking her at pagliano though i had been given the freedom of her garden giuliana had left her brand upon me and though bianca had by now achieved for me what neither prayers nor fasting could accomplish and had exorcized the unholy visions of giuliana from my mind yet when i came to consider bianca as a possible companionas something more or something less than a saint enthroned in the heaven created by my worship of herthere rose between us ever that barrier of murder and adultery a barrier which not even in imagination did i dare to overstep  i strove to put such thoughts from my mind that i might leave it free to do the work to which i had now vowed myself  all through that winter we pursued our mission with the dal verme we had but indifferent success for they accounted themselves safe being like cavalcanti feudatories of the emperor himself and nowise included in the territories of parma and piacenza from romagnese we made our way to the stronghold of the anguissola of albarola my cousins who gave me a very friendly welcome and who though with us in spirit and particularly urged by their hatred of our guelphic cousin cosimo who was now pier luigis favourite yet hesitated as the others had done and we met with little better success with sforza of santafiora to whose castle we next repaired or yet with the landi the scotti or confalonieri everywhere the same spirit of awe was abroad and the same pusillanimity content to hug the little that remained rather than rear its head to demand that which by right belonged  so that when the spring came round again and our mission done our crusade preached to hearts that would not be inflamed we turned our steps once more towards pagliano we were utterly dispirited menalthough for myself my despondency was tempered a little by the thought that i was to see bianca once more  yet before i come to speak of her again let me have done with these historical matters in so far as they touched ourselves  we had left the nobles unresponsive as you have seen but soon the prognostications of the crafty gonzaga were realized soon farnese through his excessive tyranny stung them out of their apathy the first to feel his iron hand were the pallavicini whom he stripped of their lands of cortemaggiore taking as hostages girolamo pallavicinis wife and mother next he hurled his troops against the dal verme forcing romagnese to capitulate and then seeking similarly to reduce their other fief of bobbio thence upon his allconquering way he marched upon castel san giovanni whence he sought to oust the sforza and at the same time he committed the mistake of attempting to drive the gonzaga out of soragna  this last rashness brought down upon his head the direct personal resentment of ferrante gonzaga with the imperial troops at his heels the governor of milan not only intervened to save soragna for his family but forced pier luigi to disgorge bobbio and romagnese restoring them to the dal verme and compelled him to raise the siege of san giovanni upon which he was at the time engagedclaiming that both these noble houses were feudatories of the empire  intimidated by that rude lesson pier luigi was forced to draw in his steely claws to console himself he turned his attention to the val di taro and issued an edict commanding all nobles there to disarm disband their troops quit their fortresses and go to reside in the principal cities of their districts those who resisted or demurred he crushed at once with exile and confiscation and even those who meekly did his will he stripped of all privileges as feudal lords  even my mother we heard was forced to dismiss her trivial garrison having been ordered to close the citadel of mondolfo and take up her residence in our palace in the city itself but she went further than she was biddenshe took the veil in the convent of santa chiara and so retired from the world  the state began to ferment in secret at so much and such harsh tyranny farnese was acting in piacenza as tarquin of old had acted in his garden slicing the tallest poppies from their stems and soon to swell his treasury which not even his plunder brigandage and extortionate confiscations could fill sufficiently to satisfy his greed he set himself to look into the past lives of the nobles and to promulgate laws that were retroactive so that he was enabled to levy fresh fines and perpetrate fresh sequestrations in punishment of deeds that had been done long years ago  amongst these we heard that he had giovanni danguissola decapitated in effigy for his rebellion against the authority of the holy see and that my tyrannies of mondolfo and carmina were confiscated from me because of my offence in being giovanni danguissolas son and presently we heard that mondolfo had been conferred by farnese upon his good and loyal servant and captain the lord cosimo danguissola subject to a tax of a thousand ducats yearly  galeotto ground his teeth and swore horribly when the news was brought us from piacenza whilst i felt my heart sink and the last hope of biancathe hope secretly entertained almost against hope itselfwithering in my soul  but soon came consolation pier luigi had gone too far even rats when cornered will turn at bay and bare their teeth for combat so now the nobles of the valnure and the val di taro  the scotti the pallavicini the landi and the anguissola of albarola came one after the other in secret to pagliano to interview the gloomy galeotto and at one gathering that was secretly held in a chamber of the castle he lashed them with his furious scorn  you are come now he jeered at them now that you are maimed now that you have been bled of half your strength now that most of your teeth are drawn had you but had the spirit and good sense to rise six months ago when i summoned you so to do the struggle had been brief and the victory certain now the fight will be all fraught with risk dangerous to engage and uncertain of issue  but it was theythese men who themselves had been so pusillanimous at firstwho now urged him to take the lead swearing to follow him to the death to save for their children what little was still left them  in that spirit i will not lead you a step he answered them if we raise our standard we fight for all our ancient rights for all our privileges and for the restoration of all that has been confiscated in short for the expulsion of the farnese from these lands if that is your spirit then i will consider what is to be donefor believe me open warfare will no longer avail us here what we have to do must be done by guile you have waited too long to resolve yourselves and whilst you have grown weak farnese has been growing strong he has fawned upon and flattered the populace he has set the people against the nobles he has pretended that in crushing the nobles he was serving the people and theypoor foolshave so far believed him that they will run to his banner in any struggle that may ensue  he dismissed them at last with the promise that they should hear from him and on the morrow attended by falcone only he rode forth again from pagliano to seek out the dal verme and the sforza of santafiora and endeavour to engage their interest against the man who had outraged them  and that was early in august of the year 46  i remained at pagliano by galeottos request he would have no need of me upon his mission but he might desire me to seek out some of the others of the val di taro with such messages as he should send me  and in all this time i had seen but little of monna bianca we met under her fathers eye in that goldandpurple diningroom and there i would devoutly though surreptitiously feast my eyes upon the exquisite beauty of her but i seldom spoke to her and then it was upon the most trivial matters whilst although the summer was now full fragrantly unfolded yet i never dared to intrude into that garden of hers to which i had been bidden ever restrained by the overwhelming memory of the past  so poignant was this memory that at times i caught myself wondering whether after all i had not been mistaken in lending an ear so readily to the arguments of fra gervasio whether fra gervasio himself had not been mistaken in assuming that my place was in the world and whether i had not done best to have carried out my original intention of seeking refuge in some monastery in the lowly position of a lay brother  meanwhile the lord of pagliano used me in the most affectionate and fatherly manner but not even this sufficed to encourage me where his daughter was concerned and i seemed to observe also that bianca herself if she did not actually avoid my society was certainly at no pains to seek it  what the end would have been but for the terrible intervention there was in our affairs i have often surmised without result  it happened that one day about a week after galeotto had left us there rode up to the gates of pagliano a very magnificent company and there was great braying of horns stamping of horses and rattle of arms  my lord pier luigi farnese had been on a visit to his city of parma and on his return journey had thought well to turn aside into the lands of ultrapo and pay a visit to the lord of pagliano whom he did not love yet whom perhaps it may have been his intention to conciliate since hurt him he could not  sufficiently severe had been the lesson he had received for meddling with imperial fiefs and he must have been mad had he thought of provoking further the resentment of the emperor to farnese charles v was a sleeping dog it was as well to leave sleeping  he rode then upon his friendly visit into the castle of pagliano attended by a vast retinue of courtiers and ladies pages lackeys and a score of menatarms a messenger had ridden on in advance to warn cavalcanti of the honour that the duke proposed to do him and cavalcanti relishing the honour no whit yet submitting out of discreetness stood to receive his excellency at the foot of the marble staircase with bianca on one side and myself upon the other  under the archway they rode farnese at the head of the cavalcade he bestrode a splendid white palfrey whose mane and tail were hennadyed whose crimson velvet trappings trailed almost to the ground he was dressed in white velvet even to his thighboots which were laced with gold and armed with heavy gold spurs a scarlet plume was clasped by a great diamond in his velvet cap and on his right wrist was perched a hooded falcon  he was a tall and gracefully shaped man of something over forty years of age blackhaired and oliveskinned wearing a small pointed beard that added length to his face his nose was aquiline and he had fine eyes but under them there were heavy brown shadows and as he came nearer it was seen that his countenance was marred by an unpleasant eruption of sores  after him came his gentlemen a round dozen of them with half that number of splendid ladies all a very dazzling company behind these in blazing liveries there was a cloud of pages upon mules and lackeys leading sumpterbeasts and then to afford them an effective background a grey steel phalanx of menatarms  i describe his entrance as it appeared at a glance for i did not study it or absorb any of its details my horrified gaze was held by a figure that rode on his right hand a queenly woman with a beautiful pale countenance and a lazy insolent smile  it was giuliana  how she came there i did not at the moment trouble to reflect she was there that was the hideous fact that made me doubt the sight of my own eyes made me conceive almost that i was at my disordered visions again the fruit of too much brooding i felt as if all the blood were being exhausted from my heart as if my limbs would refuse their office and i leaned for support against the terminal of the balustrade by which i stood  she saw me and after the first slight start of astonishment her lazy smile grew broader and more insolent i was but indifferently conscious of the hustle about me of the fact that cavalcanti himself was holding the dukes stirrup whilst the latter got slowly to the ground and relinquished his falcon to a groom who wore a perch suspended from his neck bearing three other hooded birds similarly i was no more than conscious of being forced to face the duke by words that cavalcanti was uttering he was presenting me  this my lord is agostino danguissola  i saw as through a haze the swarthy pustuled visage frown down upon me i heard a voice which was at once harsh and effeminate and quite detestable saying in unfriendly tones  the son of giovanni danguissola of mondolfo eh  the same my lord said cavalcanti adding generouslygiovanni danguissola was my friend  it is a friendship that does you little credit sir was the harsh answer it is not well to befriend the enemies of god  was it possible that i had heard aright had this human foulness dared to speak of god  that is a matter upon which i will not dispute with a guest said cavalcanti with an urbanity of tone belied by the anger that flashed from his brown eyes  at the time i thought him greatly daring little dreaming that forewarned of the dukes coming his measures were taken and that one blast from the silver whistle that hung upon his breast would have produced a tide of menatarms that would have engulfed and overwhelmed messer pier luigi and his suite  farnese dismissed the matter with a casual laugh and then a lazy drawling voicea voice that once had been sweetest music to my ears but now was loathsome as the croaking of stygian frogsaddressed me  why here is a great change sir saint we had heard you had turned anchorite and behold you in cloth of gold shining as you would outdazzle phoebus  i stood palely before her striving to keep the loathing from my face and i was conscious that bianca had suddenly turned and was regarding us with eyes of grave concern  i like you better for the change pursued giuliana and i vow that you have grown at least another inch have you no word for me agostino  i was forced to answer her i trust that all is well with you madonna i said  her lazy smile grew broader displaying the dazzling whiteness of her strong teeth why all is very well with me said she and her sidelong glance at the duke half mocking half kindly with an odious kindliness seemed to give added explanations  that he should have dared bring here this woman whom no doubt he had wrested from his creature gambarahere into the shrine of my pure and saintly biancawas something for which i could have killed him then for which i hated him far more bitterly than for any of those dark turpitudes that i had heard associated with his odious name  and meanwhile there he stood that popes bastard leaning over my bianca speaking to her and in his eyes the glow of a dark and unholy fire what time they fed upon her beauty as the slug feeds upon the lily he seemed to have no thought for any other nor for the circumstance that he kept us all standing there  you must come to our court at piacenza madonna i heard him murmuring we knew not that so fair a flower was blossoming unseen in this garden of pagliano it is not well that such a jewel should be hidden in this grey casket you were made to queen it in a court madonna and at piacenza you shall be hailed and honoured as its queen and so he rambled on with his rough and trivial flattery his foully pimpled face within a foot of hers and she shrinking before him very white and mute and frightened her father looked on with darkling brows and giuliana began to gnaw her lip and look less lazy whilst in the courtly background there was a respectful murmuring babble supplying a sycophantic chorus to the dukes detestable adulation  it was cavalcanti at last who came to his daughters rescue by a peremptory offer to escort the duke and his retinue within     chapter iv madonna bianca   pier luigis original intent had been to spend no more than a night at pagliano but when the morrow came he showed no sign of departing nor upon the next day nor yet upon the next  a week passed and still he lingered seeming to settle more and more in the stronghold of the cavalcanti leaving the business of his duchy to his secretary filarete and to his council at the head of which as i learnt was my old friend annibale caro  and meanwhile cavalcanti using great discreetness suffered the dukes presence and gave him and his suite most noble entertainment  his position was perilous and precarious in the extreme and it needed all his strength of character to hold in curb the resentment that boiled within him to see himself thus preyed upon and that was not the worst the worst was pier luigis ceaseless attentions to bianca the attentions of the satyr for the nymph a matter in which i think cavalcanti suffered little less than did i  he hoped for the best content to wait until cause for action should be forced upon him and meanwhile that courtly throng took its ease at pagliano the garden that hitherto had been biancas own sacred domain the garden into which i had never yet dared set foot was overrun now by the dukes gay suitea cloud of poisonous butterflies there in the green shaded alleys they disported themselves in the lemongrove in the perfumed rosegarden by hedges of box and screens of purple clematis they fluttered  bianca sought to keep her chamber in those days and kept it for as long on each day as was possible to her but the duke hobbling on the terracefor as a consequence of his journey on horseback he had developed a slight lameness being all rotten with diseasewould grow irritable at her absence and insistent upon her presence hinting that her retreat was a discourtesy so that she was forced to come forth again and suffer his ponderous attentions and gross flatteries  and three days later there came another to pagliano bidden thither by the duke and this other was none else than my cousin cosimo who now called himself lord of mondolfo having been invested in that tyranny as i have said  on the morning after his arrival we met upon the terrace  my saintly cousin was his derisive greeting and yet another change in youout of sackcloth into velvet the calendar shall know you as st weathercock i thinkor perhaps st mountebank  what followed was equally bitter and sardonic on his part fiercely and openly hostile on mine at my hostility he had smiled cruelly  be content with what is my strolling saint he said in the tone of one who gives a warning unless you would be back in your hermitage or within the walls of some cloister or even worse already have you found it a troublesome matter to busy yourself with the affairs of the world you were destined for sanctity he came closer and grew very fierce do not put it upon me to make a saint of you by sending you to heaven  it might end in your own dispatch to hell said i shall we essay it  body of god he snarled laughter still lingering on his white face is this the mood of your holiness at present what a bloodthirsty brave are you become consider pray sir that if you trouble me i have no need to do my own office of hangman there is sufficient against you to make the tribunal of the ruota very busy there iscan you have forgotten itthat little affair at the house of messer fifanti  i dropped my glance browbeaten for an instant then i looked at him again and smiled  you are but a poor coward messer cosimo said i to use a shadow as a screen you know that nothing can be proved against me unless giuliana speaks and that she dare not for her own sake there are witnesses who will swear that gambara went to fifantis house that night there is not one to swear that gambara did not kill fifanti ere he came forth again and it is the popular belief for his traffic with giuliana is wellknown as it is wellknown that she fled with him after the murderwhich in itself is evidence of a sort your duke has too great a respect for the feelings of the populace i sneered to venture to outrage them in such a matter besides i ended it is impossible to incriminate me without incriminating giuliana and messer pier luigi seems i should say unwilling to relinquish the lady to the brutalities of a tribunal  you are greatly daring said he and he was pale now for in that last mention of giuliana it seemed that i had touched him where he was still sensitive  daring i rejoined it is more than i can say for you ser cosimo yours is the cowards fault of caution  i thought to spur him if this failed i was prepared to strike him for my temper was beyond control that he standing towards me as he did should dare to mock me was more than i could brook but at that moment there spoke a harsh voice just behind me  how sir what words are these  there very magnificent in his suit of ivory velvet stood the duke he was leaning heavily upon his cane and his face was more blotched than ever the sunken eyes more sunken  are you seeking to quarrel with the lord of mondolfo quoth he and i saw by his smile that he used my cousins title as a taunt  behind him was cavalcanti with bianca leaning upon his arm just as i had seen her that day when she came with him to monte orsaro save that now there was a look as of fear in the blue depths of her eyes a little on one side there was a group composed of three of the dukes gentlemen with giuliana and another of the ladies and giuliana was watching us with halfveiled eyes  my lord i answered very stiff and erect and giving him back look for look something perhaps of the loathing with which he inspired me imprinted on my face my lord you give yourself idle alarms ser cosimo is too cautious to embroil himself  he limped toward me leaning heavily upon his stick and it pleased me that of a good height though he was he was forced to look up into my face  there is too much bad anguissola blood in you he said be careful lest out of our solicitude for you we should find it well to let our leech attend you  i laughed looking into his blotched face considering his lame leg and all the evil humours in him  by my faith i think it is your excellency needs the attentions of a leech said i and flung all present into consternation by that answer  i saw his face turn livid and i saw the hand shake upon the golden head of his cane he was very sensitive upon the score of his foul infirmities his eyes grew baleful as he controlled himself then he smiled displaying a ruin of blackened teeth  you had best take care he said it were a pity to cripple such fine limbs as yours but there is a certain matter upon which the holy office might desire to set you some questions best be careful sir and avoid disagreements with my captains  he turned away he had had the last word and had left me cold with apprehension yet warmed by the consciousness that in the brief encounter it was he who had taken the deeper wound  he bowed before bianca oh pardon me he said i did not dream you stood so near else no such harsh sounds should have offended your fair ears as for messer danguissola he shrugged as who would say have pity on such a boor  but her answer crisp and sudden as come words that are spoken on impulse or inspiration dashed his confidence  nothing that he said offended me she told him boldly almost scornfully  he flashed me a glance that was full of venom and i saw cosimo smile whilst cavalcanti started slightly at such boldness from his meek child but the duke was sufficiently master of himself to bow again  then am i less aggrieved said he and changed the subject shall we to the bowling lawn and his invitation was direct to bianca whilst his eyes passed over her father without waiting for their answer his question indeed amounting to a command he turned sharply to my cousin your arm cosimo said he and leaning heavily upon his captain he went down the broad granite steps followed by the little knot of courtiers and lastly by bianca and her father  as for me i turned and went indoors and there was little of the saint left in me in that hour all was turmoil in my soul turmoil and hatred and anger anon to soothe me came the memory of those sweet words that bianca had spoken in my defence and those words emboldened me at last to seek her but as i had never yet dared in all the time that i had spent at pagliano  i found her that evening by chance in the gallery over the courtyard she was pacing slowly having fled thither to avoid that hateful throng of courtiers seeing me she smiled timidly and her smile gave me what little further encouragement i needed i approached and very earnestly rendered her my thanks for having championed my cause and supported me with the express sign of her approval  she lowered her eyes her bosom quickened slightly and the colour ebbed and flowed in her cheeks  you should not thank me said she what i did was done for justices sake  i have been presumptuous i answered humbly in conceiving that it might have been for the sake of me  but it was that also she answered quickly fearing perhaps that she had pained me it offended me that the duke should attempt to browbeat you i took pride in you to see you bear yourself so well and return thrust for thrust  i think your presence must have heartened me said i no pain could be so cruel as to seem base or craven in your eyes  again the telltale colour showed upon her lovely cheek she began to pace slowly down the gallery and i beside her presently she spoke again  and yet she said i would have you cautious do not wantonly affront the duke for he is very powerful  i have little left to lose said i  you have your life said she  a life which i have so much misused that it must ever cry out to me in reproach  she gave me a little fluttering timid glance and looked away again thus we came in silence to the gallerys end where a marble seat was placed with gay cushions of painted and gilded leather she sank to it with a little sigh and i leaned on the balustrade beside her and slightly over her and now i grew strangely bold  set me some penance i cried that shall make me worthy  again came that little fluttering frightened glance  a penance quoth she i do not understand  all my life i explained has been a vain striving after something that eluded me once i deemed myself devout and because i had sinned and rendered myself unworthy you found me a hermit on monte orsaro seeking by penance to restore myself to the estate from which i had succumbed that shrine was proved a blasphemy and so the penance i had done the signs i believed i had received were turned to mockery it was not there that i should save myself one night i was told so in a vision  she gave an audible gasp and looked at me so fearfully that i fell silent staring back at her  you knew i cried  long did her blue slanting eyes meet my glance without wavering as never yet they had met it she seemed to hesitate and at the same time openly to consider me  i know now she breathed  what do you know my voice was tense with excitement  what was your vision she rejoined  have i not told you there appeared to me one who called me back to the world who assured me that there i should best serve god who filled me with the conviction that she needed me she addressed me by name and spoke of a place of which i had never heard until that hour but which today i know  and you and you she asked what answer did you make  i called her by name although until that hour i did not know it  she bowed her head emotion set her all atremble  it is what i have so often wondered she confessed scarce above a whisper and it is trueas true as it is strange  true i echoed it was the only true miracle in that place of false ones and it was so clear a call of destiny that it decided me to return to the world which i had abandoned and yet i have since wondered why here there seems to be no place for me any more than there was yonder i am devout again with a worldly devotion now yet with a devotion that must be heaveninspired so pure and sweet it is it has shut out from me all the foulness of that past and yet i am unworthy and that is why i cry to you to set me some penance ere i can make my prayer  she could not understand me nor did she we were not as ordinary lovers we were not as man and maid who meeting and being drawn each to the other fence and trifle in a pretty game of dalliance until the maid opines that the appearances are safe and that her resistance having been of a seemly length she may now make the ardently desired surrender with all wars honours nothing of that was in our wooing a wooing which seemed to us now that we spoke of it to have been done when we had scarcely met done in the vision that i had of her and the vision that she had of me  with averted eyes she set me now a question  madonna giuliana used you with a certain freedom on her arrival and i have since heard your name coupled with her own by the dukes ladies but i have asked no questions of them i know how false can be the tongues of courtly folk i ask it now of you what is or was this madonna giuliana to you  she was i answered bitterly and god pity me that i must say it to youshe was to me what circe was to the followers of ulysses  she made a little moan and i saw her clasp her hands in her lap and the sound and sight filled me with sorrow and despair she must know better that the knowledge should stand between us as a barrier which both could see than that it should remain visible only to the eyes of my own soul to daunt me  o bianca forgive me i cried i did not know i did not know i was a poor fool reared in seclusion and ripened thus for the first temptation that should touch me that is what on monte orsaro i sought to expiate that i might be worthy of the shrine i guarded then that is what i would expiate now that i might be worthy of the shrine whose guardian i would become the shrine at which i worship now  i was bending very low above her little brown head in which the threads of the gold coifnet gleamed in the fading light  if i had but had my vision sooner i murmured how easy it would have been can you find mercy for me in your gentle heart can you forgive me bianca  o agostino she answered very sadly and the sound of my name from her lips coming so naturally and easily thrilled me like the sound of the mystic music of monte orsaro what shall i answer you i cannot now give me leisure to think my mind is all benumbed you have hurt me so  me miserable i cried  i had believed you one who erred through excess of holiness  whereas i am one who attempted holiness through excess of error  i had believed you so soo agostino it was a little wail of pain  set me a penance i implored her  what penance can i set you will any penance restore to me my shattered faith  i groaned miserably and covered my face with my hands it seemed that i was indeed come to the end of all my hopes that the world was become as much a mockery to me as had been the hermitage that the one was to end for me upon the discovery of a fraud as had the other endedwith the difference that in this case the fraud was in myself  it seemed indeed that our first communion must be our last ever since she had seen me step into that goldandpurple diningroom at pagliano the incarnation of her vision as she was the incarnation of mine bianca must have waited confidently for this hour knowing that it was foreordained to come bitterness and disillusion were all that it had brought her  and then ere more could be said a thin flutelike voice hissed down the vaulted gallery  madonna bianca to hide your beauty from our hungry eyes to quench the light by which we guide our footsteps to banish from us the happiness and joy of your presence unkind unkind  it was the duke in his white velvet suit he looked almost ghostly in the deepening twilight he hobbled towards us his stick tapping the blackandwhite squares of the marble floor he halted before her and she put aside her emotion donned a worldly mask and rose to meet him  then he looked at me and his brooding eyes seemed to scan my face  why it is ser agostino lord of nothing he sneered and down the gallery rang the laugh of my cousin cosimo and there came too a ripple of other voices  whether to save me from friction with those steely gentlemen who aimed at grinding me to powder whether from other motives bianca set her fingertips upon the dukes white sleeve and moved away with him  i leaned against the balustrade all numb watching them depart i saw cosimo come upon her other side and lean over her as he moved so slim and graceful beside her own slight graceful figure then i sank to the cushions of the seat she had vacated and stayed there with my misery until the night had closed about the place and the white marble pillars looked ghostly and unreal     chapter v the warning   i prayed that evening more fervently than i had prayed since quitting monte orsaro it was as if all the influences of my youth which lately had been shaken off in the stir of intrigue and of rides that had seemed the prelude to battle were closing round me again  even as a woman had lured me once from the ways to which i seemed predestined only to drive me back once more the more frenziedly so now it almost seemed as if again a woman should have lured me to the world but to drive me from it again and more resolutely than ever for i was anew upon the edge of a resolve to have done with all human interests and to seek the peace and seclusion of the cloister  and then i bethought me of gervasio i would go to him for guidance as i had done aforetime i would ride on the morrow to seek him out in the convent near piacenza to which he had withdrawn  i was disturbed at last by the coming of a page to my chamber with the announcement that my lord was already at supper  i had thoughts of excusing myself but in the end i went  the repast was spread as usual in the banquetinghall of the castle and about the splendid table was pier luigis company amounting to nigh upon a score in all the duke himself sat on monna biancas right whilst on her left was cosimo  heeding little whether i was observed or not i sank to a vacant place midway down the board between one of the dukes pretty young gentlemen and one of the ladies of that curious traina boldeyed roman woman whose name i remember was valeria cesarini but who matters nothing in these pages almost facing me sat giuliana but i was hardly conscious of her or conscious indeed of any save monna bianca  once or twice biancas glance met mine but it fell away again upon the instant she was very pale and there were wistful lines about her lips yet her mood was singular her eyes had an unnatural sparkle and ever and anon she would smile at what was said to her in halfwhispers now by the duke now by cosimo whilst once or twice she laughed outright gone was the usual chill reserve with which she hedged herself about to distance the hateful advances of pier luigi there were moments now when she seemed almost flattered by his vile ogling and adulatory speeches as if she had been one of those brazen ladies of his court  it wounded me sorely i could not understand it lacking the wit to see that this queer mood sprang from the blow i had dealt her and was the outward manifestation of her own pain at the shattering of the illusions she had harboured concerning myself  and so i sat there moodily gnawing my lip and scowling darkly upon pier luigi and upon my cousin who was as assiduous in his attentions as his master and who seemed to be receiving an even greater proportion of her favours one little thing there was to hearten me looking at the lord of pagliano who sat at the tables head i observed that his glance was dark as it kept watch upon his daughterthat chaste white lily that seemed of a sudden to have assumed such wanton airs  it was a matter that stirred me to battle and forgotten again were my resolves to seek gervasio forgotten all notion of abandoning the world for the second time here was work to be done bianca was to be guarded perhaps it was in this that she would come to have need of me  once cosimo caught my gloomy looks and he leaned over to speak to the duke who glanced my way with languid sneering eyes he had a score to settle with me for the discomfiture he had that morning suffered at my hands thanks to biancas collaboration he was a clumsy fool when all is said and confident now of her supportfrom the sudden and extreme friendliness of her moodhe ventured to let loose a shaft at me in a tone that all the table might overhear  that cousin of yours wears a very conventual hangdog look said he to cosimo and then to the lady on my rightforgive valeria he begged the scurvy chance that should have sat a shaveling next to you lastly he turned to me to complete this gross work of offensiveness  when do you look sir to enter the life monastic for which heaven has so clearly designed you  there were some sycophants who tittered at his stupid pleasantry then the table fell silent to hear what answer i should make and a frown sat like a thundercloud upon the brow of cavalcanti  i toyed with my goblet momentarily tempted to fling its contents in his pustuled face and risk the consequences but i bethought me of something else that would make a deadlier missile  alas i sighed i have abandoned the notionconstrained to it  he took my bait constrained quoth he now what fool did so constrain you  no fool but circumstance i answered it has occurred to me i explained and i boldly held his glance with my own that as a simple monk my life would be fraught with perils seeing that in these times even a bishop is not safe  saving bianca who in her sweet innocence did not so much as dream of the existence of such vileness as that to which i was referring and by which a saintly man had met his death i do not imagine that there was a single person present who did not understand to what foul crime i alluded  the silence that followed my words was as oppressive as the silence which in nature preludes thunder  a vivid flame of scarlet had overspread the dukes countenance it receded leaving his cheeks a greenish white even to the mottling pimples abashed his smouldering eyes fell away before my bold defiant glance the fingers of his trembling hand tightened about the slender stem of his venetian goblet so that it snapped and there was a gush of crimson wine upon the snowy napery his lips were drawn backlike a dogs in the act of snarlingand showed the black stumps of his broken teeth but he made no sound uttered no word it was cosimo who spoke half rising as he did so  this insolence my lord duke must be punished this insult wiped out suffer me  but pier luigi reached forward across bianca set a hand upon my cousins sleeve and pressed him back into his seat silencing him  let be he said and looked up the board at cavalcanti it is for my lord of pagliano to say if a guest shall be thus affronted at his board  cavalcantis face was set and rigid you place a heavy burden on my shoulders said he when your excellency my guest appeals to me against another guest of mineagainst one who is all but friendless and the son of my own best friend  and my worst enemy cried pier luigi hotly  that is your excellencys own concern not mine said cavalcanti coldly but since you appeal to me i will say that messer danguissolas words were illjudged in such a season yet in justice i must add that it is not the way of youth to weigh its words too carefully and you gave him provocation when a manbe he never so highpermits himself to taunt another he would do well to see that he is not himself vulnerable to taunts  farnese rose with a horrible oath and every one of his gentlemen with him  my lord he said this is to take sides against me to endorse the affront  then you mistake my intention rejoined cavalcanti with an icy dignity you appeal to me for judgment and between guests i must hold the scales deadlevel with no thought for the rank of either of your chivalry my lord duke you must perceive that i could not do else  it was the simplest way in which he could have told farnese that he cared nothing for the rank of either and of reminding his excellency that pagliano being an imperial fief was not a place where the duke of parma might ruffle it unchecked  messer pier luigi hesitated entirely out of countenance then his eyes turned to bianca and his expression softened  what says madonna bianca he inquired his manner reassuming some measure of its courtliness is her judgment as unmercifully level  she looked up startled and laughed a little excitedly touched by the tenseness of a situation which she did not understand  what say i quoth she why that here is a deal of pother about some foolish words  and there cried pier luigi spoke i think not only beauty but wisdomminervas utterances from the lips of diana  in glad relief the company echoed his forced laugh and all sat down again the incident at an end and my contempt of the duke increased to see him permit such a matter to be so lightly ended  but that night when i had retired to my chamber i was visited by cavalcanti he was very grave  agostino he said let me implore you to be circumspect to keep a curb upon your bitter tongue be patient boy as i amand i have more to endure  i marvel sir that you endure it answered i for my mood was petulant  you will marvel less when you are come to my yearsif indeed you come to them for if you pursue this course and strike back when such men as pier luigi tap you you will not be likely to see old age body of satan i would that galeotto were here if aught should happen to you he checked and set a hand upon my shoulder  for your fathers sake i love you agostino and i speak as one who loves you  i know i know i cried seizing his hand in a sudden penitence i am an ingrate and a fool and you upheld me nobly at table sir i swear that i will not submit you to so much concern again  he patted my shoulder in a very friendly fashion and his kindly eyes smiled upon me if you but promise thatfor your own sake agostinowe need say no more god send this papal byblow takes his departure soon for he is as unwelcome here as he is unbidden  the foul toad said i to see him daily hourly bending over monna bianca whispering and oglingugh  it offends you eh and for that i love you there be circumspect and patient and all will be well put your faith in galeotto and endure insults which you may depend upon him to avenge when the hour strikes  upon that he left me and he left me with a certain comfort and in the days that followed i acted upon his injunction though truth to tell there was little provocation to do otherwise the duke ignored me and all the gentlemen of his following did the like including cosimo and meanwhile they revelled at pagliano and made free with the hospitality to which they had not been bidden  thus sped another week in which i had not the courage again to approach bianca after what had passed between us at our single interview nor for that matter was i afforded the opportunity the duke and cosimo were ever at her side and yet it almost seemed as if the duke had given place to his captain for cosimos was the greater assiduity now  the days were spent at bowls or pallone within the castle or upon hawkingparties or huntingparties when presently the dukes health was sufficiently improved to enable him to sit his horse and at night there was feasting which cavalcanti must provide and on some evenings we danced though that was a diversion in which i took no part having neither the will nor the art  one night as i sat in the gallery above the great hall watching them footing it upon the mosaic floor below giulianas deep slow voice behind me stirred me out of my musings she had espied me up there and had come to join me although hitherto i had most sedulously avoided her neither addressing her nor giving her the opportunity to address me since the first brazen speech on her arrival  that whitefaced lily madonna bianca de cavalcanti seems to have caught the duke in her net of innocence said she  i started round as if i had been stung and at sight of my empurpling face she slowly smiled the same hateful smile that i had seen upon her face that day in the garden when gambara had bargained for her with fifanti  you are greatly daring said i  to take in vain the name of her white innocence she answered smiling superciliously and then she grew more serious look agostino we were friends once i would be your friend now  it is a friendship madonna best not given expression  ha we are very scrupulousare we notsince we have abandoned the ways of holiness and returned to this world of wickedness and raised our eyes to the pale purity of the daughter of cavalcanti she spoke sneeringly  what is that to you i asked  nothing she answered frankly but that another may have raised his eyes to her is something i am honest with you if this child is aught to you and you would not lose her you would do well to guard her more closely than you are wont a word in season that is all my message  stay i begged her now for already she was gliding away through the shadows of the gallery  she laughed over her shoulder at methe very incarnation of effrontery and insolence  have i moved you into sensibility quoth she will you condescend to questions with one whom you despiseas indeed she added with a stinging scorn you have every right to do  tell me more precisely what you mean i begged her for her words had moved me fearfully  gesu she exclaimed can i be more precise must i add counsels why then i counsel that a change of air might benefit madonna biancas health and that if my lord of pagliano is wise he will send her into retreat in some convent until the dukes visit here is at an end and i can promise you that in that case it will be the sooner ended now i think that even a saint should understand me  with that last gibe she moved resolutely on and left me  of the gibe i took little heed what imported was her warning and i did not doubt that she had good cause to warn me i remembered with a shudder her oldtime habit of listening at doors it was very probable that in like manner had she now gathered information that entitled her to give me such advice  it was incredible and yet i knew that it was true and i cursed my blindness and cavalcantis what precisely farneses designs might be i could not conceive it was hard to think that he should dare so much as giuliana more than hinted it may be that after all there was no more than just the danger of it and that her own base interests urged her to do what she could to avert it  in any case her advice was sound and perhaps as she said the removal of bianca quietly might be the means of helping pier luigis unwelcome visit to an end  indeed it was so it was bianca who held him at pagliano as the blindest idiot should have perceived  that very night i would seek out cavalcanti ere i retired to sleep     chapter vi the talons of the holy office   acting upon my resolve i went to wait for cavalcanti in the little anteroom that communicated with his bedroom my patience was tried for he was singularly late in coming fully an hour passed after all the sounds had died down in the castle and it was known that all had retired and still there was no sign of him  i asked one of the pages who lounged there waiting for their master did he think my lord would be in the library and the boy was conjecturing upon this unusual tardiness of cavalcantis in seeking his bed when the door opened and at last he appeared  when he found me awaiting him a certain eagerness seemed to light his face a seconds glance showed me that he was in the grip of some unusual agitation he was pale with a dull flush under the eyes and the hand with which he waved away the pages shook as did his voice when he bade them depart saying that he desired to be alone with me awhile  when the two slim lads had gone he let himself fall wearily into a tall carved chair that was placed near an ebony table with silver feet in the middle of the room  but instead of unburdening himself as i fully expected he looked at me and  what is it agostino he inquired  i have thought i answered after a moments hesitation of a means by which this unwelcome visit of farneses might be brought to an end  and with that i told him as delicately as was possible that i believed madonna bianca to be the lodestone that held him there and that were she removed from his detestable attentions pagliano would cease to amuse him and he would go his ways  there was no outburst such as i had almost looked for at the mere suggestion contained in my faltering words he looked at me gravely and sadly out of that stern face of his  i would you had given me this advice two weeks ago he said but who was to have guessed that this popes bastard would have so prolonged his visit for the rest however you are mistaken agostino it is not he who has dared to raise his eyes as you suppose to bianca were such the case i should have killed him with my hands were he twenty times the duke of parma no no my bianca is being honourably wooed by your cousin cosimo  i looked at him amazed it could not be i remembered giulianas words giuliana did not love me and were it as he supposed she would have seen no cause to intervene rather might she have taken a malicious pleasure in witnessing my own discomfiture in seeing the sweet maid to whom i had raised my eyes snatched away from me by my cousin who already usurped so much that was my own  o you must be mistaken i cried  mistaken he echoed he shook his head smiling bitterly there is no possibility of mistake i am just come from an interview with the duke and his fine captain together they sought me out to ask my daughters hand for cosimo danguissola  and you i cried for this thrust aside my every doubt  and i declined the honour he answered sternly rising in his agitation i declined it in such terms as to leave them no doubt upon the irrevocable quality of my determination and then this pestilential duke had the effrontery to employ smiling menaces to remind me that he had the power to compel folk to bend the knee to his will to remind me that behind him he had the might of the pontiff and even of the holy office and when i defied him with the answer that i was a feudatory of the emperor he suggested that the emperor himself must bow before the court of the inquisition  my god i cried in liveliest fear  an idle threat he answered contemptuously and set himself to stride the room his hands clasped behind his broad back  what have i to do with the holy office he snorted but they had worse indignities for me agostino they mocked me with a reminder that giovanni danguissola had been my firmest friend they told me they knew it to have been my intention that my daughter should become the lady of mondolfo and to cement the friendship by making one state of pagliano mondolfo and carmina and they added that by wedding her to cosimo danguissola was the way to execute that plan for cosimo lord of mondolfo already should receive carmina as a weddinggift from the duke  was such indeed your intention i asked scarce above a whisper overawed as men are when they perceive precisely what their folly and wickedness have cost them  he halted before me and set one hand of his upon my shoulder looking up into my face it has been my fondest dream agostino he said  i groaned it is a dream that never can be realized now said i miserably  never indeed if cosimo danguissola continues to be lord of mondolfo he answered his keen friendly eyes considering me  i reddened and paled under his glance  nor otherwise said i for monna bianca holds me in the contempt which i deserve better a thousand times that i should have remained out of this world to which you caused me to returnunless indeed my present torment is the expiation that is required of me unless indeed i was but brought back that i might pay with suffering for all the evil that i have wrought  he smiled a little is it so with you why then you afflict yourself too soon boy you are overhasty to judge i am her father and my little bianca is a book in which i have studied deeply i read her better than do you agostino but we will talk of this again  he turned away to resume his pacing in the very moment in which he had fired me with such exalted hopes meanwhile there is this farnese dog with his parcel of minions and harlots making a sty of my house he threatens to remain until i come to what he terms a reasonable minduntil i consent to do his will and allow my daughter to marry his henchman and he parted from me enjoining me to give the matter thought and impudently assuring me that in cosimo danguissolain that guelphic jackali had a husband worthy of bianca de cavalcanti  he spoke it between his teeth his eyes kindling angrily again  the remedy my lord is to send bianca hence i said let her seek shelter in a convent until messer pier luigi shall have taken his departure and if she is no longer here cosimo will have little inclination to linger  he flung back his head and there was defiance in every line of his clearcut face never he snapped the thing could have been done two weeks ago when they first came it would have seemed that the step was determined before his coming and that in my independence i would not alter my plans but to do it now were to show fear of him and that is not my way  go agostino let me have the night to think i know not how to act but we will talk again tomorrow  it was best so best leave it to the night to bring counsel for we were face to face with grave issues which might need determining sword in hand  that i slept little will be readily conceived i plagued my mind with this matter of cosimos suit thinking that i saw the ultimate intentto bring pagliano under the ducal sway by rendering master of it one who was devoted to farnese  and then too i would think of that other thing that cavalcanti had said that i had been hasty in my judgment of his daughters mind my hopes rose and tortured me with the suspense they held then came to me the awful thought that here there might be a measure of retribution and that it might be intended as my punishment that cosimo whom i had unconsciously bested in my sinful passion should best me now in this pure and holy love  i was astir betimes and out in the gardens before any hoping i think that bianca too might seek the early morning peace of that place and that so we might have speech  instead it was giuliana who came to me i had been pacing the terrace some ten minutes inhaling the matutinal fragrance drawing my hands through the cool dew that glistened upon the boxwood hedges when i saw her issue from the loggia that opened to the gardens  upon her coming i turned to go within and i would have passed her without a word but that she put forth a hand to detain me  i was seeking you agostino she said in greeting  having found me madonna you will give me leave to go said i  but she was resolutely barring my way a slow smile parted her scarlet lips and broke over that ivory countenance that once i had deemed so lovely and now i loathed  i mind me another occasion in a garden betimes one morning when you were in no such haste to shun me  i crimsoned under her insolent regard have you the courage to remember i exclaimed  half the art of life is to harbour happy memories said she  happy quoth i  do you deny that we were happy on that morningit would be just about this time of year two years ago and what a change in you since then heigho and yet men say that woman is inconstant  i did not know you then i answered harshly  and do you know me now has womanhood no mysteries for you since you gathered wisdom in the wilderness  i looked at her with detestation in my eyes the effrontery the ease and insolence of her bearing all confirmed my conviction of her utter shamelessness and heartlessness  the day after after your husband died i said i saw you in a dell near castel guelfo with my lord gambara in that hour i knew you  she bit her lip then smiled again what would you answered she through your folly and crime i was become an outcast i went in danger of my life you had basely deserted me my lord gambara more generous offered me shelter and protection i was not born for martyrdom and dungeons she added and sighed with smiling plaintiveness are you of all men the one to blame me  i have not the right i know i answered nor do i blame you more than i blame myself but since i blame myself most bitterlysince i despise and hate myself for what is past you may judge what my feelings are for you and judging them i think it were well you gave me leave to go  i came to speak of other than ourselves ser agostino she answered all unmoved still by my scorn or leastways showing nothing of what emotions might be hers it is of that simpering daughter of my lord of pagliano  there is nothing i could less desire to hear you talk upon said i  it is so very like a man to scorn the thing i could tell him after he has already heard it from me  the thing you told me was false said i it was begotten of fear to see your own base interests thwarted it is proven so by the circumstance that the duke has sought the hand of madonna bianca for cosimo danguissola  for cosimo she cried and i never saw her so serious and thoughtful for cosimo you are sure of this the urgency of her tone was such that it held me there and compelled my answer  i have it from my lord himself  she knit her brows her eyes upon the ground then slowly she raised them and looked at me again the same unusual seriousness and alertness in every line of her face  why by what dark ways does he burrow to his ends she mused  and then her eyes grew lively her expression cunning and vengeful i see it she exclaimed o it is as clear as crystal this is the roman manner of using complaisant husbands  madonna i rebuked her angrilyangry to think that anyone should conceive that bianca could be so abused  gesu she returned with a shrug the thing is plain enough if you will but look at it here his excellency dares nothing lest he should provoke the resentment of that uncompromising lord of pagliano but once she is safely awayas cosimos wife  stop i cried putting out a hand as if i would cover her mouth then collecting myself do you suggest that cosimo could lend himself to so infamous a compact  lend himself that pander you do not know your cousin if you have any interest in this madonna bianca you will get her hence without delay and see that pier luigi has no knowledge of the convent to which she is consigned he enjoys the privileges of a papal offspring and there is no sanctuary he will respect so let the thing be done speedily and in secret  i looked at her between doubt and horror  why should you mistrust me she asked answering my look i have been frank with you it is not you nor that whitefaced ninny i would serve you may both go hang for me though i loved you once agostino and the sudden tenderness of tone and smile were infinitely mocking no no beloved if i meddle in this at all it is because my own interests are in peril  i shuddered at the cold matteroffact tone in which she alluded to such interests as those which she could have in pier luigi  ay shrink and cringe sir saint she sneered having cast me off and taken up holiness you have the right of course and with that she moved past me and down the terracesteps without ever turning her head to look at me again and that was the last i ever saw of her as you shall find though little was it to have been supposed so then  i stood hesitating half minded to go after her and question her more closely as to what she knew and what she did no more than surmise but then i reflected that it mattered little what really mattered was that her good advice should be acted upon without delay  i went towards the house and in the loggia came face to face with cosimo  still pursuing the old love he greeted me smiling and jerking his head in the direction of giuliana we ever return to it in the end they say yet you had best have a care it is not well to cross my lord pier luigi in such matters he can be a very jealous tyrant  i wondered was there some double meaning in the words i made shift to pass on leaving his taunt unanswered when suddenly he stepped up to me and tapped my shoulder  one other thing sweet cousin you little deserve a warning at my hands yet you shall have it make haste to shake the dust of pagliano from your feet an evil is hanging over you here  i looked into his wickedly handsome face and smiled coldly  it is a warning which in my turn i will give to you you jackal said i and watched the expression of his countenance grow set and frozen the colour recede from it  what do you mean he growled touched to suspicion of my knowledge by the term i had employed what things has that trull dared to  i cut in i mean sir to warn you do not drive me to do more  we were quite alone behind us stretched the long empty room before us the empty gardens he was without weapons as was i but my manner was so fierce that he recoiled before me in positive fear of my hands i think  i swung on my heel and pursued my way  i went above to seek cavalcanti and found him newly risen wrapped in a gown of miniver he received me with the news that having given the matter thought he had determined to sacrifice his pride and remove bianca not later than the morrow as soon as he could arrange it and to arrange it he would ride forth at once  i offered to go with him and that offer he accepted whereafter i lounged in his antechamber waiting until he should be dressed and considering whether to impart to him the further information i had that morning gleaned in the end i decided not to do so unable to bring myself to tell him that so much turpitude might possibly be plotting against bianca it was a statement that soiled her so it seemed to me indeed i could scarcely bear to think of it  presently he came forth fulldressed booted and armed and we went along the corridor and out upon the gallery as side by side we were descending the steps we caught sight of a singular group in the courtyard  six mounted men in black were drawn up there and a little in the foreground a seventh in a corselet of blackened steel and with a steel cap upon his head stood by his horse in conversation with farnese in attendance upon the duke were cosimo and some three of his gentlemen  we halted upon the steps and i felt cavalcantis hand suddenly tighten upon my arm  what is it i asked innocently entirely unalarmed these are familiars of the holy office he answered me his tone very grave in that moment the duke turning espied us he came towards the staircase to meet us and his face too was very solemn  we went down i filled by a strange uneasiness which i am sure was entirely shared by cavalcanti  evil tidings my lord of pagliano said farnese the holy office has sent to arrest the person of agostino danguissola for whom it has been seeking for over a year  for me i cried stepping forward ahead of cavalcanti what has the holy office to do with me  the leading familiar advanced if you are agostino danguissola there is a charge of sacrilege against you for which you are required to answer before the courts of the holy office in rome  sacrilege i echoed entirely bewilderedfor my first thought had been that here might be something concerning the death of fifanti and that the dread tribunal of the inquisition dealing with the matter secretly there would be no disclosures to be feared by those who had evoked its power  the thought was after all a foolish one for the death of fifanti was a matter that concerned the ruota and the open courts and those as i well knew did not dare to move against me on messer gambaras account  of what sacrilege can i be guilty i asked  the tribunal will inform you replied the familiara tall sallow elderly man  the tribunal will need then to await some other opportunity said cavalcanti suddenly messer danguissola is my guest and my guests are not so rudely plucked forth from pagliano  the duke drew away and leaned upon the arm of cosimo watching behind me in the gallery i heard a rustle of feminine gowns but i did not turn to look my eyes were upon the stern sable figure of the familiar  you will not be so illadvised my lord he was saying as to compel us to use force  you will not i trust be so illadvised as to attempt it laughed cavalcanti tossing his great head i have five score menatarms within these walls messer blackclothes  the familiar bowed that being so the force for today is yours as you say but i would solemnly warn you not to employ it contumaciously against the officers of the holy office nor to hinder them in the duty which they are here to perform lest you render yourself the object of their just resentment  cavalcanti took a step forward his face purple with anger that this tipstaff ruffian should take such a tone with him but in that instant i seized his arm  it is a trap i muttered in his ear beware  i was no more than in time i had surprised upon farneses mottled face a sly smilethe smile of the cat which sees the mouse come venturing from its lair and i saw the smile perishto confirm my suspicionswhen at my whispered words cavalcanti checked in his rashness  still holding him by the arm i turned to the familiar  i shall surrender to you in a moment sir said i meanwhile and you gentlemengive us leave apart and i drew the bewildered cavalcanti aside and down the courtyard under the colonnade of the gallery  my lord be wise for biancas sake i implored him i am assured that here is nothing but a trap baited for you do not gorge their bait as your valour urges you defeat them my lord by circumspection do you not see that if you resist the holy office they can issue a ban against you and that against such a ban not even the emperor can defend you indeed if they told him that his feudatory the lord of pagliano had been guilty of contumaciously thwarting the ends of the holy inquisition that bigot charles v would be the first to deliver you over to the ghastly practices of that tribunal it should not need my lord that i should tell you this  my god he groaned in utter misery but you agostino  there is nothing against me i answered impatiently what sacrilege have i ever committed the thing is a trumpedup business conceived with a foul purpose by messer pier luigi there courage then and selfrestraint and thus we shall foil their aims come my lord i will ride to rome with them and do not doubt that i shall return very soon  he looked at me with eyes that were full of trouble indecision in every line of a face that was wont to look so resolute he knew himself between the sword and the wall  i would that galeotto were here cried that man usually so selfreliant what will he say to me when he comes you were a sacred charge boy  say to him that i will be returning shortlywhich must be true come then you may serve me this way the other way you will but have to endure ultimate arrest and so leave bianca at their mercy which is precisely what they seek  he braced himself at the thought of bianca we turned and in silence we paced back quite leisurely as if entirely at our ease for all that cavalcantis face had grown very haggard  i yield me sir i said to the familiar  a wise decision sneered the duke  i trust youll find it so my lord i answered sneering too  they led forward a horse for me and when i had embraced cavalcanti i mounted and my funereal escort closed about me we rode across the courtyard under the startled eyes of the folk of pagliano for the familiars of the holy office were dread and fearful objects even to the stoutesthearted man as we neared the gateway a shrill cry rang out on the morning air  agostino  fear and tenderness and pain were all blent in that cry  i swung round in the saddle to behold the white form of bianca standing in the gallery with parted lips and startled eyes that were gazing after me her arms outheld and then even as i looked she crumpled and sank with a little moan into the arms of the ladies who were with her  i looked at pier luigi and from the depths of my heart i cursed him and i prayed that the day might not be far distant when he should be made to pay for all the sins of his recreant life  and then as we rode out into the open country my thoughts were turned to tenderer matters and it came to me that when all was done that cry of biancas made it worth while to have been seized by the talons of the holy office     chapter vii the papal bull   and now that you may understand to the full the thing that happened it is necessary that i should relate it here in its proper sequence although that must entail my own withdrawal for a time from pages upon which too long i have intruded my own doings and thoughts and feelings  i set it down as it was told to me later by those who bore their share in it and particularly by falcone who as you shall learn came to be a witness of all and retailed to me the affair with the greatest detail of what this one said and how that one looked  i reached rome on the fourth day after my setting out with my grim escort and on that same day at much the same hour as that in which the door of my dungeon in sant angelo closed upon me galeotto rode into the courtyard of pagliano on his return from his treasonable journey  he was attended only by falcone and it so chanced that his arrival was witnessed by farnese who with various members of his suite was lounging in the gallery at the time  surprise was mutual at the encounter for galeotto had known nothing of the dukes sojourn at pagliano believing him to be still at parma whilst the duke as little suspected that of the five score menatarms garrisoned in pagliano three score lances were of galeottos free company  but at sight of this condottiero whose true aims he was far from suspecting and whose services he was eager to enlist the duke heaved himself up from his seat and went down the staircase shouting greetings to the soldier and playfully calling him galeotto in its double sense and craving to know where he had been hiding himself this while  the condottiero swung down from his saddle unaideda thing which he could do even when fullarmedand stood before farnese a grim duststained figure with a curious smile twisting his scarred face  why said he in answer i have been upon business that concerns your magnificence somewhat closely  and with falcone at his heels he advanced the horses relinquished to the grooms who had hastened forward  upon business that concerns me quoth the duke intrigued  why yes said galeotto who stood now face to face with farnese at the foot of the steps up which the dukes attendants were straggling i have been recruiting forces and since one of these days your magnificence is to give me occupation you will see that the matter concerns you  above leaned cavalcanti his face grey and haggard without the heart to relish the wicked humour of galeotto that could make jests for his own entertainment true there was also falcone to overhear appreciate and grin under cover of his great brown hand  does this mean that you are come to your senses on the score of a stipend ser galeotto quoth the duke  i am not a trader out of the giudecca to haggle over my wares replied the burly condottiero but i nothing doubt that your magnificence and i will come to an understanding at the last  five thousand ducats yearly is my offer said farnese provided that you bring three hundred lances  ah well said galeotto softly you may come to regret one of these days highness that you did not think well to pay me the price i ask  regret quoth the duke with a frown of displeasure at so much frankness  when you see me engaged in the service of some other galeotto explained you need a condottiero my lord and you may come to need one even more than you do now  i have the lord of mondolfo said the duke  galeotto stared at him with round eyes the lord of mondolfo quoth he intentionally uncomprehending  you have not heard why here he stands and he waved a jewelled hand towards cosimo a handsome figure in green and blue standing nearest to farnese  galeotto looked at this anguissola and his brow grew very black  so he said slowly you are the lord of mondolfo eh i think you are very brave  i trust my valour will not be lacking when the proof of it is needed answered cosimo haughtily feeling the others unfriendly mood and responding to it  it cannot said galeotto since you have the courage to assume that title for the lordship of mondolfo is an unlucky one to bear ser cosimo giovanni danguissola was unhappy in all things and his was a truly miserable end his father before him was poisoned by his best friend and as for the last who legitimately bore that titlewhy none can say that the poor lad was fortunate  the last who legitimately bore that title cried cosimo very ruffled i think sir it is your aim to affront me  and what is more continued the condottiero as if cosimo had not spoken not only are the lords of mondolfo unlucky in themselves but they are a source of ill luck to those they serve giovannis father had but taken service with cesare borgia when the latters ruin came at the hands of pope julius ii what giovannis own friendship cost his friends none knows better than your highness so that when all is said i think you had better look about you for another condottiero magnificent  the magnificent stood gnawing his beard and brooding darkly for he was a grossly superstitious fellow who studied omens and dabbled in horoscopes divinations and the like and he was struck by the thing that galeotto said he looked at cosimo darkly but cosimo laughed  who believes such old wives tales not i for one  the more fool you snapped the duke  indeed indeed galeotto applauded a disbelief in omens can but spring from an ignorance of such matters you should study them messer cosimo i have done so and i tell you that the lordship of mondolfo is unlucky to all darkcomplexioned men and when such a man has a mole under the left ear as you havein itself a sign of death by hangingit is well to avoid all risks  now that is very strange muttered the duke much struck by this whittling down of cosimos chances whilst cosimo shrugged impatiently and smiled contemptuously you seem to be greatly versed in these matters ser galeotto added farnese  he who would succeed in whatever he may undertake should qualify to read all signs said galeotto sententiously i have sought this knowledge  do you see aught in me that you can read inquired the duke in all seriousness  galeotto considered him a moment without any trace in his eyes of the wicked mockery that filled his soul why he answered slowly not in your own person magnificentleastways not upon so brief a glance but since you ask me i have lately been considering the new coinage of your highness  yes yes exclaimed the duke all eagerness whilst several of his followers came crowding nearerfor all the world is interested in omens what do you read there  your fate i think  my fate  have you a coin upon you  farnese produced a gold ducat firenew from the mint the condottiero took it and placed his finger upon the four letters p l a cthe abbreviation of placentia in the inscription  plac he spelled that contains your fate magnificent and you may read it for yourself and he returned the coin to the duke who stared at the letters foolishly and then at this reader of omens  but what is the meaning of plac he asked and he had paled a little with excitement  i have a feeling that it is a sign i cannot say more i can but point it out to you my lord and leave the deciphering of it to yourself who are more skilled than most men in such matters have i your excellencys leave to go doff this dusty garb he concluded  ay go sir answered the duke abstractedly puzzling now with knitted brows over the coin that bore his image  come falcone said galeotto and with his equerry at his heels he set his foot on the first step  cosimo leaned forward a sneer on his white hawkface i trust ser galeotto that you are a better condottiero than a charlatan  and you sir said galeotto smiling his sweetest in return are i trust a better charlatan than a condottiero  he went up the stairs the gaudy throng making way before him and he came at last to the top where stood the lord of pagliano awaiting him a great trouble in his eyes they clasped hands in silence and cavalcanti went in person to lead his guest to his apartments  you have not a happy air said galeotto as they went and body of god it is no matter for marvel considering the company you keep how long has the farnese beast been here  his visit is now in its third week said cavalcanti answering mechanically  galeotto swore in sheer surprise by the host and what keeps him  cavalcanti shrugged and let his arms fall to his sides to galeotto this proud stern baron seemed most oddly dispirited  i see that we must talk he said things are speeding well and swiftly now he added dropping his voice but more of that presently i have much to tell you  when they had reached the chamber that was galeottos and the doors were closed and falcone was unbuckling his masters spursnow for my news said the condottiero but first to spare me repetitions let us have agostino here where is he  the look on cavalcantis face caused galeotto to throw up his head like a spirited animal that scents danger  where is he he repeated and old falcones fingers fell idle upon the buckle on which they were engaged  cavalcantis answer was a groan he flung his long arms to the ceiling as if invoking heavens aid then he let them fall again heavily all strength gone out of them  galeotto stood an instant looking at him and turning very white suddenly he stepped forward leaving falcone upon his knees  what is this he said his voice a rumble of thunder where is the boy i say  the lord of pagliano could not meet the gaze of those steel coloured eyes  o god he groaned how shall i tell you  is he dead asked galeotto his voice hard  no nonot dead but but the plight of one usually so strong so full of mastery and arrogance was pitiful  but what demanded the condottiero gesu am i a woman or a man without sorrows that you need to stand hesitating whatever it may be speak then and tell me  he is in the clutches of the holy office answered cavalcanti miserably  galeotto looked at him his pallor increasing then he sat down suddenly and elbows on knees he took his head in his hands and spoke no word for a spell during which time falcone still kneeling looked from one to the other in an agony of apprehension and impatience to hear more  neither noticed the presence of the equerry nor would it have mattered if they had for he was trusty as steel and they had no secrets from him  at last having gained some measure of selfcontrol galeotto begged to know what had happened and cavalcanti related the event  what could i do what could i do he cried when he had finished  you let them take him said galeotto like a man who repeats the thing he has been told because he cannot credit it you let them take him  what alternative had i groaned cavalcanti his face ashen and seared with pain  there is that between us ettore that that will not let me credit this even though you tell it me  and now the wretched lord of pagliano began to use the very arguments that i had used to him he spoke of cosimos suit of his daughter and how the duke sought to constrain him to consent to the alliance he urged that in this matter of the holy office was a trap set for him to place him in farneses power  a trap roared the condottiero leaping up what trap where is this trap you had five score menatarms under your orders herethree score of them my own men each one of whom would have laid down his life for me and you allowed the boy to be taken hence by six rascals from the holy office intimidated by a paltry score of troopers that rode with this filthy duke  nay naynot that the other protested had i dared to raise a finger i should have brought myself within the reach of the inquisition without benefiting agostino that was the trap as agostino himself perceived it was he himself who urged me not to intervene but to let them take him hence since there was no possible charge which the holy office could prefer against him  no charge cried galeotto with a withering scorn did villainy ever want for invention and this trap body of god ettore am i to account you a fool after all these years what trap was there that could be sprung upon you as things stood why man the game was in your hands entirely here was this farnese in your power what better hostage than that could you have held you had but to whistle your wardogs to heel and seize his person demanding of the pope his father a plenary absolution and indemnity for yourself and for agostino from any prosecutions of the holy office ere you surrendered him and had they attempted to employ force against you you could have held them in check by threatening to hang the duke unless the parchments you demanded were signed and delivered to you my god ettore must i tell you this  cavalcanti sank to a seat and took his head in his hands  you are right he said i deserve all your reproaches i have been a fool worsei have wanted for courage and then suddenly he reared his head again and his glance kindled but it is not yet too late he cried and started up it is still time  time sneered galeotto why the boy is in their hands it is hostage for hostage now a very different matter he is lostirretrievably lost he ended groaning we can but avenge him to save him is beyond our power  no said cavalcanti it is not i am a dolt a dotard and i have been the cause of it then i shall pay the price  what price quoth the condottiero pondering the other with an eye that held no faintest gleam of hope  within an hour you shall have in your hands the necessary papers to set agostino at liberty and you shall carry them yourself to rome it is the amend i owe you it shall be made  but how is it possible  it is possible and it shall be done and when it is done you may count upon me to the last breath to help you to pull down this pestilential duke in ruin  he strode to the door his step firm once more and his face set though it was very grey i will leave you now but you may count upon the fulfilment of my promise  he went out leaving galeotto and falcone alone and the condottiero flung himself into a chair and sat there moodily deep in thought still in his dusty garments and with no thought for changing them falcone stood by the window looking out upon the gardens and not daring to intrude upon his masters mood  thus cavalcanti found them a hour later when he returned he brought a parchment to which was appended a great seal bearing the pontifical arms he thrust it into galeottos hand  there he said is the discharge of the debt which through my weakness and folly i have incurred  galeotto looked at the parchment then at cavalcanti and then at the parchment once more it was a papal bull of plenary pardon and indemnity to me  how came you by this he asked astonished  is not farnese the popes son quoth cavalcanti scornfully  but upon what terms was it conceded if it involves your honour your life or your liberty heres to make an end of it and he held it across in his hands as if to tear it looking up at the lord of pagliano  it involves none of these the latter answered steadily you had best set out at once the holy office can be swift to act     chapter viii the third degree   i was haled from my dungeon by my gaoler accompanied by two figures that looked immensely tall in their black monkish gowns their heads and faces covered by vizored cowls in which two holes were cut for their eyes seen by the ruddy glare of the torch which the gaoler carried to that subterranean place of darkness those black silent figures their very hands tucked away into the widemouthed sleeves of their habits looked spectral and luridhorrific messengers of death  by chill dark passages of stone through which our steps reverberated they brought me to a pillared vaulted underground chamber lighted by torches in iron brackets on the walls  on a dais stood an oaken writingtable bearing two massive wax tapers and a crucifix at this table sat a portly swarthyvisaged man in the black robes of the order of st dominic immediately below and flanking him on either hand sat two mute cowled figures to do the office of amanuenses  away on the right where the shadows were but faintly penetrated by the rays of the torches stood an engine of wood somewhat of the size and appearance of the framework of a couch but with stout straps of leather to pinion the patient and enormous wooden screws upon which the frame could be made to lengthen or contract from the ceiling grey ropes dangled from pulleys like the tentacles of some dread monster of cruelty  one glance into that gloomy part of the chamber was enough for me  repressing a shudder i faced the inquisitor and thereafter kept my eyes upon him to avoid the sight of those other horrors and he was horror enough for any man in my circumstances to envisage  he was very fat with a shaven swarthy face and the dewlap of an ox in that round fleshliness his eyes were sunken like two black buttons malicious through their very want of expression his mouth was looselipped and gluttonous and cruel  when he spoke the deep rumbling quality of his voice was increased by the echoes of that vaulted place  what is your name he said  i am agostino danguissola lord of mondolfo and  pass over your titles he boomed the holy office takes no account of worldly rank what is your age   i am in my twentyfirst year  benedicamus dominum he commented though i could not grasp the appositeness of the comment you stand accused agostino danguissola of sacrilege and of defiling holy things what have you to say do you confess your guilt  i am so far from confessing it i answered that i have yet to learn what is the nature of the sacrilege with which i am charged i am conscious of no such sin far from it indeed  you shall be informed he interrupted imposing silence upon me by a wave of his fat hand and heaving his vast bulk sidewaysread him the indictment he bade one of the amanuenses  from the depths of a vizored cowl came a thin shrill voice  the holy office has knowledge that agostino danguissola did for a space of some six months during the winter of the year of our blessed lord 1544 and the spring of the year of our blessed lord 1545 pursue a fraudulent and sacrilegious traffic adulterating for moneys which he extorted from the poor and the faithful things which are holy and adapting them to his own base purposes it is charged against him that in a hermitage on monte orsaro he did claim for an image of st sebastian that it was miraculous that it had power to heal suffering and that miraculously it bled from its wounds each year during passion week whence it resulted that pilgrimages were made to this false shrine and great store of alms was collected by the said agostino danguissola which moneys he appropriated to his own purposes it is further known that ultimately he fled the place fearing discovery and that after his flight the image was discovered broken and the cunning engine by which this diabolical sacrilege was perpetrated was revealed  throughout the reading the fleshy eyes of the inquisitor had been steadily inscrutably regarding me he passed a hand over his pendulous chin as the thin voice faded into silence  you have heard said he  i have heard a tangle of falsehood answered i never was truth more untruly told than this  the beady eyes vanished behind narrowing creases of fat and yet i knew that they were still regarding me presently they appeared again  do you deny that the image contained this hideous engine of fraud  i do not i answered  set it down he eagerly bade one of the amanuenses he confesses thus much and then to medo you deny that you occupied that hermitage during the season named  i do not  set it down he said again what then remains he asked me  it remains that i knew nothing of the fraud the trickster was a pretended monk who dwelt there before me and at whose death i was present i took his place thereafter implicitly believing in the miraculous image refusing when its fraud was ultimately suggested to me to credit that any man could have dared so vile and sacrilegious a thing in the end when it was broken and its fraud discovered i quitted that ghastly shrine of satans in horror and disgust  there was no emotion on the huge yellow face that is the obvious defence he said slowly but it does not explain the appropriation of the moneys  i appropriated none i cried angrily that is the foulest lie of all  do you deny that alms were made  certainly they were made though to what extent i am unaware a vessel of baked earth stood at the door to receive the offerings of the faithful it had been my predecessors practice to distribute a part of these alms among the poor a part it was said he kept to build a bridge over the bagnanza torrent which was greatly needed  well well quoth he and when you left you took with you the moneys that had been collected  i did not i answered i gave the matter no thought when i left i took nothing with menot so much as the habit i had worn in that hermitage  there was a pause then he spoke slowly such is not the evidence before the holy office  what evidence i cried breaking in upon his speech where is my accuser set me face to face with him  slowly he shook his huge head with its absurd fringe of greasy locks about the tonsured scalpthat symbol of the crown of thorns  you must surely know that such is not the way of the holy office in its wisdom this tribunal holds that to produce delators would be to subject them perhaps to molestation and thus dry up the springs of knowledge and information which it now enjoys so that your request is idle as idle as is the attempt at defence that you have made the falsehoods with which you have sought to clog the wheels of justice  falsehood sir monk quoth i so fiercely that one of my attendants set a restraining hand upon my arm  the beady eyes vanished and reappeared and they considered me impassively  your sin agostino danguissola said he in his booming level voice is the most hideous that the wickedness of man could conceive or diabolical greed put into execution it is the sin that more than any other closes the door to mercy it is the offence of simon mage and it is to be expiated only through the gates of death you shall return hence to your cell and when the door closes upon you it closes upon you for all time in life nor shall you ever see your fellowman again there hunger and thirst shall be your executioners slowly to deprive you of a life of which you have not known how to make better use without light or food or drink shall you remain there until you die this is the punishment for such sacrilege as yours  i could not believe it i stood before him what time he mouthed out those horrible and emotionless words he paused a moment and again came that broad gesture of his that stroked mouth and chin then he resumed  so much for your body there remains your soul in its infinite mercy the holy office desires that your expiation be fulfilled in this life and that you may be rescued from the fires of everlasting hell therefore it urges you to cleanse yourself by a full and contrite avowal ere you go hence confess then my son and save your soul  confess i echoed confess to a falsehood i have told you the truth of this matter i tell you that in all the world there is none less prone to sacrilege than i that i am by nature and rearing devout and faithful these are lies which have been uttered to my hurt in dooming me you doom an innocent man be it so i do not know that i have found the world so delectable a place as to quit it with any great regret my blood be upon your own heads and upon this iniquitous and monstrous tribunal but spare yourselves at least the greater offence of asking my confession of a falsehood  the little eyes had vanished the face grew very evil stirred at last into animosity by my denunciation of that court then the inscrutable mask slipped once more over that odious countenance  he took up a little mallet and struck a gong that stood beside him  i heard a creaking of hinges and saw an opening in the wall to my right where i had perceived no door two men came forthbrawny muscular bearded men in coarse black hose and leathern waistcoats cut deep at the neck and leaving their great arms entirely naked the foremost carried a thong of leather in his hands  the hoist said the inquisitor shortly  the men advanced towards me and came to replace the familiars between whom i had been standing each seized an arm and they held me so i made no resistance  will you confess the inquisitor demanded there is still time to save yourself from torture  but already the torture had commenced for the very threat of it is known as the first degree i was in despair death i could suffer but under torments i feared that my strength might fail i felt my flesh creeping and tightening upon my body which had grown very cold with the awful chill of fear my hair seemed to bristle and stiffen until i thought that i could feel each separate thread of it  i swear to you that i have spoken the truth i cried desperately i swear it by the sacred image of our redeemer standing there before you  shall we believe the oath of an unbeliever attainted of sacrilege he grumbled and he almost seemed to sneer  believe or not i answered but believe thisthat one day you shall stand face to face with a judge whom there is no deceiving to answer for the abomination that you make of justice in his holy name let loose against me your worst cruelties then they shall be as caresses to the torments that will be loosed against you when your turn for judgment comes  to the hoist with him he commanded stretching an arm towards the grey tentaclelike ropes we must soften his heart and break the diabolical pride that makes him persevere in blasphemy  they led me aside into that place of torments and one of them drew down the ropes from the pulley overhead until the ends fell on a level with my wrists and this was torture of the second degreeto see its imminence  will you confess boomed the inquisitors voice i made him no answer  strip and attach him he commanded  the executioners laid hold of me and in the twinkling of an eye i stood naked to the waist i caught my lips in my teeth as the ropes were being adjusted to my wrists and as thus i suffered torture of the third degree  will you confess came again the question  and scarcely had it been putfor the last time as i well knewthan the door was flung open and a young man in black sprang into the chamber and ran to thrust a parchment before the inquisitor  the inquisitor made a sign to the executioners to await his pleasure  i stood with throbbing pulses and waited instinctively warned that this concerned me the inquisitor took the parchment considered its seals and then the writing upon it  that done he set it down and turned to face us  release him he bade the executioners whereat i felt as i would faint in the intensity of this reaction  when they had done his bidding the dominican beckoned me forward i went still marvelling  see he said how inscrutable are the divine ways and how truth must in the end prevail your innocence is established after all since the holy father himself has seen cause to intervene to save you you are at liberty you are free to depart and to go wheresoever you will this bull concerns you and he held it out to me  my mind moved through these happenings as a man moves through a dense fog faltering and hesitating at every step i took the parchment and considered it satisfied as to its nature however mystified as to how the pope had come to intervene i folded the document and thrust it into my belt  then the familiars of the holy office assisted me to resume my garments and all was done now in utter silence and for my own part in the same mental and dreamlike confusion  at length the inquisitor waved a huge hand doorwards ite he said and added whilst his raised hand seemed to perform a benedictory gesturepax domini sit tecum  et cum spiritu tuo i replied mechanically as turning i stumbled out of that dread place in the wake of the messenger who had brought the bull and who went ahead to guide me     chapter ix the return   above in the blessed sunlight which hurt my eyesfor i had not seen it for a full weeki found galeotto awaiting me in a bare room and scarcely was i aware of his presence than his great arms went round me and enclasped me so fervently that his corselet almost hurt my breast and brought back as in a flash a poignant memory of another man fully as tall who had held me to him one night many years ago and whose armour too had hurt me in that embrace  then he held me at arms length and considered me and his steely eyes were blurred and moist he muttered something to the familiar linked his arm through mine and drew me away down passages through doors and so at last into the busy roman street  we went in silence by ways that were well known to him but in which i should assuredly have lost myself and so we came at last to a fair tavernthe osteria del solenear the tower of nona  his horse was stalled here and a servant led the way abovestairs to the room that he had hired  how wrong had i not been i reflected to announce before the inquisition that i should have no regrets in leaving this world how ungrateful was that speech considering this faithful one who loved me for my fathers sake and was there not bianca who surelyif her last cry wrung from her by anguish contained the truthmust love me for my own  how sweet the revulsion that now came upon me as i sank into a chair by the window and gave myself up to the enjoyment of that truly happy moment in which the grey shadow of death had been lifted from me  servants bustled in to spread the board with the choice meats that galeotto had ordered and great baskets of luscious fruits and flagons of red puglia wine and soon we seated ourselves to the feast  but ere i began to eat i asked galeotto how this miracle had been wrought what magic powers he wielded that even the holy office must open its doors at his bidding with a glance at the servants who attended us he bade me eat saying that we should talk anon and as my reaction had brought a sharp hunger in its train i fell to with the best will in all the world and from broth to figs there were few words between us  at last our goblets charged and the servants withdrawn i repeated my inquiry  the magic is not mine said galeotto it is cavalcantis it was he who obtained this bull  and with that he set himself briefly to relate the matters that already are contained here concerning that transaction but the minuter details of which i was later to extract from falcone and as he proceeded with his narrative i felt myself growing cold again with apprehension just as i had grown cold that morning in the hands of the executioners until at last seeing me deadwhite galeotto checked to inquire what ailed me  whatwhat was the price that cavalcanti paid for this i inquired in answer  i could not glean it nor did i stay to insist for there was haste he assured me that the thing had been accomplished without hurt to his honour life or liberty and with that i was content and spurred for rome  and you have never since thought what the price was that cavalcanti might have paid  he looked at me with troubled eyes i confess that in this matter the satisfaction of coming to your salvation has made me selfish i have had thoughts for nothing else  i groaned and flung out my arms across the table he has paid such a price i said that a thousand times sooner would i that you had left me where i was  he leaned forward frowning darkly what do you mean he cried  and then i told him what i feared told him how farnese had sued for biancas hand for cosimo how proudly and finally cavalcanti had refused how the duke had insisted that he would remain at pagliano until my lord changed his mind how i had learned from giuliana the horrible motive that urged the duke to press for that marriage  lastlyand that is the price he consented to pay i cried wildly his daughterthat sweet virginwas the price and at this hour maybe the price is paid and that detestable bargain consummated o galeotto galeotto why was i not left to rot in that dungeon of the inquisitionsince i could have died happily knowing naught of this  by the blood of god boy do you imply that i had knowledge do you suggest that i would have bought any life at such a price  no no i answered i know that you did notthat you could not and then i leaped to my feet and we sit talking here whilst this whilst this o god i sobbed we may yet be in time to horse then let us away  he too came to his feet ay you are right it but remains to remedy the evil come then anger shall mend my spent strength it can be done in three days we will ride as none ever rode yet since the world began  and we didso desperately that by the morning of the third day which was a sunday we were in forli having crossed the apennines at arcangelo and by that same evening in bologna we had not slept and we had scarcely rested since leaving rome we were almost dead from weariness  since such was my own case what must have been galeottos he was of iron it is true but consider that he had ridden this way at as desperate a pace already to save me from the clutches of the inquisition and that scarce rested he was riding north again consider this and you will not marvel that his weariness conquered him at last  at the inn at bologna where we dismounted we found old falcone awaiting us he had set out with his master to ride to rome but being himself saddleworn at the time he had been unable to proceed farther than this and here galeotto in his fierce impatience had left him pursuing his way alone  here then we found the equerry again consumed by anxiety he leapt forward to greet me addressing me by the old title of madonnino which i loved to hear from him however much that title might otherwise arouse harsh and gloomy memories  here at bologna galeotto announced that he would be forced to rest and we slept for three hoursuntil night had closed in we were shaken out of our slumbers by the host as he had been ordered but even then i lay entranced my limbs refusing their office until the memory of what was at issue acted like a spur upon me and caused me to fling my weariness aside as if it had been a cloak  galeotto however was in a deplorable case he could not move a limb he was exhaustedutterly and hopelessly exhausted with fatigue and want of sleep falcone and i pulled him to his feet between us but he collapsed again unable to stand  i am spent he muttered give me twelve hourstwelve hours sleep agostino and ill ride with you to the devil  i groaned and cursed in one twelve hours i cried and she i cant wait galeotto i must ride on alone  he lay on his back and stared up at me and his eyes had a glassy stare then he roused himself by an effort and raised himself upon his elbow  that is it boyride on alone take falcone listen there are three score men of mine at pagliano who will follow you to hell at a word that falcone shall speak to them from me about it then and save her but wait boy do no violence to farnese if you can help it  but if i cant i asked  if you cantno matter but endeavour not to offer him any hurt leave that to meanon when all is ripe for it today it would be premature and and we we should be crushed by the his speech trailed off into incoherent mutterings his eyelids dropped and he was fast asleep again  ten minutes later we were riding north again and all that night we rode along the endless aemilian way pausing for no more than a draught of wine from time to time and munching a loaf as we rode we crossed the po and kept steadily on taking fresh horses when we could until towards sunset a turn in the road brought pagliano into our viewgrey and lichened on the crest of its smooth emerald hill  the dusk was falling and lights began to gleam from some of the castle windows when we brought up in the shadow of the gateway  a manatarms lounged out of the guardhouse to inquire our business  is madonna bianca wed yet was the breathless greeting i gave him  he peered at me and then at falcone and he swore in some surprise  well returned my lord madonna bianca the nuptials were celebrated today the bride has gone  gone i roared gone whither man  why to piacenzato my lord cosimos palace there they set out some three hours since  where is your lord i asked him flinging myself from the saddle  within doors most noble  how i found him or by what ways i went to do so are things that are effaced completely from my memory but i know that i came upon him in the library he was sitting hunched in a great chair his face ashen his eyes fevered at sight of methe cause however innocent of all this evilhis brows grew dark and his eyes angry if he had reproaches for me i gave him no time to utter them but hurled him mine  what have you done sir i demanded by what right did you do this thing by what right did you make a sacrifice of that sweet dove did you conceive me so vile as to think that i should ever owe you gratitudethat i should ever do aught but abhor the deed abhor all who had a hand in it abhor the very life itself purchased for me at such a cost  he cowered before my furious wrath for i must have seemed terrific as i stood thundering there my face wild my eyes bloodshot half mad from pain and rage and sleeplessness  and do you know what you have done i went on do you know to what you have sold her must i tell you  and i told him in a dozen brutal words that brought him to his feet the lion in him roused at last his eyes ablaze  we must after them i urged we must wrest her from these beasts and make a widow of her for the purpose galeottos lances are below and they will follow me you may bring what more you please come sirto horse  he sprang forward with no answer beyond a muttered prayer that we might come in time  we must i answered fiercely and ran madly from the room along the gallery and down the stairs shouting and raging like a maniac cavalcanti following me  within ten minutes galeottos three score men and another score of those who garrisoned pagliano for cavalcanti were in the saddle and galloping hellforleather to piacenza ahead on fresh horses went falcone and i the lord of pagliano spurring beside me and pestering me with questions as to the source of my knowledge  our great fear was lest we should find the gates of piacenza closed on our arrival but we covered the ten miles in something under an hour and the head of our little column was already through the fodesta gate when the first hour of night rang out from the duomo giving the signal for the closing of the gates  the officer in charge turned out to view so numerous a company and challenged us to stand but i flung him the answer that we were the black bands of ser galeotto and that we rode by order of the duke with which perforce he had to be content for we did not stay for more and were too numerous to be detained by such meagre force as he commanded  up the dark street we sweptthe same street down which i had last ridden on that night when gambara had opened the gates of the prison for meand so we came to the square and to cosimos palace  all was in darkness and the great doors were closed a strange appearance this for a house to which a bride had so newly come  i dismounted as lightly as if i had not ridden lately more than just the ten miles from pagliano indeed i had become unconscious of all fatigue entirely oblivious of the fact that for three nights now i had not sleptsave for the three hours at bologna  i knocked briskly on the ironstudded gates we stood there waiting cavalcanti and falcone afoot with me the men on horseback still a silent phalanx  i issued an order to falcone ten of them to secure our egress the rest to remain here and allow none to leave the house  the equerry stepped back to convey the command in his turn to the men and the ten he summoned slipped instantly from their saddles and ranged themselves in the shadow of the wall  i knocked again more imperatively and at last the postern in the door was opened by an elderly servingman  whats this he asked and thrust a lanthorn into my face  we seek messer cosimo danguissola i answered he looked beyond me at the troop that lined the street and his face became troubled why what is amiss quoth he  fool i shall tell that to your master conduct me to him the matter presses  nay thenbut have you not heard my lord was wed today you would not have my lord disturbed at such a time he seemed to leer  i put my foot into his stomach and bore him backward flinging him full length upon the ground he went over and rolled away into a corner where he lay bellowing  silence him i bade the men who followed us in then half of you remain here to guard the stairs the rest attend us  the house was vast and it remained silent so that it did not seem that the clowns scream when he went over had been heard by any  up the broad staircase we sped guided by the light of the lanthorn which falcone had picked upfor the place was ominously in darkness cavalcanti kept pace with me panting with rage and anxiety  at the head of the stairs we came upon a man whom i recognized for one of the dukes gentlemeninwaiting he had been attracted no doubt by the sound of our approach but at sight of us he turned to escape cavalcanti reached forward in time to take him by the ankle so that he came down heavily upon his face  in an instant i was sitting upon him my dagger at his throat  a sound said i and you shall finish it in hell eyes bulging with fear stared at me out of his white face he was an effeminate cur of the sort that the duke was wont to keep about him and at once i saw that we should have no trouble with him  where is cosimo i asked him shortly come man conduct us to the room that holds him if you would buy your dirty life  he is not here wailed the fellow  you lie you hound said cavalcanti and turning to mefinish him agostino he bade me  the man under me writhed filled now by the terror that cavalcanti had so cunningly known how to inspire in him i swear to god that he is not here he answered and but that fear had robbed him of his voice he would have screamed it gesu i swear itit is true  i looked up at cavalcanti baffled and sick with sudden dismay i saw cavalcantis eye which had grown dull kindle anew he stooped over the prostrate man  is the bride hereis my daughter in this house  the fellow whimpered and did not answer until my daggers edge was at his throat again then he suddenly screechedyes  in an instant i had dragged him to his feet again his pretty clothes and daintily curled hair all crumpled so that he looked the most pitiful thing in all the world  lead us to her chamber i bade him  and he obeyed as men obey when the fear of death is upon them     chapter x the nuptials of bianca   an awful thought was in my mind as we went evoked by the presence in such a place of one of the dukes gentlemen an awful question rose again and again to my lips and yet i could not bring myself to utter it  so we went on in utter silence now my hand upon his shoulder clutching velvet doublet and flesh and bone beneath it my dagger bare in my other hand  we crossed an antechamber whose heavy carpet muffled our footsteps and we halted before tapestry curtains that masked a door here curbing my fierce impatience i paused i signed to the five attendant soldiers to come no farther then i consigned the courtier who had guided us to the care of falcone and i restrained cavalcanti who was shaking from head to foot  i raised the heavy muffling curtain and standing there an instant by the door i heard my biancas voice and her words seemed to freeze the very marrow in my bones  o my lord she was imploring in a choking voice o my lord have pity on me  sweet came the answer it is i who beseech pity at your hands do you not see how i suffer do you not see how fiercely love of you is torturing mehow i burnthat you can so cruelly deny me  it was farneses voice cosimo that dastard had indeed carried out the horrible compact of which giuliana had warned me carried it out in a more horrible and inhuman manner than even she had suggested or suspected  cavalcanti would have hurled himself against the door but that i set a hand upon his arm to restrain him and a finger of my other handthe one that held the daggerto my lips  softly i tried the latch i was amazed to find the door yield and yet where was the need to lock it what interruption could he have feared in a house that evidently had been delivered over to him by the bridegroom a house that was in the hands of his own people  very quietly i thrust the door open and we stood there upon the thresholdcavalcanti and ifather and lover of that sweet maid who was the prey of this foul duke we stood whilst a man might count a dozen silent witnesses of that loathsome scene  the bridal chamber was all hung in golden arras save the great carved bed which was draped in deadwhite velvet and ivory damasksymbolizing the purity of the sweet victim to be offered up upon that sacrificial altar  and to that dread sacrifice she had comefor my sake as i was to learnwith the fearful willingness of iphigenia for that sacrifice she had been prepared but not for this horror that was thrust upon her now  she crouched upon a tallbacked prayingstool her gown not more white than her face her little hands convulsively clasped to make her prayer to that monster who stood over her his mottled face all flushed his eyes glowing as they considered her helplessness and terror with horrible pitiless greed  thus we observed them ourselves unperceived for some moments for the prayingstool on which she crouched was placed to the left by the cowled fireplace in which a fire of scented wood was crackling the scene lighted by two golden candlebranches that stood upon the table near the curtained window  o my lord she cried in her despair of your mercy leave me and no man shall ever know that you sought me thus i will be silent my lord o if you have no pity for me have at least pity for yourself do not cover yourself with the infamy of such a deeda deed that will make you hateful to all men  gladly at such a price would i purchase your love my bianca what pains could daunt me ah you are mine you are mine  as the hawk that has been long poised closes its wings and drops at last upon its prey so swooped he of a sudden down upon her caught and dragged her up from the prayingstool to crush her to him  she screamed in that embrace and sought to battle swinging round so that her back was fully towards us and farnese swinging round also in that struggle faced us and beheld us  it was as if a mask had been abruptly plucked from his face so sudden and stupendous was its alteration from flushed that it had been it grew livid and sickly the unholy fires were spent in his eyes and they grew dull and dead as a snakes his jaw was loosened and the sensual mouth looked unutterably foolish  for a moment i think i smiled upon him and then cavalcanti and i sprang forward both together as we moved his arms loosened their hold and bianca would have fallen but that i caught her  her terror still upon her she glanced upwards to see what fresh enemy was this and then at sight of my face as my arms closed about her and held her safe  agostino she cried and closed her eyes to lie panting on my breast  the duke fleeing like a scared rat before the anger of cavalcanti scuttled down the room to a small door in the wall that held the fireplace he tore it open and sprang through cavalcanti following recklessly  there was a snarl and a cry and the lord of pagliano staggered back clutching one hand to his breast and through his fingers came an ooze of blood falcone ran to him but cavalcanti swore like a man possessed  it is nothing he snapped by the horns of satan it is nothing a flesh wound and like a fool i gave back before it after him in there kill kill  out came falcones sword with a swish and into the dark closet beyond went the equerry with a roar cavalcanti after him  it seemed that scarce had farnese got within that closet than flattening himself against the wall he had struck at cavalcanti as the latter followed thus driving him back and gaining all the respite he needed for now they found the closet empty there was a door beyond that opened to a corridor and this was locked not a doubt but that farnese had gone that way they broke that door down i heard them at it what time i comforted bianca and soothed her stroking her head her cheek and murmuring fondly to her until presently she was weeping softly  thus cavalcanti and falcone found us presently when they returned farnese had escaped with one of his gentlemen who had reached him in time to warn him that the street was full of soldiers and the palace itself invaded thereupon the duke had dropped from one of the windows to the garden his gentleman with him and cavalcanti had been no more than in time to see them disappearing through the garden gate  the lord of paglianos buffcoat was covered with blood where pier luigi had stabbed him but he would give the matter no thought he was like a tiger now he dashed out into the antechamber and i heard him bellowing orders someone screamed horribly and then followed a fierce din as if the very place were coming down about our ears  what is it cried bianca quivering in my arms are are they fighting  i do not think so sweet i answered her we are in great strength have no fear  and then falcone came in again  the lord of pagliano is raging like a madman he said we had best be getting away or we shall have a brush with the captain of justice  supporting bianca i led her from that chamber  where are we going she asked me  home to pagliano i answered her and with that answer comforted that sorely tried maid  we found the antechamber in wreckage the great chandelier had been dragged from the ceiling pictures were slashed and cut to ribbons the arras had been torn from the walls and the costly furniture was reduced to firewood the doublewindows opening to the balcony stood wide and not a pane of glass left whole the fragments lying all about the place  thus it seemed childishly almost had cavalcanti vented his terrible rage and i could well conceive what would have befallen any of the dukes people upon whom in that hour he had chanced i did not know then that the poor pimp who had acted as our guide was hanging from the balcony dead nor that his had been the horrible scream i had heard  on the stairs we met the raging cavalcanti reascending the stump of his shivered sword in his hand  hasten he cried i was coming for you let us begone  below just within the main doors we found a pile of furniture set on a heap of straw  what is this i asked  you shall see he roared get to horse  i hesitated a moment then obeyed him and took bianca on the withers in front of me my arm about her to support her  then he called to one of the menatarms who stood by with a flaring torch he snatched the brand from his hand and stabbed the straw with it in a dozen places from each of which there leapt at once a tongue of flame when at last he flung the torch into the heart of the pile it was all a roaring hissing crackling blaze  he stood back and laughed if there are any more of his brothelmates in the house they can escape as he did they will be more fortunate than that one and he pointed up to the limp figure hanging from the balcony so that i now learnt what already i have told you  with my hand i screened biancas eyes do not look i bade her  i shuddered at the sight of that limply hanging body and yet i reflected that it was just any man who could have lent his aid to the foul crime that was attempted there that night deserved this fate and worse  cavalcanti got to horse and we rode down the street bringing folk to their windows in alarm behind us the flames began to lick out from the ground floor of cosimos palace  we reached the porta fodesta and peremptorily bade the guard to open for us he answered as became his duty with the very words that had been addressed to me at that place on a night two years ago  none passes out tonight  in an instant a group of our men surrounded him others made a living barrier before the guardhouse whilst two or three dismounted drew the bolts and dragged the great gates open  we rode on crossing the river and heading straight for pagliano  for a while it was the sweetest ride that ever i rode with my bianca nestling against my breast and responding faintly to all the foolishness that poured from me in that ambrosial hour  and then it seemed to me that we rode not by night but in the blazing light of day along a dusty road flanking an arid sundrenched stretch of the campagna and despite the aridity there must be water somewhere for i heard it thundering as the bagnanza had thundered after rain and yet i knew that could not be the bagnanza for the bagnanza was nowhere in the neighbourhood of rome  suddenly a great voice and i knew it for the voice of bianca called me by name  agostino  the vision was dissipated it was night again and we were riding for pagliano through the fertile lands of ultrapo and there was bianca clutching at my breast and uttering my name in accents of fear whilst the company about me was halting  what is it cried cavalcanti are you hurt i understood i had been dozing in the saddle and i must have rolled out of it but that bianca awakened me with her cry i said so  body of satan he swore to doze at such a time  i have scarce been out of the saddle for three days and three nightsthis is the fourth i informed him i have had but three hours sleep since we left rome i am done i admitted you sir had best take your daughter she is no longer safe with me  it was so the fierce tension which had banished sleep from me whilst these things were doing being now relaxed left me exhausted as galeotto had been at bologna and galeotto had urged me to halt and rest there he had begged for twelve hours i could now thank heaven from a full heart for having given me the strength and resolution to ride on for those twelve hours would have made all the difference between heaven and hell  cavalcanti himself would not take her confessing to some weakness for all that he insisted that his wound was not serious yet he had lost much blood through having neglected in his rage to stanch it so it was to falcone that fell the charge of that sweet burden  the last thing i remember was cavalcantis laugh as from the high ground we had mounted he stopped to survey a ruddy glare above the city of piacenza where in a vomit of sparks cosimos fine palace was being consumed  then we rode down into the valley again and as we went the thud of hooves grew more and more distant and i slept in the saddle as i rode a manatarms on either side of me so that i remember no more of the doings of that strenuous night     chapter xi the penance   i awakened in the chamber that had been mine at pagliano before my arrest by order of the holy office and i was told upon awakening that i had slept a night and a day and that it was eventide once more  i rose bathed and put on a robe of furs and then galeotto came to visit me  he had arrived at dawn and he too had slept for some ten hours since his arrival yet despite of it his air was haggard his glance overcast and heavy  i greeted him joyously conscious that we had done well but he remained gloomy and unresponsive  there is ill news he said at last cavalcanti is in a raging fever and he is sapped of strength his body almost drained of blood i even fear that he is poisoned that farneses dagger was laden with some venom  o surely it will be well with him i faltered he shook his head sombrely his brows furrowed  he must have been stark mad last night to have raged as he did with such a wound upon him and to have ridden ten miles afterwards o it was midsummer frenzy that sustained him here in the courtyard he reeled unconscious from the saddle they found him drenched with blood from head to foot and he has been unconscious ever since i am afraid he shrugged despondently  do you mean that that he may die i asked scarce above a whisper  it will be a miracle if he does not and that is one more crime to the score of pier luigi he said it in a tone of indescribable passion shaking his clenched fist at the ceiling  the miracle did not come to pass two days later in the presence of galeotto bianca fra gervasio who had been summoned from his piacenza convent to shrive the unfortunate baron and myself ettore cavalcanti sank quietly to rest  whether he was dealt an envenomed wound as galeotto swore or whether he died as a result of the awful draining of his veins i do not know  at the end he had a moment of lucidity  you will guard my bianca agostino he said to me and i swore it fervently as he bade me whilst upon her knees beyond the bed clasping one of his hands that had grown white as marble bianca was sobbing brokenheartedly  then the dying man turned his head to galeotto you will see justice done upon that monster ere you die he said it is gods holy work  and then his mind became clouded again by the mists of approaching dissolution and he sank into a sleep from which he never awakened  we buried him on the morrow in the chapel of pagliano and on the next day galeotto drew up a memorial wherein he set forth all the circumstances of the affair in which that gallant gentleman had met his end it was a terrible indictment of pier luigi farnese of this memorial he prepared two copies and to theseas witnesses of all the facts therein relatedbianca falcone and i appended our signatures and fra gervasio added his own one of these copies galeotto dispatched to the pope the other to ferrante gonzaga in milan with a request that it should be submitted to the emperor  when the memorial was signed he rose and taking biancas hand in his own he swore by his every hope of salvation that ere another year was sped her father should be avenged together with all the other of pier luigis victims  that same day he set out again upon his conspirators work whose aim was not only the life of pier luigi but the entire shattering of the pontifical sway in parma and piacenza some days later he sent me another score of lancesfor he kept his forces scattered about the country whilst gradually he increased their numbers  thereafter we waited for events at pagliano the drawbridge raised and none entering save after due challenge  we expected an attack which never came for pier luigi did not dare to lead an army against an imperial fief upon such hopeless grounds as were his own possibly too galeottos memorial may have caused the pope to impose restraint upon his dissolute son  cosimo danguissola however had the effrontery to send a messenger a week later to pagliano to demand the surrender of his wife saying that she was his by gods law and mans and threatening to enforce his rights by an appeal to the vatican  that we sent the messenger emptyhanded away it is scarce necessary to chronicle i was in command at pagliano holding it in biancas name as biancas lieutenant and castellan and i made oath that i would never lower the bridge to admit an enemy  but cosimos message aroused in us a memory that had lain dormant these days she was no longer for my wooing she was the wife of another  it came to us almost as a flash of lightning in the night and it startled us by all that it revealed  the fault of it is all mine said she as we sat that evening in the goldandpurple diningroom where we had supped  it was with those words that she broke the silence that had endured throughout the repast until the departure of the pages and the seneschal who had ministered to us precisely as in the days when cavalcanti had been alive  ah not that sweet i implored her reaching a hand to her across the table  but it is true my dear she answered covering my hand with her own if i had shown you more mercy when so contritely you confessed your sin mercy would have been shown to me i should have known from the sign i had that we were destined for each other that nothing that you had done could alter that i did know it and yet she halted there her lip tremulous  and yet you did the only thing that you could do when your sweet purity was outraged by the knowledge of what i really had been  but you were so no more she said with a something of pleading in her voice  it was youthe blessed sight of you that cleansed me i cried when love for you awoke in me i knew love for the first time for that other thing which i deemed love had none of loves holiness your image drove out all the sin from my soul the peace which half a year of penance of fasting and flagellation could not bring me was brought me by my love for you when it awoke it was as a purifying fire that turned to ashes all the evil of desires that my heart had held  her hand pressed mine she was weeping softly  i was an outcast i continued i was a mariner without compass far from the sight of land striving to find my way by the light of sentiments implanted in me from early youth i sought salvation desperatelysought it in a hermitage as i would have sought it in a cloister but that i had come to regard myself as unworthy of the cloistered life i found it at last in you in the blessed contemplation of you it was you who taught me the lesson that the world is gods world and that god is in the world as much as in the cloister such was the burden of your message that night when you appeared to me on monte orsaro  o agostino she cried and all this being so can you refrain from blaming me for what has come to pass if i had but had faith in youthe faith in the sign which we both receivedi should have known all this known that if you had sinned you had been tempted and that you had atoned  i think the atonement lies here and now in this i answered very gravely she was the wife of another who dragged me down you are the wife of another who have lifted me up she through sin was attainable that you can never never be else should i have done with life in earnest but do not blame yourself sweet saint you did as your pure spirit bade you soon all would have been well but that already messer pier luigi had seen you  she shuddered  you know dear that if i submitted to wed your cousin it was to save youthat such was the price imposed  dear saint i cried  i but mention it that upon such a score you may have no doubt of my motives  how could i doubt i protested  i rose and moved down the room towards the window behind which the night gleamed deepest blue i looked out upon the gardens from which the black shadows of stark poplars thrust upward against the sky and i thought out this thing then i turned to her having as i imagined found the only and rather obvious solution  there is but one thing to do bianca  and that her eyes were very anxious and looked perhaps even more so in consequence of the pallor of her face and the lines of pain that had come into it in these weeks of such sore trial  i must remove the barrier that stands between us i must seek out cosimo and kill him  i said it without anger without heat of any sort a calm cold statement of a step that it was necessary to take it was a just measure the only measure that could mend an unjust situation and so i think she too viewed it for she did not start or cry out in horror or manifest the slightest surprise at my proposal but she shook her head and smiled very wistfully  what a folly would not that be she said how would it amend what is you would be taken and justice would be done upon you summarily would that make it any easier or any better for me i should be alone in the world and entirely undefended  ah but you go too fast i cried by justice i could not suffer i need but to state the case the motive of my quarrel the iniquitous wrong that was attempted against you the odious traffic of this marriage and all men would applaud my act none would dare do me a hurt  you are too generous in your faith in man she said who would believe your claims  the courts i said  the courts of a state in which pier luigi governs  but i have witnesses of the facts  those witnesses would never be allowed to testify your protests would be smothered and how would your case really look she cried the world would conceive that the lover of bianca de cavalcanti had killed her husband that he might take her for his own what could you hope for against such a charge as that men might even remember that other affair of fifantis and even the populace which may be said to have saved you erstwhile might veer round and change from the opinion which it has ever held they would say that one who has done such a thing once may do it twice that  o for pitys sake stop have mercy i cried flinging out my arms towards her and mercifully she ceased perceiving that she had said enough  i turned to the window again and pressed my brow against the cool glass she was right that acute mind of hers had pierced straight to the very core of this matter to do the thing that had been in my mind would be not only to destroy myself but to defile her for upon her would recoil a portion of the odium that must be flung at me andas she saidwhat then must be her position they would even have a case upon which to drag her from these walls of pagliano she would be a victim of the civil courts she might at pier luigis instigation be proceeded against as my accomplice in what would be accounted a dastardly murder for the basest of motives  i turned to her again  you are right i said i see that you are right just as i was right when i said that my atonement lies here and now the penance for which i have cried out so long is imposed at last it is as just as it is cruelly apt  i came slowly back to the table and stood facing her across it she looking up at me with very piteous eyes  bianca i must go hence i said that too is clear  her lips parted her eyes dilated her face if anything grew paler  o no no she cried piteously  it must be i said how can i remain cosimo may appeal for justice against me claiming that i hold his wife in duressand justice will be done  but can you not resist pagliano is strong and wellmanned the black bands are very faithful men and they will stand by you to the end  and the world i cried what will the world say of you it is you yourself have made me see it shall your name be dragged in the foul mire of scandal the wife of cosimo danguissola a runagate with her husbands cousin shall the world say that  she moaned and covered her face with her hands then she controlled herself again and looked at me almost fiercely  do you care so much for what men say  i am thinking of you  then think of me to better purpose my agostino consider that we are confronted by two evils and that the choice of the lesser is forced upon us if you go i am all unprotected and and the harm is done already  long i looked at her with such a yearning to take her in my arms and comfort her and i had the knowledge that if i remained daily must i experience this yearning which must daily grow crueller and more fierce from the very restraint i must impose upon it and then that rearing of mine all drenched in sanctity misunderstood came to my help and made me see in this an added burden to my penance a burden which i must accept if i would win to ultimate grace  and so i consented to remain and i parted from her with no more than a kiss bestowed upon her fingertips and went to pray for patience and strength to bear my heavy cross and so win to my ultimate reward be it in this world or the next  in the morning came news by a messenger from galeottonews of one more foul crime that the duke had committed on that awful night when we had rescued bianca from his evil claws the unfortunate giuliana had been found dead in her bed upon the following morning and the popular voice said that the duke had strangled her  of that rumour i subsequently had confirmation it would appear that maddened with rage at the loss of his prey that ravening wolf had looked about to discover who might have betrayed his purpose and procured that intervention he bethought him of giuliana had not cosimo seen her in intimate talk with me on the morning of my arrest and would he not have reported it to his master  so to the handsome mansion in which he housed her and to which at all hours he had access the duke went instantly he must have taxed her with it and knowing her nature i can imagine that she not only admitted that his thwarting was due to her but admitted it mockingly exultingly jeering as only a jealous woman can jeer until in his rage he seized her by the throat  how bitterly must she not have repented that she had not kept a better guard upon her tongue during those moments of her agony brief in themselves yet horribly long to her until her poor wanton spirit went forth from the weak clay that she had loved too well  when i heard of the end of that unfortunate all my bitterness against her went out of me and in my heart i set myself to find excuses for her witty and cultured in much in much else she had been as stupid as the dumb beast she was irreligious as were many because what she saw of religion did not inspire respect in her and whilst one of her lovers had been a prince of the church another had been the son of the pope she was by nature sensuous and her sensuousness stifled in her all perception of right or wrong  i like to think that her death was brought about as the result of a good deedso easily might it have been the consequence of an evil one and i trust that that deedgood in itself whatever the sources from which it may have sprungmay have counted in her favour and weighed in the balance against the sins that were largely of her nature  i bethought me of fra gervasios words to me who that knows all that goes to the making of a sin shall ever dare to blame a sinner he had applied those words to my own case where giuliana was concerned but do they not apply equally to giuliana do they not apply to every sinner when all is said     chapter xii blood   the words that passed between bianca and me that evening in the diningroom express all that can be said of our attitude to each other during the months that followed daily we met and the things which our lips no longer dared to utter our eyes expressed  days passed and grew to weeks and these accumulated into months the autumn faded from gold to grey and the winter came and laid the earth to sleep and then followed spring to awaken it once more  none troubled us at pagliano and we began with some justice to consider ourselves secure galeottos memorial not a doubt had stirred up matters and pier luigi would be under orders from his father not to add one more scandal to the many of his life by venturing to disturb madonna bianca in her stronghold at pagliano  from time to time we were visited by galeotto it was well for him that fatigue had overwhelmed him that day at bologna and so hindered him from taking a hand with us in the doings of that hideous night else he might no longer have freedom to roam the state unchallenged as he did  he told us of the new citadel the duke was building in piacenza and how for the purpose he was pulling down houses relentlessly to obtain material and to clear himself a space and how further he was widening and strengthening the walls of the city  but i doubt he said one morning in that spring if he will live to see the work completed for we are resolved at last there is no need for an armed rising five score of my lances will be all that is necessary we are planning a surprise and ferrante gonzaga is to be at hand to support us with imperial troops and to receive the state as the emperors vicegerent when the hour strikes it will strike soon he added and this too shall be paid for with the rest and he touched the black mourning gown that bianca wore  he rode away again that day and he went north for a last interview with the emperors lieutenant but promising to return before the blow was struck to give me the opportunity to bear my share in it  spring turned to summer and we waited wandering in the gardens together reading together playing at bowls or tennis though the latter game was not considered one for women and sometimes exercising the menatarms in the great inner bailey where they lodged twice we rode out ahawking accompanied by a strong escort and returned without mishap though i would not consent to a third excursion lest a rumour having gone abroad our enemies should lie in wait to trap us i grew strangely fearful of losing her who did not and who never might belong to me  and all this time my penance as i regarded it grew daily heavier to bear long since i had ceased so much as to kiss her fingertips but to kiss the very air she breathed was fraught with danger to my peace of mind and then one evening as we paced the garden together i had a moments madness a moment in which my yearnings would no longer be repressed without warning i swung about caught her in my arms and crushed her to me  i saw the sudden flicker of her eyelids the one swift upward glance of her blue eyes and i beheld in them a yearning akin to my own but also a something of fear that gave me pause  i put her from me i knelt and kissed the hem of her mourning gown  forgive me sweet i besought her very humbly  my poor agostino was all she answered me what time her fingers fluttered gently over my sable hair  thereafter i shunned her for a whole week and was never in her company save at meals under the eyes of our attendants  at last one day in the early part of september on the very anniversary of her fathers deaththe eighth of that month it was and a thursdaycame galeotto with a considerable company of menatarms and that night he was gay and blithe as i had never seen him in these twelve months past  when we were alone the cause of it which already i suspected at last transpired  it is the hour he said very pregnantly his sands are swiftly running out tomorrow agostino you ride with me to piacenza falcone shall remain here to captain the men in case any attempt should be made upon pagliano which is not likely  and now he told us of the gay doings there had been in piacenza for the occasion of the visit of the dukes son ottaviothat same soninlaw of the emperor whom the latter befriended yet not to the extent of giving him the duchy in his fathers place when that father should have gone to answer for his sins  daily there had been jousts and tournaments and all manner of gaieties for which the piacentini had been sweated until they could sweat no more having fawned upon the people that they might help him to crush the barons farnese was now crushing the people whose service he no longer needed extortion had reduced them to poverty and despair and their very houses were being pulled down to supply material for the new citadel the duke recking little who might thus be left without a roof over his head  he has gone mad said galeotto and laughed pier luigi could not more effectively have played his part so as to serve our ends the nobles he alienated long ago and now the very populace is incensed against him and weary of his rapine it is so bad with him that of late he has remained shut in the citadel and seldom ventures abroad so as to avoid the sight of the starving faces of the poor and the general ruin that he is making of that fair city he has given out that he is ill a little bloodletting will cure all his ills for ever  upon the morrow galeotto picked thirty of his men and gave them their orders they were to depose their black liveries and clad as countryfolk but armed as countryfolk would be for a long journey they were severally to repair afoot to piacenza and assemble there upon the morning of saturday at the time and place he indicated they went and that afternoon we followed  you will come back to me agostino bianca said to me at parting  i will come back i answered and bowing i left her my heart very heavy  but as we rode the prospect of the thing to do warmed me a little and i shook off my melancholy optimism coloured the world for me all of the rosy hue of promise  we slept in piacenza that night in a big house in the street that leads to the church of san lazzaro and there was a company of perhaps a dozen assembled there the principals being the brothers pallavicini of cortemaggiore who had been among the first to feel the iron hand of pier luigi there were also present agostino landi and the head of the house of confalonieri  we sat after supper about a long table of smooth brown oak which reflected as in a pool the beakers and flagons with which it was charged when suddenly galeotto span a coin upon the middle of it it fell flat presently showing the ducal arms and the inscription of which the abbreviation plac was a part  galeotto set his finger to it a year ago i warned him said he that his fate was written there in that shortened word tomorrow i shall read the riddle for him  i did not understand the allusion and said so  why he explained not only to me but to others whose brows had also been knit first plac stands for placentia where he will meet his doom and then it contains the initials of the four chief movers in this undertakingpallavicini landi anguissola and confalonieri  you force the omen to come true when you give me a leaders rank in this affair said i  he smiled but did not answer and returned the coin to his pocket  and now the happening that is to be related is to be found elsewhere for it is a matter of which many men have written in different ways according to their feelings or to the hand that hired them to the writing  soon after dawn galeotto quitted us each of us instructed how to act  later in the morning as i was on my way to the castle where we were to assemble at noon i saw galeotto riding through the streets at the dukes side he had been beyond the gates with pier luigi on an inspection of the new fortress that was building it appeared that once more there was talk between the duke and galeotto of the latters taking service under him and galeotto made use of this circumstance to forward his plans he was i think the most selfcontained and patient man that it would have been possible to find for such an undertaking  in addition to the condottiero a couple of gentlemen on horseback attended the duke and half a score of his swiss lanzknechte in gleaming corselets and steel morions shouldering their formidable pikes went afoot to hedge his excellency  the people fell back before that little company the citizens doffed their caps with the respect that is begotten of fear but their air was sullen and in the main they were silent though here and there some knave with the craven adulation of those born to serve at all costs raised a feeble shout of duca  the duke moved slowly at little more than a walking pace for he was all crippled again by the disease that ravaged him and his face handsome in itself was now repulsive to behold it was a livid background for the fiery pustules that mottled it and under the sunken eyes there were great brown stains of suffering  i flattened myself against a wall in the shadow of a doorway lest he should see me for my height made me an easy mark in that crowd but he looked neither to right nor to left as he rode indeed it was said that he could no longer bear to meet the glances of the people he had so grossly abused and outraged with deeds that are elsewhere abundantly related and with which i need not turn your stomachs here  when they had gone by i followed slowly in their wake towards the castle as i turned out of the fine road that gambara had built i was joined by the brothers pallavicini a pair of resolute grizzled gentlemen the elder of whom as you will remember was slightly lame with an odd sense of fitness they had dressed themselves in black they were accompanied by half a dozen of galeottos men but these bore no device by which they could be identified we exchanged greetings and stepped out together across the open space of the piazza della citadella towards the fortress  we crossed the drawbridge and entered unchallenged by the guard people were wont to come and go and to approach the duke it was necessary to pass the guard in the antechamber above whose business it was to question all comers  moreover the only guard set consisted of a couple of swiss who lounged in the gateway the garrison being all at dinner a circumstance upon which galeotto had calculated in appointing noon as the hour for the striking of the blow  we crossed the quadrangle and passing under a second archway came into the inner bailey as we had been bidden here we were met by confalonieri who also had half a dozen men with him he greeted us and issued his orders sharply  you ser agostino are to come with us whilst you others are to remain here until messer landi arrives with the remainder of our forces he should have a score of men with him and they will cut down the guard when they enter the moment that is done let a pistolshot be discharged as the signal to us above and proceed immediately to take up the bridge and overpower the swiss who should still be at table landi has his orders and knows how to act  the pallavicini briefly spoke their assents and confalonieri taking me by the arm led me quickly abovestairs his halfdozen men following close upon our heels upon none was there any sign of armour but every man wore a shirt of mail under his doublet or jerkin  we entered the antechambera fine lofty apartment richly hung and richly furnished it was empty of courtiers for all were gone to dine with the captain of the guard who had been married upon that very morning and was giving a banquet in honour of the event as galeotto had informed himself when he appointed the day  over by a window sat four of the swissthe entire guardabout a table playing at dice their lances deposited in an angle of the wall  watching their gamefor which he had lingered after accompanying the duke thus farstood the tall broadshouldered figure of galeotto he turned as we entered and gave us an indifferent glance as if we were of no interest to him then returned his attention to the dicers  one or two of the swiss looked up at us casually the dice rattled merrily and there came from the players little splutters of laughter and deep guttural german oaths  at the rooms far end by the curtains that masked the door of the chamber where farnese sat at dinner stood an usher in black velvet staff in hand who took no more interest in us than did the swiss  we sauntered over to the dicers table and in placing ourselves the better to watch their game we so contrived that we entirely hemmed them into the embrasure whilst confalonieri himself stood with his back to the pikes an effective barrier between the men and their weapons  we remained thus for some moments whilst the game went on and we laughed with the winners and swore with the losers as if our hearts were entirely in the dicing and we had not another thought in the world  suddenly a pistolshot crackled below and startled the swiss who looked at one another one burly fellow whom they named hubli held the dicebox poised for a throw that was never made  across the courtyard below men were running with drawn swords shouting as they ran and hurled themselves through the doorway leading to the quarters where the swiss were at table this the guards saw through the open window and they stared muttering german oaths to express their deep bewilderment  and then there came a creak of winches and a grinding of chains to inform us that the bridge was being taken up at last those four lanzknechte looked at us  beim blute gottes swore hubli was giebt es  our set faces showing no faintest trace of surprise quickened their alarm and this became flavoured by suspicion when they perceived at last how closely we pressed about them  continue your game said confalonieri quietly it will be best for you  the great blonde fellow hubli flung down the dicebox and heaved himself up truculently to face the speaker who stood between him and the lances instantly confalonieri stabbed him and he sank back into his chair with a cry intensest surprise in his blue eyes so sudden and unlookedfor had the action been  galeotto had already left the group about the table and with a blow of his great hand he felled the usher who sought to bar his passage to the dukes chamber he tore down the curtains and he was wrapping and entangling the fellow in the folds of them when i came to his aid followed by confalonieri whose six men remained to hold the three sound and the one wounded swiss in check  and now from below there rose such a din of steel on steel of shouts and screams and curses that it behoved us to make haste  bidding us follow him galeotto flung open the door at table sat farnese with two of his gentlemen one of whom was the marquis sforzafogliani the other a doctor of canon law named copallati  alarm was already written on their faces at sight of galeottoah you are still here cried farnese what is taking place below have the swiss fallen to fighting among themselves  galeotto returned no answer but advanced slowly into the room and now farneses eyes went past him and fastened upon me and i saw them suddenly dilate beyond me they went and met the cold glance of confalonieri that other gentleman he had so grievously wronged and whom he had stripped of the last rag of his possessions and his rights the sun coming through the window caught the steel that confalonieri still carried in his hands its glint drew the eyes of the duke and he must have seen that the barons sleeve was bloody  he rose leaning heavily upon the table  what does this mean he demanded in a quavering voice and his face had turned grey with apprehension  it means galeotto answered him firmly and coldly that your rule in piacenza is at an end that the pontifical sway is broken in these states and that beyond the po ferrante gonzaga waits with an army to take possession here in the emperors name finally my lord duke it means that the devils patience is to be rewarded and that he is at last to have you who have so faithfully served him upon earth  farnese made a gurgling sound and put a jewelled hand to his throat as if he choked he was all in green velvet and every button of his doublet was a brilliant of price and that gay raiment by its incongruity seemed to heighten the tragedy of the moment  of his gentlemen the doctor sat frozen with terror in his highbacked seat clutching the arms of it so that his knuckles showed white as marble in like case were the two attendant servants who hung motionless by the buffet but sforzafogliani a man of some spirit for all his effeminate appearance leapt to his feet and set a hand to his weapons  instantly confalonieris sword flashed from its sheath he had passed his dagger into his left hand  on your life my lord marquis do not meddle here he warned him in a voice that was like a trumpetcall  and before that ferocious aspect and those naked weapons sforzafogliani stood checked and intimidated  i too had drawn my poniard determined that farnese should fall to my steel in settlement of the score that lay between us he saw the act and if possible his fears were increased for he knew that the wrongs he had done me were personal matters between us for which it was not likely i should prove forgiving  mercy he gasped and held out supplicating hands to galeotto  mercy i echoed and laughed fiercely what mercy would you have shown me against whom you set the holy office but that you could sell my life at a price that was merciless what mercy would you have shown to the daughter of cavalcanti when she lay in your foul power what mercy did you show her father who died by your hand what mercy did you show the unfortunate giuliana whom you strangled in her bed what mercy did you ever show to any that you dare ask now for mercy  he looked at me with dazed eyes and from me to galeotto he shuddered and turned a greenish hue his knees were loosened by terror and he sank back into the chair from which he had risen  at least at least he gasped let me have a priest to shrive me do not do not let me die with all my sins upon me  in that moment there came from the antechamber the sound of swiftly moving feet and the clash of steel mingling with cries the sound heartened him he conceived that someone came to his assistance he raised his voice in a desperate screech  to me to me help  as he shouted i sprang towards him to find my passage suddenly barred by galeottos arm he shot it out and my breast came against it as against a rod of iron it threw me out of balance and ere i had recovered it had thrust me back again  back there said galeottos brazen voice this affair is mine mine are the older wrongs and the greater  with that he stepped behind the dukes chair and farnese in a fresh spurt of panic came to his feet galeotto locked an arm about his neck and pulled his head back into his ear he muttered words that i could not overhear but it was matter that stilled farneses last struggle only the dukes eyes moved rolling in his head as he sought to look upon the face of the man who spoke to him and in that moment galeotto wrenched his victims head still farther back laying entirely bare the long brown throat across which he swiftly drew his dagger  copallati screamed and covered his face with his hands sforzafogliani white to the lips looked on like a man entranced  there was a screech from farnese that ended in a gurgle and suddenly the blood spurted from his neck as from a fountain galeotto let him go he dropped to his chair and fell forward against the table drenching it in blood thence he went over sideways and toppled to the floor where he lay twitching a huddle of arms and legs the head lolling sideways the eyes vitreous and blood blood blood all about him     chapter xiii the overthrow   the sight turned me almost physically sick  i faced about and sprang from the room out into the antechamber where a battle was in progress some three or four of the dukes gentlemen and a couple of swiss had come to attempt a rescue they had compelled galeottos six men to draw and defend themselves the odds being suddenly all against them into that medley i went with drawn sword hacking and cutting madly giving knocks and taking them glad of the excitement of it glad of anything that would shut out from my mind the horror of the scene i had witnessed  presently confalonieri came out to take a hand leaving galeotto on guard within and in a few minutes we had made an end of that resistancethe last splutter of resistance within those walls  beyond some cuts and scratches that some of us had taken not a man of ours was missing whilst of the dukes followers not a single one remained alive in that antechamber the place was a shambles hangings that had been clutched had been torn from the walls a great mirror was cracked from top to bottom tables were overset and wrecked chairs were splintered and hardly a pane of glass remained in any of the windows and everywhere there was blood everywhere dead men  up the stairs came trooping now our assembled forces led by landi and the pallavicini below all was quiet the swiss garrison taken by surprise at table as was planned had been disarmed and all were safe and impotent under lock and bolt the guards at the gate had been cut down and we were entirely masters of the place  sforzafogliani copallati and the two servants were fetched from the dukes chamber and taken away to be locked up in another room until the business should be ended for after all it was but begun  in the town the alarmbell was ringing from the tower of the communal palace and at the sound i saw galeottos eyes kindling he took command none disputing it him and under his orders men went briskly to turn the cannon of the fortress upon the square that an attack might be repulsed if it were attempted and three salvoes were fired to notify ferrante gonzaga where he waited that the castle was in the hands of the conspirators and pier luigi slain  meanwhile we had returned with galeotto to the room where the duke had died and where his body still lay huddled as it had fallen the windows of this chamber were set in the outer wall of the fortress immediately above the gates and commanding a view of the square we were sixconfalonieri landi the two pallavicini galeotto and myself besides a slight fellow named malvicini who had been an officer of lighthorse in the dukes service but who had taken a hand in betraying him  in the square there was by now a seething excited mob through which a little army of perhaps a thousand men of the town militia with their captain da terni riding at their head was forcing its way and they were shouting duca and crying out that the castle had been seized by spaniardsby which they meant the emperors troops  galeotto dragged a chair to the window and standing upon it showed himself to the people  disperse he shouted to them to your homes the duke is dead  but his voice could not surmount that raging din above which continued to ring the cry of duca duca  let me show them their duca said a voice it was malvicinis  he had torn down a curtainrope and had attached an end of it to one of the dead mans legs thus he dragged the body forward towards the window the other end of the rope he now knotted very firmly to a mullion then he took the body up in his arms whilst galeotto stood aside to make way for him and staggering under his ghastly burden malvicini reached the window and heaved it over the sill  it fell the length of the rope and there was arrested with a jerk to hang head downwards spreadeagle against the brown wall and the diamond buttons in his green velvet doublet sparkled merrily in the sunshine  at that sight a great silence swept across the multitude and availing himself of this galeotto again addressed those piacentini  to your homes he cried to them and arm yourselves to defend the state from your enemies if the need should arise there hangs the dukedead he has been slain to liberate our country from unjust oppression  still it seemed they did not hear him for though to us they appeared to be almost silent yet there was a rustle and stir amongst them which must have deafened each to what was being announced  they renewed their cries of duca of spaniards and to arms  a curse on your spaniards cried malvicini here take your duke look at him and understand and he slashed the rope across so that the body plunged down into the castle ditch  a few of the foremost of the crowd ran forward and scrambled down into the ditch to view the body and from them the rumour of the truth ran like a ripple over water through that mob so that in the twinkling of an eye there was no man in that vast concourseand all piacenza seemed by now to be packed into the squarebut knew that pier luigi farnese was dead  a sudden hush fell there were no more cries of duca they stood silent and not a doubt but that in the breasts of the majority surged a great relief even the militia ceased to advance if the duke was dead there was nothing left to do  again galeotto spoke to them and this time his words were caught by those in the ditch immediately below us and from them they were passed on and suddenly a great cry went upa shout of relief a paean of joy if farnese was dead and well dead they could at last express the thing that was in their hearts  and now at the far end of the square a glint of armour appeared a troop of horse emerged and began slowly to press forward through the crowd driving it back on either side but very gently they came three abreast and there were six score of them and from their lanceheads fluttered bannerols showing a sable bar on an argent field they were galeottos free company headed by one of his lieutenants beyond the po they too had been awaiting the salvo of artillery that should be their signal to advance  when their identity was understood and when the crowd had perceived that they rode to support the holders of the castle they were greeted with lusty cheers in which presently even the militia joined for these last were piacentini and no swiss hireling soldiers of the dukes  the drawbridge was let down and the company thundered over it to draw up in the courtyard under the eyes of galeotto he issued his orders once more to his companions then calling for horses for himself and for me and bidding a score of lances to detach themselves to ride with us we quitted the fortress  we pressed through the clamant multitude until we had reached the middle of the square here galeotto drew rein and raising his hand for silence informed the people once more that the duke had been done to death by the nobles of piacenza thus to avenge alike their own and the peoples wrongs and to free them from unjust oppression and tyranny  they cheered him when he had done and the cry now was piacenza piacenza  when they had fallen silent againi would have you remember he cried that pier luigi was the pontiffs son and that the pontiff will make haste to avenge his death and to reestablish here in piacenza the farnese sway so that all that we have done this day may go for naught unless we take our measures  the silence deepened  but you have been served by men who have the interest of the state at heart and more has been done to serve you than the mere slaying of pier luigi farnese our plans are made and we but wait to know is it your will that the state should incorporate itself as of old with that of milan and place itself under the protection of the emperor who will appoint you fellowcountrymen for rulers and will govern you wisely and justly abolishing extortion and oppression  a thunder of assent was his answer cesare cesare was now the cry and caps were tossed into the air  then go arm yourselves and repair to the commune and there make known your will to the anziani and councillors and see that it is given effect by them the emperors lieutenant is at your gates i ride to surrender to him the city in your name and before nightfall he will be here to protect you from any onslaught of the pontificals  with that he pushed on the mob streaming along with us intent upon going there and then to do the thing that galeotto advised and by now they had discovered galeottos name and they were shouting it in acclamation of him and at the sound he smiled though his eyes seemed very wistful  he leaned over to me and gripped my hand where it lay on the saddlebow clutching the reins  thus is giovanni danguissola at last avenged he said to me in a deep voice that thrilled me  i would that he were here to know i answered  and again galeottos eyes grew wistful as they looked at me  we won out of the town at last and when we came to the high ground beyond the river we saw in the plain below phalanx upon phalanx of a great army it was ferrante gonzagas imperial force  galeotto pointed to it that is my goal he said you had best ride on to pagliano with these lances you may need them there i had hoped that cosimo would have been found in the castle with pier luigi his absence makes me uneasy away with you then you shall have news of me within three days  we embraced on horseback as we were then he wheeled his charger and went down the steep ground riding hard for ferrantes army whilst we pursued our way and came some two hours later without mishap to pagliano  i found bianca awaiting me in the gallery above the courtyard drawn thither by the sounds of our approach  dear agostino i have been so fearful for you was her greeting when i had leapt up the staircase to take her hand  i led her to the marble seat she had occupied on that night two years ago when first we had spoken of our visions briefly i gave her the news of what had befallen in piacenza  when i had done she sighed and looked at me  it brings us no nearer to each other she said  nay nowthis much nearer at least that the imperial decree will return me the lordships of mondolfo and carmina dispossessing the usurper thus i shall have something to offer you my bianca  she smiled at me very sadly almost reproachfully  foolish said she what matter the possessions that it may be yours to cast into my lap is that what we wait for agostino is there not pagliano for you would not that at need be lordship enough  the meanest cottage of the countryside were lordship enough so that you shared it i answered passionately as many in like case have answered before and since  you see then that you are wrong to attach importance to so slight a thing as this imperial decree where you and i are concerned can an imperial decree annul my marriage  for that a papal bull would be necessary  and how is a papal bull to be obtained  it is not for us i admitted miserably  i have been wicked she said her eyes upon the ground a faint colour stirring in her cheeks i have prayed that the usurper might be dispossessed of his rights in me i have prayed that when the attack was made and revolt was carried into the citadel of piacenza cosimo danguissola might stand at his usual post beside the duke and might fall with him surely justice demanded it she cried out gods justice as well as mans his act in marrying me was a defilement of one of the holiest of sacraments and for that he should surely be punished and struck down  i went upon my knees to her dear love i cried see i have you daily in my sight let me not be ungrateful for so much  she took my face in her hands and looked into my eyes saying no word then she leaned forward and very gently touched my forehead with her lips  god pity us a little agostino she murmured her eyes shining with unshed tears  the fault is mineall mine i denounced myself we are being visited with my sins when i can take you for my ownif that blessed day should ever dawni shall know that i have attained to pardon that i am cleansed and worthy of you at last  she rose and i escorted her within then went to my own chamber to bathe and rest     chapter xiv the citation   we were breaking our fast upon the following morning when falcone sent word to me by one of the pages that a considerable force was advancing towards us from the south  i rose somewhat uneasy yet i reflected that it was possible that news of the revolt in piacenza having reached parma this was an army of pontificals moving thence upon the rebellious city but in that case what should they be doing this side of po  an hour later from the battlements where we paced side by sidebianca and iwe were able to estimate this force and we fixed its strength at five score lances soon we could make out the device upon their bannerolsa boars head azure upon an argent fieldmy own device that of the anguissola of mondolfo and instantly i knew them for cosimos men  on the lower parapet six culverins had been dragged into position under the supervision of falconewho was still with us at pagliano these pieces stood loaded and manned by the soldiers to whom i had assigned the office of engineers  thus we waited until the little army came to a halt about a quarter of a mile away and a trumpeter with a flag of truce rode forward accompanied by a knight armed capapie his beaver down  the herald wound a challenge and it was answered from the postern by a manatarms whereupon the herald delivered his message  in the name of our holy father and lord paul iii we summon agostino danguissola here to confer with the high and mighty cosimo danguissola tyrant of mondolfo and carmina  three minutes later to their infinite surprise the bridge thudded down to span the ditch and i walked out upon it with bianca at my side  will the lord cosimo come within to deliver his message i demanded  the lord cosimo would not fearing a trap  will he meet us here upon the bridge divesting himself first of his weapons myself i am unarmed  the herald conveyed the words to cosimo who hesitated still indeed he had wheeled his horse when the bridge fell ready to gallop off at the first sign of a sortie  i laughed you are a paltry coward cosimo when all is said i shouted do you not see that had i planned to take you i need resort to no subterfuge i have i addedthough untruthfullytwice your number of lances under arms and by now i could have flung them across the bridge and taken you under the very eyes of your own men you were rash to venture so far but if you will not venture farther at least send me your herald  at that he got down from his horse delivered up sword and dagger to his single attendant received from the man a parchment and came towards us opening his vizor as he advanced midway upon the bridge we met his lips curled in a smile of scorn  greetings my strolling saint he said through all your vagaries you are at least consistent in that you ever engage your neighbours wife to bear you company in your wanderings  i went hot and cold red and white by turns with difficulty i controlled myself under that tauntthe cruellest he could have flung at me in biancas hearing  your business here i snarled  he held out the parchment his eyes watching me intently so that they never once strayed to bianca  read st mountebank he bade me  i took the paper but before i lowered my eyes to it i gave him warning  if on your part you attempt the slightest treachery i said you shall be repaid in kind my men are at the winches and they have my orders that at the first treacherous movement on your part they are to take up the bridge you will see that you could not reach the end of it in time to save yourself  it was his turn to change colour under the shadow of his beaver have you trapped me he asked between his teeth  if you had anything of the anguissola besides the name i answered you would know me incapable of such a thing it is because i know that of the anguissola you have nothing but the name that you are a craven a dastard and a dog that i have taken my precautions  is it your conception of valour to insult a man whom you hold as if bound hand and foot against striking you as you deserve  i smiled sweetly into that white scowling face  throw down your gauntlet upon this bridge cosimo if you deem yourself affronted if you think that i have lied and most joyfully will i take it up and give you the trial by battle of your seeking  for an instant i almost thought that he would take me at my word as most fervently i hoped but he restrained himself  read he bade me again with a fierce gesture and accounting him well warned by now i read with confidence  it was a papal brief ordering me under pain of excommunication and death to make surrender to cosimo danguissola of the castle of pagliano which i traitorously held and of the person of his wife madonna bianca  this document is not exact said i i do not hold this castle traitorously it is an imperial fief and i hold it in the emperors name  he smiled persist if you are weary of life he said surrender now and you are free to depart and go wheresoever you list continue in your offence and the consequences shall daunt you ere all is done this imperial fief belongs to me and it is for me who am lord of pagliano by virtue of my marriage and the late lords death to hold it for the emperor  and you are not to doubt that when this brief is laid before the emperors lieutenant at milan he will move instantly against you to cast you out and to invest me in those rights which are mine by gods law and mans alike  my answer may at first have seemed hardly to the point i held out the brief to him  to seek the emperors lieutenant you need not go as far as milan you will find him in piacenza  he looked at me as if he did not understand how he asked  i explained while you have been cooling your heels in the antechambers of the vatican to obtain this endorsement of your infamy the world hereabouts has moved a little yesterday ferrante gonzaga took possession of piacenza in the emperors name today the council will be swearing fealty to caesar upon his lieutenants hands  he stared at me for a long moment speechless in his utter amazement then he swallowed hard  and the duke he asked  the duke has been in hell these fourandtwenty hours  dead he questioned his voice hushed  dead said i  he leaned against the rail of the bridge his arms fallen limply to his sides one hand crushing the pontifical parchment then he braced himself again he had reviewed the situation and did not see that it hurt his position when all was said  even so he urged what can you hope for the emperor himself must bow before this and do me justice and he smacked the document i demand my wife and my demand is backed by pontifical authority you are mad if you think that charles v can fail to support it  it is possible that charles v may take a different view of the memorial setting forth the circumstances of your marriage from that which the holy father appears to have taken i counsel you to seek the imperial lieutenant at piacenza without delay here you waste time  his lips closed with a snap then at last his eyes wandered to bianca who stood just beside and slightly behind me  let me appeal to you monna bianca he began  but at that i got between them are you so dead to shame i roared that you dare address her you pimp you jackal you eater of dirt be off or i will have this drawbridge raised and deal with you here and now in despite of pope and emperor and all the other powers you can invoke away with you then  you shall pay he snarled by god you shall pay  and on that he went off in some fear lest i should put my threat into execution  but bianca was in a panic he will do as he says she cried as soon as we had reentered the courtyard the emperor cannot deny him justice he must he must o agostino it is the end and see to what a pass i have brought you  i comforted her i spoke brave words i swore to hold that castle as long as one stone of it stood upon another but deep down in my heart there was naught but presages of evil  on the following day which was sunday we had peace but towards noon on monday the blow fell an imperial herald from piacenza rode out to pagliano with a small escort  we were in the garden when word was brought us and i bade the herald be admitted then i looked at bianca she was trembling and had turned very white  we spoke no word whilst they brought the messengera brisk fellow in his blackandyellow austrian livery he delivered me a sealed letter it proved to be a summons from ferrante gonzaga to appear upon the morrow before the imperial court which would sit in the communal palace of piacenza to deliver judgment upon an indictment laid against me by cosimo danguissola  i looked at the herald hesitation in my mind and glance he held out a second letter  this my lord i was asked by favour to deliver to you also  i took it and considered the superscription  these to the most noble agostino danguissola at pagliano       quickly      quickly      quickly  the hand was galeottos i tore it open it contained but two lines  upon your life do not fail to obey the imperial summons send falcone to me here at once and it was signedgaleotto  it is well i said to the herald i will not fail to attend  i bade the seneschal who stood in attendance to give the messenger refreshment ere he left and upon that dismissed him  when we were alone i turned to bianca galeotto bids me go i said there is surely hope  she took the note and passing a hand over her eyes as if to clear away some mist that obscured her vision she read it then she considered the curt summons that gave no clue and lastly looked at me  it is the end i said one way or the other it is the end but for galeottos letter i think i should have refused to obey and made myself an outlaw indeed as it isthere is surely hope  o agostino surely surely she cried have we not suffered enough have we not paid enough already for the happiness that should be ours tomorrow i shall go with you to piacenza  no no i implored her  could i remain here she pleaded could i sit here and wait could you be so cruel as to doom me to such a torture of suspense  but if if the worst befalls  it cannot she answered i believe in god     chapter xv the will of heaven   in the chamber of justice of the communal palace sat that day not the assessors of the ruota but the councillors in their damask robesthe council of ten of the city of piacenza and to preside over them sat not their prior but ferrante gonzaga himself in a gown of scarlet velvet edged with miniver  they sat at a long table draped in red at the rooms end gonzaga slightly above them on a raised dais under a canopy behind him hung a golden shield upon which was figured between two upright columns each surmounted by a crown the doubleheaded black eagle of austria a scroll intertwining the pillars was charged with the motto plus ultra  at the back of the court stood the curious who had come to see the show held in bounds by a steel line of spanish halberdiers but the concourse was slight for the folk of piacenza still had weightier matters to concern them than the trial of a wifestealer  i had ridden in with an escort of twenty lances but i left these in the square when i entered the palace and formally made surrender to the officer who met me this officer led me at once into the chamber of justice two menatarms opening a lane for me through the people with the butts of their pikes so that i came into the open space before my judges and bowed profoundly to gonzaga  coldly he returned the salutation his prominent eyes regarding me from out of that florid crafty countenance  on my left but high up the room and immediately at right angles to the judges tables sat galeotto fullarmed he was flanked on the one side by fra gervasio who greeted me with a melancholy smile and on the other by falcone who sat rigid  opposite to this group on the judges other hand stood cosimo he was flushed and his eyes gleamed as they measured me with haughty triumph from me they passed to bianca who followed after me with her women pale but intrepid and selfcontained her face the whiter by contrast with the mourninggown which she still wore for her father and which it might well come to pass that she should continue hereafter to wear for me  i did not look at her again as she passed on and up towards galeotto who had risen to receive her he came some few steps to meet her and escorted her to a seat next to his own so that falcone moved down to another vacant stool her women found place behind her  an usher set a chair for me and i too sat down immediately facing the emperors lieutenant then another usher in a loud voice summoned cosimo to appear and state his grievance  he advanced a step or two when gonzaga raised his hand to sign to him to remain where he was so that all could see him whilst he spoke  forthwith quickly fluently and lucidly as if he had got the thing by heart cosimo recited his accusation how he had married bianca de cavalcanti by her fathers consent in her fathers own castle of pagliano how that same night his palace in piacenza had been violently invested by myself and others abetting me and how we had carried off his bride and burnt his palace to the ground how i had since held her from him shut up in the castle of pagliano which was his fief in his quality as her husband and how similarly i had unlawfully held pagliano against him to his hurt  finally he reminded the court that he had appealed to the pope who had issued a brief commanding me under pain of excommunication and death to make surrender that i had flouted the pontifical authority and that it was only upon his appeal to caesar and upon the imperial mandate that i had surrendered wherefore he begged the court to uphold the holy fathers authority and forthwith to pronounce me excommunicate and my life forfeit restoring to him his wife bianca and his domain of pagliano which he would hold as the emperors liege and loyal servitor  having spoken thus he bowed to the court stepped back and sat down  the ten looked at gonzaga gonzaga looked at me  have you anything to say he asked  i rose imbued by a calm that surprised me  messer cosimo has left something out of his narrative said i when he says that i violently invested his palace here in piacenza on the night of his marriage and dragged thence the lady bianca others abetting me he would do well to add in the interests of justice the names of those who were my abettors  cosimo rose again does it matter to this court and to the affair at issue what caitiffs he employed he asked haughtily  if they were caitiffs it would not matter said i but they were not indeed to say that it was i who invested his palace is to say too much the leader of that expedition was monna biancas own father who having discovered the truth of the nefarious traffic in which messer cosimo was engaged hastened to rescue his daughter from an infamy  cosimo shrugged these are mere words he said  the lady herself is present and can bear witness to their truth i cried  a prejudiced witness indeed said cosimo with confidence and gonzaga nodded whereupon my heart sank  will messer agostino give us the names of any of the braves who were with him quoth cosimo it will no doubt assist the ends of justice for those men should be standing by him now  he checked me no more than in time i had been on the point of citing falcone and suddenly i perceived that to do so would be to ruin falcone without helping myself  i looked at my cousin in that case said i i will not name them  falcone however was minded to name himself for with a grunt he made suddenly to rise but galeotto stretched an arm across bianca and forced the equerry back into his seat  cosimo saw and smiled he was very sure of himself by now  the only witness whose word would carry weight would be the late lord of pagliano he said and the prisoner is more crafty than honest in naming one who is dead your excellency will know the precise importance to attach to that  again his excellency nodded could it indeed be that i was enmeshed my calm deserted me  will messer cosimo tell your excellency under what circumstances the lord of pagliano died i cried  it is yourself should be better able to inform the court of that answered cosimo quickly since he died at pagliano after you had borne his daughter thither as we have proof  gonzaga looked at him sharply are you implying sir that there is a further crime for which messer agostino danguissola should be indicted he inquired  cosimo shrugged and pursed his lips i will not go so far since the matter of ettore cavalcantis death does not immediately concern me besides there is enough contained in the indictment as it stands  the imputation was none the less terrible and could not fail of an effect upon the minds of the ten i was in despair for at every question it seemed that the tide of destruction rose higher about me i deemed myself irrevocably lost the witnesses i might have called were as good as gagged  yet there was one last question in my quivera question which i thought must crumple up his confidence  can you tell his excellency where you were upon your marriage night i cried hoarsely my temples throbbing  superbly cosimo looked round at the court he shrugged and shook his head as if in utter pity  i leave it to your excellency to say where a man should be upon his marriage night he said with an astounding impudence and there were some who tittered in the crowd behind me let me again beg your excellency and your worthinesses to pass to judgment and so conclude this foolish comedy  gonzaga nodded gravely as if entirely approving whilst with a fat jewelled hand he stroked his ample chin  i too think that it is time he said whereupon cosimo with a sigh of relief would have resumed his seat but that i stayed him with the last thing i had to say  my lord i cried appealing to gonzaga the true events of that night are set forth in a memorial of which two copies were drawn up one for the pope and the other for your excellency as the emperors vicegerent shall i recite its contentsthat messer cosimo may be examined upon them  it is not necessary came gonzagas icy voice the memorial is here before me and he tapped a document upon the table then he fixed his prominent eyes upon cosimo you are aware of its contents he asked  cosimo bowed and galeotto moved at last for the first time since the trials inception  until now he had sat like a carved image save when he had thrust out a hand to restrain falcone and his attitude had filled me with an unspeakable dread but at this moment he leaned forward turning an ear towards cosimo as if anxious not to miss a single word that the man might utter and cosimo intent as he was did not observe the movement  i saw its fellow at the vatican said my cousin and since the pope in his wisdom and goodness judged worthless the witnesses whose signatures it bears his holiness thought well to issue the brief upon which your excellency has acted in summoning agostino danguissola before you here  thus is that memorial disposed of as a false and lying document  and yet said gonzaga thoughtfully his heavy lip between thumb and forefinger it bears amongst others the signature of the lord of paglianos confessor  without violation of the seal of the confessional it is impossible for that friar to testify was the answer and the holy father cannot grant him dispensation for so much his signature therefore stands for nothing  there followed a moments silence the ten whispered among themselves but gonzaga never consulted them by so much as a glance they appeared to serve none but a decorative office in that court of his for they bore no share in the dispensing of a justice of which he constituted himself the sole arbiter  at last the governor spoke  it seems indeed that there is no more to say and the court has a clear course before it since the emperor cannot contravene the mandates of the holy see nothing remains then but to deliver sentence unless  he paused and his eyes singularly sly his lips pursed almost humorously he turned his glance upon galeotto  ser cosimo he said has pronounced this memorial a false and lying document is there anything that you messer galeotto as its author can have to tell the court  instantly the condottiero rose his great scarred face very solemn his eyes brooding he advanced almost to the very centre of the table so that he all but stood immediately before gonzaga yet sideways so that i had him in profile whilst he fully faced cosimo  cosimo at least had ceased to smile his handsome white face had lost some of its supercilious confidence here was something unexpected something upon which he had not reckoned against which he had not provided  what has ser galeotto to do with this he demanded harshly  that sir no doubt he will tell us if you will have patience gonzaga answered so sweetly and deferentially that of a certainty some of cosimos uneasiness must have been dissipated  i leaned forward now scarce daring to draw breath lest i should lose a word of what was to follow the blood that had earlier surged to my face had now all receded again and my pulses throbbed like hammers  then galeotto spoke his voice very calm and level  will your excellency first permit me to see the papal brief upon which you acted in summoning hither the accused  silently gonzaga delivered a parchment into galeottos hands the condottiero studied it frowning then he smote it sharply with his right hand  this document is not in order he announced  how quoth cosimo and he smiled again reassured completely by now convinced that here was no more than a minor quibble of the law  you are here described as cosimo danguissola lord of mondolfo and carmina these titles are not yours  the blood stirred faintly in cosimos cheeks  those fiefs were conferred upon me by our late lord duke pier luigi he replied  gonzaga spoke the confiscations effected by the late usurping duke and the awards made out of such confiscations have been cancelled by imperial decree all lands so confiscated are by this decree revertible to their original holders upon their taking oath of allegiance to caesar  cosimo continued to smile this is no matter of a confiscation effected by duke pier luigi he said the confiscation and my own investiture in the confiscated fiefs are a consequence of agostino danguissolas recreancyat least it is in such terms that my investiture is expressly announced in the papal bull that has been granted me and in the brief which lies before your excellency nor was such express announcement necessary for since i was next heir after ser agostino to the tyranny of mondolfo it follows that upon his being outlawed and his life forfeit i enter upon my succession  here thought i were we finally checkmated but galeotto showed no sign of defeat  where is this bull you speak of he demanded as though he were the judge himself  cosimo haughtily looked past him at gonzaga does your excellency ask to see it  assuredly said gonzaga shortly i may not take your word for its existence  cosimo plucked a parchment from the breast of his brown satin doublet unfolded it and advanced to lay it before gonzaga so that he stood near galeottonot more than an arms length between them  the governor conned it then passed it to galeotto it seems in order he said  nevertheless galeotto studied it awhile and then still holding it he looked at cosimo and the scarred face that hitherto had been so sombre now wore a smile  it is as irregular as the other he said it is entirely worthless  worthless quoth cosimo in an amazement that was almost scornful but have i not already explained  it sets forth here cut in galeotto with assurance that the fief of mondolfo and carmina are confiscated from agostino danguissola now i submit to your excellency and to your worthinesses he added turning aside that this confiscation is grotesque and impossible since mondolfo and carmina never were the property of agostino danguissola and could no more be taken from him than can a coat be taken from the back of a naked manunless he added sneering a papal bull is capable of miracles  cosimo stared at him with round eyes and i stared too no glimmer of the enormous truth breaking yet upon my bewildered mind in the court the silence was deathly until gonzaga spoke  do you say that mondolfo and carmina did not belongthat they never were the fiefs of agostino danguissola he asked  that is what i say returned galeotto towering there immense and formidable in his gleaming armour  to whom then did they belong  they did and do belong to giovanni danguissolaagostinos father  cosimo shrugged at this and some of the dismay passed from his countenance  what folly is this he cried giovanni danguissola died at perugia eight years ago  that is what is generally believed and what giovanni danguissola has left all to believe even to his own priestridden wife even to his own son sitting there lest had the world known the truth whilst pier luigi lived such a confiscation as this should indeed have been perpetrated  but he did not die at perugia at perugia ser cosimo he took this scar which for thirteen years has served him for a mask and he pointed to his own face  i came to my feet scarce believing what i heard galeotto was giovanni danguissolamy father and my heart had never told me so  in a flash i saw things that hitherto had been obscure things that should have guided me to the truth had i but heeded their indications  how for instance had i assumed that the anguissola whom he had mentioned as one of the heads of the conspiracy against pier luigi could have been myself  i stood swaying there whilst his voice boomed out again  now that i have sworn fealty to the emperor in my true name upon the hands of my lord gonzaga here now that the imperial aegis protects me from pope and popes bastards now that i have accomplished my lifes work and broken the pontifical sway in this piacenza i can stand forth again and resume the state that is my own  there stands my fosterbrother who has borne witness to my true identity there falcone who has been my equerry these thirty years and there are the brothers pallavicini who tended me and sheltered me when i lay at the point of death from the wounds that disfigured me at perugia  so my lord cosimo ere you can proceed further in this matter against my son you will need to take your brief and your bull back to rome and get them amended for there is in italy no lord of mondolfo and carmina other than myself  cosimo fell back before him limp and trembling his spirit broken by this shattering blow  and then gonzaga uttered words that might have heartened him but after being hurled from what he accounted the pinnacle of success he mistrusted now the crafty lieutenant saw that he had been played with as a mouse by this imperial cat with the soft deadly paws  we might waive the formalities in the interests of justice purred the lieutenant there is this memorial my lord he said and tapped the document his eyes upon my father  since your excellency wishes the matter to be disposed of out of hand it can i think be done he said and he looked again at cosimo  you have said that this memorial is false because the witnesses whose names are here cannot be admitted to testify  cosimo braced himself for a last effort do you defy the pope he thundered  if necessary was the answer i have done so all my life  cosimo turned to gonzaga it is not i who have branded this memorial false he said but the holy father himself  the emperor said my father may opine that in this matter the holy father has been deluded by liars there are other witnesses there is myself for one this memorial contains nothing but what was imparted to me by the lord of pagliano on his deathbed in the presence of his confessor  we cannot admit the confessor gonzaga thrust in  give me leave your excellency it was not in his quality as confessor that fra gervasio heard the dying man depone cavalcantis confession followed upon that and there was in addition present the seneschal of pagliano who is present here sufficient to establish this memorial alike before the imperial and the pontifical courts  and i swear to god as i stand here in his sight he continued in a ringing voice that every word there set down is as spoken by ettore cavalcanti lord of pagliano some hours before he died and so will those others swear and i charge your excellency as caesars vicegerent to accept that memorial as an indictment of that caitiff cosimo danguissola who lent himself to so foul and sacrilegious a deedfor it involved the defilement of the sacrament of marriage  in that you lie screamed cosimo crimson now with rage the veins at his throat and brow swelling like ropes  a silence followed my father turned to falcone and held out his hand falcone sprang to give him a heavy iron gauntlet holding this by the fingers my father took a step towards cosimo and he was smiling very calm again after his late furious mood  be it so he said since you say that i lie i do here challenge you to prove it upon my body  and he crashed the iron glove straight into cosimos face so that the skin was broken and blood flowed about the mouth leaving the lower half of the visage crimson the upper deadwhite  gonzaga sat on entirely unmoved and waited indifferent to the stir there was amid the ten for by the ancient laws of chivalryhowever much they might be falling now into desuetudeif cosimo took up the glove the matter passed beyond the jurisdiction of the court and all men must abide by the issue of the trial by battle  for a long moment cosimo hesitated then he saw ruin all about him hewho had come to this court so confidentlyhad walked into a trap he saw it now and saw that the only loophole was the chance this combat offered him he played the man in the end he stooped and took up the glove  upon your body thengod helping me he said  unable longer to control myself i sprang to my fathers side i caught his arm  let me father let me  he looked into my face and smiled and the steelcoloured eyes seemed moist and singularly soft  my son he said and his voice was gentle and soothing as a womans caress  my father i answered him a knot in my throat  alas that i must deny you the first thing you ask me by that name he said but the challenge is given and accepted do you take bianca to the duomo and pray that right may be done and gods will prevail gervasio shall go with you  and then came an interruption from gonzaga  my lord he said will you determine when and where this battle is to be fought  upon the instant answered my father on the banks of po with a score of lances to keep the lists  gonzaga looked at cosimo do you agree to this  it cannot be too soon for me replied the quivering cosimo black hatred in his glance  be it so then said the governor and he rose the court rising with him  my father pressed my hand again to the duomo agostino till i come he said and on that we parted  my sword was returned to me by gonzagas orders in so far as it concerned myself the trial was at an end and i was free  at gonzagas invitation very gladly i there and then swore fealty to the emperor upon his hands and then with bianca and gervasio i made my way through the cheering crowd and came out into the sunshine where my lances who had already heard the news set up a great shout at sight of me  thus we crossed the square and went to the duomo to render thanks we knelt at the altarrail and gervasio knelt above us upon the altars lowest step  somewhere behind us knelt biancas women who had followed us to the church  thus we waited for close upon two hours that were as an eternity  and kneeling there the eyes of my soul conned closely the scroll of my young life as it had been unfolded hitherto i reviewed its beginnings in the greyness of mondolfo under the tutelage of my poor dolorous mother who had striven so fiercely to set my feet upon the ways of sanctity but my ways had been errant ways even though myself i had sought to walk as she directed i had strayed and blundered veered and veered again a very mockery of what she strove to make mea strolling saint indeed as cosimo had dubbed me a wandering mummer when i sought after holiness  but my strolling my errantry ended here at last at the steps of this altar as i knew  deeply had i sinned but deeply and strenuously had i expiated and the heaviest burden of my expiation had been that endured in the past year at pagliano beside my gentle bianca who was anothers wedded wife that cross of penitenceso singularly condign to my sini had borne with fortitude heartened by the confidence that thus should i win to pardon and that the burden would be mercifully lifted when the expiation was complete in the lifting of that burden from me i should see a sign that pardon was mine at last that at last i was accounted worthy of this pure maid through whom i should have won to grace through whom i had come to learn that lovegods greatest giftis the great sanctifier of man  that the stroke of that ardently awaited hour was even now impending i did not for a moment doubt  behind us the door opened and steps clanked upon the granite floor  fra gervasio rose very tall and gaunt his gaze anxious  he looked and the anxiety passed thankfulness overspread his face he smiled serenely tears in his deepset eyes seeing this i too dared to look at last  up the aisle came my father very erect and solemn and behind him followed falcone with eyes atwinkle in his weatherbeaten face  let the will of heaven be done said my father and gervasio came down to pronounce the nuptial blessing over us
