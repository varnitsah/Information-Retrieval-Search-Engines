rev jeffrey wortle dd was a man much esteemed by othersand by himself  he combined two professions in both of which he had been successfulhad been and continued to be at the time in which we speak of him  i will introduce him to the reader in the present tense as rector of bowick and proprietor and headmaster of the school established in the village of that name  the seminary at bowick had for some time enjoyed a reputation under himnot that he had ever himself used so newfangled and unpalatable a word in speaking of his school  bowick school had been established by himself as preparatory to eton  dr wortle had been elected to an assistantmastership at eton early in life soon after he had become a fellow of exeter  there he had worked successfully for ten years and had then retired to the living of bowick  on going there he had determined to occupy his leisure and if possible to make his fortune by taking a few boys into his house  by dint of charging high prices and giving good foodperhaps in part also by the quality of the education which he impartedhis establishment had become popular and had outgrown the capacity of the parsonage  he had been enabled to purchase a field or two close abutting on the glebe gardens and had there built convenient premises  he now limited his number to thirty boys for each of which he charged £200 ayear  it was said of him by his friends that if he would only raise his price to £250 he might double the number and really make a fortune  in answer to this he told his friends that he knew his own business besthe declared that his charge was the only sum that was compatible both with regard to himself and honesty to his customers and asserted that the labours he endured were already quite heavy enough  in fact he recommended all those who gave him advice to mind their own business  it may be said of him that he knew his own so well as to justify him in repudiating counsel from others  there are very different ideas of what a fortune may be supposed to consist  it will not be necessary to give dr wortles exact idea  no doubt it changed with him increasing as his money increased  but he was supposed to be a comfortable man  he paid ready money and high prices  he liked that people under him should thriveand he liked them to know that they throve by his means  he liked to be master and always was  he was just and liked his justice to be recognised  he was generous also and liked that too to be known he kept a carriage for his wife who had been the daughter of a poor clergyman at windsor and was proud to see her as well dressed as the wife of any county squire  but he was a domineering husband  as his wife worshipped him and regarded him as a jupiter on earth from whose nod there could be and should be no appeal but little harm came from this if a tyrant he was an affectionate tyrant  his wife felt him to be so his servants his parish and his school all felt him to be so  they obeyed him loved him and believed in him  so upon the whole at the time with which we are dealing did the diocese the county and that world of parents by whom the boys were sent to his school  but this had not come about without some hard fighting he was over fifty years of age and had been rector of bowick for nearly twenty  during that time there had been a succession of three bishops and he had quarrelled more or less with all of them  it might be juster to say that they had all of them had more or less of occasion to find fault with him  now dr wortleor mr wortle as he should be called in reference to that periodwas a man who would bear censure from no human being  he had left his position at eton because the headmaster had required from him some slight change of practice  there had been no quarrel on that occasion but mr wortle had gone  he at once commenced his school at bowick taking halfadozen pupils into his own house  the bishop of that day suggested that the cure of the souls of the parishioners of bowick was being subordinated to the latin and greek of the sons of the nobility  the bishop got a response which gave an additional satisfaction to his speedy translation to a more comfortable diocese  between the next bishop and mr wortle there was unfortunately misunderstanding and almost feud for the entire ten years during which his lordship reigned in the palace of broughton  this bishop of broughton had been one of that large batch of low church prelates who were brought forward under lord palmerston  among them there was none more low more pious more sincere or more given to interference  to teach mr wortle his duty as a parish clergyman was evidently a necessity to such a bishop to repudiate any such teaching was evidently a necessity to mr wortle consequently there were differences in all of which mr wortle carried his own  what the good bishop suffered no one probably knew except his wife and his domestic chaplain  what mr wortle enjoyedor dr wortle as he came to be called about this timewas patent to all the county and all the diocese  the sufferer died not let us hope by means of the doctor and then came the third bishop  he too had found himself obliged to say a word  he was a man of the worldwise prudent not given to interference or faultfinding friendly by nature one who altogether hated a quarrel a bishop beyond all things determined to be the friend of his clergymenand yet he thought himself obliged to say a word  there were matters in which dr wortle affected a peculiarly anticlerical mode of expression if not of feeling  he had been foolish enough to declare openly that he was in search of a curate who should have none of the grace of godliness about him  he was wont to ridicule the piety of young men who devoted themselves entirely to their religious offices  in a letter which he wrote he spoke of one youthful divine as a conceited ass who had preached for forty minutes  he not only disliked but openly ridiculed all signs of a special pietistic bearing  it was said of him that he had been heard to swear  there can be no doubt that he made himself wilfully distasteful to many of his stricter brethren then it came to pass that there was a correspondence between him and the bishop as to that outspoken desire of his for a curate without the grace of godliness  but even here dr wortle was successful  the management of his parish was preeminently good  the parish school was a model  the farmers went to church  dissenters there were none  the people of bowick believed thoroughly in their parson and knew the comfort of having an openhanded welltodo gentleman in the village  this third episcopal difficulty did not endure long  dr wortle knew his man and was willing enough to be on good terms with his bishop so long as he was allowed to be in all things his own master  there had too been some fighting between dr wortle and the world about his school  he was as i have said a thoroughly generous man but he required himself to be treated with generosity  any question as to the charges made by him as schoolmaster was unendurable  he explained to all parents that he charged for each boy at the rate of two hundred ayear for board lodging and tuition and that anything required for a boys benefit or comfort beyond that ordinarily supplied would be charged for as an extra at such price as dr wortle himself thought to be an equivalent now the popularity of his establishment no doubt depended in a great degree on the sufficiency and comfort of the good things of the world which he provided  the beer was of the best the boys were not made to eat fat their taste in the selection of joints was consulted  the morning coffee was excellent  the cook was a great adept at cakes and puddings  the doctor would not himself have been satisfied unless everything had been plentiful and everything of the best  he would have hated a butcher who had attempted to seduce him with meat beneath the usual price  but when he had supplied that which was sufficient according to his own liberal ideas he did not give more without charging for it among his customers there had been a certain honourable mr stantiloup andwhich had been more importantan honourable mrs stantiloup  mrs stantiloup was a lady who liked all the best things which the world could supply but hardly liked paying the best price  dr wortles school was the best thing the world could supply of that kind but then the price was certainly the very best  young stantiloup was only eleven and as there were boys at bowick as old as seventeenfor the school had not altogether maintained its old character as being merely preparatorymrs stantiloup had thought that her boy should be admitted at a lower fee the correspondence which had ensued had been unpleasant  then young stantiloup had had the influenza and mrs stantiloup had sent her own doctor  champagne had been ordered and carriage exercise  mr stantiloup had been forced by his wife to refuse to pay sums demanded for these undoubted extras  ten shillings aday for a drive for a little boy seemed to her a great dealseemed so to mrs stantiloup  ought not the doctors wife to have been proud to take out her little boy in her own carriage  and then £2 10s for champagne for the little boy  it was monstrous  mr stantiloup remonstrated  dr wortle said that the little boy had better be taken away and the bill paid at once  the little boy was taken away and the money was offered short of £5  the matter was instantly put into the hands of the doctors lawyer and a suit commenced the doctor of course got his money and then there followed an acrimonious correspondence in the times and other newspapers  mrs stantiloup did her best to ruin the school and many very eloquent passages were written not only by her or by her own special scribe but by others who took the matter up to prove that two hundred ayear was a great deal more than ought to be paid for the charge of a little boy during three quarters of the year  but in the course of the next twelve months dr wortle was obliged to refuse admittance to a dozen eligible pupils because he had not room for them  no doubt he had suffered during these contestssuffered that is in mind  there had been moments in which it seemed that the victory would be on the other side that the forces congregated against him were too many for him and that not being able to bend he would have to be broken but in every case he had fought it out and in every case he had conquered he was now a prosperous man who had achieved his own way and had made all those connected with him feel that it was better to like him and obey him than to dislike him and fight with him  his curates troubled him as little as possible with the grace of godliness and threw off as far as they could that zeal which is so dear to the youthful mind but which so often seems to be weak and flabby to their elders  his ushers or assistants in the school fell in with his views implicitly and were content to accept compensation in the shape of personal civilities  it was much better to go shares with the doctor in a joke than to have to bear his hard words  it is chiefly in reference to one of these ushers that our story has to be told  but before we commence it we must say a few more words as to the doctor and his family  of his wife i have already spoken  she was probably as happy a woman as you shall be likely to meet on a summers day  she had good health easy temper pleasant friends abundant means and no ambition  she went nowhere without the doctor and whenever he went she enjoyed her share of the respect which was always shown to him she had little or nothing to do with the school the doctor having many years ago resolved that though it became him as a man to work for his bread his wife should not be a slave  when the battles had been going onthose between the doctor and the bishops and the doctor and mrs stantiloup and the doctor and the newspapersshe had for a while been unhappy  it had grieved her to have it insinuated that her husband was an atheist and asserted that her husband was a cormorant but his courage had sustained her and his continual victories had taught her to believe at last that he was indomitable  they had one child a daughter mary of whom it was said in bowick that she alone knew the length of the doctors foot  it certainly was so that if mrs wortle wished to have anything done which was a trifle beyond her own influence she employed mary  and if the boys collectively wanted to carry a point they would collectively obtain miss wortles aid  but all this the doctor probably knew very well and though he was often pleased to grant favours thus asked he did so because he liked the granting of favours when they had been asked with a proper degree of care and attention  she was at the present time of the age in which fathers are apt to look upon their children as still children while other men regard them as being grownup young ladies  it was now june and in the approaching august she would be eighteen  it was said of her that of the girls all round she was the prettiest and indeed it would be hard to find a sweeterfavoured girl than mary wortle  her father had been all his life a man noted for the manhood of his face  he had a broad forehead with bright grey eyeseyes that had always a smile passing round them though the smile would sometimes show that touch of irony which a smile may contain rather than the goodhumour which it is ordinarily supposed to indicate  his nose was aquiline not hooky like a true birdsbeak but with that bend which seems to give to the human face the clearest indication of individual will  his mouth for a man was perhaps a little too small but was admirably formed as had been the chin with a deep dimple on it which had now by the slow progress of many dinners become doubled in its folds  his hair had been chestnut but dark in its hue it had now become grey but still with the shade of the chestnut through it here and there  he stood five feet ten in height with small hands and feet  he was now perhaps somewhat stout but was still as upright on his horse as ever and as well able to ride to hounds for a few fields when by chance the hunt came in the way of bowick  such was the doctor  mrs wortle was a pretty little woman now over forty years of age of whom it was said that in her day she had been the beauty of windsor and those parts  mary wortle took mostly after her father being tall and comely having especially her fathers eyes but still they who had known mrs wortle as a girl declared that mary had inherited also her mothers peculiar softness and complexion  for many years past none of the pupils had been received within the parsonageunless when received there as guests which was of frequent occurrence  all belonging to the school was built outside the glebe land as a quite separate establishment with a door opening from the parsonage garden to the schoolyard  of this door the rule was that the doctor and the gardener should have the only two keys but the rule may be said to have become quite obsolete as the door was never locked  sometimes the bigger boys would come through unaskedperhaps in search of a game of lawntennis with miss wortle perhaps to ask some favour of mrs wortle who always was delighted to welcome them perhaps even to seek the doctor himself who never on such occasions would ask how it came to pass that they were on that side of the wall  sometimes mrs wortle would send her housekeeper through for some of the little boys  it would then be a good time for the little boys  but this would generally be during the doctors absence  here on the school side of the wall there was a separate establishment of servants and a separate kitchen  there was no sending backwards or forwards of food or of clothesunless it might be when some special delicacy was sent in if a boy were unwell  for these no extra charge was ever made as had been done in the case of young stantiloup  then a strange doctor had come and had ordered the wine and the carriage  there was no extra charge for the kindly glasses of wine which used to be administered in quite sufficient plenty  behind the school and running down to the little river pin there is a spacious cricketground and a court marked out for lawntennis  up close to the school is a racketcourt  no doubt a good deal was done to make the externals of the place alluring to those parents who love to think that their boys shall be made happy at school  attached to the school forming part of the building is a pleasant wellbuilt residence with six or eight rooms intended for the senior or classical assistantmaster it had been the doctors scheme to find a married gentleman to occupy this house whose wife should receive a separate salary for looking after the linen and acting as matron to the schooldoing what his wife did till he became successfulwhile the husband should be in orders and take part of the church duties as a second curate  but there had been a difficulty in this    chapter ii  the new usher  the doctor had found it difficult to carry out the scheme described in the last chapter  they indeed who know anything of such matters will be inclined to call it utopian and to say that one so wise in worldly matters as our schoolmaster should not have attempted to combine so many things  he wanted a gentleman a schoolmaster a curate a matron and a ladywe may say all in one  curates and ushers are generally unmarried an assistant schoolmaster is not often in orders and sometimes is not a gentleman  a gentleman when he is married does not often wish to dispose of the services of his wife  a lady when she has a husband has generally sufficient duties of her own to employ her without undertaking others  the scheme if realised would no doubt be excellent but the difficulties were too many  the stantiloups who lived about twenty miles off made fun of the doctor and his project and the bishop was said to have expressed himself as afraid that he would not be able to license as curate any one selected as usher to the school  one attempt was made after another in vainbut at last it was declared through the country far and wide that the doctor had succeeded in this as in every other enterprise that he had attempted  there had come a rev mr peacocke and his wife  six years since mr peacocke had been well known at oxford as a classic and had become a fellow of trinity  then he had taken orders and had some time afterwards married giving up his fellowship as a matter of course  mr peacocke while living at oxford had been well known to a large oxford circle but he had suddenly disappeared from that world and it had reached the ears of only a few of his more intimate friends that he had undertaken the duties of vicepresident of a classical college at saint louis in the state of missouri  such a disruption as this was for a time complete but after five years mr peacocke appeared again at oxford with a beautiful american wife and the necessity of earning an income by his erudition  it would at first have seemed very improbable that dr wortle should have taken into his school or into his parish a gentleman who had chosen the united states as a field for his classical labours  the doctor whose mind was by no means logical was a thoroughgoing tory of the old school and therefore considered himself bound to hate the name of a republic  he hated rolling stones and mr peacocke had certainly been a rolling stone he loved oxford with all his heart and some years since had been heard to say hard things of mr peacocke when that gentleman deserted his college for the sake of establishing himself across the atlantic  but he was one who thought that there should be a place of penitence allowed to those who had clearly repented of their errors and moreover when he heard that mr peacocke was endeavouring to establish himself in oxford as a coach for undergraduates and also that he was a married man without any encumbrance in the way of family there seemed to him to be an additional reason for pardoning that american escapade  circumstances brought the two men together  there were friends at oxford who knew how anxious the doctor was to carry out that plan of his in reference to an usher a curate and a matron and here were the very things combined  mr peacockes scholarship and power of teaching were acknowledged he was already in orders and it was declared that mrs peacocke was undoubtedly a lady  many inquiries were made  many meetings took place  many difficulties arose  but at last mr and mrs peacocke came to bowick and took up their abode in the school  all the doctors requirements were not at once fulfilled  mrs peacockes position was easily settled  mrs peacocke who seemed to be a woman possessed of sterling sense and great activity undertook her duties without difficulty  but mr peacocke would not at first consent to act as curate in the parish  he did however after a time perform a portion of the sunday services  when he first came to bowick he had declared that he would undertake no clerical duty  education was his profession and to that he meant to devote himself exclusively  nor for the six or eight months of his sojourn did he go back from this so that the doctor may be said even still to have failed in carrying out his purpose  but at last the new schoolmaster appeared in the pulpit of the parish church and preached a sermon  all that had passed in private conference between the doctor and his assistant on the subject need not here be related  mr peacockes aversion to do more than attend regularly at the church services as one of the parishioners had been very strong  the doctors anxiety to overcome his assistants reasoning had also been strong  there had no doubt been much said between them  mr peacocke had been true to his principles whatever those principles were in regard to his appointment as a curatebut it came to pass that he for some months preached regularly every sunday in the parish church to the full satisfaction of the parishioners  for this he had accepted no payment much to the doctors dissatisfaction  nevertheless it was certainly the case that they who served the doctor gratuitously never came by the worse of the bargain  mr peacocke was a small wiry man anything but robust in appearance but still capable of great bodily exertion  he was a great walker  labour in the school never seemed to fatigue him  the addition of a sermon to preach every week seemed to make no difference to his energies in the school  he was a constant reader and could pass from one kind of mental work to another without fatigue  the doctor was a noted scholar but it soon became manifest to the doctor himself and to the boys that mr peacocke was much deeper in scholarship than the doctor  though he was a poor man his own small classical library was supposed to be a repository of all that was known about latin and greek  in fact mr peacocke grew to be a marvel but of all the marvels about him the thing most marvellous was the entire faith which the doctor placed in him  certain changes even were made in the oldestablished curriculum of tuitionand were made as all the boys supposed by the advice of mr peacocke  mr peacocke was treated with a personal respect which almost seemed to imply that the two men were equal  this was supposed by the boys to come from the fact that both the doctor and the assistant had been fellows of their colleges at oxford but the parsons and other gentry around could see that there was more in it than that  mr peacocke had some power about him which was potent over the doctors spirit  mrs peacocke in her line succeeded almost as well  she was a woman something over thirty years of age when she first came to bowick in the very pride and bloom of womans beauty  her complexion was dark and brownso much so that it was impossible to describe her colour generally by any other word  but no clearer skin was ever given to a woman  her eyes were brown and her eyebrows black and perfectly regular  her hair was dark and very glossy and always dressed as simply as the nature of a womans head will allow  her features were regular but with a great show of strength  she was tall for a woman but without any of that look of length under which female altitude sometimes suffers she was strong and well made and apparently equal to any labour to which her position might subject her  when she had been at bowick about three months a boys leg had been broken and she had nursed him not only with assiduity but with great capacity  the boy was the youngest son of the marchioness of altamont and when lady altamont paid a second visit to bowick for the sake of taking her boy home as soon as he was fit to be moved her ladyship made a little mistake  with the sweetest and most caressing smile in the world she offered mrs peacocke a tenpound note my dear madam said mrs peacocke without the slightest reserve or difficulty it is so natural that you should do this because you cannot of course understand my position but it is altogether out of the question  the marchioness blushed and stammered and begged a hundred pardons  being a goodnatured woman she told the whole story to mrs wortle  i would just as soon have offered the money to the marchioness herself said mrs wortle as she told it to her husband  i would have done it a deal sooner said the doctor  i am not in the least afraid of lady altamont but i stand in awful dread of mrs peacocke  nevertheless mrs peacocke had done her work by the little lords bedside just as though she had been a paid nurse  and so she felt herself to be  nor was she in the least ashamed of her position in that respect  if there was aught of shame about her as some people said it certainly did not come from the fact that she was in the receipt of a salary for the performance of certain prescribed duties such remuneration was she thought as honourable as the doctors income but to her american intelligence the acceptance of a present of money from a marchioness would have been a degradation  it certainly was said of her by some persons that there must have been something in her former life of which she was ashamed  the honourable mrs stantiloup to whom all the affairs of bowick had been of consequence since her husband had lost his lawsuit and who had not only heard much but had inquired far and near about mr and mrs peacocke declared diligently among her friends with many nods and winks that there was something rotten in the state of denmark  she did at first somewhat imprudently endeavour to spread a rumour abroad that the doctor had become enslaved by the ladys beauty  but even those hostile to bowick could not accept this  the doctor certainly was not the man to put in jeopardy the respect of the world and his own standing for the beauty of any woman and moreover the doctor as we have said before was over fifty years of age  but there soon came up another ground on which calumny could found a story  it was certainly the case that mrs peacocke had never accepted any hospitality from mrs wortle or other ladies in the neighbourhood  it reached the ears of mrs stantiloup first that the ladies had called upon each other as ladies are wont to do who intend to cultivate a mutual personal acquaintance and then that mrs wortle had asked mrs peacocke to dinner  but mrs peacocke had refused not only that invitation but subsequent invitations to the less ceremonious form of teadrinking  all this had been true and it had been true alsothough of this mrs stantiloup had not heard the particularsthat mrs peacocke had explained to her neighbour that she did not intend to put herself on a visiting footing with any one  but why not my dear mrs wortle had said urged to the argument by precepts from her husband  why should you make yourself desolate here when we shall be so glad to have you  it is part of my life that it must be so mrs peacocke had answered  i am quite sure that the duties i have undertaken are becoming a lady but i do not think that they are becoming to one who either gives or accepts entertainments  there had been something of the same kind between the doctor and mr peacocke  why the mischief shouldnt you and your wife come and eat a bit of mutton and drink a glass of wine over at the rectory like any other decent people  i never believed that accusation against the doctor in regard to swearing but he was no doubt addicted to expletives in conversation and might perhaps have indulged in a strong word or two had he not been prevented by the sanctity of his orders  perhaps i ought to say replied mr peacocke because we are not like any other decent people  then he went on to explain his meaning  decent people he thought in regard to social intercourse are those who are able to give and take with ease among each other  he had fallen into a position in which neither he nor his wife could give anything and from which though some might be willing to accept him he would be accepted only as it were by special favour  bosh ejaculated the doctor  mr peacocke simply smiled  he said it might be bosh but that even were he inclined to relax his own views his wife would certainly not relax hers  so it came to pass that although the doctor and mr peacocke were really intimate and that something of absolute friendship sprang up between the two ladies when mr peacocke had already been more than twelve months in bowick neither had he nor mrs peacocke broken bread in the doctors house  and yet the friendship had become strong  an incident had happened early in the year which had served greatly to strengthen it  at the school there was a little boy just eleven years old the only son of a lady de lawle who had in early years been a dear friend to mrs wortle  lady de lawle was the widow of a baronet and the little boy was the heir to a large fortune  the mother had been most loath to part with her treasure friends uncles and trustees had declared that the old prescribed form of education for british aristocrats must be followeda tother school namely then eton and then oxford  no his mother might not go with him first to one and then to the other  such going and living with him would deprive his education of all the real salt  therefore bowick was chosen as the tother school because mrs wortle would be more like a mother to the poor desolate boy than any other lady  so it was arranged and the poor desolate boy became the happiest of the young pickles whom it was mrs wortles special province to spoil whenever she could get hold of them  now it happened that on one beautiful afternoon towards the end of april mrs wortle had taken young de lawle and another little boy with her over the footbridge which passed from the bottom of the parsonage garden to the glebemeadow which ran on the other side of a little river and with them had gone a great newfoundland dog who was on terms equally friendly with the inmates of the rectory and the school  where this bridge passed across the stream the gardens and the field were on the same level  but as the water ran down to the ground on which the schoolbuildings had been erected there arose a steep bank over a bend in the river or rather steep cliff for indeed it was almost perpendicular the force of the current as it turned at this spot having washed away the bank  in this way it had come to pass that there was a precipitous fall of about a dozen feet from the top of the little cliff into the water and that the water here as it eddied round the curve was black and deep so that the bigger boys were wont to swim in it arrangements for bathing having been made on the further or school side  there had sometimes been a question whether a rail should not be placed for protection along the top of this cliff but nothing of the kind had yet been done  the boys were not supposed to play in this field which was on the other side of the river and could only be reached by the bridge through the parsonage garden  on this day young de lawle and his friend and the dog rushed up the hill before mrs wortle and there began to romp as was their custom  mary wortle who was one of the party followed them enjoining the children to keep away from the cliff  for a while they did so but of course returned  once or twice they were recalled and scolded always asserting that the fault was altogether with neptune  it was neptune that knocked them down and always pushed them towards the river  perhaps it was neptune but be that as it might there came a moment very terrible to them all  the dog in one of his gyrations came violently against the little boy knocked him off his legs and pushed him over the edge  mrs wortle who had been making her way slowly up the hill saw the fall heard the splash and fell immediately to the ground  other eyes had also seen the accident  the doctor and mr peacocke were at the moment walking together in the playgrounds at the school side of the brook  when the boy fell they had paused in their walk and were standing the doctor with his back to the stream and the assistant with his face turned towards the cliff  a loud exclamation broke from his lips as he saw the fall but in a momentalmost before the doctor had realised the accident which had occurredhe was in the water and two minutes afterwards young de lawle drenched indeed frightened and out of breath but in nowise seriously hurt was out upon the bank and mr peacocke drenched also but equally safe was standing over him while the doctor on his knees was satisfying himself that his little charge had received no fatal injury  it need hardly be explained that such a termination as this to such an accident had greatly increased the good feeling with which mr peacocke was regarded by all the inhabitants of the school and rectory    chapter iii  the mystery  mr peacocke himself said that in this matter a great deal of fuss was made about nothing  perhaps it was so  he got a ducking but being a strong swimmer probably suffered no real danger  the boy rolling down three or four feet of bank had then fallen down six or eight feet into deep water  he might no doubt have been much hurt  he might have struck against a rock and have been killedin which case mr peacockes prowess would have been of no avail  but nothing of this kind happened little jack de lawle was put to bed in one of the rectory bedrooms and was comforted with sherrynegus and sweet jelly  for two days he rejoiced thoroughly in his accident being freed from school and subjected only to caresses  after that he rebelled having become tired of his bed  but by that time his mother had been most unnecessarily summoned  unless she was wanted to examine the forlorn condition of his clothes there was nothing that she could do  but she came and of course showered blessings on mr peacockes headwhile mrs wortle went through to the school and showered blessings on mrs peacocke  what would they have done had the peacockes not been there  you must let them have their way whether for good or bad the doctor said when his assistant complained rather of the blessingspointing out at any rate their absurdity  one man is damned for ever because in the conscientious exercise of his authority he gives a little boy a rap which happens to make a small temporary mark on his skin  another becomes a hero because when in the equally conscientious performance of a duty he gives himself a ducking  i wont think you a hero but of course i consider myself very fortunate to have had beside me a man younger than myself and quick and ready at such an emergence  of course i feel grateful but i shant bother you by telling you so  but this was not the end of it  lady de lawle declared that she could not be happy unless mr and mrs peacocke would bring jack home for the holidays to de lawle park  of course she carried her blessings up into mrs peacockes little drawingroom and became quite convinced as was mrs wortle that mrs peacocke was in all respects a lady  she heard of mr peacockes antecedents at oxford and expressed her opinion that they were charming people  she could not be happy unless they would promise to come to de lawle park for the holidays  then mrs peacocke had to explain that in her present circumstances she did not intend to visit anywhere she was very much flattered and delighted to think that the dear little boy was none the worse for his accident but there must be an end of it there was something in her manner as she said this which almost overawed lady de lawle  she made herself at any rate understood and no further attempt was made for the next six weeks to induce her or mr peacocke to enter the rectory diningroom  but a good deal was said about mr peacockegenerally in his favour  generally in his favourbecause he was a fine scholar and could swim well  his preaching perhaps did something for him but the swimming did more  but though there was so much said of good there was something also of evil  a man would not altogether refuse society for himself and his wife unless there were some cause for him to do so  he and she must have known themselves to be unfit to associate with such persons as they would have met at de lawle park  there was a mystery and the mystery when unravelled would no doubt prove to be very deleterious to the character of the persons concerned  mrs stantiloup was quite sure that such must be the case  it might be very well said mrs stantiloup for dr wortle to obtain the services of a welleducated usher for his school but it became quite another thing when he put a man up to preach in the church of whose life for five years no one knew anything  somebody had told her something as to the necessity of a bishops authority for the appointment of a curate but no one had strictly defined to her what a curate is  she was however quite ready to declare that mr peacocke had no business to preach in that pulpit and that something very disagreeable would come of it  nor was this feeling altogether confined to mrs stantiloup though it had perhaps originated with what she had said among her own friends  dont you think it well you should know something of his life during these five years  this had been said to the rector by the bishop himselfwho probably would have said nothing of the kind had not these reports reached his ears  but reports when they reach a certain magnitude and attain a certain importance require to be noticed  so much in this world depends upon character that attention has to be paid to bad character even when it is not deserved  in dealing with men and women we have to consider what they believe as well as what we believe ourselves  the utility of a sermon depends much on the idea that the audience has of the piety of the man who preaches it  though the words of god should never have come with greater power from the mouth of man they will come in vain if they be uttered by one who is known as a breaker of the commandmentsthey will come in vain from the mouth of one who is even suspected to be so  to all this when it was said to him by the bishop in the kindest manner dr wortle replied that such suspicions were monstrous unreasonable and uncharitable  he declared that they originated with that abominable virago mrs stantiloup  look round the diocese said the bishop in reply to this and see if you can find a single clergyman acting in it of the details of whose life for the last five years you know absolutely nothing  thereupon the doctor said that he would make inquiry of mr peacocke himself  it might well be he thought that mr peacocke would not like such inquiry but the doctor was quite sure that any story told to him would be true  on returning home he found it necessary or at any rate expedient to postpone his questions for a few days  it is not easy to ask a man what he has been doing with five years of his life when the question implies a belief that these five years have been passed badly  and it was understood that the questioning must in some sort apply to the mans wife  the doctor had once said to mrs wortle that he stood in awe of mrs peacocke  there had certainly come upon him an idea that she was a lady with whom it would not be easy to meddle  she was obedient diligent and minutely attentive to any wish that was expressed to her in regard to her duties but it had become manifest to the doctor that in all matters beyond the school she was independent and was by no means subject to external influences  she was not for instance very constant in her own attendance at church and never seemed to feel it necessary to apologise for her absence  the doctor in his many and familiar conversations with mr peacocke had not found himself able to allude to this and he had observed that the husband did not often speak of his own wife unless it were on matters having reference to the school  so it came to pass that he dreaded the conversation which he proposed to himself and postponed it from day to day with a cowardice which was quite unusual to him  and now o kindhearted reader i feel myself constrained in the telling of this little story to depart altogether from those principles of storytelling to which you probably have become accustomed and to put the horse of my romance before the cart  there is a mystery respecting mr and mrs peacocke which according to all laws recognised in such matters ought not to be elucidated till let us say the last chapter but two so that your interest should be maintained almost to the endso near the end that there should be left only space for those little arrangements which are necessary for the wellbeing or perhaps for the evilbeing of our personages  it is my purpose to disclose the mystery at once and to ask you to look for your interestshould you choose to go on with my chroniclesimply in the conduct of my persons during this disclosure to others  you are to know it all before the doctor or the bishopbefore mrs wortle or the hon mrs stantiloup or lady de lawle you are to know it all before the peacockes become aware that it must necessarily be disclosed to any one  it may be that when i shall have once told the mystery there will no longer be any room for interest in the tale to you  that there are many such readers of novels i know  i doubt whether the greater number be not such  i am far from saying that the kind of interest of which i am speakingand of which i intend to deprive myselfis not the most natural and the most efficacious  what would the black dwarf be if every one knew from the beginning that he was a rich man and a baronetor the pirate if all the truth about norna of the fitfulhead had been told in the first chapter  therefore put the book down if the revelation of some future secret be necessary for your enjoyment  our mystery is going to be revealed in the next paragraphin the next halfdozen words  mr and mrs peacocke were not man and wife  the story how it came to be so need not be very longnor will it as i think entail any great degree of odious criminality either upon the man or upon the woman  at st louis mrs peacocke had become acquainted with two brothers named lefroy who had come up from louisiana and had achieved for themselves characters which were by no means desirable  they were sons of a planter who had been rich in extent of acres and number of slaves before the war of the secession  general lefroy had been in those days a great man in his state had held command during the war and had been utterly ruined  when the war was over the two boysthen seventeen and sixteen years of agewere old enough to remember and to regret all that they had lost to hate the idea of abolition and to feel that the world had nothing left for them but what was to be got by opposition to the laws of the union which was now hateful to them  they were both handsome and in spite of the sufferings of their state an attempt had been made to educate them like gentlemen  but no career of honour had been open to them and they had fallen by degrees into dishonour dishonesty and brigandage  the elder of these when he was still little more than a stripling had married ella beaufort the daughter of another ruined planter in his state  she had been only sixteen when her father died and not seventeen when she married ferdinand lefroy  it was she who afterwards came to england under the name of mrs peacocke  mr peacocke was vicepresident of the college at missouri when he first saw her and when he first became acquainted with the two brothers each of whom was called colonel lefroy  then there arose a great scandal in the city as to the treatment which the wife received from her husband  he was about to go away south into mexico with the view of pushing his fortune there with certain desperadoes who were maintaining a perpetual war against the authorities of the united states on the borders of texas and he demanded that his wife should accompany him  this she refused to do and violence was used to force her  then it came to pass that certain persons in st louis interfered on her behalf and among these was the reverend mr peacocke the vicepresident of the college upon whose feelings the singular beauty and dignified demeanour of the woman no doubt had had much effect  the man failed to be powerful over his wife and then the two brothers went away together  the woman was left to provide for herself and mr peacocke was generous in the aid he gave to her in doing so  it may be understood that in this way an intimacy was created but it must not be understood that the intimacy was of such a nature as to be injurious to the fair fame of the lady  things went on in this way for two years during which mrs lefroys conduct drew down upon her reproaches from no one  then there came tidings that colonel lefroy had perished in making one of those raids in which the two brothers were continually concerned  but which colonel lefroy had perished  if it were the younger brother that would be nothing to mr peacocke  if it were the elder it would be everything  if ferdinand lefroy were dead he would not scruple at once to ask the woman to be his wife  that which the man had done and that which he had not done had been of such a nature as to solve all bonds of affection  she had already allowed herself to speak of the man as one whose life was a blight upon her own and though there had been no word of outspoken love from her lips to his ears he thought that he might succeed if it could be made certain that ferdinand lefroy was no longer among the living  i shall never know she said in her misery  what i do hear i shall never believe  how can one know anything as to what happens in a country such as that  then he took up his hat and staff and vicepresident professor and clergyman as he was started off for the mexican border  he did tell her that he was going but barely told her  its a thing that ought to be found out he said and i want a turn of travelling  i shall be away three months  she merely bade god bless him but said not a word to hinder or to encourage his going  he was gone just the three months which he had himself named and then returned elate with his news  he had seen the younger brother robert lefroy and had learnt from him that the elder ferdinand had certainly been killed  robert had been most ungracious to him having even on one occasion threatened his life but there had been no doubt that he robert was alive and that ferdinand had been killed by a party of united states soldiers  then the clergyman had his reward and was accepted by the widow with a full and happy heart  not only had her release been complete but so was her present joy and nothing seemed wanting to their happiness during the six first months after their union  then one day all of a sudden ferdinand lefroy was standing within her little drawingroom at the college of st louis  dead  certainly he was not dead  he did not believe that any one had said that he was dead  she might be lying or nothe did not care he peacocke certainly had liedso said the colonel  he did not believe that peacocke had ever seen his brother robert  robert was deadmust have been dead indeed before the date given for that interview  the woman was a bigamistthat is if any second marriage had ever been perpetrated  probably both had wilfully agreed to the falsehood  for himself he should resolve at once what steps he meant to take  then he departed it being at that moment after nine in the evening  in the morning he was gone again and from that moment they had never either heard of him or seen him  how was it to be with them  they could have almost brought themselves to think it a dream were it not that others besides themselves had seen the man and known that colonel ferdinand lefroy had been in st louis  then there came to him an idea that even she might disbelieve the words which he had spokenthat even she might think his story to have been false but to this she soon put an end  dearest she said i never knew a word that was true to come from his mouth or a word that was false from yours  should they part  there is no one who reads this but will say that they should have parted  every day passed together as man and wife must be a falsehood and a sin  there would be absolute misery for both in partingbut there is no law from god or man entitling a man to escape from misery at the expense of falsehood and sin  though their hearts might have burst in the doing of it they should have parted  though she would have been friendless alone and utterly despicable in the eyes of the world abandoning the name which she cherished as not her own and going back to that which she utterly abhorred still she should have done it  and he resolving as no doubt he would have done under any circumstances that he must quit the city of his adoptionhe should have left her with such material sustenance as her spirit would have enabled her to accept should have gone his widowed way and endured as best he might the idea that he had left the woman whom he loved behind in the desert all alone  that he had not done so the reader is aware  that he had lived a life of sinthat he and she had continued in one great falsehoodis manifest enough  mrs stantiloup when she hears it all will have her triumph  lady de lawles soft heart will rejoice because that invitation was not accepted  the bishop will be unutterably shocked but perhaps to the good man there will be some solace in the feeling that he had been right in his surmises  how the doctor bore it this story is intended to telland how also mr and mrs peacocke bore it when the sin and the falsehood were made known to all the world around them  the mystery has at any rate been told and they who feel that on this account all hope of interest is at an end had better put down the book    part ii  chapter iv  the doctor asks his question  the doctor instigated by the bishop had determined to ask some questions of mr peacocke as to his american life  the promise had been given at the palace and the doctor as he returned home repented himself in that he had made it  his lordship was a gossip as bad as an old woman as bad as mrs stantiloup and wanted to know things in which a man should feel no interest  so said the doctor to himself  what was it to him the bishop or to him the doctor what mr peacocke had been doing in america  the mans scholarship was patent his morals were unexceptional his capacity for preaching undoubted his peculiar fitness for his place at bowick unquestionable  who had a right to know more  that the man had been properly educated at oxford and properly ordained on entering his fellowship was doubted by no man  even if there had been some temporary backslidings in americawhich might be possible for which of us have not backslided at some time of our lifewhy should they be raked up there was an uncharitableness in such a proceeding altogether opposed to the doctors view of life  he hated severity  it may almost be said that he hated that state of perfection which would require no pardon  he was thoroughly human quite content with his own present position anticipating no millennium for the future of the world and probably in his heart looking forward to heaven as simply the better alternative when the happiness of this world should be at an end  he himself was in no respect a wicked man and yet a little wickedness was not distasteful to him  and he was angry with himself in that he had made such a promise  it had been a rule of life with him never to take advice  the bishop had his powers within which he as rector of bowick would certainly obey the bishop but it had been his theory to oppose his bishop almost more readily than any one else should the bishop attempt to exceed his power the bishop had done so in giving this advice and yet he had promised  he was angry with himself but did not on that account think that the promise should be evaded  oh no  having said that he would do it he would do it  and having said that he would do it the sooner that he did it the better  when three or four days had passed by he despised himself because he had not yet made for himself a fit occasion  it is such a mean sneaking thing to do he said to himself  but still it had to be done  it was on a saturday afternoon that he said this to himself as he returned back to the parsonage garden from the cricketground where he had left mr peacocke and the three other ushers playing cricket with ten or twelve of the bigger boys of the school  there was a french master a german master a master for arithmetic and mathematics with the adjacent sciences besides mr peacocke as assistant classical master  among them mr peacocke was facile princeps in rank and supposed ability but they were all admitted to the delights of the playground  mr peacocke in spite of those years of his spent in america where cricket could not have been familiar to him remembered well his old pastime and was quite an adept at the game  it was ten thousand pities that a man should be disturbed by unnecessary questionings who could not only teach and preach but play cricket also  but nevertheless it must be done  when therefore the doctor entered his own house he went into his study and wrote a short note to his assistant   my dear peacockecould you come over and see me in my study this evening for half an hour  i have a question or two which i wish to ask you  any hour you may name will suit me after eightyours most sincerely  jeffrey wortle   in answer to this there came a note to say that at halfpast eight mr peacocke would be with the doctor  at halfpast eight mr peacocke came  he had fancied on reading the doctors note that some further question would be raised as to money the doctor had declared that he could no longer accept gratuitous clerical service in the parish and had said that he must look out for some one else if mr peacocke could not oblige him by allowing his name to be referred in the usual way to the bishop  he had now determined to say in answer to this that the school gave him enough to do and that he would much prefer to give up the churchalthough he would always be happy to take a part occasionally if he should be wanted  the doctor had been sitting alone for the last quarter of an hour when his assistant entered the room and had spent the time in endeavouring to arrange the conversation that should follow  he had come at last to a conclusion  he would let mr peacocke know exactly what had passed between himself and the bishop and would then leave it to his usher either to tell his own story as to his past life or to abstain from telling it  he had promised to ask the question and he would ask it but he would let the man judge for himself whether any answer ought to be given  the bishop has been bothering me about you peacocke he said standing up with his back to the fireplace as soon as the other man had shut the door behind him  the doctors face was always expressive of his inward feelings and at this moment showed very plainly that his sympathies were not with the bishop  im sorry that his lordship should have troubled himself said the other as i certainly do not intend to take any part in his diocese  well sink that for the present said the doctor  i wont let that be mixed up with what i have got to say just now  you have taken a certain part in the diocese already very much to my satisfaction  i hope it may be continued but i wont bother about that now  as far as i can see you are just the man that would suit me as a colleague in the parish  mr peacocke bowed but remained silent  the fact is continued the doctor that certain old women have got hold of the bishop and made him feel that he ought to answer their objections  that mrs stantiloup has a tongue as loud as the towncriers bell  but what has mrs stantiloup to say about me  nothing except in so far as she can hit me through you  and what does the bishop say  he thinks that i ought to know something of your life during those five years you were in america  i think so also said mr peacocke  i dont want to know anything for myself  as far as i am concerned i am quite satisfied  i know where you were educated how you were ordained and i can feel sure from your present efficiency that you cannot have wasted your time  if you tell me that you do not wish to say anything i shall be contented and i shall tell the bishop that as far as i am concerned there must be an end of it  and what will he do asked mr peacocke  well as far as the curacy is concerned of course he can refuse his licence  i have not the slightest intention of applying to his lordship for a licence  this the usher said with a tone of selfassertion which grated a little on the doctors ear in spite of his goodhumour towards the speaker  i dont want to go into that he said  a man never can say what his intentions may be six months hence  but if i were to refuse to speak of my life in america said mr peacocke and thus to decline to comply with what i must confess would be no more than a rational requirement on your part how then would it be with myself and my wife in regard to the school  it would make no difference whatever said the doctor  there is a story to tell said mr peacocke very slowly  i am sure that it cannot be to your disgrace  i do not say that it isnor do i say that it is not  there may be circumstances in which a man may hardly know whether he has done right or wrong  but this i do knowthat had i done otherwise i should have despised myself  i could not have done otherwise and have lived  there is no man in the world said the doctor earnestly less anxious to pry into the secrets of others than i am  i take things as i find them  if the cook sends me up a good dish i dont care to know how she made it  if i read a good book i am not the less gratified because there may have been something amiss with the author  you would doubt his teaching said mr peacocke who had gone astray himself  then i must doubt all human teaching for all men have gone astray  you had better hold your tongue about the past and let me tell those who ask unnecessary questions to mind their own business  it is very odd doctor said mr peacocke that all this should have come from you just now  why odd just now  because i had been turning it in my mind for the last fortnight whether i ought not to ask you as a favour to listen to the story of my life  that i must do so before i could formally accept the curacy i had determined but that only brought me to the resolution of refusing the office  i thinki think that irrespective of the curacy it ought to be told but i have not quite made up my mind  do not suppose that i am pressing you  oh no nor would your pressing me influence me  much as i owe to your undeserved kindness and forbearance i am bound to say that  nothing can influence me in the least in such a matter but the wellbeing of my wife and my own sense of duty  and it is a matter in which i can unfortunately take counsel from no one  she and she alone besides myself knows the circumstances and she is so forgetful of herself that i can hardly ask her for an opinion  the doctor by this time had no doubt become curious  there was a something mysterious with which he would like to become acquainted  he was by no means a philosopher superior to the ordinary curiosity of mankind  but he was manly and even at this moment remembered his former assurances  of course said he i cannot in the least guess what all this is about  for myself i hate secrets  i havent a secret in the world  i know nothing of myself which you mightnt know too for all that i cared  but that is my good fortune rather than my merit  it might well have been with me as it is with you but as a rule i think that where there is a secret it had better be kept  no one at any rate should allow it to be wormed out of him by the impertinent assiduity of others if there be anything affecting your wife which you do not wish all the world on this side of the water to know do not tell it to any one on this side of the water  there is something affecting my wife that i do not wish all the world to know  then tell it to no one said dr wortle authoritatively  i will tell you what i will do said mr peacocke i will take a week to think of it and then i will let you know whether i will tell it or whether i will not and if i tell it i will let you know also how far i shall expect you to keep my secret and how far to reveal it  i think the bishop will be entitled to know nothing about me unless i ask to be recognised as one of the clergy of his diocese  certainly not certainly not said the doctor  and then the interview was at an end  mr peacocke when he went away from the rectory did not at once return to his own house but went off for a walk alone  it was now nearly midsummer and there was broad daylight till ten oclock  it was after nine when he left the doctors but still there was time for a walk which he knew well through the fields which would take him round by bowick wood and home by a path across the squires park and by the church  an hour would do it and he wanted an hour to collect his thoughts before he should see his wife and discuss with her as he would be bound to do all that had passed between him and the doctor  he had said that he could not ask her advice  in this there had been much of truth  but he knew also that he would do nothing as to which he had not received at any rate her assent  she for his sake would have annihilated herself had that been possible  again and again since that horrible apparition had showed itself in her room at st louis she had begged that she might leave himnot on her own behalf not from any dread of the crime that she was committing not from shame in regard to herself should her secret be found out but because she felt herself to be an impediment to his career in the world  as to herself she had no pricks of conscience  she had been true to the manbrutal abominable as he had been to heruntil she had in truth been made to believe that he was dead and even when he had certainly been alivefor she had seen himhe had only again seen her again to desert her  duty to him she could owe never  there was no sting of conscience with her in that direction  but to the other man she owed as she thought everything that could be due from a woman to a man  he had come within her ken and had loved her without speaking of his love he had seen her condition and had sympathised with her fully  he had gone out with his life in his handhe a clergyman a quiet man of lettersto ascertain whether she was free and finding her as he believed to be free he had returned to take her to his heart and to give her all that happiness which other women enjoy but which she had hitherto only seen from a distance  then the blow had come  it was necessary it was natural that she should be ruined by such a blow circumstances had ruined her  that fate had betaken her which so often falls upon a woman who trusts herself and her life to a man  but why should he fall also with her fall  there was still a career before him he might be useful he might be successful he might be admired everything might still be open to himexcept the love of another woman as to that she did not doubt his truth  why should he be doomed to drag her with him as a log tied to his foot seeing that a woman with a misfortune is condemned by the general voice of the world whereas for a man to have stumbled is considered hardly more than a matter of course she would consent to take from him the means of buying her bread but it would be bettershe had saidthat she should eat it on her side of the water while he might earn it on the other  we know what had come of these arguments  he had hitherto never left her for a moment since that man had again appeared before their eyes  he had been strong in his resolution  if it were a crime then he would be a criminal  if it were a falsehood then would he be a liar  as to the sin there had no doubt been some divergence of opinion between him and her  the teaching that he had undergone in his youth had been that with which we here are all more or less acquainted and that had been strengthened in him by the fact of his having become a clergyman  she had felt herself more at liberty to proclaim to herself a gospel of her own for the guidance of her own soul  to herself she had never seemed to be vicious or impure but she understood well that he was not equally free from the bonds which religion had imposed upon him  for his sakefor his sake it would be better that she should be away from him  all this was known to him accurately and all this had to be considered by him as he walked across the squires park in the gloaming of the evening no doubthe now said to himselfthe doctor should have been made acquainted with his condition before he or she had taken their place at the school  reticence under such circumstances had been a lie  against his conscience there had been many pricks  living in his present condition he certainly should not have gone up into that pulpit to preach the word of god  though he had been silent he had known that the evil and the deceit would work round upon him  but now what should he do there was only one thing on which he was altogether decidednothing should separate them  as he had said so often before he said again nowif there be sin let it be sin  but this was clear to himwere he to give dr wortle a true history of what had happened to him in america then must he certainly leave bowick  and this was equally certain that before telling his tale he must make known his purpose to his wife  but as he entered his own house he had determined that he would tell the doctor everything    chapter v  then we must go  i thought you were never going to have done with that old jupiter said mrs peacocke as she began at that late hour of the evening to make tea for herself and her husband  why have you waited for me  because i like company  did you ever know me go to tea without you when there was a chance of your coming  what has jupiter been talking about all this time  jupiter has not been talking all this time  jupiter talked only for half an hour  jupiter is a very good fellow  i always thought so  otherwise i should never have consented to have been one of his satellites or have been contented to see you doing chief moon  but you have been with him an hour and a half  since i left him i have walked all round by bowick lodge  i had something to think of before i could talk to yousomething to decide upon indeed before i could return to the house  what have you decided she asked  her voice was altogether changed though she was seated in her chair and had hardly moved her appearance and her carriage of herself were changed  she still held the cup in her hand which she had been about to fill but her face was turned towards his and her large brown speaking eyes were fixed upon him  let me have my tea he said and then i will tell you  while he drank his tea she remained quite quiet not touching her own but waiting patiently till it should suit him to speak  ella he said i must tell it all to dr wortle  why dearest  as he did not answer at once she went on with her question  why now more than before  nay it is not now more than before  as we have let the before go by we can only do it now  but why at all dear  has the argument which was strong when we came lost any of its force  it should have had no force  we should not have taken the mans good things and have subjected him to the injury which may come to him by our bad name  have we not given him good things in return  not the good things which he had a right to expectnot that respectability which is all the world to such an establishment as this  let me go she said rising from her chair and almost shrieking  nay ella nay if you and i cannot talk as though we were one flesh almost with one soul between us as though that which is done by one is done by both whether for weal or woeif you and i cannot feel ourselves to be in a boat together either for swimming or for sinking then i think that no two persons on this earth ever can be bound together after that fashion  whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge  the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me then she rose from her chair and flinging herself on her knees at his feet buried her face in his lap  ella he said the only injury you can do me is to speak of leaving me  and it is an injury which is surely unnecessary because you cannot carry it beyond words  now if you will sit up and listen to me i will tell you what passed between me and the doctor  then she raised herself from the ground and took her seat at the teatable and listened patiently as he began his tale  they have been talking about us here in the county  who has found it necessary to talk about one so obscure as i  what does it matter who they might be  the doctor in his kindly wrathfor he is very wrothmentions this name and the other  what does it matter  obscurity itself becomes mystery and mystery of course produces curiosity  it was bound to be so  it is not they who are in fault but we  if you are different from others of course you will be inquired into  am i so different  yesdifferent in not eating the doctors dinners when they are offered to you different in not accepting lady de lawles hospitality different in contenting yourself simply with your duties and your husband  of course we are different  how could we not be different  and as we are different so of course there will be questions and wonderings and that sifting and searching which always at last finds out the facts  the bishop says that he knows nothing of my american life  why should he want to know anything  because i have been preaching in one of his churches  it is naturalnatural that the mothers of the boys should want to know something  the doctor says that he hates secrets  so do i  oh my dearest  a secret is always accompanied by more or less of fear and produces more or less of cowardice  but it can no more be avoided than a sore on the flesh or a broken bone  who would not go about with all his affairs such as the world might know if it were possible  but there come gangrenes in the heart or perhaps in the pocket  wounds come undeserved wounds as those did to you my darling but wounds which may not be laid bare to all eyes  who has a secret because he chooses it  but the bishop  wellyes the bishop  the bishop has told the doctor to examine me and the doctor has done it  i give him the credit of saying that the task has been most distasteful to him  i do him the justice of acknowledging that he has backed out of the work he had undertaken  he has asked the question but has said in the same breath that i need not answer it unless i like  and you  you have not answered it yet  no i have answered nothing as yet  but i have i think made up my mind that the question must be answered  that everything should be told  everythingto him  my idea is to tell everything to him and to leave it to him to decide what should be done  should he refuse to repeat the story any further and then bid us go away from bowick i should think that his conduct had been altogether straightforward and not uncharitable  and youwhat would you do then  i should go  what else  but whither  ah on that we must decide  he would be friendly with me  though he might think it necessary that i should leave bowick he would not turn against me violently  he could do nothing  i think he would assist me rather  he would help me perhaps to find some place where i might still earn my bread by such skill as i possesswhere i could do so without dragging in aught of my domestic life as i have been forced to do here  i have been a curse to you exclaimed the unhappy wife  my dearest blessing he said  that which you call a curse has come from circumstances which are common to both of us  there need be no more said about it  that man has been a source of terrible trouble to us  the trouble must be discussed from time to time but the necessity of enduring it may be taken for granted  i cannot be a philosopher such as you are she said  there is no escape from it  the philosophy is forced upon us  when an evil thing is necessary there remains only the consideration how it may be best borne  you must tell him then  i think so  i have a week to consider of it but i think so  though he is very kind at this moment in giving me the option and means what he says in declaring that i shall remain even though i tell him nothing yet his mind would become uneasy and he would gradually become discontented think how great is his stake in the school  how would he feel towards me were its success to be gradually diminished because he kept a master here of whom people believed some unknown evil  there has been no sign of any such falling off  there has been no time for it  it is only now that people are beginning to talk  had nothing of the kind been said had this bishop asked no questions had we been regarded as people simply obscure to whom no mystery attached itself the thing might have gone on but as it is i am bound to tell him the truth  then we must go  probably  at once  when it has been so decided the sooner the better  how could we endure to remain here when our going shall be desired  oh no  we must flit and again seek some other home  though he should keep our secretand i believe he will if he be askedit will be known that there is a secret and a secret of such a nature that its circumstances have driven us hence  if i could get literary work in london perhaps we might live there  but howhow would you set about it  the truth is dearest that for work such as yours you should either have no wife at all or else a wife of whom you need not be ashamed to speak the whole truth before the world  what is the use of it he said rising from his chair as in anger  why go back to all that which should be settled between us as fixed by fate each of us has given to the other all that each has to give and the partnership is complete  as far as that is concerned i at any rate am contented  ah my darling she exclaimed throwing her arms round his neck  let there be an end to distinctions and differences which between you and me can have no effect but to increase our troubles  you are a woman and i am a man and therefore no doubt your name when brought in question is more subject to remark than mineas is my name being that of a clergyman more subject to remark than that of one not belonging to a sacred profession  but not on that account do i wish to unfrock myself nor certainly on that account do i wish to be deprived of my wife  for good or bad it has to be endured together and expressions of regret as to that which is unavoidable only aggravate our trouble  after that he seated himself and took up a book as though he were able at once to carry off his mind to other matters  she probably knew that he could not do so but she sat silent by him for a while till he bade her take herself to bed promising that he would follow without delay  for three days nothing further was said between them on the subject nor was any allusion made to it between the doctor and his assistant  the school went on the same as ever and the intercourse between the two men was unaltered as to its general mutual courtesy  but there did undoubtedly grow in the doctors mind a certain feverish feeling of insecurity  at any rate he knew this that there was a mystery that there was something about the peacockessomething referring especially to mrs peacockewhich if generally known would be held to be deleterious to their character  so much he could not help deducing from what the man had already told him  no doubt he had undertaken in his generosity that although the man should decline to tell his secret no alteration should be made as to the school arrangements but he became conscious that in so promising he had in some degree jeopardised the wellbeing of the school  he began to whisper to himself that persons in such a position as that filled by this mr peacocke and his wife should not be subject to peculiar remarks from illnatured tongues  a weapon was afforded by such a mystery to the stantiloups of the world which the stantiloups would be sure to use with all their virulence  to such an establishment as his school respectability was everything  credit he said to himself is a matter so subtle in its essence that as it may be obtained almost without reason so without reason may it be made to melt away  much as he liked mr peacocke much as he approved of him much as there was in the man of manliness and worth which was absolutely dear to himstill he was not willing to put the character of his school in peril for the sake of mr peacocke  were he to do so he would be neglecting a duty much more sacred than any he could owe to mr peacocke  it was thus that during these three days he conversed with himself on the subject although he was able to maintain outwardly the same manner and the same countenance as though all things were going well between them  when they parted after the interview in the study the doctor no doubt had so expressed himself as rather to dissuade his usher from telling his secret than to encourage him to do so  he had been free in declaring that the telling of the secret should make no difference in his assistants position at bowick  but in all that he had acted from his habitual impulse  he had since told himself that the mystery ought to be disclosed  it was not right that his boys should be left to the charge of one who however competent dared not speak of his own antecedents  it was thus he thought of the matter after consideration  he must wait of course till the week should be over before he made up his mind to anything further  so peacocke isnt going to take the curacy  this was said to the doctor by mr pearson the squire in the course of those two or three days of which we are speaking  mr pearson was an old gentleman who did not live often at bowick being compelled as he always said by his health to spend the winter and spring of every year in italy and the summer months by his family in london  in truth he did not much care for bowick but had always been on good terms with the doctor and had never opposed the school  mr pearson had been good also as to church mattersas far as goodness can be shown by generosityand had interested himself about the curates  so it had come to pass that the doctor did not wish to snub his neighbour when the question was asked  i rather think not said the doctor  i fear i shall have to look out for some one else  he did not prolong the conversation for though he wished to be civil he did not wish to be communicative  mr pearson had shown his parochial solicitude and did not trouble himself with further questions  so mr peacocke isnt going to take the curacy  this the very same question in the very same words was put to the doctor on the next morning by the vicar of the next parish  the rev mr puddicombe a clergyman without a flaw who did his duty excellently in every station of life was one who would preach a sermon or take a whole service for a brother parson in distress and never think of reckoning up that return sermons or return services were due to himone who gave dinners too and had pretty daughtersbut still our doctor did not quite like him  he was a little too pious and perhaps given to ask questions  so mr peacocke isnt going to take the curacy  there was a certain animation about the asking of this question by mr puddicombe very different from mr pearsons listless manner  it was clear to the doctor that mr puddicombe wanted to know  it seemed to the doctor that something of condemnation was implied in the tone of the question not only against mr peacocke but against himself also for having employed mr peacocke  upon my word i cant tell you he said rather crossly  i thought that it had been all settled  i heard that it was decided  then you have heard more than i have  it was the bishop told me  now it certainly was the case that in that fatal conversation which had induced the doctor to interrogate mr peacocke about his past life the doctor himself had said that he intended to look out for another curate he probably did not remember that at the moment  i wish the bishop would confine himself to asserting things that he knows said the doctor angrily  i am sure the bishop intends to do so said mr puddicombe very gravely  but i apologise  i had not intended to touch a subject on which there may perhaps be some reserve  i was only going to tell you of an excellent young man of whom i have heard  but good morning  then mr puddicombe withdrew    chapter vi  lord carstairs  during the last six months mr peacockes most intimate friend at bowick excepting of course his wife had been one of the pupils at the school the lad was one of the pupils but could not be said to be one of the boys  he was the young lord carstairs eldest son of earl bracy  he had been sent to bowick now six years ago with the usual purpose of progressing from bowick to eton  and from bowick to eton he had gone in due course  but there things had not gone well with the young lord some school disturbance had taken place when he had been there about a year and a half in which he was or was supposed to have been a ringleader  it was thought necessary for the preservation of the discipline of the school that a victim should be madeand it was perhaps thought well in order that the impartiality of the school might be made manifest that the victim should be a lord  earl bracy was therefore asked to withdraw his son and young lord carstairs at the age of seventeen was left to seek his education where he could  it had been and still was the earls purpose to send his son to oxford but there was now an interval of two years before that could be accomplished  during one year he was sent abroad to travel with a tutor and was then reported to have been all that a wellconducted lad ought to be  he was declared to be quite worthy of all that oxford would do for him  it was even suggested that eton had done badly for herself in throwing off from her such a young nobleman  but though lord carstairs had done well with his french and german on the continent it would certainly be necessary that he should rub up his greek and latin before he went to christ church then a request was made to the doctor to take him in at bowick in some sort as a private pupil  after some demurring the doctor consented  it was not his wont to run counter to earls who treated him with respect and deference  earl bracy had in a special manner been his friend and lord carstairs himself had been a great favourite at bowick  when that expulsion from eton had come about the doctor had interested himself and had declared that a very scant measure of justice had been shown to the young lord  he was thus in a measure compelled to accede to the request made to him and lord carstairs was received back at bowick not without hesitation but with a full measure of affectionate welcome  his bedroom was in the parsonagehouse and his dinner he took with the doctors family  in other respects he lived among the boys  will it not be bad for mary mrs wortle had said anxiously to her husband when the matter was first discussed  why should it be bad for mary  oh i dont knowbut young people together you know  mightnt it be dangerous  he is a boy and she is a mere child  they are both children  it will be a trouble but i do not think it will be at all dangerous in that way and so it was decided  mrs wortle did not at all agree as to their both being children  she thought that her girl was far from being a child but she had argued the matter quite as much as she ever argued anything with the doctor  so the matter was arranged and young lord carstairs came back to bowick  as far as the doctor could see nothing could be nicer than his young pupils manners  he was not at all above playing with the other boys  he took very kindly to his old studies and his old haunts and of an evening after dinner went away from the drawingroom to the study in pursuit of his latin and his greek without any precocious attempt at making conversation with miss wortle  no doubt there was a good deal of lawntennis of an afternoon and the lawntennis was generally played in the rectory garden  but then this had ever been the case and the lawntennis was always played with two on a side there were no têteàtête games between his lordship and mary and whenever the game was going on mrs wortle was always there to see fairplay  among other amusements the young lord took to walking far afield with mr peacocke and then no doubt many things were said about that life in america when a man has been much abroad and has passed his time there under unusual circumstances his doings will necessarily become subjects of conversation to his companions  to have travelled in france germany or in italy is not uncommon nor is it uncommon to have lived a year or years in florence or in rome  it is not uncommon now to have travelled all through the united states  the rocky mountains or peru are hardly uncommon so much has the taste for travelling increased  but for an oxford fellow of a college and a clergyman of the church of england to have established himself as a professor in missouri is uncommon and it could hardly be but that lord carstairs should ask questions respecting that faraway life  mr peacocke had no objection to such questions  he told his young friend much about the manners of the people of st louistold him how far the people had progressed in classical literature in what they fell behind and in what they excelled youths of their own age in england and how far the college was a success  then he described his own lifeboth before and after his marriage  he had liked the people of st louis well enoughbut not quite well enough to wish to live among them  no doubt their habits were very different from those of englishmen  he could however have been happy enough thereonly that circumstances arose  did mrs peacocke like the place the young lord asked one day  she is an american you know  oh yes i have heard  but did she come from st louis  no her father was a planter in louisiana not far from new orleans before the abolition of slavery  did she like st louis  well enough i think when we were first married  she had been married before you know  she was a widow  did she like coming to england among strangers  she was glad to leave st louis  things happened there which made her life unhappy  it was on that account i came here and gave up a position higher and more lucrative than i shall ever now get in england  i should have thought you might have had a school of your own said the lad  you know so much and get on so well with boys  i should have thought you might have been tutor at a college  to have a school of my own would take money said he which i have not got  to be tutor at a college would take but never mind  i am very well where i am and have nothing to complain of  he had been going to say that to be tutor of a college he would want high standing  and then he would have been forced to explain that he had lost at his own college that standing which he had once possessed  yes he said on another occasion she is unhappy but do not ask her any questions about it  whoi  oh dear no  i should not think of taking such a liberty  it would be as a kindness not as a liberty  but still do not speak to her about it  there are sorrows which must be hidden which it is better to endeavour to bury by never speaking of them by not thinking of them if that were possible  is it as bad as that the lad asked  it is bad enough sometimes  but never mind  you remember that roman wisdomdabit deus his quoque finem and i think that all things are bearable if a man will only make up his mind to bear them  do not tell any one that i have complained  whoi  oh never  not that i have said anything which all the world might not know but that it is unmanly to complain  indeed i do not complain only i wish that things were lighter to her  then he went off to other matters but his heart was yearning to tell everything to this young lad  before the end of the week had arrived there came a letter to him which he had not at all expected and a letter also to the doctorboth from lord bracy  the letter to mr peacocke was as follows   my dear siri have been much gratified by what i have heard both from dr wortle and my son as to his progress  he will have to come home in july when the doctors school is broken up and as you are probably aware will go up to oxford in october  i think it would be very expedient that he should not altogether lose the holidays and i am aware how much more he would do with adequate assistance than without it  the meaning of all this is that i and lady bracy will feel very much obliged if you and mrs peacocke will come and spend your holidays with us at carstairs  i have written to dr wortle on the subject partly to tell him of my proposal because he has been so kind to my son and partly to ask him to fix the amount of remuneration should you be so kind as to accede to my request  his mother has heard on more than one occasion from her son how very goodnatured you have been to himyours faithfully  bracy   it was of course quite out of the question  mr peacocke as soon as he had read the letter felt that it was so  had things been smooth and easy with him nothing would have delighted him more  his liking for the lad was most sincere and it would have been a real pleasure to him to have worked with him during the holidays  but it was quite out of the question  he must tell lord carstairs that it was so and must at the moment give such explanation as might occur to him  he almost felt that in giving that explanation he would be tempted to tell his whole story  but the doctor met him before he had an opportunity of speaking to lord carstairs  the doctor met him and at once produced the earls letter i have heard from lord bracy and you i suppose have had a letter too said the doctor  his manner was easy and kind as though no disagreeable communication was due to be made on the following day  yes said mr peacocke  i have had a letter  well  his lordship has asked me to go to carstairs for the holidays but it is out of the question  it would do carstairs all the good in the world said the doctor and i do not see why you should not have a pleasant visit and earn twentyfive pounds at the same time  it is quite out of the question  i suppose you would not like to leave mrs peacocke said the doctor  either to leave her or to take her  to go myself under any circumstances would be altogether out of the question  i shall come to you tomorrow doctor as i said i would last saturday  what hour will suit you  then the doctor named an hour in the afternoon and knew that the revelation was to be made to him  he felt too that that revelation would lead to the final departure of mr and mrs peacocke from bowick and he was unhappy in his heart  though he was anxious for his school he was anxious also for his friend  there was a gratification in the feeling that lord bracy thought so much of his assistantor would have been but for this wretched mystery  no said mr peacocke to the lad  i regret to say that i cannot go  i will tell you why perhaps another time but not now  i have written to your father by this post because it is right that he should be told at once  i have been obliged to say that it is impossible  i am so sorry  i should so much have liked it  my father would have done everything to make you comfortable and so would mamma  in answer to all this mr peacocke could only say that it was impossible  this happened on friday afternoon friday being a day on which the school was always very busy  there was no time for the doing of anything special as there would be on the following day which was a halfholiday  at night when the work was altogether over he showed the letter to his wife and told her what he had decided  couldnt you have gone without me she asked  how can i do that he said when before this time tomorrow i shall have told everything to dr wortle  after that he would not let me go he would do no more than his duty in telling me that if i proposed to go he must make it all known to lord bracy  but this is a trifle  i am at the present moment altogether in the dark as to what i shall do with myself when tomorrow evening comes  i cannot guess because it is so hard to know what are the feelings in the breast of another man  it may so well be that he should refuse me permission to go to my desk in the school again  will he be hard like that  i can hardly tell myself whether it would be hard  i hardly know what i should feel it my duty to do in such a position myself  i have deceived him  no she exclaimed  yes i have deceived him  coming to him as i did i gave him to understand that there was nothing wrongnothing to which special objection could be made in my position  then we are deceiving all the world in calling ourselves man and wife  certainly we are but to that we had made up our mind  we are not injuring all the world  no doubt it is a liebut there are circumstances in which a lie can hardly be a sin  i would have been the last to say so before all this had come upon me but i feel it to be so now  it is a lie to say that you are my wife  is it  is it  is it not  and yet i would rather cut my tongue out than say otherwise to give you my name is a liebut what should i think of myself were i to allow you to use any other  what would you have thought if i had asked you to go away and leave me when that bad hour came upon us  i would have borne it  i could not have borne it  there are worse things than a lie  i have found since this came upon us that it may be well to choose one sin in order that another may be shunned  to cherish you to comfort you to make the storm less sharp to youthat has already been my duty as well as my pleasure  to do the same to me is your duty  and my pleasure and my pleasuremy only pleasure  we must cling to each other let the world call us what names it may but there may come a time in which one is called on to do a special act of justice to others  it has come now to me  from the world at large i am prepared if possible to keep my secret even though i do it by lyingbut to this one man i am driven to tell it because i may not return his friendship by doing him an evil  morning school at this time of the year at bowick began at halfpast seven  there was an hour of school before breakfast at which the doctor did not himself put in an appearance  he was wont to tell the boys that he had done all that when he was young and that now in his old age it suited him best to have his breakfast before he began the work of the day mr peacocke of course attended the morning school  indeed as the matutinal performances were altogether classical it was impossible that much should be done without him  on this saturday morning however he was not present and a few minutes after the proper time the mathematical master took his place  i saw him coming across out of his own door little jack talbot said to the younger of the two clifford boys and there was a man coming up from the gate who met him  what sort of a man asked clifford  he was a rummylooking fellow with a great beard and a queer kind of coat  i never saw any one like him before  and where did they go  they stood talking for a minute or two just before the front door and then mr peacocke took him into the house  i heard him tell carstairs to go through and send word up to the doctor that he wouldnt be in school this morning  it had all happened just as young talbot had said  a very rummylooking fellow had at that early hour been driven over from broughton to bowick and had caught mr peacocke just as he was going into the school  he was a man with a beard loose flowing on both sides as though he were winged like a birda beard that had been black but was now streaked through and through with grey hairs  the man had a coat with frogged buttons that must have been intended to have a military air when it was new but which was now much the worse for wear  the coat was so odd as to have caught young talbots attention at once  and the mans hat was old and seedy but there was a look about him as though he were by no means ashamed either of himself or of his present purpose  he came in a gig said talbot to his friend for i saw the horse standing at the gate and the man sitting in the gig  you remember me no doubt the stranger said when he encountered mr peacocke  i do not remember you in the least the schoolmaster answered  come come that wont do  you know me well enough  im robert lefroy  then mr peacocke looking at him again knew that the man was the brother of his wifes husband  he had not seen him often but he recognised him as robert lefroy and having recognised him he took him into the house    part iii  chapter vii  robert lefroy  ferdinand lefroy the man who had in truth been the womans husband had during that one interview which had taken place between him and the man who had married his wife on his return to st louis declared that his brother robert was dead  but so had robert when peacocke encountered him down at texas declared that ferdinand was dead  peacocke knew that no word of truth could be expected from the mouths of either of them  but seeing is believing  he had seen ferdinand alive at st louis after his marriage and by seeing him had been driven away from his home back to his old country  now he also saw this other man and was aware that his secret was no longer in his own keeping  yes i know you now  why when i saw you last did you tell me that your brother was dead  why did you bring so great an injury on your sisterinlaw  i never told you anything of the kind  as god is above us you told me so  i dont know anything about that my friend  maybe i was cut  i used to be drinking a good deal them days  maybe i didnt say anything of the kindonly it suited you to go back and tell her so  anyways i disremember it altogether  anyways he wasnt dead  and i aint dead now  i can see that  and i aint drunk now  but i am not quite so well off as a fellow would wish to be  can you get me breakfast  yes i can get you breakfast he said after pausing for a while  then he rang the bell and told the girl to bring some breakfast for the gentleman as soon as possible into the room in which they were sitting this was in a little library in which he was in the habit of studying and going through lessons with the boys  he had brought the man here so that his wife might not come across him  as soon as the order was given he ran upstairs to her room to save her from coming down  a manwhat man she asked  robert lefroy  i must go to him at once  bear yourself well and boldly my darling  it is he certainly  i know nothing yet of what he may have to say but it will be well that you should avoid him if possible  when i have heard anything i will tell you all  then he hurried down and found the man examining the bookshelves  you have got yourself up pretty tidy again peacocke said lefroy  pretty well  the old game i suppose  teaching the young idea  is this what you call a college now in your country  it is a school  and youre one of the masters  i am the second master  it aint as good i reckon as the missouri college  its not so large certainly  whats the screw he said  the payment you mean  it can hardly serve us now to go into matters such as that  what is it that has brought you here lefroy  well a big ship an uncommonly bad sort of railway car and the ricketiest little buggy that ever a man trusted his life to  thems whats brought me here  i suppose you have something to say or you would not have come said peacocke  yes ive a good deal to say of one kind or another  but heres the breakfast and im wellnigh starved  what cold meat  im darned if i can eat cold meat  havent you got anything hot my dear  then it was explained to him that hot meat was not to be had unless he would choose to wait to have some lengthened cooking accomplished  to this however he objected and then the girl left the room  ive a good many things to say of one kind or another he continued its difficult to say peacocke how you and i stand with each other  i do not know that we stand with each other at all as you call it  i mean as to relationship  are you my brotherinlaw or are you not this was a question which in very truth the schoolmaster found it hard to answer  he did not answer it at all but remained silent  are you my brotherinlaw or are you not  you call her mrs peacocke eh  yes i call her mrs peacocke  and she is here living with you  yes she is here  had she not better come down and see me  she is my sisterinlaw anyway  no said mr peacocke i think on the whole that she had better not come down and see you  you dont mean to say she isnt my sisterinlaw  shes that whatever else she is  shes that whatever name she goes by  if ferdinand had been ever so much dead and that marriage at st louis had been ever so good still shed been my sisterinlaw  not a doubt about it said mr peacocke  but still under all the circumstances she had better not see you  well thats a queer beginning anyway  but perhaps youll come round byandby  she goes by mrs peacocke  she is regarded as my wife said the husband feeling himself to become more and more indignant at every word but knowing at the same time how necessary it was that he should keep his indignation hidden  whether true or false asked the brotherinlaw  i will answer no such question as that  you aint very well disposed to answer any question as far as i can see but i shall have to make you answer one or two before ive done with you theres a doctor here isnt there as this school belongs to  yes there is  it belongs to dr wortle  its him these boys are sent to  yes he is the master i am only his assistant  its him they comes to for education and morals and religion  quite so  and he knows no doubt all about you and my sisterinlawhow you came and married her when she was another mans wife and took her away when you knew as that other man was alive and kicking  mr peacocke when these questions were put to him remained silent because literally he did not know how to answer them  he was quite prepared to take his position as he found it  he had told himself before this dreadful man had appeared that the truth must be made known at bowick and that he and his wife must pack up and flit  it was not that the man could bring upon him any greater evil than he had anticipated  but the questions which were asked him were in themselves so bitter  the man no doubt was his wifes brotherinlaw  he could not turn him out of the house as he would a stranger had a stranger come there asking such questions without any claim of family  abominable as the man was to him still he was there with a certain amount of right upon his side  i think said he that questions such as those youve asked can be of no service to you  to me they are intended only to be injurious  theyre as a preface to what is to come said robert lefroy with an impudent leer upon his face  the questions no doubt are disagreeable enough  she aint your wife no more than shes mine  youve no business with her and that you knew when you took her away from st louis  you may or you maynt have been fooled by some one down in texas when you went back and married her in all that hurry  but you knew what you were doing well enough when you took her away  you wont dare to tell me that you hadnt seen ferdinand when you two mizzled off from the college then he paused waiting again for a reply  as i told you before he said no further conversation on the subject can be of avail  it does not suit me to be crossexamined as to what i knew or what i did not know  if you have anything for me to hear you can say it  if you have anything to tell to others go and tell it to them  thats just it said lefroy  then go and tell it  youre in a terrible hurry mister peacocke  i dont want to drop in and spoil your little game  youre making money of your little game  i can help you as to carrying on your little game better than you do at present  i dont want to blow upon you  but as youre making money out of it id like to make a little too  i am precious hard upi am  you will make no money of me said the other  a little will go a long way with me and remember i have got tidings now which are worth paying for  what tidings  if theyre worth paying for its not likely that you are going to get them for nothing  look here colonel lefroy whatever you may have to say about me will certainly not be prevented by my paying you money  though you might be able to ruin me tomorrow i would not give you a dollar to save myself  but her said lefroy pointing as it were upstairs with his thumb over his shoulder  nor her said peacocke  you dont care very much about her then  how much i may care i shall not trouble myself to explain to you  i certainly shall not endeavour to serve her after that fashion  i begin to understand why you have come and can only beg you to believe that you have come in vain  lefroy turned to his food which he had not yet finished while his companion sat silent at the window trying to arrange in his mind the circumstances of the moment as best he might  he declared to himself that had the man come but one day later his coming would have been matter of no moment  the story the entire story would then have been told to the doctor and the brotherinlaw with all his malice could have added nothing to the truth  but now it seemed as though there would be a race which should tell the story first  now the doctor would no doubt be led to feel that the narration was made because it could no longer be kept back  should this man be with the doctor first and should the story be told as he would tell it then it would be impossible for mr peacocke in acknowledging the truth of it all to bring his friends mind back to the condition in which it would have been had this intruder not been in the way  and yet he could not make a race of it with the man  he could not rush across and all but out of breath with his energy begin his narration while lefroy was there knocking at the door  there would be an absence of dignity in such a mode of proceeding which alone was sufficient to deter him  he had fixed an hour already with the doctor  he had said that he would be there in the house at a certain time  let the man do what he would he would keep exactly to his purpose unless the doctor should seek an earlier interview  he would in no tittle be turned from his purpose by the unfortunate coming of this wretched man  well said lefroy as soon as he had eaten his last mouthful  i have nothing to say to you said peacocke  nothing to say  not a word  well thats queer  i should have thought thered have been a many words  ive got a lot to say to somebody and mean to say itprecious soon too  is there any hotel here where i can put this horse up  i suppose you havent got stables of your own  i wonder if the doctor would give me accommodation  i havent got a stable and the doctor certainly will not give you accommodation  there is a publichouse less than a quarter of a mile further on which no doubt your driver knows very well  you had better go there yourself because after what has taken place i am bound to tell you that you will not be admitted here  not admitted  no  you must leave this house and will not be admitted into it again as long as i live in it  the doctor will admit me  very likely  i at any rate shall do nothing to dissuade him  if you go down to the road youll see the gate leading up to his house  i think youll find that he is downstairs by this time  you take it very cool peacocke  i only tell you the truth  with you i will have nothing more to do  you have a story which you wish to tell to dr wortle  go and tell it to him  i can tell it to all the world said lefroy  go and tell it to all the world  and i aint to see my sister  no you will not see your sisterinlaw here  why should she wish to see one who has only injured her  i aint injured herat any rate not as yet  i aint done nothingnot as yet  ive been as dark as the graveas yet  let her come down and you go away for a moment and let us see if we cant settle it  there is nothing for you to settle  nothing that you can do nothing that you can say will influence either her or me  if you have anything to tell go and tell it  why should you smash up everything in that way peacocke  youre comfortable here why not remain so  i dont want to hurt you  i want to help youand i can  three hundred dollars wouldnt be much to you  you were always a fellow as had a little money by you  if this box were full of gold said the schoolmaster laying his hand upon a black desk which stood on the table i would not give you one cent to induce you to hold your tongue for ever  i would not condescend even to ask it of you as a favour  you think that you can disturb our happiness by telling what you know of us to dr wortle  go and try  mr peacockes manner was so firm that the other man began to doubt whether in truth he had a secret to tell  could it be possible that dr wortle knew it all and that the neighbours knew it all and that in spite of what had happened the position of the man and of the woman was accepted among them  they certainly were not man and wife and yet they were living together as such  could such a one as this dr wortle know that it was so  he when he had spoken of the purposes for which the boys were sent there asking whether they were not sent for education for morals and religion had understood much of the doctors position  he had known the peculiar value of his secret  he had been aware that a schoolmaster with a wife to whom he was not in truth married must be out of place in an english seminary such as this  but yet he now began to doubt  i am to be turned out then he asked  yes indeed colonel lefroy  the sooner you go the better  thats a pretty sort of welcome to your wifes brotherinlaw who has just come over all the way from mexico to see her  to get what he can out of her by his unwelcome presence said peacocke here you can get nothing  go and do your worst  if you remain much longer i shall send for the policeman to remove you  you will  yes i shall  my time is not my own and i cannot go over to my work leaving you in my house  you have nothing to get by my friendship  go and see what you can do as my enemy  i will said the colonel getting up from his chair i will  if im to be treated in this way it shall not be for nothing  i have offered you the right hand of an affectionate brotherinlaw  bosh said mr peacocke  and you tell me that i am an enemy  very well i will be an enemy  i could have put you altogether on your legs but ill leave you without an inch of ground to stand upon  you see if i dont  then he put his hat on his head and stalked out of the house down the road towards the gate  mr peacocke when he was left alone remained in the room collecting his thoughts and then went upstairs to his wife  has he gone she asked  yes he has gone  and what has he said  he has asked for moneyto hold his tongue  have you given him any  not a cent  i have given him nothing but hard words  i have bade him go and do his worst  to be at the mercy of such a man as that would be worse for you and for me than anything that fortune has sent us even yet  did he want to see me  yes but i refused  was it not better  yes certainly if you think so  what could i have said to him certainly it was better  his presence would have half killed me  but what will he do henry  he will tell it all to everybody that he sees  oh my darling  what matter though he tells it at the towncross  it would have been told today by myself  but only to one  it would have been the same  for any purpose of concealment it would have been the same  i have got to hate the concealment  what have we done but clung together as a man and woman should who have loved each other and have had a right to love  what have we done of which we should be ashamed  let it be told  let it all be known  have you not been good and pure  have not i been true to you  bear up your courage and let the man do his worst  not to save even you would i cringe before such a man as that  and were i to do so i should save you from nothing    chapter viii  the story is told  during the whole of that morning the doctor did not come into the school the school hours lasted from halfpast nine to twelve during a portion of which time it was his practice to be there  but sometimes on a saturday he would be absent when it was understood generally that he was preparing his sermon for the sunday  such no doubt might be the case now but there was a feeling among the boys that he was kept away by some other reason  it was known that during the hour of morning school mr peacocke had been occupied with that uncouth stranger and some of the boys might have observed that the uncouth stranger had not taken himself altogether away from the premises  there was at any rate a general feeling that the uncouth stranger had something to do with the doctors absence  mr peacocke did his best to go on with the work as though nothing had occurred to disturb the usual tenor of his way and as far as the boys were aware he succeeded  he was just as clear about his greek verbs just as incisive about that passage of cæsar as he would have been had colonel lefroy remained on the other side of the water  but during the whole time he was exercising his mind in that painful process of thinking of two things at once  he was determined that cæsar should be uppermost but it may be doubted whether he succeeded  at that very moment colonel lefroy might be telling the doctor that his ella was in truth the wife of another man  at that moment the doctor might be deciding in his anger that the sinful and deceitful man should no longer be officer of his  the hour was too important to him to leave his mind at his own disposal nevertheless he did his best  clifford junior he said i shall never make you understand what cæsar says here or elsewhere if you do not give your entire mind to cæsar  i do give my entire mind to cæsar said clifford junior  very well now go on and try again  but remember that cæsar wants all your mind  as he said this he was revolving in his own mind how he would face the doctor when the doctor should look at him in his wrath  if the doctor were in any degree harsh with him he would hold his own against the doctor as far as the personal contest might go  at twelve the boys went out for an hour before their dinner and lord carstairs asked him to play a game of rackets  not today my lord he said  is anything wrong with you  yes something is very wrong  they had strolled out of the building and were walking up and down the gravel terrace in front when this was said  i knew something was wrong because you called me my lord  yes something is so wrong as to alter for me all the ordinary ways of my life  but i wasnt thinking of it  it came by accidentjust because i am so troubled  what is it  there has been a man herea man whom i knew in america  an enemy  yesan enemy  one who is anxious to do me all the injury he can  are you in his power mr peacocke  no thank god not that  i am in no mans power  he cannot do me any material harm  anything which may happen would have happened whether he had come or not  but i am unhappy  i wish i knew  so do iwith all my heart  i wish you knew i wish you knew  i would that all the world knew  but we shall live through it no doubt  and if we do not what matter  nil conscire sibinulla pallescere culpa that is all that is necessary to a man  i have done nothing of which i repentnothing that i would not do again nothing of which i am ashamed to speak as far as the judgment of other men is concerned  go now  they are making up sides for cricket  perhaps i can tell you more before the evening is over  both mr and mrs peacocke were accustomed to dine with the boys at one when carstairs being a private pupil only had his lunch  but on this occasion she did not come into the diningroom  i dont think i can today she said when he bade her to take courage and not be altered more than she could help in her outward carriage by the misery of her present circumstances  i could not eat if i were there and then they would look at me  if it be so do not attempt it  there is no necessity  what i mean is that the less one shrinks the less will be the suffering  it is the man who shivers on the brink that is cold and not he who plunges into the water  if it were overif the first brunt of it were over i could find means to comfort you  he went through the dinner as he had done the cæsar eating the roast mutton and the baked potatoes and the great plateful of currantpie that was brought to him  he was fed and nourished no doubt but it may be doubtful whether he knew much of the flavour of what he ate  but before the dinner was quite ended before he had said the grace which it was always his duty to pronounce there came a message to him from the rectory  the doctor would be glad to see him as soon as dinner was done  he waited very calmly till the proper moment should come for the grace and then very calmly he took his way over to the house  he was certain now that lefroy had been with the doctor because he was sent for considerably before the time fixed for the interview  it was his chief resolve to hold his own before the doctor  the doctor who could read a character well had so read that of mr peacockes as to have been aware from the first that no censure no faultfinding would be possible if the connection were to be maintained  other ushers other curates he had occasionally scolded  he had been very careful never even to seem to scold mr peacocke  mr peacocke had been aware of it tooaware that he could not endure it and aware also that the doctor avoided any attempt at it  he had known that as a consequence of this he was bound to be more than ordinarily prompt in the performance of all his duties  the man who will not endure censure has to take care that he does not deserve it  such had been this mans struggle and it had been altogether successful  each of the two understood the other and each respected the other  now their position must be changed  it was hardly possible mr peacocke thought as he entered the house that he should not be rebuked with grave severity and quite out of the question that he should bear any rebuke at all  the library at the rectory was a spacious and handsome room in the centre of which stood a large writingtable at which the doctor was accustomed to sit when he was at workfacing the door with a bowwindow at his right hand  but he rarely remained there when any one was summoned into the room unless some one were summoned with whom he meant to deal in a spirit of severity  mr peacocke would be there perhaps three or four times aweek and the doctor would always get up from his chair and stand or seat himself elsewhere in the room and would probably move about with vivacity being a fidgety man of quick motions who sometimes seemed as though he could not hold his own body still for a moment  but now when mr peacocke entered the room he did not leave his place at the table would you take a chair he said there is something that we must talk about  colonel lefroy has been with you i take it  a man calling himself by that name has been here  will you not take a chair  i do not know that it will be necessary  what he has told youwhat i suppose he has told youis true  you had better at any rate take a chair  i do not believe that what he has told me is true  but it is  i do not believe that what he has told me is true  some of it cannot i think be true  much of it is not sounless i am more deceived in you than i ever was in any man  at any rate sit down  then the schoolmaster did sit down  he has made you out to be a perjured wilful cruel bigamist  i have not been such said peacocke rising from his chair  one who has been willing to sacrifice a woman to his passion  no no  who deceived her by false witnesses  never  and who has now refused to allow her to see her own husbands brother lest she should learn the truth  she is thereat any rate for you to see  therefore the man is a liar  a long story has to be told as to which at present i can only guess what may be the nature  i presume the story will be the same as that you would have told had the man never come here  exactly the same dr wortle  therefore you will own that i am right in asking you to sit down  the story may be very longthat is if you mean to tell it  i doand did  i was wrong from the first in supposing that the nature of my marriage need be of no concern to others but to herself and to me  yesmr peacocke yes  we are all of us joined together too closely to admit of isolation such as that  there was something in this which grated against the schoolmasters pride though nothing had been said as to which he did not know that much harder things must meet his ears before the matter could be brought to an end between him and the doctor  the mister had been prefixed to his name which had been omitted for the last three or four months in the friendly intercourse which had taken place between them and then though it had been done in the form of agreeing with what he himself had said the doctor had made his first complaint by declaring that no man had a right to regard his own moral life as isolated from the lives of others around him  it was as much as to declare at once that he had been wrong in bringing this woman to bowick and calling her mrs peacocke  he had said as much himself but that did not make the censure lighter when it came to him from the mouth of the doctor  but come said the doctor getting up from his seat at the table and throwing himself into an easychair so as to mitigate the austerity of the position let us hear the true story  so big a liar as that american gentleman probably never put his foot in this room before  then mr peacocke told the story beginning with all those incidents of the womans life which had seemed to be so cruel both to him and to others at st louis before he had been in any degree intimate with her  then came the departure of the two men and the necessity for pecuniary assistance which mr peacocke now passed over lightly saying nothing specially of the assistance which he himself had rendered  and she was left quite alone asked the doctor  quite alone  and for how long  eighteen months had passed before we heard any tidings  then there came news that colonel lefroy was dead  the husband  we did not know which  they were both colonels  and then  did he tell you that i went down into mexico  never mind what he told me  all that he told me were lies  what you tell me i shall believe  but tell me everything  there was a tone of complete authority in the doctors voice but mixed with this there was a kindliness which made the schoolmaster determined that he would tell everything as far as he knew how  when i heard that one of them was dead i went away down to the borders of texas in order that i might learn the truth  did she know that you were going  yesi told her the day i started  and you told her why  that i might find out whether her husband were still alive  but  the doctor hesitated as he asked the next question  he knew however that it had to be asked and went on with it  did she know that you loved her  to this the other made no immediate answer  the doctor was a man who in such a matter was intelligent enough and he therefore put his question in another shape  had you told her that you loved her  neverwhile i thought that other man was living  she must have guessed it said the doctor  she might guess what she pleased  i told her that i was going and i went  and how was it then  i went and after a time i came across the very man who is here now this robert lefroy  i met him and questioned him and he told me that his brother had been killed while fighting  it was a lie  altogether a lie asked the doctor  how altogether  he might have been wounded and given over for dead  the brother might have thought him to be dead  i do not think so  i believe it to have been a plot in order that the man might get rid of his wife  but i believed it  then i went back to st louisand we were married  you thought there was no obstacle but what you might become man and wife legally  i thought she was a widow  there was no further delay  very little  why should there have been delay  i only ask  she had suffered enough and i had waited long enough  she owed you a great deal said the doctor  it was not a case of owing said mr peacocke  at least i think not i think she had learnt to love me as i had learnt to love her  and how did it go with you then  very wellfor some months  there was nothing to mar our happinesstill one day he came and made his way into our presence  the husband  yes the husband ferdinand lefroy the elder brotherhe of whom i had been told that he was dead he was there standing before us talking to ushalf drunk but still well knowing what he was doing  why had he come  in want of money i supposeas this other one has come here  did he ask for money  i do not think he did then though he spoke of his poor condition  but on the next day he went away  we heard that he had taken the steamer down the river for new orleans  we have never heard more of him from that day to this  can you imagine what caused conduct such as that  i think money was given to him that night to go but if so i do not know by whom  i gave him none  during the next day or two i found that many in st louis knew that he had been there  they knew then that you  they knew that my wife was not my wife  that is what you mean to ask the doctor nodded his head  yes they knew that  and what then  word was brought to me that she and i must part if i chose to keep my place at the college  that you must disown her  the president told me that it would be better that she should go elsewhere  how could i send her from me  no indeedbut as to the facts  you know them all pretty well now  i could not send her from me  nor could i go and leave her  had we been separated then because of the law or because of religion the burden the misery the desolation would all have been upon her  i would have clung to her let the law say what it might said the doctor rising from his chair  you would  i wouldand i think that i could have reconciled it to my god  but i might have been wrong he added i might have been wrong  i only say what i should have done  it was what i did  exactly exactly  we are both sinners  both might have been wrong then you brought her over here and i suppose i know the rest  you know everything now said mr peacocke  and believe every word i have heard  let me say that if that may be any consolation to you  of my friendship you may remain assured  whether you can remain here is another question  we are prepared to go  you cannot expect that i should have thought it all out during the hearing of the story  there is much to be consideredvery much  i can only say this as between man and man that no man ever sympathized with another more warmly than i do with you  you had better let me have till monday to think about it    chapter ix  mrs wortle and mr puddicombe  in this way nothing was said at the first telling of the story to decide the fate of the schoolmaster and of the lady whom we shall still call his wife  there certainly had been no horror displayed by the doctor whether you can remain here is another question  the doctor during the whole interview had said nothing harder than that  mr peacocke as he left the rectory did feel that the doctor had been very good to him there had not only been no horror but an expression of the kindest sympathy  and as to the going that was left in doubt  he himself felt that he ought to gobut it would have been so very sad to have to go without a friend left with whom he could consult as to his future condition  he has been very kind then said mrs peacocke to her husband when he related to her the particulars of the interview  very kind  and he did not reproach you  not a word  nor me  he declared that had it been he who was in question he would have clung to you for ever and ever  did he  then will he leave us here  that does not follow  i should think not  he will know that others must know it  your brotherinlaw will not tell him only  lefroy when he finds that he can get no money here from sheer revenge will tell the story everywhere  when he left the rectory he was probably as angry with the doctor as he is with me  he will do all the harm that he can to all of us  we must go then  i should think so  your position here would be insupportable even if it could be permitted  you may be sure of thiseverybody will know it  what do i care for everybody she said  it is not that i am ashamed of myself  no dearest nor am iashamed of myself or of you  but there will be bitter words and bitter words will produce bitter looks and scant respect  how would it be with you if the boys looked at you as though they thought ill of you  they would notoh they would not  or the servantsif they reviled you  could it come to that  it must not come to that  but it is as the doctor said himself just nowa man cannot isolate the morals the manners the ways of his life from the morals of others  men if they live together must live together by certain laws  then there can be no hope for us  none that i can see as far as bowick is concerned  we are too closely joined in our work with other people  there is not a boy here with whose father and mother and sisters we are not more or less connected  when i was preaching in the church there was not one in the parish with whom i was not connected  would it do do you think for a priest to preach against drunkenness whilst he himself was a noted drunkard  are we like that  it is not what the drunken priest might think of himself but what others might think of him  it would not be with us the position which we know that we hold together but that which others would think it to be  if i were in dr wortles case and another were to me as i am to him i should bid him go  you would turn him away from you him and hiswife  i should  my first duty would be to my parish and to my school  if i could befriend him otherwise i would do soand that is what i expect from dr wortle  we shall have to go and i shall be forced to approve of our dismissal  in this way mr peacocke came definitely and clearly to a conclusion in his own mind  but it was very different with dr wortle  the story so disturbed him that during the whole of that afternoon he did not attempt to turn his mind to any other subject  he even went so far as to send over to mr puddicombe and asked for some assistance for the afternoon service on the following day  he was too unwell he said to preach himself and the one curate would have the two entire services unless mr puddicombe could help him  could mr puddicombe come himself and see him on the sunday afternoon  this note he sent away by a messenger who came back with a reply saying that mr puddicombe would himself preach in the afternoon and would afterwards call in at the rectory  for an hour or two before his dinner the doctor went out on horseback and roamed about among the lanes endeavouring to make up his mind  he was hitherto altogether at a loss as to what he should do in this present uncomfortable emergency  he could not bring his conscience and his inclination to come square together  and even when he counselled himself to yield to his conscience his very consciencea second conscience as it wererevolted against the first  his first conscience told him that he owed a primary duty to his parish a second duty to his school and a third to his wife and daughter  in the performance of all these duties he would be bound to rid himself of mr peacocke  but then there came that other conscience telling him that the man had been more sinned against than sinningthat common humanity required him to stand by a man who had suffered so much and had suffered so unworthily  then this second conscience went on to remind him that the man was preeminently fit for the duties which he had undertakenthat the man was a godfearing moral and especially intellectual assistant in his schoolthat were he to lose him he could not hope to find any one that would be his equal or at all approaching to him in capacity  this second conscience went further and assured him that the mans excellence as a schoolmaster was even increased by the peculiarity of his position  do we not all know that if a man be under a cloud the very cloud will make him more attentive to his duties than another  if a man for the wages which he receives can give to his employer high character as well as work he will think that he may lighten his work because of his character  and as to this man who was the very phoenix of school assistants there would really be nothing amiss with his character if only this piteous incident as to his wife were unknown  in this way his second conscience almost got the better of the first  but then it would be known  it would be impossible that it should not be known  he had already made up his mind to tell mr puddicombe absolutely not daring to decide in such an emergency without consulting some friend mr puddicombe would hold his peace if he were to promise to do so certainly he might be trusted to do that  but others would know it the bishop would know it mrs stantiloup would know it  that man of course would take care that all broughton with its close full of cathedral clergymen would know it  when mrs stantiloup should know it there would not be a boys parent through all the school who would not know it  if he kept the man he must keep him resolving that all the world should know that he kept him that all the world should know of what nature was the married life of the assistant in whom he trusted  and he must be prepared to face all the world confiding in the uprightness and the humanity of his purpose  in such case he must say something of this kind to all the world i know that they are not married  i know that their condition of life is opposed to the law of god and man  i know that she bears a name that is not in truth her own but i think that the circumstances in this case are so strange so peculiar that they excuse a disregard even of the law of god and man  had he courage enough for this  and if the courage were there was he high enough and powerful enough to carry out such a purpose  could he beat down the mrs stantiloups  and indeed could he beat down the bishop and the bishops phalanxfor he knew that the bishop and the bishops phalanx would be against him  they could not touch him in his living because mr peacocke would not be concerned in the services of the church but would not his school melt away to nothing in his hands if he were to attempt to carry it on after this fashion  and then would he not have destroyed himself without advantage to the man whom he was anxious to assist  to only one point did he make up his mind certainly during that ride before he slept that night he would tell the whole story to his wife  he had at first thought that he would conceal it from her  it was his rule of life to act so entirely on his own will that he rarely consulted her on matters of any importance  as it was he could not endure the responsibility of acting by himself  people would say of him that he had subjected his wife to contamination and had done so without giving her any choice in the matter  so he resolved that he would tell his wife  not married said mrs wortle when she heard the story  married yes  they were married  it was not their fault that the marriage was nothing  what was he to do when he heard that they had been deceived in this way  not married properly  poor woman  yes indeed  what should i have done if such had happened to me when we had been six months married  it couldnt have been  why not to you as well as to another  i was only a young girl  but if you had been a widow  dont my dear dont  it wouldnt have been possible  but you pity her  oh yes  and you see that a great misfortune has fallen upon her which she could not help  not till she knew it said the wife who had been married quite properly  and what then  what should she have done then  gone said the wife who had no doubt as to the comfort the beauty the perfect security of her own position  gone  gone away at once  whither should she go  who would have taken her by the hand  who would have supported her  would you have had her lay herself down in the first gutter and die  better that than what she did do said mrs wortle  then by all the faith i have in christ i think you are hard upon her do you think what it is to have to go out and live aloneto have to look for your bread in desolation  i have never been tried my dear said she clinging close to him  i have never had anything but what was good  ought we not to be kind to one to whom fortune has been so unkind  if we can do so without sin  sin  i despise the fear of sin which makes us think that its contact will soil us  her sin if it be sin is so near akin to virtue that i doubt whether we should not learn of her rather than avoid her  a woman should not live with a man unless she be his wife  mrs wortle said this with more of obstinacy than he had expected  she was his wife as far as she knew  but when she knew that it was not so any longerthen she should have left him  and have starved  i suppose she might have taken bread from him  you think then that she should go away from here  do not you think so  what will mrs stantiloup say  and i am to turn them out into the cold because of a virago such as she is  you would have no more charity than that  oh jeffrey what would the bishop say  cannot you get beyond mrs stantiloup and beyond the bishop and think what justice demands  the boys would all be taken away  if you had a son would you send him where there was a schoolmaster livingliving  oh you wouldnt  it is very clear to the doctor that his wifes mind was made up on the subject and yet there was no softerhearted woman than mrs wortle anywhere in the diocese or one less likely to be severe upon a neighbour not only was she a kindly gentle woman but she was one who always had been willing to take her husbands opinion on all questions of right and wrong  she however was decided that they must go  on the next morning after service which the schoolmaster did not attend the doctor saw mr peacocke and declared his intention of telling the story to mr puddicombe  if you bid me hold my tongue he said i will do so  but it will be better that i should consult another clergyman  he is a man who can keep a secret  then mr peacocke gave him full authority to tell everything to mr puddicombe  he declared that the doctor might tell the story to whom he would  everybody might know it now  he had he said quite made up his mind about that  what was the good of affecting secrecy when this man lefroy was in the country  in the afternoon after service mr puddicombe came up to the house and heard it all  he was a dry thin apparently unsympathetic man but just withal and by no means given to harshness  he could pardon whenever he could bring himself to believe that pardon would have good results but he would not be driven by impulses and softness of heart to save the faulty one from the effect of his fault merely because that effect would be painful  he was a man of no great mental calibrenot sharp and quick and capable of repartee as was the doctor but rational in all things and always guided by his conscience  he has behaved very badly to you he said when he heard the story  i do not think so i have no such feeling myself  he behaved very badly in bringing her here without telling you all the facts  considering the position that she was to occupy he must have known that he was deceiving you  i can forgive all that said the doctor vehemently  as far as i myself am concerned i forgive everything  you are not entitled to do so  hownot entitled  you must pardon me if i seem to take a liberty in expressing myself too boldly in this matter  of course i should not do so unless you asked me  i want you to speak freelyall that you think  in considering his conduct we have to consider it all  first of all there came a great and terrible misfortune which cannot but excite our pity  according to his own story he seems up to that time to have been affectionate and generous  i believe every word of it said the doctor  allowing for a mans natural bias on his own side so do i  he had allowed himself to become attached to another mans wife but we need not perhaps insist upon that  the doctor moved himself uneasily in his chair but said nothing  we will grant that he put himself right by his marriage though in that no doubt there should have been more of caution  then came his great misfortune  he knew that his marriage had been no marriage  he saw the man and had no doubt  quite so quite so said the doctor impatiently  he should of course have separated himself from her  there can be no doubt about it  there is no room for any quibble  quibble said the doctor  i mean that no reference in our own minds to the pity of the thing to the softness of the momentshould make us doubt about it  feelings such as these should induce us to pardon sinners even to receive them back into our friendship and respectwhen they have seen the error of their ways and have repented  you are very hard  i hope not  at any rate i can only say as i think  but in truth in the present emergency you have nothing to do with all that  if he asked you for counsel you might give it to him but that is not his present position  he has told you his story not in a spirit of repentance but because such telling had become necessary  he would have told it all the same though this man had never come  let us grant that it is so there still remains his relation to you  he came here under false pretences and has done you a serious injury  i think not said the doctor  would you have taken him into your establishment had you known it all before  certainly not  therefore i say that he has deceived you  i do not advise you to speak to him with severity but he should i think be made to know that you appreciate what he has done  and you would turn him offsend him away at once out about his business  certainly i would send him away  you think him such a reprobate that he should not be allowed to earn his bread anywhere  i have not said so  i know nothing of his means of earning his bread men living in sin earn their bread constantly  but he certainly should not be allowed to earn his here  not though that man who was her husband should now be dead and he should again marrylegally marrythis woman to whom he has been so true and loyal  as regards you and your school said mr puddicombe i do not think it would alter his position  with this the conference ended and mr puddicombe took his leave  as he left the house the doctor declared to himself that the man was a straitlaced fanatical hardhearted bigot  but though he said so to himself he hardly thought so and was aware that the mans words had had effect upon him    part iv  chapter x  mr peacocke goes  the doctor had been all but savage with his wife and for the moment had hated mr puddicombe but still what they said had affected him  they were both of them quite clear that mr peacocke should be made to go at once  and he though he hated mr puddicombe for his cold logic could not but acknowledge that all the man had said was true  according to the strict law of right and wrong the two unfortunates should have parted when they found that they were not in truth married  and again according to the strict law of right and wrong mr peacocke should not have brought the woman there into his school as his wife  there had been deceit but then would not he dr wortle himself have been guilty of similar deceit had it fallen upon him to have to defend a woman who had been true and affectionate to him  mr puddicombe would have left the woman to break her heart and have gone away and done his duty like a christian feeling no tugging at his heartstrings  it was so that our doctor spoke to himself of his counsellor sitting there alone in his library  during his conference with lefroy something had been said which had impressed him suddenly with an idea  a word had fallen from the colonel an unintended word by which the doctor was made to believe that the other colonel was dead at any rate now  he had cunningly tried to lead up to the subject but robert lefroy had been on his guard as soon as he had perceived the doctors object and had drawn back denying the truth of the word he had before spoken  the doctor at last asked him the question direct  lefroy then declared that his brother had been alive and well when he left texas but he did this in such a manner as to strengthen in the doctors mind the impression that he was dead  if it were so then might not all these crooked things be made straight  he had thought it better to raise no false hopes  he had said nothing of this to peacocke on discussing the story  he had not even hinted it to his wife from whom it might probably make its way to mrs peacocke  he had suggested it to mr puddicombeasking whether there might not be a way out of all their difficulties  mr puddicombe had declared that there could be no such way as far as the school was concerned  let them marry and repent their sins and go away from the spot they had contaminated and earn their bread in some place in which there need be no longer additional sin in concealing the story of their past life  that seemed to have been mr puddicombes final judgment  but it was altogether opposed to dr wortles feelings  when mr puddicombe came down from the church to the rectory lord carstairs was walking home after the afternoon service with miss wortle it was his custom to go to church with the family whereas the school went there under the charge of one of the ushers and sat apart in a portion of the church appropriated to themselves  mrs wortle when she found that the doctor was not going to the afternoon service declined to go herself she was thoroughly disturbed by all these bad tidings and was indeed very little able to say her prayers in a fit state of mind  she could hardly keep herself still for a moment and was as one who thinks that the crack of doom is comingso terrible to her was her vicinity and connection with this man and with the woman who was not his wife  then again she became flurried when she found that lord carstairs and mary would have to walk alone together and she made little abortive attempts to keep first the one and then the other from going to church  mary probably saw no reason for staying away while lord carstairs possibly found an additional reason for going  poor mrs wortle had for some weeks past wished that the charming young nobleman had been at home with his father and mother or anywhere but in her house  it had been arranged however that he should go in july and not return after the summer holidays  under these circumstances having full confidence in her girl she had refrained from again expressing her fears to the doctor  but there were fears  it was evident to her though the doctor seemed to see nothing of it that the young lord was falling in love  it might be that his youth and natural bashfulness would come to her aid and that nothing should be said before that day in july which would separate them  but when it suddenly occurred to her that they two would walk to and fro from church together there was cause for additional uneasiness  if she had heard their conversation as they came back she would have been in no way disturbed by its tone on the score of the young mans tenderness towards her daughter but she might perhaps have been surprised by his vehemence in another respect  she would have been surprised also at finding how much had been said during the last twentyfour hours by others besides herself and her husband about the affairs of mr and mrs peacocke  do you know what he came about asked mary  the he had of course been robert lefroy  not in the least but he came up there looking so queer as though he certainly had come about something unpleasant  and then he was with papa afterwards said mary  i am sure papa and mamma not coming to church has something to do with it  and mr peacocke hasnt been to church all day  something has happened to make him very unhappy said the boy  he told me so even before this man came here  i dont know any one whom i like so much as mr peacocke  i think it is about his wife said mary  how about his wife  i dont know but i think it is  she is so very quiet  how quiet miss wortle he asked  she never will come in to see us  mamma has asked her to dinner and to drink tea ever so often but she never comes  she calls perhaps once in two or three months in a formal way and that is all we see of her  do you like her he asked  how can i say when i so seldom see her  i do  i like her very much  i go and see her often and im sure of thisshe is quite a lady  mamma asked her to go to carstairs for the holidays because of what i said  she is not going  no neither of them will come  i wish they would and oh miss wortle i do so wish you were going to be there too  this is all that was said of peculiar tenderness between them on that walk home  late in the eveningso late that the boys had already gone to bedthe doctor sent again for mr peacocke  i should not have troubled you tonight he said only that i have heard something from pritchett pritchett was the rectory gardener who had charge also of the school buildings and was a person of great authority in the establishment  he as well the doctor held mr peacocke in great respect and would have been almost as unwilling as the doctor himself to tell stories to the schoolmasters discredit  they are saying down at the lambthe lamb was the bowick publichousethat lefroy told them all yesterday the doctor hesitated before he could tell it  that my wife is not my wife  just so  of course i am prepared for it  i knew that it would be so did not you  i expected it  i was sure of it  it may be taken for granted at once that there is no longer a secret to keep  i would wish you to act just as though all the facts were known to the entire diocese  after this there was a pause during which neither of them spoke for a few moments  the doctor had not intended to declare any purpose of his own on that occasion but it seemed to him now as though he were almost driven to do so  then mr peacocke seeing the difficulty at once relieved him from it  i am quite prepared to leave bowick he said at once  i know that it must be so  i have thought about it and have perceived that there is no possible alternative  i should like to consult with you as to whither i had better go  where shall i first take her  leave her here said the doctor  here  where  where she is in the schoolhouse  no one will come to fill your place for a while  i should have thought said mr peacocke very slowly that her presencewould have been worse almostthan my own  to mesaid the doctorto me she is as pure as the most unsullied matron in the country  upon this mr peacocke jumping from his chair seized the doctors hand but could not speak for his tears then he seated himself again turning his face away towards the wall  to no one could the presence of either of you be an evil  the evil is if i may say so that the two of you should be here together  you should be aparttill some better day has come upon you  what better day can ever come said the poor man through his tears  then the doctor declared his scheme  he told what he thought as to ferdinand lefroy and his reason for believing that the man was dead  i felt sure from his manner that his brother is now dead in truth  go to him and ask him boldly he said  but his word would not suffice for another marriage ceremony  to this the doctor agreed  it was not his intention he said that they should proceed on evidence as slight as that  no a step must be taken much more serious in its importance and occupying a considerable time he peacocke must go again to missouri and find out all the truth  the doctor was of opinion that if this were resolved upon and that if the whole truth were at once proclaimed then mr peacocke need not hesitate to pay robert lefroy for any information which might assist him in his search  while you are gone continued the doctor almost wildly let bishops and stantiloups and puddicombes say what they may she shall remain here  to say that she will be happy is of course vain  there can be no happiness for her till this has been put right  but she will be safe and here at my hand she will i think be free from insult  what better is there to be done  there can be nothing better said peacocke drawing his breathas though a gleam of light had shone in upon him  i had not meant to have spoken to you of this till tomorrow  i should not have done so but that pritchett had been with me  but the more i thought of it the more sure i became that you could not both remaintill something had been done till something had been done  i was sure of it dr wortle  mr puddicombe saw that it was so  mr puddicombe is not all the world to me by any means but he is a man of common sense  i will be frank with you  my wife said that it could not be so  she shall not stay  mrs wortle shall not be annoyed  you dont see it yet said the doctor  but you do  i know you do and she shall stay  the house shall be hers as her residence for the next six months  as for money  i have got what will do for that i think  if she wants money she shall have what she wants  there is nothing i will not do for you in your troubleexcept that you may not both be here together till i shall have shaken hands with her as mrs peacocke in very truth  it was settled that mr peacocke should not go again into the school or mrs peacocke among the boys till he should have gone to america and have come back  it was explained in the school by the doctor earlyfor the doctor must now take the morning school himselfthat circumstances of very grave import made it necessary that mr peacocke should start at once for america  that the tidings which had been published at the lamb would reach the boys was more than probable  nay was it not certain  it would of course reach all the boys parents  there was no use no service in any secrecy  but in speaking to the school not a word was said of mrs peacocke  the doctor explained that he himself would take the morning school and that mr rose the mathematical master would take charge of the school meals  mrs cane the housekeeper would look to the linen and the bedrooms  it was made plain that mrs peacockes services were not to be required but her name was not mentionedexcept that the doctor in order to let it be understood that she was not to be banished from the house begged the boys as a favour that they would not interrupt mrs peacockes tranquillity during mr peacockes absence  on the tuesday morning mr peacocke started remaining however a couple of days at broughton during which the doctor saw him  lefroy declared that he knew nothing about his brotherwhether he were alive or dead he might be dead because he was always in trouble and generally drunk robert on the whole thought it probable that he was dead but could not be got to say so  for a thousand dollars he would go over to missouri and if necessary to texas so as to find the truth  he would then come back and give undeniable evidence  while making this benevolent offer he declared with tears in his eyes that he had come over intending to be a true brother to his sisterinlaw and had simply been deterred from prosecuting his good intentions by peacockes austerity  then he swore a most solemn oath that if he knew anything about his brother ferdinand he would reveal it  the doctor and peacocke agreed together that the mans word was worth nothing but that the mans services might be useful in enabling them to track out the truth  they were both convinced by words which fell from him that ferdinand lefroy was dead but this would be of no avail unless they could obtain absolute evidence  during these two days there were various conversations at broughton between the doctor mr peacocke and lefroy in which a plan of action was at length arranged  lefroy and the schoolmaster were to proceed to america together and there obtain what evidence they could as to the life or death of the elder brother  when absolute evidence had been obtained of either a thousand dollars was to be handed to robert lefroy  but when this agreement was made the man was given to understand that his own uncorroborated word would go for nothing  who is to say what is evidence and what not asked the man not unnaturally  mr peacocke must be the judge said the doctor  i aint going to agree to that said the other  though he were to see him dead he might swear he hadnt and not give me a red cent  why aint i to be judge as well as he  because you can trust him and he cannot in the least trust you said the doctor  you know well enough that if he were to see your brother alive or to see him dead you would get the money  at any rate you have no other way of getting it but what we propose  to all this robert lefroy at last assented  the prospect before mr peacocke for the next three months was certainly very sad  he was to travel from broughton to st louis and possibly from thence down into the wilds of texas in company with this man whom he thoroughly despised  nothing could be more abominable to him than such an association but there was no other way in which the proposed plan could be carried out  he was to pay lefroys expenses back to his own country and could only hope to keep the man true to his purpose by doing so from day to day  were he to give the man money the man would at once disappear  here in england and in their passage across the ocean the man might in some degree be amenable and obedient  but there was no knowing to what he might have recourse when he should find himself nearer to his country and should feel that his companion was distant from his own  youll have to keep a close watch upon him whispered the doctor to his friend  i should not advise all this if i did not think you were a man of strong nerve  i am not afraid said the other but i doubt whether he may not be too many for me  at any rate i will try it  you will hear from me as i go on  and so they parted as dear friends part  the doctor had in truth taken the man altogether to his heart since all the circumstances of the story had come home to him  and it need hardly be said that the other was aware how deep a debt of gratitude he owed to the protector of his wife  indeed the very money that was to be paid to robert lefroy if he earned it was advanced out of the doctors pocket  mr peacockes means were sufficient for the expenses of the journey but fell short when these thousand dollars had to be provided    chapter xi  the bishop  mr peacocke had been quite right in saying that the secret would at once be known through the whole diocese  it certainly was so before he had been gone a week and it certainly was the case also that the diocese generally did not approve of the doctors conduct  the woman ought not to have been left there  so said the diocese  it was of course the case that though the diocese knew much it did not know all  it is impossible to keep such a story concealed but it is quite as impossible to make known all its details  in the eyes of the diocese the woman was of course the chief sinner and the chief sinner was allowed to remain at the school  when this assertion was made to him the doctor became very angry saying that mrs peacocke did not remain at the school that according to the arrangement as at present made mrs peacocke had nothing to do with the school that the house was his own and that he might lend it to whom he pleased  was he to turn the woman out houseless when her husband had gone on such an errand on his advice  of course the house was his own but as clergyman of the parish he had not a right to do what he liked with it  he had no right to encourage evil  and the man was not the womans husband  that was just the point made by the diocese  and she was at the schoolliving under the same roof with the boys  the diocese was clearly of opinion that all the boys would be taken away  the diocese spoke by the voice of its bishop as a diocese should do shortly after mr peacockes departure the doctor had an interview with his lordship and told the whole story  the doing this went much against the grain with him but he hardly dared not to do it  he felt that he was bound to do it on the part of mrs peacocke if not on his own  and then the man who had now gone though he had never been absolutely a curate had preached frequently in the diocese  he felt that it would not be wise to abstain from telling the bishop  the bishop was a goodly man comely in his person and possessed of manners which had made him popular in the world  he was one of those who had done the best he could with his talent not wrapping it up in a napkin but getting from it the best interest which the worlds market could afford  but not on that account was he other than a good man  to do the best he could for himself and his familyand also to do his dutywas the line of conduct which he pursued  there are some who reverse this order but he was not one of them  he had become a scholar in his youth not from love of scholarship but as a means to success the church had become his profession and he had worked hard at his calling  he had taught himself to be courteous and urbane because he had been clever enough to see that courtesy and urbanity are agreeable to men in high places  as a bishop he never spared himself the work which a bishop ought to do  he answered letters he studied the characters of the clergymen under him he was just with his patronage he endeavoured to be efficacious with his charges he confirmed children in cold weather as well as in warm he occasionally preached sermons and he was beautiful and decorous in his gait of manner as it behoves a clergyman of the church of england to be  he liked to be master but even to be master he would not encounter the abominable nuisance of a quarrel  when first coming to the diocese he had had some little difficulty with our doctor but the bishop had abstained from violent assertion and they had on the whole been friends  there was however on the bishops part something of a feeling that the doctor was the bigger man and it was probable that without active malignity he would take advantage of any chance which might lower the doctor a little and bring him more within episcopal power  in some degree he begrudged the doctor his manliness  he listened with many smiles and with perfect courtesy to the story as it was told to him and was much less severe on the unfortunates than mr puddicombe had been  it was not the wickedness of the two people in living together or their wickedness in keeping their secret which offended him so much as the evil which they were likely to doand to have done  no doubt he said an illliving man may preach a good sermon perhaps a better one than a pious godfearing clergyman whose intellect may be inferior though his morals are much betterbut coming from tainted lips the better sermon will not carry a blessing with it at this the doctor shook his head  bringing a blessing was a phrase which the doctor hated  he shook his head not too civilly saying that he had not intended to trouble his lordship on so difficult a point in ecclesiastical morals  but we cannot but remember said the bishop that he has been preaching in your parish church and the people will know that he has acted among them as a clergyman  i hope the people my lord may never have the gospel preached to them by a worse man  i will not judge him but i do think that it has been a misfortune  you of course were in ignorance  had i known all about it i should have been very much inclined to do the same  this was in fact not true and was said simply in a spirit of contradiction  the bishop shook his head and smiled  my school is a matter of more importance said the doctor  hardly hardly dr wortle  of more importance in this way that my school may probably be injured whereas neither the morals nor the faith of the parishioners will have been hurt  but he has gone  he has gonebut she remains  what exclaimed the bishop  he has gone but she remains  he repeated the words very distinctly with a frown on his brow as though to show that on that branch of the subject he intended to put up with no oppositionhardly even with an adverse opinion  she had a certain charge as i understandas to the school  she had my lord and very well she did her work  i shall have a great loss in herfor the present  but you said she remained  i have lent her the use of the house till her husband shall come back  mr peacocke you mean said the bishop who was unable not to put in a contradiction against the untruth of the word which had been used  i shall always regard them as married  but they are not  i have lent her the house at any rate during his absence  i could not turn her into the street  would not a lodging here in the city have suited her better  i thought not  people here would have refused to take herbecause of her story  the wife of some religious grocer who sands his sugar regularly would have thought her house contaminated by such an inmate  so it would have been doctor to some extent  at hearing this the doctor made very evident signs of discontent  you cannot alter the ways of the world suddenly though by example and precept you may help to improve them slowly  in our present imperfect condition of moral culture it is perhaps well that the company of the guilty should be shunned  guilty  i am afraid that i must say so  the knowledge that such a feeling exists no doubt deters others from guilt  the fact that wrongdoing in women is scorned helps to maintain the innocence of women  is it not so  i must hesitate before i trouble your lordship by arguing such difficult questions  i thought it right to tell you the facts after what had occurred  he has gone she is thereand there she will remain for the present  i could not turn her out  thinking her as i do worthy of my friendship i could not do other than befriend her  of course you must be the judge yourself  i had to be the judge my lord  i am afraid that the parents of the boys will not understand it  i also am afraid  it will be very hard to make them understand it there will be some who will work hard to make them misunderstand it  i hope not that  there will  i must stand the brunt of it  i have had battles before this and had hoped that now when i am getting old they might have been at an end  but there is something left of me and i can fight still  at any rate i have made up my mind about this  there she shall remain till he comes back to fetch her  and so the interview was over the bishop feeling that he had in some slight degree had the best of itand the doctor feeling that he in some slight degree had had the worst  if possible he would not talk to the bishop on the subject again  he told mr puddicombe also  with your generosity and kindness of heart i quite sympathise said mr puddicombe endeavouring to be pleasant in his manner  but not with my prudence  not with your prudence said mr puddicombe endeavouring to be true at the same time  but the doctors greatest difficulty was with his wife whose conduct it was necessary that he should guide and whose feelings and conscience he was most anxious to influence  when she first heard his decision she almost wrung her hands in despair  if the woman could have gone to america and the man have remained she would have been satisfied anything wrong about a man was but of little momentcomparatively so even though he were a clergyman but anything wrong about a womanand she so near to herself  o dear  and the poor dear boysunder the same roof with her  and the boys mammas  how would she be able to endure the sight of that horrid mrs stantiloupor mrs stantiloups words which would certainly be conveyed to her  but there was something much worse for her even than all this  the doctor insisted that she should go and call upon the woman  and take mary asked mrs wortle  what would be the good of taking mary  who is talking of a child like that  it is for the sake of charityfor the dear love of christ that i ask you to do it  do you ever think of mary magdalene  oh yes  this is no magdalene  this is a woman led into no faults by vicious propensities  here is one who has been altogether unfortunatewho has been treated more cruelly than any of whom you have ever read  why did she not leave him  because she was a woman with a heart in her bosom  i am to go to her  i do not order it  i only ask it  such asking from her husband was she knew very near alike to ordering  what shall i say to her  bid her keep up her courage till he shall return  if you were all alone as she is would not you wish that some other woman should come to comfort you  think of her desolation  mrs wortle did think of it and after a day or two made up her mind to obey her husbandsrequest  she made her call but very little came of it except that she promised to come again  mrs wortle said the poor woman pray do not let me be a trouble to you  if you stay away i shall quite understand that there is sufficient reason  i know how good your husband has been to us  mrs wortle said however as she took her leave that she would come again in a day or two  but there were other troubles in store for mrs wortle  before she had repeated her visit to mrs peacocke a lady who lived about ten miles off the wife of the rector of buttercup called upon her  this was the lady margaret momson a daughter of the earl of brigstock who had thirty years ago married a young clergyman  nevertheless up to the present day she was quite as much the earls daughter as the parsons wife  she was first cousin to that mrs stantiloup between whom and the doctor internecine war was always being waged and she was also aunt to a boy at the school who however was in no way related to mrs stantiloup young momson being the son of the parsons eldest brother  lady margaret had never absolutely and openly taken the part of mrs stantiloup  had she done so a visit even of ceremony would have been impossible  but she was supposed to have stantiloup proclivities and was not therefore much liked at bowick  there had been a question indeed whether young momson should be received at the schoolbecause of the quasi connection with the archenemy but squire momson of buttercup the boys father had set that at rest by bursting out in the doctors hearing into violent abuse against the closefisted vulgar old faggot  the son of a man imbued with such proper feelings was of course accepted  but lady margaret was proudespecially at the present time  what a romance this is mrs wortle she said that has gone all through the diocese  the reader will remember that lady margaret was also the wife of a clergyman  you meanthe peacockes  of course i do  he has gone away  we all know that of courseto look for his wifes husband  good gracious me  what a story  they think that he isdead now  i suppose they thought so before said lady margaret  of course they did  though it does seem that no inquiry was made at all  perhaps they dont care about those things over there as we do here  he couldnt have cared very muchnor she  the doctor thinks that they are very much to be pitied  the doctor always was a little quixoticeh  i dont think that at all lady margaret  i mean in the way of being so very goodnatured and kind  her brother camedidnt he  her first husbands brother said mrs wortle blushing  her first husband  wellyou know what i mean lady margaret  yes i know what you mean  it is so very shocking isnt it  and so the two men have gone off together to look for the third  goodness mewhat a party they will be if they meet  do you think theyll quarrel  i dont know lady margaret  and that he should be a clergyman of the church of england  isnt it dreadful  what does the bishop say  has he heard all about it  the bishop has nothing to do with it  mr peacocke never held a curacy in the diocese  but he has preached here very oftenand has taken her to church with him  i suppose the bishop has been told  you may be sure that he knows it as well as you  we are so anxious you know about dear little gus  dear little gus was augustus momson the ladys nephew who was supposed to be the worstbehaved and certainly the stupidest boy in the school  augustus will not be hurt i should say  perhaps not directly  but my sister has i know very strong opinions on such subjects  now i want to ask you one thing  is it true thatsheremains here  she is still living in the schoolhouse  is that prudent mrs wortle  if you want to have an opinion on that subject lady margaret i would recommend you to ask the doctor  by which she meant to assert that lady margaret would not for the life of her dare to ask the doctor such a question  he has done what he has thought best  most goodnatured you mean mrs wortle  i mean what i say lady margaret  he has done what he has thought best looking at all the circumstances  he thinks that they are very worthy people and that they have been most cruelly illused  he has taken that into consideration  you call it goodnature  others perhaps may call itcharity  the wife though she at her heart deplored her husbands action in the matter was not going to own to another lady that he had been imprudent  i am sure i hope they will said lady margaret  then as she was taking her leave she made a suggestion  some of the boys will be taken away i suppose  the doctor probably expects that  i dont know what he expects said mrs wortle  some are always going and when they go others come in their places  as for me i wish he would give the school up altogether  perhaps he means it said lady margaret otherwise perhaps he wouldnt have been so goodnatured  then she took her departure  when her visitor was gone mrs wortle was very unhappy  she had been betrayed by her wrath into expressing that wish as to the giving up of the school  she knew well that the doctor had no such intention  she herself had more than once suggested it in her timid way but the doctor had treated her suggestions as being worth nothing  he had his ideas about mary who was undoubtedly a very pretty girl  mary might marry well and £20000 would probably assist her in doing so  when he was told of lady margarets hints he said in his wrath that he would send young momson away instantly if a word was said to him by the boys mamma  of course said he if the lad turns out a scapegrace as is like enough it will be because mrs peacocke had two husbands  it is often a question to me whether the religion of the world is not more odious than its want of religion  to this terrible suggestion poor mrs wortle did not dare to make any answer whatever    chapter xii  the stantiloup correspondence  we will now pass for a moment out of bowick parish and go over to buttercup  there at buttercup hall the squires house in the drawingroom were assembled mrs momson the squires wife lady margaret momson the rectors wife mrs rolland the wife of the bishop and the hon mrs stantiloup  a party was staying in the house collected for the purpose of entertaining the bishop and it would perhaps not have been possible to have got together in the diocese four ladies more likely to be hard upon our doctor  for though squire momson was not very fond of mrs stantiloup and had used strong language respecting her when he was anxious to send his boy to the doctors school mrs momson had always been of the other party and had in fact adhered to mrs stantiloup from the beginning of the quarrel  i do trust said mrs stantiloup that there will be an end to all this kind of thing now  do you mean an end to the school asked lady margaret  i do indeed  i always thought it matter of great regret that augustus should have been sent there after the scandalous treatment that bob received  bob was the little boy who had drank the champagne and required the carriage exercise  but i always heard that the school was quite popular said mrs rolland  i think youll find continued mrs stantiloup that there wont be much left of its popularity now  keeping that abominable woman under the same roof with the boys  no master of a school that wasnt absolutely blown up with pride would have taken such people as those peacockes without making proper inquiry  and then to let him preach in the church i suppose mr momson will allow you to send for augustus at once  this she said turning to mrs momson  mr momson thinks so much of the doctors scholarship said the mother apologetically  and we are so anxious that gus should do well when he goes to eton  what is latin and greek as compared to his soul asked lady margaret  no indeed said mrs rolland  she had found herself compelled as wife of the bishop to assent to the selfevident proposition which had been made  she was a quiet silent little woman whom the bishop had married in the days of his earliest preferment and who though she was delighted to find herself promoted to the society of the big people in the diocese had never quite lifted herself up into their sphere  though she had her ideas as to what it was to be a bishops wife she had never yet been quite able to act up to them  i know that young talbot is to leave said mrs stantiloup  i wrote to mrs talbot immediately when all this occurred and ive heard from her cousin lady grogram that the boy is not to go back after the holidays this happened to be altogether untrue  what she probably meant was that the boy should not go back if she could prevent his doing so  i feel quite sure said lady margaret that lady anne will not allow her boys to remain when she finds out what sort of inmates the doctor chooses to entertain  the lady anne spoken of was lady anne clifford the widowed mother of two boys who were intrusted to the doctors care  i do hope youll be firm about gus said mrs stantiloup to mrs momson if were not to put down this kind of thing what is the good of having any morals in the country at all  we might just as well live like pagans and do without any marriage services as they do in so many parts of the united states  i wonder what the bishop does think about it asked mrs momson of the bishops wife  it makes him very unhappy i know that said mrs rolland  of course he cannot interfere about the school  as for licensing the gentleman as a curate that was of course quite out of the question  at this moment mr momson the clergyman and the bishop came into the room and were offered as is usual on such occasions cold tea and the remains of the buttered toast  the squire was not there  had he been with the other gentlemen mrs stantiloup violent as she was would probably have held her tongue but as he was absent the opportunity was not bad for attacking the bishop on the subject under discussion  we were talking my lord about the bowick school  now the bishop was a man who could be very confidential with one lady but was apt to be guarded when men are concerned  to any one of those present he might have said what he thought had no one else been there to hear that would have been the expression of a private opinion but to speak before the four would have been tantamount to a public declaration  about the bowick school said he i hope there is nothing going wrong with the bowick school  you must have heard about mr peacocke said lady margaret  yes i have certainly heard of mr peacocke  he i believe has left dr wortles seminary  but she remains said mrs stantiloup with tragic energy  so i understandin the house but not as part of the establishment  does that make so much difference asked lady margaret  it does make a very great difference said lady margarets husband the parson wishing to help the bishop in his difficulty  i dont see it at all said mrs stantiloup  the main spirit in the matter is just as manifest whether the lady is or is not allowed to look after the boys linen  in fact i despise him for making the pretence her doing menial work about the house would injure no one  it is her presence therethe presence of a woman who has falsely pretended to be married when she knew very well that she had no husband  when she knew that she had two said lady margaret  and fancy lady margaretlady bracy absolutely asked her to go to carstairs  that woman was always infatuated about dr wortle  what would she have done if they had gone and this other man had followed his sisterinlaw there  but lord and lady bracy would ask any one to carstairsjust any one that they could get hold of  mr momson was one whose obstinacy was wont to give way when sufficiently attacked  even he after having been for two days subjected to the eloquence of mrs stantiloup acknowledged that the doctor took a great deal too much upon himself  he does it said mrs stantiloup just to show that there is nothing that he cant bring parents to assent to fancya woman living there as housekeeper with a man as usher pretending to be husband and wife when they knew all along that they were not married  mr momson who didnt care a straw about the morals of the man whose duty it was to teach his little boy his latin grammar or the morals of the woman who looked after his little boys waistcoats and trousers gave a halfassenting grunt  and you are to pay continued mrs stantiloup with considerable emphasisyou are to pay two hundred and fifty pounds ayear for such conduct as that  two hundred suggested the squire who cared as little for the money as he did for the morals  two hundred and fiftyevery shilling of it when you consider the extras  there are no extras as far as i can see  but then my boy is strong and healthy thank god said the squire taking his opportunity of having one fling at the lady  but while all this was going on he did give a halfassent that gus should be taken away at midsummer being partly moved thereto by a letter from the doctor in which he was told that his boy was not doing any good at the school  it was a week after that that mrs stantiloup wrote the following letter to her friend lady grogram after she had returned home from buttercup hall  lady grogram was a great friend of hers and was first cousin to that mrs talbot who had a son at the school  lady grogram was an old woman of strong mind but small means who was supposed to be potential over those connected with her  mrs stantiloup feared that she could not be efficacious herself either with mr or mrs talbot but she hoped that she might carry her purpose through lady grogram  it may be remembered that she had declared at buttercup hall that young talbot was not to go back to bowick  but this had been a figure of speech as has been already explained   my dear lady grogramsince i got your last letter i have been staying with the momsons at buttercup  it was awfully dull  he and she are i think the stupidest people that ever i met  none of those momsons have an idea among them  they are just as heavy and inharmonious as their name  lady margaret was one of the party  she would have been better only that our excellent bishop was there too and lady margaret thought it well to show off all her graces before the bishop and the bishops wife i never saw such a dowdy in all my life as mrs rolland  he is all very well and looks at any rate like a gentleman  it was i take it that which got him his diocese  they say the queen saw him once and was taken by his manners  but i did one good thing at buttercup  i got mr momson to promise that that boy of his should not go back to bowick  dr wortle has become quite intolerable  i think he is determined to show that whatever he does people shall put up with it  it is not only the most expensive establishment of the kind in all england but also the worst conducted you know of course how all this matter about that woman stands now  she is remaining there at bowick absolutely living in the house calling herself mrs peacocke while the man she was living with has gone off with her brotherinlaw to look for her husband  did you ever hear of such a mess as that  and the doctor expects that fathers and mothers will still send their boys to such a place as that  i am very much mistaken if he will not find it altogether deserted before christmas  lord carstairs is already gone this was at any rate disingenuous as she had been very severe when at buttercup on all the carstairs family because of their declared and perverse friendship for the doctor mr momson though he is quite incapable of seeing the meaning of anything has determined to take his boy away  she may thank me at any rate for that  i have heard that lady anne cliffords two boys will both leave  in one sense she had heard it because the suggestion had been made by herself at buttercup i do hope that mr talbots dear little boy will not be allowed to return to such contamination as that  fancythe man and the woman living there in that way together and the doctor keeping the woman on after he knew it all it is really so horrible that one doesnt know how to talk about it  when the bishop was at buttercup i really felt almost obliged to be silent  i know very well that mrs talbot is always ready to take your advice as for him men very often do not think so much about these things as they ought  but he will not like his boy to be nearly the only one left at the school  i have not heard of one who is to remain for certain  how can it be possible that any boy who has a mother should be allowed to remain there  do think of this and do your best  i need not tell you that nothing ought to be so dear to us as a high tone of moralsmost sincerely yours  juliana stantiloup   we need not pursue this letter further than to say that when it reached mr talbots hands which it did through his wife he spoke of mrs stantiloup in language which shocked his wife considerably though she was not altogether unaccustomed to strong language on his part  mr talbot and the doctor had been at school together and at oxford and were friends  i will give now a letter that was written by the doctor to mr momson in answer to one in which that gentleman signified his intention of taking little gus away from the school   my dear mr momsonafter what you have said of course i shall not expect your boy back after the holidays  tell his mamma with my compliments that he shall take all his things home with him  as a rule i do charge for a quarter in advance when a boy is taken away suddenly without notice and apparently without cause  but i shall not do so at the present moment either to you or to any parent who may withdraw his son  a circumstance has happened which though it cannot impair the utility of my school and ought not to injure its character may still be held as giving offence to certain persons  i will not be driven to alter my conduct by what i believe to be foolish misconception on their part but they have a right to their own opinions and i will not mulct them because of their conscientious convictionsyours faithfully  jeffrey wortle  if you come across any friend who has a boy here you are perfectly at liberty to show him or her this letter   the defection of the momsons wounded the doctor no doubt  he was aware that mrs stantiloup had been at buttercup and that the bishop also had been thereand he could put two and two together but it hurt him to think that one so staunch though so stupid as mrs momson should be turned from her purpose by such a woman as mrs stantiloup  and he got other letters on the subject  here is one from lady anne clifford   dear doctoryou know how safe i think my dear boys are with you and how much obliged i am both to you and your wife for all your kindness but people are saying things to me about one of the masters at your school and his wife  is there any reason why i should be afraid  you will see how thoroughly i trust you when i ask you the questionyours very sincerely  anne clifford   now lady anne clifford was a sweet confiding affectionate but not very wise woman  in a letter written not many days before to mary wortle who had on one occasion been staying with her she said that she was at that time in the same house with the bishop and mrs rolland  of course the doctor knew again how to put two and two together  then there came a letter from mr talbot   dear wortleso you are boiling for yourself another pot of hot water i never saw such a fellow as you are for troubles  old mother shipton has been writing such a letter to our old woman and explaining that no boys soul would any longer be worth looking after if he be left in your hands dont you go and get me into a scrape more than you can help but you may be quite sure of this that if i had as many sons as priam i should send them all to youonly i think that the cheques would be very long in comingyours always  john talbot   the doctor answered this at greater length than he had done in writing to mr momson who was not specially his friend   my dear talbotyou may be quite sure that i shall not repeat to any one what you have told me of mother shipton  i knew however pretty well what she was doing and what i had to expect from her  it is astonishing to me that such a woman should still have the power of persuading any oneastonishing also that any human being should continue to hate as she hates me  she has often tried to do me an injury but she has never succeeded yet  at any rate she will not bend me  though my school should be broken up tomorrow which i do not think probable i should still have enough to live uponwhich is more by all accounts than her unfortunate husband can say for himself  the facts are these  more than twelve months ago i got an assistant named peacocke a clergyman an oxford man and formerly a fellow of trinitya man quite superior to anything i have a right to expect in my school  he had gone as a classical professor to a college in the united statesa rash thing to do no doubtand had there married a widow which was rasher still  the lady came here with him and undertook the charge of the schoolhousewith a separate salary and an admirable person in the place she was  then it turned out as no doubt you have heard that her former husband was alive when they were married  they ought probably to have separated but they didnt  they came here instead and here they were followed by the brother of the husbandwho i take it is now dead though of that we know nothing certain  that he should have told me his position is more than any man has a right to expect from another  fortune had been most unkind to him and for her sake he was bound to do the best that he could with himself  i cannot bring myself to be angry with him though i cannot defend him by strict laws of right and wrong  i have advised him to go back to america and find out if the man be in truth dead  if so let him come back and marry the woman again before all the world  i shall be ready to marry them and to ask him and her to my house afterwards  in the mean time what was to become of her  let her go into lodgings said the bishop  go to lodgings at broughton  you know what sort of lodgings she would get there among psalmsinging greengrocers who would tell her of her misfortune every day of her life  i would not subject her to the misery of going and seeking for a home  i told him when i persuaded him to go that she should have the rooms they were then occupying while he was away  in settling this of course i had to make arrangements for doing in our own establishment the work which had lately fallen to her share  i mention this for the sake of explaining that she has got nothing to do with the school  no doubt the boys are under the same roof with her  will your boys morals be the worse  it seems that gustavus momsons will  you know the father do you not  i wonder whether anything will ever affect his morals  now i have told you everything  not that i have doubted you but as you have been told so much i have thought it well that you should have the whole story from myself  what effect it may have upon the school i do not know  the only boy of whose secession i have yet heard is young momson  but probably there will be others  four new boys were to have come but i have already heard from the father of one that he has changed his mind  i think i can trace an acquaintance between him and mother shipton  if the body of the school should leave me i will let you know at once as you might not like to leave your boy under such circumstances  you may be sure of this that here the lady remains until her husband returns  i am not going to be turned from my purpose at this time of day by anything that mother shipton may say or doyours always  jeffrey wortle   end of vol

puddicombes boot  it was not to be expected that the matter should be kept out of the county newspaper or even from those in the metropolis  there was too much of romance in the story too good a tale to be told for any such hope  the mans former life and the womans the disappearance of her husband and his reappearance after his reported death the departure of the couple from st louis and the coming of lefroy to bowick formed together a most attractive subject  but it could not be told without reference to dr wortles school to dr wortles position as clergyman of the parishand also to the fact which was considered by his enemies to be of all the facts the most damning that mr peacocke had for a time been allowed to preach in the parish church  the broughton gazette a newspaper which was supposed to be altogether devoted to the interest of the diocese was very eloquent on this subject  we do not desire said the broughton gazette to make any remarks as to the management of dr wortles school  we leave all that between him and the parents of the boys who are educated there  we are perfectly aware that dr wortle himself is a scholar and that his school has been deservedly successful  it is advisable no doubt that in such an establishment none should be employed whose lives are openly immoralbut as we have said before it is not our purpose to insist upon this  parents if they feel themselves to be aggrieved can remedy the evil by withdrawing their sons  but when we consider the great power which is placed in the hands of an incumbent of a parish that he is endowed as it were with the freehold of his pulpit that he may put up whom he will to preach the gospel to his parishioners even in a certain degree in opposition to his bishop we think that we do no more than our duty in calling attention to such a case as this  then the whole story was told at great length so as to give the we of the broughton gazette a happy opportunity of making its leading article not only much longer but much more amusing than usual  we must say continued the writer as he concluded his narrative that this man should not have been allowed to preach in the bowick pulpit  he is no doubt a clergyman of the church of england and dr wortle was within his rights in asking for his assistance but the incumbent of a parish is responsible for those he employs and that responsibility now rests on dr wortle  there was a great deal in this that made the doctor very angryso angry that he did not know how to restrain himself  the matter had been argued as though he had employed the clergyman in his church after he had known the history  for aught i know he said to mrs wortle any curate coming to me might have three wives all alive  that would be most improbable said mrs wortle  so was all this improbablejust as improbable  nothing could be more improbable  do we not all feel overcome with pity for the poor woman because she encountered trouble that was so improbable  how much more improbable was it that i should come across a clergyman who had encountered such improbabilities  in answer to this mrs wortle could only shake her head not at all understanding the purport of her husbands argument  but what was said about his school hurt him more than what was said about his church  in regard to his church he was impregnable  not even the bishop could touch himor even annoy him much  but this pennyaliner as the doctor indignantly called him had attacked him in his tenderest point  after declaring that he did not intend to meddle with the school he had gone on to point out that an immoral person had been employed there and had then invited all parents to take away their sons  he doesnt know what moral and immoral means said the doctor again pleading his own case to his own wife  as far as i know it would be hard to find a man of a higher moral feeling than mr peacocke or a woman than his wife  i suppose they ought to have separated when it was found out said mrs wortle  no no he shouted i hold that they were right  he was right to cling to her and she was bound to obey him  such a fellow as thatand he crushed the paper up in his hand in his wrath as though he were crushing the editor himselfsuch a fellow as that knows nothing of morality nothing of honour nothing of tenderness  what he did i would have done and ill stick to him through it all in spite of the bishop in spite of the newspapers and in spite of all the rancour of all my enemies  then he got up and walked about the room in such a fury that his wife did not dare to speak to him  should he or should he not answer the newspaper that was a question which for the first two days after he had read the article greatly perplexed him  he would have been very ready to advise any other man what to do in such a case  never notice what may be written about you in a newspaper he would have said  such is the advice which a man always gives to his friend  but when the case comes to himself he finds it sometimes almost impossible to follow it  whats the use  who cares what the broughton gazette says let it pass and it will be forgotten in three days  if you stir the mud yourself it will hang about you for months  it is just what they want you to do  they cannot go on by themselves and so the subject dies away from them but if you write rejoinders they have a contributor working for them for nothing and one whose writing will be much more acceptable to their readers than any that comes from their own anonymous scribes  it is very disagreeable to be worried like a rat by a dog but why should you go into the kennel and unnecessarily put yourself in the way of it  the doctor had said this more than once to clerical friends who were burning with indignation at something that had been written about them  but now he was burning himself and could hardly keep his fingers from pen and ink  in this emergency he went to mr puddicombe not as he said to himself for advice but in order that he might hear what mr puddicombe would have to say about it  he did not like mr puddicombe but he believed in himwhich was more than he quite did with the bishop  mr puddicombe would tell him his true thoughts  mr puddicombe would be unpleasant very likely but he would be sincere and friendly  so he went to mr puddicombe  it seems to me he said almost necessary that i should answer such allegations as these for the sake of truth  you are not responsible for the truth of the broughton gazette said mr puddicombe  but i am responsible to a certain degree that false reports shall not be spread abroad as to what is done in my church  you can contradict nothing that the newspaper has said  it is implied said the doctor that i allowed mr peacocke to preach in my church after i knew his marriage was informal  there is no such statement in the paragraph said mr puddicombe after attentive reperusal of the article  the writer has written in a hurry as such writers generally do but has made no statement such as you presume  were you to answer him you could only do so by an elaborate statement of the exact facts of the case  it can hardly be worth your while in defending yourself against the broughton gazette to tell the whole story in public of mr peacockes life and fortunes  you would pass it over altogether  certainly i would  and so acknowledge the truth of all that the newspaper says  i do not know that the paper says anything untrue said mr puddicombe not looking the doctor in the face with his eyes turned to the ground but evidently with the determination to say what he thought however unpleasant it might be  the fact is that you have fallen into amisfortune  i dont acknowledge it at all said the doctor  all your friends at any rate will think so let the story be told as it may  it was a misfortune that this lady whom you had taken into your establishment should have proved not to be the gentlemans wife  when i am taking a walk through the fields and get one of my feet deeper than usual into the mud i always endeavour to bear it as well as i may before the eyes of those who meet me rather than make futile efforts to get rid of the dirt and look as though nothing had happened  the dirt when it is rubbed and smudged and scraped is more palpably dirt than the honest mud  i will not admit that i am dirty at all said the doctor  nor do i in the case which i describe  i admit nothing but i let those who see me form their own opinion  if any one asks me about my boot i tell him that it is a matter of no consequence  i advise you to do the same  you will only make the smudges more palpable if you write to the broughton gazette  would you say nothing to the boys parents asked the doctor  there perhaps i am not a judge as i never kept a schoolbut i think not  if any father writes to you then tell him the truth  if the matter had gone no farther than this the doctor might probably have left mr puddicombes house with a sense of thankfulness for the kindness rendered to him but he did go farther and endeavoured to extract from his friend some sense of the injustice shown by the bishop the stantiloups the newspaper and his enemies in general through the diocese  but here he failed signally  i really think dr wortle that you could not have expected it otherwise  expect that people should lie  i dont know about lies  if people have told lies i have not seen them or heard them  i dont think the bishop has lied  i dont mean the bishop though i do think that he has shown a great want of what i may call liberality towards a clergyman in his diocese  no doubt he thinks you have been wrong  by liberality you mean sympathy why should you expect him to sympathise with your wrongdoing  what have i done wrong  you have countenanced immorality and deceit in a brother clergyman  i deny it said the doctor rising up impetuously from his chair  then i do not understand the position dr wortle  that is all i can say  to my thinking mr puddicombe i never came across a better man than mr peacocke in my life  i cannot make comparisons  as to the best man i ever met in my life i might have to acknowledge that even he had done wrong in certain circumstances  as the matter is forced upon me i have to express my opinion that a great sin was committed both by the man and by the woman you not only condone the sin but declare both by your words and deeds that you sympathise with the sin as well as with the sinners  you have no right to expect that the bishop will sympathise with you in thatnor can it be but that in such a country as this the voices of many will be loud against you  and yours as loud as any said the doctor angrily  that is unkind and unjust said mr puddicombe  what i have said i have said to yourself and not to others and what i have said i have said in answer to questions asked by yourself  then the doctor apologised with what grace he could  but when he left the house his heart was still bitter against mr puddicombe  he was almost ashamed of himself as he rode back to bowickfirst because he had condescended to ask advice and then because after having asked it he had been so thoroughly scolded  there was no one whom mr puddicombe would admit to have been wrong in the matter except the doctor himself  and yet though he had been so counselled and so scolded he had found himself obliged to apologize before he left the house  and too he had been made to understand that he had better not rush into print though the broughton gazette should come to the attack again and again he must hold his peace  that reference to mr puddicombes dirty boot had convinced him  he could see the thoroughly squalid look of the boot that had been scraped in vain and appreciate the wholesomeness of the unadulterated mud  there was more in the man than he had ever acknowledged before  there was a consistency in him and a courage and an honesty of purpose  but there was no softness of heart  had there been a grain of tenderness there he could not have spoken so often as he had done of mrs peacocke without expressing some grief at the unmerited sorrows to which that poor lady had been subjected  his own heart melted with ruth as he thought while riding home of the cruelty to which she had been and was subjected  she was all alone there waiting waiting waiting till the dreary days should have gone by  and if no good news should come if mr peacocke should return with tidings that her husband was alive and well what should she do then  what would the world then have in store for her  if it were me said the doctor to himself id take her to some other home and treat her as my wife in spite of all the puddicombes in creationin spite of all the bishops  the doctor though he was a selfasserting and somewhat violent man was thoroughly softhearted  it is to be hoped that the reader has already learned as much as thata man with a kind tender affectionate nature it would perhaps be unfair to raise a question whether he would have done as much been so willing to sacrifice himself for a plain woman  had mr stantiloup or sir samuel griffin if he had suddenly come again to life been found to have prior wives also living would the doctor have found shelter for them in their ignominy and trouble  mrs wortle who knew her husband thoroughly was sure that he would not have done so  mrs peacocke was a very beautiful woman and the doctor was a man who thoroughly admired beauty  to say that mrs wortle was jealous would be quite untrue  she liked to see her husband talking to a pretty woman because he would be sure to be in a good humour and sure to make the best of himself  she loved to see him shine  but she almost wished that mrs peacocke had been ugly because there would not then have been so much danger about the school  im just going up to see her said the doctor as soon as he got homejust to ask her what she wants  i dont think she wants anything said mrs wortle weakly  does she not  she must be a very odd woman if she can live there all day alone and not want to see a human creature  i was with her yesterday  and therefore i will call today said the doctor leaving the room with his hat on  when he was shown up into the sittingroom he found mrs peacocke with a newspaper in her hand  he could see at a glance that it was a copy of the broughton gazette and could see also the length and outward show of the very article which he had been discussing with mr puddicombe  dr wortle she said if you dont mind i will go away from this  but i do mind  why should you go away  they have been writing about me in the newspapers  that was to be expected  but they have been writing about you  that was to have been expected also  you dont suppose they can hurt me  this was a false boast but in such conversations he was almost bound to boast  it is i then am hurting you  youoh dear no not in the least  but i do  they talk of boys going away from the school  boys will go and boys will come but we run on for ever said the doctor playfully  i can well understand that it should be so said mrs peacocke passing over the doctors parody as though unnoticed and i perceive that i ought not to be here  where ought you to be then said he intending simply to carry on his joke  where indeed  there is no where  but wherever i may do least injury to innocent peopleto people who have not been driven by storms out of the common path of life  for this place i am peculiarly unfit  will you find any place where you will be made more welcome  i think not  then let me manage the rest  you have been reading that dastardly article in the paper  it will have no effect upon me  look here mrs peacockethen he got up and held her hand as though he were going but he remained some moments while he was still speaking to herstill holding her handit was settled between your husband and me when he went away that you should remain here under my charge till his return  i am bound to him to find a home for you  i think you are as much bound to obey himwhich you can only do by remaining here  i would wish to obey him certainly  you ought to do sofrom the peculiar circumstances more especially dont trouble your mind about the school but do as he desired  there is no question but that you must do so  goodbye  mrs wortle or i will come and see you tomorrow  then and not till then he dropped her hand  on the next day mrs wortle did call though these visits were to her an intolerable nuisance  but it was certainly better that she should alternate the visits with the doctor than that he should go every day the doctor had declared that charity required that one of them should see the poor woman daily  he was quite willing that they should perform the task day and day aboutbut should his wife omit the duty he must go in his wifes place  what would all the world of bowick say if the doctor were to visit a lady a young and a beautiful lady every day whereas his wife visited the lady not at all  therefore they took it turn about except that sometimes the doctor accompanied his wife  the doctor had once suggested that his wife should take the poor lady out in her carriage  but against this even mrs wortle had rebelled  under such circumstances as hers she ought not to be seen driving about said mrs wortle  the doctor had submitted to this but still thought that the world of bowick was very cruel  mrs wortle though she made no complaint thought that she was used cruelly in the matter  there had been an intention of going into brittany during these summer holidays  the little tour had been almost promised but the affairs of mrs peacocke were of such a nature as not to allow the doctor to be absent  you and mary can go and henry will go with you henry was a bachelor brother of mrs wortle who was always very much at the doctors disposal and at hers  but certainly she was not going to quit england not going to quit home at all while her husband remained there and while mrs peacocke was an inmate of the school  it was not that she was jealous  the idea was absurd  but she knew very well what mrs stantiloup would say    chapter ii  everybodys business  but there arose a trouble greater than that occasioned by the broughton gazette there came out an article in a london weekly newspaper called everybodys business which nearly drove the doctor mad  this was on the last saturday of the holidays  the holidays had been commenced in the middle of july and went on till the end of august  things had not gone well at bowick during these weeks  the parents of all the four newlyexpected boys hadchanged their minds  one father had discovered that he could not afford it  another declared that the mother could not be got to part with her darling quite so soon as he had expected  a third had found that a private tutor at home would best suit his purposes while the fourth boldly said that he did not like to send his boy because of the fuss which had been made about mr and mrs peacocke  had this last come alone the doctor would probably have resented such a communication but following the others as it did he preferred the fourth man to any of the other three  miserable cowards he said to himself as he docketed the letters and put them away  but the greatest blow of allof all blows of this sortcame to him from poor lady anne clifford  she wrote a piteous letter to him in which she implored him to allow her to take her two boys away  my dear doctor wortle she said so many people have been telling so many dreadful things about this horrible affair that i do not dare to send my darling boys back to bowick again  uncle clifford and lord robert both say that i should be very wrong  the marchioness has said so much about it that i dare not go against her  you know what my own feelings are about you and dear mrs wortle but i am not my own mistress  they all tell me that it is my first duty to think about the dear boys welfare and of course that is true  i hope you wont be very angry with me and will write one line to say that you forgive meyours most sincerely  anne clifford   in answer to this the doctor did write as follows   my dear lady anneof course your duty is very plainto do what you think best for the boys and it is natural enough that you should follow the advice of your relatives and theirsfaithfully yours  jeffrey wortle   he could not bring himself to write in a more friendly tone or to tell her that he forgave her  his sympathies were not with her  his sympathies at the present moment were only with mrs peacocke  but then lady anne clifford was not a beautiful woman as was mrs peacocke  this was a great blow  two other boys had also been summoned away making five in all whose premature departure was owing altogether to the virulent tongue of that wretched old mother shipton  and there had been four who were to come in the place of four others who in the course of nature were going to carry on their more advanced studies elsewhere vacancies such as these had always been preoccupied long beforehand by ambitious parents  these very four places had been preoccupied but now they were all vacant  there would be nine empty beds in the school when it met again after the holidays and the doctor well understood that nine beds remaining empty would soon cause others to be emptied  it is success that creates success and decay that produces decay  gradual decay he knew that he could not endure  he must shut up his schoolgive up his employmentand retire altogether from the activity of life  he felt that if it came to this with him he must in very truth turn his face to the wall and die  would itwould it really come to that that mrs stantiloup should have altogether conquered him in the combat that had sprung up between them  but yet he would not give up mrs peacocke  indeed circumstanced as he was he could not give her up  he had promised not only her but her absent husband that until his return there should be a home for her in the schoolhouse  there would be a cowardice in going back from his word which was altogether foreign to his nature  he could not bring himself to retire from the fight even though by doing so he might save himself from the actual final slaughter which seemed to be imminent  he thought only of making fresh attacks upon his enemy instead of meditating flight from those which were made upon him  as a dog when another dog has got him well by the ear thinks not at all of his own wound but only how he may catch his enemy by the lip so was the doctor in regard to mrs stantiloup  when the two clifford boys were taken away he took some joy to himself in remembering that mr stantiloup could not pay his butchers bill  then just at the end of the holidays some goodnatured friend sent to him a copy of everybodys business there is no duty which a man owes to himself more clearly than that of throwing into the wastepaper basket unsearched and even unopened all newspapers sent to him without a previouslydeclared purpose  the sender has either written something himself which he wishes to force you to read or else he has been desirous of wounding you by some illnatured criticism upon yourself  everybodys business was a paper which in the natural course of things did not find its way into the bowick rectory and the doctor though he was no doubt acquainted with the title had never even looked at its columns  it was the purpose of the periodical to amuse its readers as its name declared with the private affairs of their neighbours  it went boldly about its work excusing itself by the assertion that jones was just as well inclined to be talked about as smith was to hear whatever could be said about jones  as both parties were served what could be the objection it was in the main goodnatured and probably did most frequently gratify the joneses while it afforded considerable amusement to the listless and numerous smiths of the world  if you cant read and understand joness speech in parliament you may at any rate have mind enough to interest yourself with the fact that he never composed a word of it in his own room without a ring on his finger and a flower in his buttonhole  it may also be agreeable to know that walker the poet always takes a muttonchop and two glasses of sherry at halfpast one  everybodys business did this for everybody to whom such excitement was agreeable  but in managing everybodys business in that fashion let a writer be as goodnatured as he may and let the principle be ever so wellfounded that nobody is to be hurt still there are dangers  it is not always easy to know what will hurt and what will not  and then sometimes there will come a temptation to be not spiteful but specially amusing  there must be danger and a writer will sometimes be indiscreet  personalities will lead to libels even when the libeller has been most innocent  it may be that after all the poor poet never drank a glass of sherry before dinner in his lifeit may be that a little toastandwater even with his dinner gives him all the refreshment that he wants and that two glasses of alcoholic mixture in the middle of the day shall seem when imputed to him to convey a charge of downright inebriety  but the writer has perhaps learned to regard two glasses of meridian wine as but a moderate amount of sustentation  this man is much flattered if it be given to be understood of him that he falls in love with every pretty woman that he seeswhereas another will think that he has been made subject to a foul calumny by such insinuation  everybodys business fell into some such mistake as this in that very amusing article which was written for the delectation of its readers in reference to dr wortle and mrs peacocke  the broughton gazette no doubt confined itself to the clerical and highly moral views of the case and having dealt with the subject chiefly on behalf of the close and the admirers of the close had made no allusion to the fact that mrs peacocke was a very pretty woman  one or two other local papers had been more scurrilous and had with ambiguous and timid words alluded to the doctors personal admiration for the lady  these or the rumours created by them had reached one of the funniest and lightesthanded of the contributors to everybodys business and he had concocted an amusing articlewhich he had not intended to be at all libellous which he had thought to be only funny  he had not appreciated probably the tragedy of the ladys position or the sanctity of that of the gentleman  there was comedy in the idea of the doctor having sent one husband away to america to look after the other while he consoled the wife in england it must be admitted said the writer that the doctor has the best of it  while one gentleman is gouging the otheras cannot but be expectedthe doctor will be at any rate in security enjoying the smiles of beauty under his own figtree at bowick  after a hot morning with tupto in the school there will be amo in the cool of the evening and this was absolutely sent to him by some goodnatured friend  the funny writer obtained a popularity wider probably than he had expected  his words reached mrs stantiloup as well as the doctor and were read even in the bishops palace  they were quoted even in the broughton gazette not with approbation but in a high tone of moral severity  see the nature of the language to which dr wortles conduct has subjected the whole of the diocese  that was the tone of the criticism made by the broughton gazette on the article in everybodys business what else has he a right to expect said mrs stantiloup to mrs rolland having made quite a journey into broughton for the sake of discussing it at the palace  there she explained it all to mrs rolland having herself studied the passage so as fully to appreciate the virus contained in it  he passes all the morning in the school whipping the boys himself because he has sent mr peacocke away and then amuses himself in the evening by making love to mr peacockes wife as he calls her  dr wortle when he read and reread the article and when the jokes which were made upon it reached his ears as they were sure to do was nearly maddened by what he called the heartless iniquity of the world but his state became still worse when he received an affectionate but solemn letter from the bishop warning him of his danger  an affectionate letter from a bishop must surely be the most disagreeable missive which a parish clergyman can receive  affection from one man to another is not natural in letters  a bishop never writes affectionately unless he means to reprove severely  when he calls a clergyman his dear brother in christ he is sure to go on to show that the man so called is altogether unworthy of the name  so it was with a letter now received at bowick in which the bishop expressed his opinion that dr wortle ought not to pay any further visits to mrs peacocke till she should have settled herself down with one legitimate husband let that legitimate husband be who it might  the bishop did not indeed at first make reference by name to everybodys business but he stated that the metropolitan press had taken up the matter and that scandal would take place in the diocese if further cause were given  it is not enough to be innocent said the bishop but men must know that we are so  then there came a sharp and pressing correspondence between the bishop and the doctor which lasted four or five days  the doctor without referring to any other portion of the bishops letter demanded to know to what metropolitan newspaper the bishop had alluded as if any such paper had spread scandalous imputations as to him the doctor respecting the lady in question it would be his the doctors duty to proceed against that newspaper for libel  in answer to this the bishop in a note much shorter and much less affectionate than his former letter said that he did not wish to name any metropolitan newspaper  but the doctor would not of course put up with such an answer as this  he wrote very solemnly now if not affectionately  his lordship had spoken of scandal in the diocese the words said the doctor contained a most grave charge  he did not mean to say that any such accusation had been made by the bishop himself but such accusation must have been made by some one at least of the london newspapers or the bishop would not have been justified in what he has written  under such circumstances he dr wortle thought himself entitled to demand from the bishop the name of the newspaper in question and the date on which the article had appeared  in answer to this there came no written reply but a copy of the everybodys business which the doctor had already seen  he had no doubt known from the first that it was the funny paragraph about tupto and amo to which the bishop had referred  but in the serious steps which he now intended to take he was determined to have positive proof from the hands of the bishop himself  the bishop had not directed the pernicious newspaper with his own hands but if called upon could not deny that it had been sent from the palace by his orders  having received it the doctor wrote back at once as follows   right reverend and dear lordany word coming from your lordship to me is of grave importance as should i think be all words coming from a bishop to his clergy and they are of special importance when containing a reproof whether deserved or undeserved  the scurrilous and vulgar attack made upon me in the newspaper which your lordship has sent to me would not have been worthy of my serious notice had it not been made worthy by your lordship as being the ground on which such a letter was written to me as that of your lordships of the 12th instant  now it has been invested with so much solemnity by your lordships notice of it that i feel myself obliged to defend myself against it by public action  if i have given just cause of scandal to the diocese i will retire both from my living and from my school  but before doing so i will endeavour to prove that i have done neither  this i can only do by publishing in a court of law all the circumstances in reference to my connection with mr and mrs peacocke  as regards myself this though necessary will be very painful  as regards them i am inclined to think that the more the truth is known the more general and the more generous will be the sympathy felt for their position  as the newspaper sent to me no doubt by your lordships orders from the palace has been accompanied by no letter it may be necessary that your lordship should be troubled by a subpoena so as to prove that the newspaper alluded to by your lordship is the one against which my proceedings will be taken  it will be necessary of course that i should show that the libel in question has been deemed important enough to bring down upon me ecclesiastical rebuke of such a nature as to make my remaining in the diocese unbearableunless it is shown that that rebuke was undeserved   there was consternation in the palace when this was received  so stiffnecked a man so obstinate so unclericalso determined to make much of little  the bishop had felt himself bound to warn a clergyman that for the sake of the church he could not do altogether as other men might  no doubt certain ladies had got around himespecially lady margaret momsonfilling his ears with the horrors of the doctors proceedings  the gentleman who had written the article about the greek and the latin words had seen the truth of the thing at onceso said lady margaret  the doctor had condoned the offence committed by the peacockes because the woman had been beautiful and was repaying himself for his mercy by basking in her loveliness  there was no saying that there was not some truth in this  mrs wortle herself entertained a feeling of the same kind  it was palpable on the face of it to all except dr wortle himselfand to mrs peacocke  mrs stantiloup who had made her way into the palace was quite convincing on this point  everybody knew she said that the doctor went across and saw the lady all alone every day everybody did not know that  if everybody had been accurate everybody would have asserted that he did this thing every other day  but the matter as it was represented to the bishop by the ladies with the assistance of one or two clergymen in the close certainly seemed to justify his lordships interference  but this that was threatened was very terrible  there was a determination about the doctor which made it clear to the bishop that he would be as bad as he said  when he the bishop had spoken of scandal of course he had not intended to say that the doctors conduct was scandalous nor had he said anything of the kind  he had used the word in its proper senseand had declared that offence would be created in the minds of people unless an injurious report were stopped  it is not enough to be innocent he had said but men must know that we are so  he had declared in that his belief in dr wortles innocence  but yet there might no doubt be an action for libel against the newspaper  and when damages came to be considered much weight would be placed naturally on the attention which the bishop had paid to the article  the result of this was that the bishop invited the doctor to come and spend a night with him in the palace  the doctor went reaching the palace only just before dinner  during dinner and in the drawingroom dr wortle made himself very pleasant  he was a man who could always be soft and gentle in a drawingroom  to see him talking with mrs rolland and the bishops daughters you would not have thought that there was anything wrong with him  the discussion with the bishop came after that and lasted till midnight  it will be for the disadvantage of the diocese that this matter should be dragged into courtand for the disadvantage of the church in general that a clergyman should seem to seek such redress against his bishop  so said the bishop  but the doctor was obdurate  i seek no redress he said against my bishop  i seek redress against a newspaper which has calumniated me  it is your good opinion my lordyour good opinion or your ill opinion which is the breath of my nostrils  i have to refer to you in order that i may show that this paper which i should otherwise have despised has been strong enough to influence that opinion    chapter iii  amo in the cool of the evening  the doctor went up to london and was told by his lawyers that an action for damages probably would lie  amo in the cool of the evening certainly meant making love  there could be no doubt that allusion was made to mrs peacocke  to accuse a clergyman of a parish and a schoolmaster of making love to a lady so circumstanced as mrs peacocke no doubt was libellous  presuming that the libel could not be justified he would probably succeed  justified said the doctor almost shrieking to his lawyers i never said a word to the lady in my life except in pure kindness and charity  every word might have been heard by all the world  nevertheless had all the world been present he would not have held her hand so tenderly or so long as he had done on a certain occasion which has been mentioned  they will probably apologise said the lawyer  shall i be bound to accept their apology  no not bound but you would have to show if you went on with the action that the damage complained of was of so grievous a nature that the apology would not salve it  the damage has been already done said the doctor eagerly  i have received the bishops rebukea rebuke in which he has said that i have brought scandal upon the diocese  rebukes break no bones said the lawyer  can you show that it will serve to prevent boys from coming to your school  it may not improbably force me to give up the living  i certainly will not remain there subject to the censure of the bishop  i do not in truth want any damages  i would not accept money  i only want to set myself right before the world  it was then agreed that the necessary communication should be made by the lawyer to the newspaper proprietors so as to put the matter in a proper train for the action  after this the doctor returned home just in time to open his school with his diminished forces  at the last moment there was another defaulter so that there were now no more than twenty pupils  the school had not been so low as this for the last fifteen years  there had never been less than eightandtwenty before since mrs stantiloup had first begun her campaign  it was heartbreaking to him  he felt as though he were almost ashamed to go into his own school  in directing his housekeeper to send the diminished orders to the tradesmen he was thoroughly ashamed of himself in giving his directions to the usher as to the redivided classes he was thoroughly ashamed of himself  he wished that there was no school and would have been contented now to give it all up and to confine marys fortune to £10000 instead of £20000 had it not been that he could not bear to confess that he was beaten  the boys themselves seemed almost to carry their tails between their legs as though even they were ashamed of their own school  if as was too probable another halfdozen should go at christmas then the thing must be abandoned  and how could he go on as rector of the parish with the abominable empty building staring him in the face every moment of his life  i hope you are not really going to law said his wife to him  i must my dear  i have no other way of defending my honour  go to law with the bishop  no not with the bishop  but the bishop would be brought into it  yes he will certainly be brought into it  and as an enemy  what i mean is that he will be brought in very much against his own will  not a doubt about it said the doctor  but he will have brought it altogether upon himself  how he can have condescended to send that scurrilous newspaper is more than i can understand  that one gentleman should have so treated another is to me incomprehensible  but that a bishop should have done so to a clergyman of his own diocese shakes all my old convictions  there is a vulgarity about it a meanness of thinking an aptitude to suspect all manner of evil which i cannot fathom  what did he really think that i was making love to the woman did he doubt that i was treating her and her husband with kindness as one human being is bound to treat another in affliction did he believe in his heart that i sent the man away in order that i might have an opportunity for a wicked purpose of my own  it is impossible  when i think of myself and of him i cannot believe it  that woman who has succeeded at last in stirring up all this evil against meeven she could not believe it  her malice is sufficient to make her conduct intelligiblebut there is no malice in the bishops mind against me  he would infinitely sooner live with me on pleasant terms if he could justify his doing so to his conscience  he has been stirred to do this in the execution of some presumed duty  i do not accuse him of malice  but i do accuse him of a meanness of intellect lower than what i could have presumed to have been possible in a man so placed  i never thought him clever i never thought him great i never thought him even to be a gentleman in the fullest sense of the word but i did think he was a man  this is the performance of a creature not worthy to be called so  oh jeffrey he did not believe all that  what did he believe  when he read that article did he see in it a true rebuke against a hypocrite or did he see in it a scurrilous attack upon a brother clergyman a neighbour and a friend  if the latter he certainly would not have been instigated by it to write to me such a letter as he did  he certainly would not have sent the paper to me had he felt it to contain a foulmouthed calumny  he wanted you to know what people of that sort were saying  yes he wanted me to know that and he wanted me to know also that the knowledge had come to me from my bishop  i should have thought evil of any one who had sent me the vile ribaldry  but coming from him it fills me with despair  despair she said repeating his word  yes despair as to the condition of the church when i see a man capable of such meanness holding so high place  amo in the cool of the evening that words such as those should have been sent to me by the bishop as showing what the metropolitan press of the day was saying about my conduct  of course my action will be against himagainst the bishop  i shall be bound to expose his conduct  what else can i do there are things which a man cannot bear and live  were i to put up with this i must leave the school leave the parishnay leave the country there is a stain upon me which i must wash out or i cannot remain here  no no no said his wife embracing him  amo in the cool of the evening and that when as god is my judge above me i have done my best to relieve what has seemed to me the unmerited sorrows of two poor sufferers  had it come from mrs stantiloup it would of course have been nothing  i could have understood that her malice should have condescended to anything however low  but from the bishop  how will you be the worse  who will know  i know it said he striking his breast  i know it  the wound is here  do you think that when a coarse libel is welcomed in the bishops palace and treated there as true that it will not be spread abroad among other houses  when the bishop has thought it necessary to send it me what will other people doothers who are not bound to be just and righteous in their dealings with me as he is  amo in the cool of the evening  then he seized his hat and rushed out into the garden  the gentleman who had written the paragraph certainly had had no idea that his words would have been thus effectual  the little joke had seemed to him to be good enough to fill a paragraph and it had gone from him without further thought  of the doctor or of the lady he had conceived no idea whatsoever  somebody else had said somewhere that a clergyman had sent a ladys reputed husband away to look for another husband while he and the lady remained together  the joke had not been much of a joke but it had been enough  it had gone forth and had now brought the whole palace of broughton into grief and had nearly driven our excellent doctor mad  amo in the cool of the evening  the words stuck to him like the shirt of nessus lacerating his very spirit  that words such as those should have been sent to him in a solemn sober spirit by the bishop of his diocese  it never occurred to him that he had in truth been imprudent when paying his visits alone to mrs peacocke  it was late in the evening and he wandered away up through the green rides of a wood the borders of which came down to the glebe fields  he had been boiling over with indignation while talking to his wife  but as soon as he was alone he endeavouredpurposely endeavoured to rid himself for a while of his wrath  this matter was so important to him that he knew well that it behoved him to look at it all round in a spirit other than that of anger  he had talked of giving up his school and giving up his parish and had really for a time almost persuaded himself that he must do so unless he could induce the bishop publicly to withdraw the censure which he felt to have been expressed against him  and then what would his life be afterwards  his parish and his school had not been only sources of income to him  the duty also had been dear and had been performed on the whole with conscientious energy  was everything to be thrown up and his whole life hereafter be made a blank to him because the bishop had been unjust and injudicious  he could see that it well might be so if he were to carry this contest on  he knew his own temper well enough to be sure that as he fought he would grow hotter in the fight and that when he was once in the midst of it nothing would be possible to him but absolute triumph or absolute annihilation  if once he should succeed in getting the bishop into court as a witness either the bishop must be crushed or he himself  the bishop must be got to say why he had sent that low ribaldry to a clergyman in his parish  he must be asked whether he had himself believed it or whether he had not believed it  he must be made to say that there existed no slightest reason for believing the insinuation contained and then having confessed so much he must be asked why he had sent that letter to bowick parsonage  if it were false as well as ribald slanderous as well as vulgar malicious as well as mean was the sending of it a mode of communication between a bishop and a clergyman of which he as a bishop could approve  questions such as these must be asked him and the doctor as he walked alone arranging these questions within his own bosom putting them into the strongest language which he could find almost assured himself that the bishop would be crushed in answering them  the bishop had made a great mistake  so the doctor assured himself  he had been entrapped by bad advisers and had fallen into a pit  he had gone wrong and had lost himself  when crossquestioned as the doctor suggested to himself that he should be crossquestioned the bishop would have to own all thisand then he would be crushed  but did he really want to crush the bishop  had this man been so bitter an enemy to him that having him on the hip he wanted to strike him down altogether  in describing the mans character to his wife as he had done in the fury of his indignation he had acquitted the man of malice  he was sure now in his calmer moments that the man had not intended to do him harm  if it were left in the bishops bosom his parish his school and his character would all be made safe to him  he was sure of that there was none of the spirit of mrs stantiloup in the feeling that had prevailed at the palace  the bishop who had never yet been able to be masterful over him had desired in a mild way to become masterful  he had liked the opportunity of writing that affectionate letter  that reference to the metropolitan press had slipt from him unawares and then when badgered for his authority when driven to give an instance from the london newspapers he had sent the objectionable periodical  he had in point of fact made a mistakea stupid foolish mistake into which a really wellbred man would hardly have fallen  ought i to take advantage of it said the doctor to himself when he had wandered for an hour or more alone through the wood  he certainly did not wish to be crushed himself  ought he to be anxious to crush the bishop because of this error  as for the paper he said to himself walking quicker as his mind turned to this side of the subjectas for the paper itself it is beneath my notice  what is it to me what such a publication or even the readers of it may think of me  as for damages i would rather starve than soil my hands with their money  though it should succeed in ruining me i could not accept redress in that shape  and thus having thought the matter fully over he returned home still wrathful but with mitigated wrath  a saturday was fixed on which he should again go up to london to see the lawyer  he was obliged now to be particular about his days as in the absence of mr peacocke the school required his time  saturday was a halfholiday and on that day he could be absent on condition of remitting the classical lessons in the morning  as he thought of it all he began to be almost tired of mr peacocke  nevertheless on the saturday morning before he started he called on mrs peacockein company with his wifeand treated her with all his usual cordial kindness  mrs wortle he said is going up to town with me but we shall be home tonight and we will see you on monday if not tomorrow  mrs wortle was going with him not with the view of being present at his interview with the lawyer which she knew would not be allowed but on the pretext of shopping  her real reason for making the request to be taken up to town was that she might use the last moment possible in mitigating her husbands wrath against the bishop  i have seen one of the proprietors and the editor said the lawyer and they are quite willing to apologise  i really do believe they are very sorry  the words had been allowed to pass without being weighed  nothing beyond an innocent joke was intended  i dare say  it seems innocent enough to them  if soot be thrown at a chimneysweeper the joke is innocent but very offensive when it is thrown at you  they are quite aware that you have ground to complain  of course you can go on if you like  the fact that they have offered to apologise will no doubt be a point in their favour  nevertheless you would probably get a verdict  we could bring the bishop into court  i think so  you have got his letter speaking of the metropolitan press  oh yes  it is for you to think dr wortle whether there would not be a feeling against you among clergymen  of course there will  men in authority always have public sympathy with them in this country  no man more rejoices that it should be so than i do  but not the less is it necessary that now and again a man shall make a stand in his own defence  he should never have sent me that paper  here said the lawyer is the apology they propose to insert if you approve of it  they will also pay my billwhich however will not i am sorry to say be very heavy  then the lawyer handed to the doctor a slip of paper on which the following words were written  our attention has been called to a notice which was made in our impression of the  ultimo on the conduct of a clergyman in the diocese of broughton  a joke was perpetrated which we are sorry to find has given offence where certainly no offence was intended  we have since heard all the details of the case to which reference was made and are able to say that the conduct of the clergyman in question has deserved neither censure nor ridicule  actuated by the purest charity he has proved himself a sincere friend to persons in great trouble  theyll put in your name if you wish it said the lawyer or alter it in any way you like so that they be not made to eat too much dirt  i do not want them to alter it said the doctor sitting thoughtfully their eating dirt will do no good to me  they are nothing to me  it is the bishop  then as though he were not thinking of what he did he tore the paper and threw the fragments down on the floor  they are nothing to me  you will not accept their apology said the lawyer  oh yesor rather it is unnecessary  you may tell them that i have changed my mind and that i will ask for no apology  as far as the paper is concerned it will be better to let the thing die a natural death  i should never have troubled myself about the newspaper if the bishop had not sent it to me  indeed i had seen it before the bishop sent it and thought little or nothing of it  animals will after their kind  the wasp stings and the polecat stinks and the lion tears its prey asunder  such a paper as that of course follows its own bent  one would have thought that a bishop would have done the same  i may tell them that the action is withdrawn  certainly certainly  tell them also that they will oblige me by putting in no apology  and as for your bill i would prefer to pay it myself  i will exercise no anger against them  it is not they who in truth have injured me  as he returned home he was not altogether happy feeling that the bishop would escape him but he made his wife happy by telling her the decision to which he had come    chapter iv  it is impossible  the absence of dr and mrs wortle was peculiarly unfortunate on that afternoon as a visitor rode over from a distance to make a calla visitor whom they both would have been very glad to welcome but of whose coming mrs wortle was not so delighted to hear when she was told by mary that he had spent two or three hours at the rectory  mrs wortle began to think whether the visitor could have known of her intended absence and the doctors  that mary had not known that the visitor was coming she was quite certain  indeed she did not really suspect the visitor who was one too ingenuous in his nature to preconcert so subtle and so wicked a scheme  the visitor of course had been lord carstairs  was he here long asked mrs wortle anxiously  two or three hours mamma  he rode over from buttercup where he is staying for a cricket match and of course i got him some lunch  i should hope so said the doctor  but i didnt think that carstairs was so fond of the momson lot as all that  mrs wortle at once doubted the declared purpose of this visit to buttercup  buttercup was more than halfway between carstairs and bowick  and then we had a game of lawntennis  talbot and monk came through to make up sides  so much mary told at once but she did not tell more till she was alone with her mother  young carstairs had certainly not come over on the sly as we may call it but nevertheless there had been a project in his mind and fortune had favoured him  he was now about nineteen and had been treated for the last twelve months almost as though he had been a man  it had seemed to him that there was no possible reason why he should not fall in love as well as another  nothing more sweet nothing more lovely nothing more lovable than mary wortle had he ever seen  he had almost made up his mind to speak on two or three occasions before he left bowick but either his courage or the occasion had failed him  once as he was walking home with her from church he had said one wordbut it had amounted to nothing she had escaped from him before she was bound to understand what he meant he did not for a moment suppose that she had understood anything  he was only too much afraid that she regarded him as a mere boy  but when he had been away from bowick two months he resolved that he would not be regarded as a mere boy any longer  therefore he took an opportunity of going to buttercup which he certainly would not have done for the sake of the momsons or for the sake of the cricket  he ate his lunch before he said a word and then with but poor grace submitted to the lawntennis with talbot and monk  even to his youthful mind it seemed that talbot and monk were brought in on purpose  they were both of them boys he had liked but he hated them now  however he played his game and when that was over managed to get rid of them sending them back through the gate to the schoolground  i think i must say goodbye now said mary because there are ever so many things in the house which i have got to do  i am going almost immediately said the young lord  papa will be so sorry not to have seen you  this had been said once or twice before  i came over he said on purpose to see you  they were now standing on the middle of the lawn and mary had assumed a look which intended to signify that she expected him to go  he knew the place well enough to get his own horse or to order the groom to get it for him  but instead of that he stood his ground and now declared his purpose  to see me lord carstairs  yes miss wortle  and if the doctor had been here or your mother i should have told them  have told them what she asked  she knew she felt sure that she knew and yet she could not refrain from the question  i have come here to ask if you can love me  it was a most decided way of declaring his purpose and one which made mary feel that a great difficulty was at once thrown upon her  she really did not know whether she could love him or not  why shouldnt she have been able to love him  was it not natural enough that she should be able but she knew that she ought not to love him whether able or not  there were various reasons which were apparent enough to her though it might be very difficult to make him see them  he was little more than a boy and had not yet finished his education  his father and mother would not expect him to fall in love at any rate till he had taken his degree  and they certainly would not expect him to fall in love with the daughter of his tutor  she had an idea that circumstanced as she was she was bound by loyalty both to her own father and to the lads father not to be able to love him  she thought that she would find it easy enough to say that she did not love him but that was not the question  as for being able to love himshe could not answer that at all  lord carstairs she said severely you ought not to have come here when papa and mamma are away  i didnt know they were away  i expected to find them here  but they aint  and you ought to go away  is that all you can say to me  i think it is  you know you oughtnt to talk to me like that  your own papa and mamma would be angry if they knew it  why should they be angry  do you think that i shall not tell them  i am sure they would disapprove it altogether said mary  in fact it is all nonsense and you really must go away  then she made a decided attempt to enter the house by the drawingroom window which opened out on a gravel terrace  but he stopped her standing boldly by the window  i think you ought to give me an answer mary he said  i have and i cannot say anything more  you must let me go in  if they say that its all right at carstairs then will you love me  they wont say that its all right and papa wont think that its right its very wrong  you havent been to oxford yet and youll have to remain there for three years  i think its very illnatured of you to come and talk to me like this  of course it means nothing  you are only a boy but yet you ought to know better  it does mean something  it means a great deal  as for being a boy i am older than you are and have quite as much right to know my own mind  hereupon she took advantage of some little movement in his position and tripping by him hastily made good her escape into the house  young carstairs perceiving that his occasion for the present was over went into the yard and got upon his horse  he was by no means contented with what he had done but still he thought that he must have made her understand his purpose  mary when she found herself safe within her own room could not refrain from asking herself the question which her lover had asked her  could she love him  she didnt see any reason why she couldnt love him  it would be very nice she thought to love him  he was sweettempered handsome bright and thoroughly goodhumoured and then his position in the world was very high  not for a moment did she tell herself that she would love him  she did not understand all the differences in the worlds ranks quite as well as did her father but still she felt that because of his rankbecause of his rank and his youth combinedshe ought not to allow herself to love him  there was no reason why the son of a peer should not marry the daughter of a clergyman  the peer and the clergyman might be equally gentlemen  but young carstairs had been there in trust lord bracy had sent him there to be taught latin and greek and had a right to expect that he should not be encouraged to fall in love with his tutors daughter  it was not that she did not think herself good enough to be loved by any young lord but that she was too good to bring trouble on the people who had trusted her father  her father would despise her were he to hear that she had encouraged the lad or as some might say had entangled him  she did not know whether she should not have spoken to lord carstairs more decidedly  but she could at any rate comfort herself with the assurance that she had given him no encouragement  of course she must tell it all to her mother but in doing so could declare positively that she had given the young man no encouragement  it was very unfortunate that lord carstairs should have come just when i was away said mrs wortle to her daughter as soon as they were alone together  yes mamma it was  and so odd  i havent been away from home any day all the summer before  he expected to find you  of course he did  had he anything particular to say  yes mamma  he had  what was it my dear  i was very much surprised mamma but i couldnt help it  he asked me  asked you what mary  oh mamma  here she knelt down and hid her face in her mothers lap  oh my dear this is very badvery bad indeed  it neednt be bad for you mamma or for papa  is it bad for you my child  no mamma except of course that i am sorry that it should be so  what did you say to him  of course i told him that it was impossible  he is only a boy and i told him so  you made him no promise  no mamma no  a promise  oh dear no  of course it is impossible  i knew that  i never dreamed of anything of the kind but he said it all there out on the lawn  had he come on purpose  yesso he said  i think he had  but he will go to oxford and will of course forget it  he is such a nice boy said mrs wortle who in all her anxiety could not but like the lad the better for having fallen in love with her daughter  yes mamma he is  i always liked him  but this is quite out of the question  what would his papa and mamma say  it would be very dreadful to have a quarrel wouldnt itand just at present when there are so many things to trouble your papa  though mrs wortle was quite honest and true in the feeling she had expressed as to the young lords visit yet she was alive to the glory of having a young lord for her soninlaw  of course it is out of the question mamma  it has never occurred to me for a moment as otherwise  he has got to go to oxford and take his degree before he thinks of such a thing  i shall be quite an old woman by that time and he will have forgotten me  you may be sure mamma that whatever i did say to him was quite plain  i wish you could have been here and heard it all and seen it all  my darling said the mother embracing her i could not believe you more thoroughly even though i saw it all and heard it all  that night mrs wortle felt herself constrained to tell the whole story to her husband  it was indeed impossible for her to keep any secret from her husband  when mary in her younger years had torn her frock or cut her finger that was always told to the doctor  if a gardener was seen idling his time or a housemaid flirting with the groom that certainly would be told to the doctor  what comfort does a woman get out of her husband unless she may be allowed to talk to him about everything  when it had been first proposed that lord carstairs should come into the house as a private pupil she had expressed her fear to the doctorbecause of mary the doctor had ridiculed her fears and this had been the result  of course she must tell the doctor  oh dear she said what do you think has happened while we were up in london  carstairs was here  oh yes he was here  he came on purpose to make a regular declaration of love to mary  nonsense  but he did jeffrey  how do you know he came on purpose  he told her so  i did not think the boy had so much spirit in him said the doctor this was a way of looking at it which mrs wortle had not expected  her husband seemed rather to approve than otherwise of what had been done  at any rate he had expressed none of that loud horror which she had expected  nevertheless continued the doctor hes a stupid fool for his pains  i dont know that he is a fool said mrs wortle  yes he is  he is not yet twenty and he has all oxford before him  how did mary behave  like an angel said marys mother  thats of course  you and i are bound to believe so  but what did she do and what did she say  she told him that it was simply impossible  so it isim afraid  she at any rate was bound to give him no encouragement  she gave him none  she feels quite strongly that it is altogether impossible  what would lord bracy say  if carstairs were but three or four years older said the doctor proudly lord bracy would have much to be thankful for in the attachment on the part of his son if it were met by a return of affection on the part of my daughter  what better could he want  but he is only a boy said mrs wortle  no thats where it is  and mary was quite right to tell him that it is impossible  it is impossible  and i trust for her sake that his words have not touched her young heart  oh no said mrs wortle  had it been otherwise how could we have been angry with the child  now this did seem to the mother to be very much in contradiction to that which the doctor had himself said when she had whispered to him that lord carstairss coming might be dangerous  i was afraid of it as you know said she  his character has altered during the last twelve months  i suppose when boys grow into men it is so with them  not so quickly said the doctor  a boy when he leaves eton is not generally thinking of these things  a boy at eton is not thrown into such society said mrs wortle  i suppose his being here and seeing mary every day has done it  poor mary  i dont think she is poor at all said marys mother  i am afraid she must not dream of her young lover  of course she will not dream of him  she has never entertained any idea of the kind  there never was a girl with less nonsense of that kind than mary  when lord carstairs spoke to her today i do not suppose she had thought about him more than any other boy that has been here  but she will think now  nonot in the least  she knows it is impossible  nevertheless she will think about it  and so will you  i  yeswhy not  why should you be different from other mothers  why should i not think about it as other fathers might do  it is impossible i wish it were not  for marys sake i wish he were three or four years older  but he is as he is and we know that it is impossible nevertheless it is natural that she should think about him  i only hope that she will not think about him too much  so saying he closed the conversation for that night  mary did not think very much about it in such a way as to create disappointment  she at once realised the impossibilities so far as to perceive that the young lord was the top brick of the chimney as far as she was concerned  the top brick of the chimney may be very desirable but one doesnt cry for it because it is unattainable  therefore mary did not in truth think of loving her young lover  he had been to her a very nice boy and so he was still thatthat and nothing more  then had come this little episode in her life which seemed to lend it a gentle tinge of romance  but had she inquired of her bosom she would have declared that she had not been in love  with her mother there was perhaps something of regret  but it was exactly the regret which may be felt in reference to the top brick  it would have been so sweet had it been possible but then it was so evidently impossible  with the doctor the feeling was somewhat different  it was not quite so manifest to him that this special brick was altogether unattainable nor even that it was quite at the top of the chimney  there was no reason why his daughter should not marry an earls son and heir  no doubt the lad had been confided to him in trust  no doubt it would have been his duty to have prevented anything of the kind had anything of the kind seemed to him to be probable  had there been any moment in which the duty had seemed to him to be a duty he would have done it even though it had been necessary to caution the earl to take his son away from bowick  but there had been nothing of the kind  he had acted in the simplicity of his heart and this had been the result  of course it was impossible  he acknowledged to himself that it was so because of the necessity of those oxford studies and those long years which would be required for the taking of the degree  but to his thinking there was no other ground for saying that it was impossible  the thing must stand as it was  if this youth should show himself to be more constant than other youthswhich was not probableand if at the end of three or four years mary should not have given her heart to any other loverwhich was also improbablewhy then it might come to pass that he should some day find himself fatherinlaw to the future earl bracy  though mary did not think of it nor mrs wortle he thought of itso as to give an additional interest to these disturbed days    chapter v  correspondence with the palace  the possible glory of marys future career did not deter the doctor from thinking of his troublesand especially that trouble with the bishop which was at present heavy on his hand  he had determined not to go on with his action and had so resolved because he had felt in his more sober moments that in bringing the bishop to disgrace he would be as a bird soiling its own nest  it was that conviction and not any idea as to the sufficiency or insufficiency as to the truth or falsehood of the editors apology which had actuated him  as he had said to his lawyer he did not in the least care for the newspaper people  he could not condescend to be angry with them  the abominable joke as to the two verbs was altogether in their line  as coming from them they were no more to him than the ribald words of boys which he might hear in the street  the offence to him had come from the bishopand he resolved to spare the bishop because of the church  but yet something must be done  he could not leave the man to triumph over him  if nothing further were done in the matter the bishop would have triumphed over him  as he could not bring himself to expose the bishop he must see whether he could not reach the man by means of his own power of wordsso he wrote as follows   my dear lordi have to own that this letter is written with feelings which have been very much lacerated by what your lordship has done  i must tell you in the first place that i have abandoned my intention of bringing an action against the proprietors of the scurrilous newspaper which your lordship sent me because i am unwilling to bring to public notice the fact of a quarrel between a clergyman of the church of england and his bishop  i think that whatever may be the difficulty between us it should be arranged without bringing down upon either of us adverse criticism from the public press  i trust your lordship will appreciate my feeling in this matter  nothing less strong could have induced me to abandon what seems to be the most certain means by which i could obtain redress  i had seen the paper which your lordship sent to me before it came to me from the palace  the scurrilous unsavoury and vulgar words which it contained did not matter to me much  i have lived long enough to know that let a mans own garments be as clean as they may be he cannot hope to walk through the world without rubbing against those who are dirty  it was only when those words came to me from your lordshipwhen i found that the expressions which i found in that paper were those to which your lordship had before alluded as being criticisms on my conduct in the metropolitan presscriticisms so grave as to make your lordship think it necessary to admonish me respecting themit was only then i say that i considered them to be worthy of my notice  when your lordship in admonishing me found it necessary to refer me to the metropolitan press and to caution me to look to my conduct because the metropolitan press had expressed its dissatisfaction it was i submit to you natural for me to ask you where i should find that criticism which had so strongly affected your lordships judgment  there are perhaps half a score of newspapers published in london whose animadversions i as a clergyman might have reason to respecteven if i did not fear them  was i not justified in thinking that at least some two or three of these had dealt with my conduct when your lordship held the metropolitan press in terrorem over my head  i applied to your lordship for the names of these newspapers and your lordship when pressed for a reply sent to methat copy of everybodys business  i ask your lordship to ask yourself whether so far i have overstated anything  did not that paper come to me as the only sample you were able to send me of criticism made on my conduct in the metropolitan press  no doubt my conduct was handled there in very severe terms  no doubt the insinuations if trueor if of such kind as to be worthy of credit with your lordship whether true or falsewere severe plainspoken and damning  the language was so abominable so vulgar so nauseous that i will not trust myself to repeat it  your lordship probably when sending me one copy kept another  now i must ask your lordshipand i must beg of your lordship for a replywhether the periodical itself has such a character as to justify your lordship in founding a complaint against a clergyman on its unproved statements and also whether the facts of the case as they were known to you were not such as to make your lordship well aware that the insinuations were false  before these ribald words were printed your lordship had heard all the facts of the case from my own lips  your lordship had known me and my character for i think a dozen years  you know the character that i bear among others as a clergyman a schoolmaster and a gentleman  you have been aware how great is the friendship i have felt for the unfortunate gentleman whose career is in question and for the lady who bears his name  when you read those abominable words did they induce your lordship to believe that i had been guilty of the inexpressible treachery of making love to the poor lady whose misfortunes i was endeavouring to relieve and of doing so almost in my wifes presence  i defy you to have believed them  men are various and their minds work in different waysbut the same causes will produce the same effects you have known too much of me to have thought it possible that i should have done as i was accused  i should hold a man to be no less than mad who could so have believed knowing as much as your lordship knew  then how am i to reconcile to my idea of your lordships character the fact that you should have sent me that paper  what am i to think of the process going on in your lordships mind when your lordship could have brought yourself to use a narrative which you must have known to be false made in a newspaper which you knew to be scurrilous as the ground for a solemn admonition to a clergyman of my age and standing  you wrote to me as is evident from the tone and context of your lordships letter because you found that the metropolitan press had denounced my conduct  and this was the proof you sent to me that such had been the case  it occurred to me at once that as the paper in question had vilely slandered me i could redress myself by an action of law and that i could prove the magnitude of the evil done me by showing the grave importance which your lordship had attached to the words  in this way i could have forced an answer from your lordship to the questions which i now put to you  your lordship would have been required to state on oath whether you believed those insinuations or not and if so why you believed them  on grounds which i have already explained i have thought it improper to do so  having abandoned that course i am unable to force any answer from your lordship  but i appeal to your sense of honour and justice whether you should not answer my questionsand i also ask from your lordship an ample apology if on consideration you shall feel that you have done me an undeserved injuryi have the honour to be my lord your lordships most obedient very humble servant  jeffrey wortle   he was rather proud of this letter as he read it to himself and yet a little afraid of it feeling that he had addressed his bishop in very strong language  it might be that the bishop should send him no answer at all or some curt note from his chaplain in which it would be explained that the tone of the letter precluded the bishop from answering it  what should he do then  it was not he thought improbable that the curt note from the chaplain would be all that he might receive  he let the letter lie by him for fourandtwenty hours after he had composed it and then determined that not to send it would be cowardly  he sent it and then occupied himself for an hour or two in meditating the sort of letter he would write to the bishop when that curt reply had come from the chaplain  that further letter must be one which must make all amicable intercourse between him and the bishop impossible  and it must be so written as to be fit to meet the public eye if he should be ever driven by the bishops conduct to put it in print  a great wrong had been done hima great wrong  the bishop had been induced by influences which should have had no power over him to use his episcopal rod and to smite himhim dr wortle he would certainly show the bishop that he should have considered beforehand whom he was about to smite  amo in the cool of the evening  and that given as an expression of opinion from the metropolitan press in general  he had spared the bishop as far as that action was concerned but he would not spare him should he be driven to further measures by further injustice  in this way he lashed himself again into a rage  whenever those odious words occurred to him he was almost mad with anger against the bishop  when the letter had been two days sent so that he might have had a reply had a reply come to him by return of post he put a copy of it into his pocket and rode off to call on mr puddicombe  he had thought of showing it to mr puddicombe before he sent it but his mind had revolted from such submission to the judgment of another  mr puddicombe would no doubt have advised him not to send it and then he would have been almost compelled to submit to such advice  but the letter was gone now  the bishop had read it and no doubt reread it two or three times  but he was anxious that some other clergyman should see itthat some other clergyman should tell him that even if inexpedient it had still been justified  mr puddicombe had been made acquainted with the former circumstances of the affair and now with his mind full of his own injuries he went again to mr puddicombe  it is just the sort of letter that you would write as a matter of course said mr puddicombe  then i hope that you think it is a good letter  good as being expressive and good also as being true i do think it  but not good as being wise  had i been in your case i should have thought it unnecessary  but you are selfdemonstrative and cannot control your feelings  i do not quite understand you  what did it all matter  the bishop did a foolish thing in talking of the metropolitan press  but he had only meant to put you on your guard  i do not choose to be put on my guard in that way said the doctor  no exactly  and he should have known you better than to suppose you would bear it  then you pressed him and he found himself compelled to send you that stupid newspaper  of course he had made a mistake  but dont you think that the world goes easier when mistakes are forgiven  i did forgive it as far as foregoing the action  that i think was a matter of course  if you had succeeded in putting the poor bishop into a witnessbox you would have had every sensible clergyman in england against you  you felt that yourself  not quite that said the doctor  something very near it and therefore you withdrew  but you cannot get the sense of the injury out of your mind and therefore you have persecuted the bishop with that letter  persecuted  he will think so  and so should i had it been addressed to me  as i said before all your arguments are trueonly i think you have made so much more of the matter than was necessary  he ought not to have sent you that newspaper nor ought he to have talked about the metropolitan press but he did you no harm nor had he wished to do you harmand perhaps it might have been as well to pass it over  could you have done so  i cannot imagine myself in such a position  i could not at any rate have written such a letter as that even if i would and should have been afraid to write it if i could  i value peace and quiet too greatly to quarrel with my bishopunless indeed he should attempt to impose upon my conscience  there was nothing of that kind here  i think i should have seen that he had made a mistake and have passed it over  the doctor as he rode home was on the whole better pleased with his visit than he had expected to be  he had been told that his letter was argumentative and true and that in itself had been much  at the end of the week he received a reply from the bishop and found that it was not at any rate written by the chaplain   my dear dr wortle said the reply your letter has pained me exceedingly because i find that i have caused you a degree of annoyance which i am certainly very sorry i have inflicted  when i wrote to you in my letterwhich i certainly did not intend as an admonitionabout the metropolitan press i only meant to tell you for your own information that the newspapers were making reference to your affair with mr peacocke  i doubt whether i knew anything of the nature of everybodys business i am not sure even whether i had ever actually read the words to which you object so strongly  at any rate they had had no weight with me  if i had read themwhich i probably did very cursorilythey did not rest on my mind at all when i wrote to you  my object was to caution you not at all as to your own conduct but as to others who were speaking evil of you  as to the action of which you spoke so strongly when i had the pleasure of seeing you here i am very glad that you abandoned it for your own sake and for mine and the sake of all us generally to whom the peace of the church is dear  as to the nature of the language in which you have found yourself compelled to write to me i must remind you that it is unusual as coming from a clergyman to a bishop  i am however ready to admit that the circumstances of the case were unusual and i can understand that you should have felt the matter severely  under these circumstances i trust that the affair may now be allowed to rest without any breach of those kind feelings which have hitherto existed between usyours very faithfully  c broughton   it is a beastly letter the doctor said to himself when he had read it a beastly letter and then he put it away without saying any more about it to himself or to any one else  it had appeared to him to be a beastly letter because it had exactly the effect which the bishop had intended it did not eat humble pie it did not give him the full satisfaction of a complete apology and yet it left no room for a further rejoinder  it had declared that no censure had been intended and expressed sorrow that annoyance had been caused  but yet to the doctors thinking it was an unmanly letter  not intended as an admonition  then why had the bishop written in that severely affectionate and episcopal style  he had intended it as an admonition and the excuse was false  so thought the doctor and comprised all his criticism in the one epithet given above after that he put the letter away and determined to think no more about it  will you come in and see mrs peacocke after lunch the doctor said to his wife the next morning  they paid their visit together and after that when the doctor called on the lady he was generally accompanied by mrs wortle  so much had been effected by everybodys business and its abominations    chapter vi  the journey  we will now follow mr peacocke for a while upon his journey  he began his close connection with robert lefroy by paying the mans bill at the inn before he left broughton and after that found himself called upon to defray every trifle of expense incurred as they went along  lefroy was very anxious to stay for a week in town  it would no doubt have been two weeks or a month had his companion given waybut on this matter a line of conduct had been fixed by mr peacocke in conjunction with the doctor from which he never departed  if you will not be guided by me i will go without you mr peacocke had said and leave you to follow your own devices on your own resources  and what can you do by yourself  most probably i shall be able to learn all that i want to learn  it may be that i shall fail to learn anything either with you or without you  i am willing to make the attempt with you if you will come along at oncebut i will not be delayed for a single day  i shall go whether you go or stay  then lefroy had yielded and had agreed to be put on board a german steamer starting from southampton to new york  but an hour or two before the steamer started he made a revelation  this is all gammon peacocke he said when on board  what is all gammon  my taking you across to the states  why is it gammon  because ferdinand died more than a year sincealmost immediately after you took her off  why did you not tell me that at bowick  because you were so uncommon uncivil  was it likely i should have told you that when you cut up so uncommon rough  an honest man would have told me the very moment that he saw me  when ones poor brother has died one does not blurt it like that all at once  your poor brother  why not my poor brother as well as anybody elses  and her husband too how was i to let it out in that sort of way  at any rate he is dead as julius cæsar  i saw him buriedright away at frisco  did he go to san francisco  yeswe both went there right away from st louis  when we got up to st louis we were on our way with them other fellows  nobody meant to disturb you but ferdy got drunk and would go and have a spree as he called it  a spree indeed  but we were off by train to kansas at five oclock the next morning  the devil wouldnt keep him sober and he died of dt the day after we got him to frisco  so theres the truth of it and you neednt go to new york at all  hand me the dollars  ill be off to the states and you can go back and marry the widowor leave her alone just as you please  they were down below when this story was told sitting on their portmanteaus in the little cabin in which they were to sleep  the prospect of the journey certainly had no attraction for mr peacocke  his companion was most distasteful to him the ship was abominable the expense was most severe  how glad would he avoid it all if it were possible  you know it all as well as if you were there said robert and were standing on his grave  he did believe it  the man in all probability had at the last moment told the true story  why not go back and be married again  the doctor could be got to believe it  but then if it were not true  it was only for a moment that he doubted i must go to frisco all the same he said  why so  because i must in truth stand upon his grave  i must have proof that he has been buried there  then you may go by yourself said robert lefroy  he had said this more than once or twice already and had been made to change his tone  he could go or stay as he pleased but no money would be paid to him until peacocke had in his possession positive proof of ferdinand lefroys death so the two made their unpleasant journey to new york together  there was complaining on the way even as to the amount of liquor that should be allowed  peacocke would pay for nothing that he did not himself order lefroy had some small funds of his own and was frequently drunk while on board  there were many troubles but still they did at last reach new york  then there was a great question whether they would go on direct from thence to san francisco or delay themselves three or four days by going round by st louis  lefroy was anxious to go to st louisand on that account peacocke was almost resolved to take tickets direct through for san francisco  why should lefroy wish to go to st louis  but then if the story were altogether false some truth might be learned at st louis and it was at last decided that thither they would go  as they went on from town to town changing carriages first at one place and then at another lefroys manner became worse and worse and his language more and more threatening  peacocke was asked whether he thought a man was to be brought all that distance without being paid for his time  you will be paid when you have performed your part of the bargain said peacocke  ill see some part of the money at st louis said lefroy or ill know the reason why  a thousand dollars  what are a thousand dollars  hand out the money  this was said as they were sitting together in a corner or separated portion of the smokingroom of a little hotel at which they were waiting for a steamer which was to take them down the mississippi to st louis  peacocke looked round and saw that they were alone  i shall hand out nothing till i see your brothers grave said peacocke  you wont  not a dollar  what is the good of your going on like that  you ought to know me well enough by this time  but you do not know me well enough  you must have taken me for a very tame sort o critter  perhaps i have  maybe youll change your mind  perhaps i shall  it is quite possible that you should murder me  but you will not get any money by that  murder you  you aint worth murdering  then they sat in silence waiting another hour and a half till the steamboat came  the reader will understand that it must have been a bad time for mr peacocke  they were on the steamer together for about twentyfour hours during which lefroy hardly spoke a word  as far as his companion could understand he was out of funds because he remained sober during the greater part of the day taking only what amount of liquor was provided for him  before however they reached st louis which they did late at night he had made acquaintance with certain fellowtravellers and was drunk and noisy when they got out upon the quay  mr peacocke bore his position as well as he could and accompanied him up to the hotel  it was arranged that they should remain two days at st louis and then start for san francisco by the railway which runs across the state of kansas before he went to bed lefroy insisted on going into the large hall in which as is usual in american hotels men sit and loafe and smoke and read the newspapers  here though it was twelve oclock there was still a crowd and lefroy after he had seated himself and lit his cigar got up from his seat and addressed all the men around him  heres a fellow said he has come out from england to find out whats become of ferdinand lefroy  i knew ferdinand lefroy said one man and i know you too master robert  what has become of ferdinand lefroy asked mr peacocke  hes gone where all the good fellows go said another  you mean that he is dead asked peacocke  of course hes dead said robert  ive been telling him so ever since we left england but he is such a d unbelieving infidel that he wouldnt credit the mans own brother  he wont learn much here about him  ferdinand lefroy said the first man died on the way as he was going out west  i was over the road the day after  you know nothing about it said robert  he died at frisco two days after wed got him there  he died at ogden junction where you turn down to utah city  you didnt see him dead said the other  if i remember right continued the first man theyd taken him away to bury him somewhere just there in the neighbourhood  i didnt care much about him and i didnt ask any particular questions  he was a drunken beastbetter dead than alive  youve been drunk as often as him i guess said robert  i never gave nobody the trouble to bury me at any rate said the other  do you mean to say positively of your own knowledge asked peacocke that ferdinand lefroy died at that station  ask him hes his brother and he ought to know best  i tell you said robert earnestly that we carried him on to frisco and there he died  if you think you know best you can go to utah city and wait there till you hear all about it  i guess theyll make you one of their elders if you wait long enough  then they all went to bed  it was now clear to mr peacocke that the man as to whose life or death he was so anxious had really died  the combined evidence of these men which had come out without any preconcerted arrangement was proof to his mind but there was no evidence which he could take back with him to england and use there as proof in a court of law or even before the bishop and dr wortle  on the next morning before robert lefroy was up he got hold of the man who had been so positive that death had overtaken the poor wretch at the railway station which is distant from san francisco two days journey  had the man died there and been buried there nothing would be known of him in san francisco  the journey to san francisco would be entirely thrown away and he would be as badly off as ever  i wouldnt like to say for certain said the man when he was interrogated  i only tell you what they told me  as i was passing along somebody said as ferdy lefroy had been taken dead out of the cars on to the platform  now you know as much about it as i do  he was thus assured that at any rate the journey to san francisco had not been altogether a fiction  the man had gone west as had been said and nothing more would be known of him at st louis  he must still go on upon his journey and make such inquiry as might be possible at the ogden junction  on the day but one following they started again taking their tickets as far as leavenworth  they were told by the officials that they would find a train at leavenworth waiting to take them on across country into the regular san francisco line  but as is not unusual with railway officials in that part of the world they were deceived  at leavenworth they were forced to remain for fourandtwenty hours and there they put themselves up at a miserable hotel in which they were obliged to occupy the same room  it was a rough uncouth place in which as it seemed to mr peacocke the men were more uncourteous to him and the things around more unlike to what he had met elsewhere than in any other town of the union robert lefroy since the first night at st louis had become sullen rather than disobedient  he had not refused to go on when the moment came for starting but had left it in doubt till the last moment whether he did or did not intend to prosecute his journey  when the ticket was taken for him he pretended to be altogether indifferent about it and would himself give no help whatever in any of the usual troubles of travelling  but as far as this little town of leavenworth he had been carried and peacocke now began to think it probable that he might succeed in taking him to san francisco  on that night he endeavoured to induce him to go first to bed but in this he failed  lefroy insisted on remaining down at the bar where he had ordered for himself some liquor for which mr peacocke in spite of all his efforts to the contrary would have to pay  if the man would get drunk and lie there he could not help himself  on this he was determined that whether with or without the man he would go on by the first trainand so he took himself to his bed  he had been there perhaps halfanhour when his companion came into the roomcertainly not drunk  he seated himself on his bed and then pulling to him a large travellingbag which he used he unpacked it altogether laying all the things which it contained out upon the bed what are you doing that for said mr peacocke we have to start from here tomorrow morning at five  im not going to start tomorrow at five nor yet tomorrow at all nor yet next day  you are not  not if i know it  i have had enough of this game  i am not going further west for any one  hand out the money  you have been told everything about my brother true and honest as far as i know it  hand out the money  not a dollar said peacocke  all that i have heard as yet will be of no service to me  as far as i can see you will earn it but you will have to come on a little further yet  not a foot i aint agoing out of this room tomorrow  then i must go without youthats all  you may go and be   but youll have to shell out the money first old fellow  not a dollar  you wont  certainly i will not  how often have i told you so  then i shall take it  that you will find very difficult  in the first place if you were to cut my throat  which is just what i intend to do  if you were to cut my throatwhich in itself will be difficultyou would only find the trifle of gold which i have got for our journey as far as frisco  that wont do you much good  the rest is in circular notes which to you would be of no service whatever  my god said the man suddenly i am not going to be done in this way and with that he drew out a bowieknife which he had concealed among the things which he had extracted from the bag  you dont know the sort of country youre in now  they dont think much here of the life of such a skunk as you  if you mean to live till tomorrow morning you must come to terms  the room was a narrow chamber in which two beds ran along the wall each with its foot to the other having a narrow space between them and the other wall  peacocke occupied the one nearest to the door  lefroy now got up from the bed in the further corner and with the bowieknife in his hand rushed against the door as though to prevent his companions escape peacocke who was in bed undressed sat up at once but as he did so he brought a revolver out from under his pillow  so you have been and armed yourself have you said robert lefroy  yes said peacockeif you come nearer me with that knife i shall shoot you  put it down  likely i shall put it down at your bidding  with the pistol still held at the other mans head peacocke slowly extracted himself from his bed  now said he if you dont come away from the door i shall fire one barrel just to let them know in the house what sort of affair is going on  put the knife down  you know that i shall not hurt you then  after hesitating for a moment or two lefroy did put the knife down  i didnt mean anything old fellow said he  i only wanted to frighten you  well you have frightened me  now whats to come next  no i aintnot frightened you a bit  a pistols always better than a knife any day  well now ill tell ye how it all is  saying this he seated himself on his own bed and began a long narration  he would not go further west than leavenworth  whether he got his money or whether he lost it he would not travel a foot further  there were reasons which would make it disagreeable for him to go into california  but he made a proposition  if peacocke would only give him money enough to support himself for the necessary time he would remain at leavenworth till his companion should return there or would make his way to chicago and stay there till peacocke should come to him  then he proceeded to explain how absolute evidence might be obtained at san francisco as to his brothers death  that fellow was lying altogether he said about my brother dying at the ogden station  he was very bad there no doubt and we thought it was going to be all up with him  he had the horrors there worse than i ever saw before and i hope never to see the like again  but we did get him on to san francisco and when he was able to walk into the city on his own legs i thought that might be he would rally and come round  however in two days he diedand we buried him in the big cemetery just out of the town  did you put a stone over him  yes there is a stone as large as life  youll find the name on itferdinand lefroy of kilbrack louisiana  kilbrack was the name of our plantation where we should be living now as gentlemen ought with three hundred niggers of our own but for these accursed northern hypocrites  how can i find the stone  theres a chap there who knows i guess where all them graves are to be found  but its on the right hand a long way down near the far wall at the bottom just where the ground takes a little dip to the north  it aint so long ago but what the letters on the stone will be as fresh as if they were cut yesterday  does no one in san francisco know of his death  theres a chap named burke at johnsons the cigarshop in montgomery street  he was brother to one of our party and he went out to the funeral  maybe youll find him or any way some traces of him  the two men sat up discussing the matter nearly the whole of the night and peacocke before he started had brought himself to accede to lefroys last proposition  he did give the man money enough to support him for two or three weeks and also to take him to chicago promising at the same time that he would hand to him the thousand dollars at chicago should he find him there at the appointed time and should he also have found ferdinand lefroys grave at san francisco in the manner described    chapter vii  nobody has condemned you here  mrs wortle when she perceived that her husband no longer called on mrs peacocke alone became herself more assiduous in her visits till at last she too entertained a great liking for the woman  when mr peacocke had been gone for nearly a month she had fallen into a habit of going across every day after the performance of her own domestic morning duties and remaining in the schoolhouse for an hour  on one morning she found that mrs peacocke had just received a letter from new york in which her husband had narrated his adventures so far  he had written from southampton but not after the revelation which had been made to him there as to the death of ferdinand  he might have so done but the information given to him had at the spur of the moment seemed to be so doubtful that he had refrained  then he had been able to think of it all during the voyage and from new york he had written at great length detailing everything  mrs peacocke did not actually read out loud the letter which was full of such terms of affection as are common between man and wife knowing that her title to be called a wife was not admitted by mrs wortle but she read much of it and told all the circumstances as they were related  then said mrs wortle he certainly isno more  there came a certain accession of sadness to her voice as she reflected that after all she was talking to this woman of the death of her undoubted husband  yes he is deadat last  mrs wortle uttered a deep sigh  it was dreadful to her to think that a woman should speak in that way of the death of her husband  i know all that is going on in your mind said mrs peacocke looking up into her face  do you  every thought  you are telling yourself how terrible it is that a woman should speak of the death of her husband without a tear in her eye without a sobwithout one word of sorrow  it is very sad  of course it is sad  has it not all been sad  but what would you have me do  it is not because he was always bad to mebecause he marred all my early life making it so foul a blotch that i hardly dare to look back upon it from the quietness and comparative purity of these latter days it is not because he has so treated me as to make me feel that it has been a misfortune to me to be born that i now receive these tidings with joy it is because of him who has always been good to me as the other was bad who has made me wonder at the noble instincts of a man as the other has made me shudder at his possible meanness  it has been very hard upon you said mrs wortle  and hard upon him who is dearer to me than my own soul  think of his conduct to me  how he went away to ascertain the truth when he first heard tidings which made him believe that i was free to become his  how he must have loved me then when after all my troubles he took me to himself at the first moment that was possible  think too what he has done for me sinceand i for him  how i have marred his life while he has striven to repair mine  do i not owe him everything  everything said mrs wortleexcept to do what is wrong  i did do what was wrong  would not you have done so under such circumstances  would not you have obeyed the man who had been to you so true a husband while he believed himself entitled to the name  wrong  i doubt whether it was wrong  it is hard to know sometimes what is right and what is wrong  what he told me to do that to me was right  had he told me to go away and leave him i should have goneand have died  i suppose that would have been right  she paused as though she expected an answer  but the subject was so difficult that mrs wortle was unable to make one  i have sometimes wished that he had done so  but as i think of it when i am alone i feel how impossible that would have been to him he could not have sent me away  that which you call right would have been impossible to him whom i regard as the most perfect of human beings  as far as i know him he is faultlessand yet according to your judgment he has committed a sin so deep that he must stand disgraced before the eyes of all men  i have not said so  it comes to that  i know how good you are how much i owe to you  i know that dr wortle and yourself have been so kind to us that were i not grateful beyond expression i should be the meanest human creature  do not suppose that i am angry or vexed with you because you condemn me  it is necessary that you should do so  but how can i condemn myselfor how can i condemn him  if you are both free now it may be made right  but how about repentance  will it be all right though i shall not have repented  i will never repent  there are laws in accordance with which i will admit that i have done wrong but had i not broken those laws when he bade me i should have hated myself through all my life afterwards  it was very different  if you could know mrs wortle how difficult it would have been to go away and leave him  it was not till he came to me and told me that he was going down to texas to see how it had been with my husband that i ever knew what it was to love a man  he had never said a word  he tried not to look it  but i knew that i had his heart and that he had mine  from that moment i have thought of him day and night  when i gave him my hand then as he parted from me i gave it him as his own  it has been his to do what he liked with it ever since let who might live or who might die ought i not to rejoice that he is dead  mrs wortle could not answer the question  she could only shudder  it was not by any will of my own continued the eager woman that i married ferdinand lefroy  everything in our country was then destroyed  all that we loved and all that we valued had been taken away from us  war had destroyed everything  when i was just springing out of childhood we were ruined  we had to go all of us women as well as men girls as well as boysand be something else than we had been  i was told to marry him  that was wrong  when everything is in ruin about you what room is there for ordinary welldoing  it seemed then that he would have some remnant of property our fathers had known each other long  the wretched man whom drink afterwards made so vile might have been as good a gentleman as another if things had gone well with him  he could not have been a hero like him whom i will always call my husband but it is not given to every man to be a hero  was he bad always from the first  he always drankfrom his weddingday and then robert was with him who was worse than he  between them they were very bad  my life was a burden to me  it was terrible  it was a comfort to me even to be deserted and to be left  then came this englishman in my way and it seemed to me on a sudden that the very nature of mankind was altered  he did not lie when he spoke  he was never debased by drink  he had other care than for himself  for himself i think he never cared  since he has been here in the school have you found any cause of fault in him  no indeed  no indeed nor ever willunless it be a fault to love a woman as he loves me  see what he is doing nowwhere he has gonewhat he has to suffer coupled as he is with that wretch  and all for my sake  for both your sakes  he would have been none the worse had he chosen to part with me  he was in no trouble  i was not his wife and he need onlybid me go  there would have been no sin with him thenno wrong  had he followed out your right and your wrong and told me that as we could not be man and wife we must just part he would have been in no troublewould he  i dont know how it would have been then said mrs wortle who was by this time sobbing aloud in tears  no nor i nor i  i should have been deadbut he  he is a sinner now so that he may not preach in your churches or teach in your schools so that your dear husband has to be ruined almost because he has been kind to him  he then might have preached in any churchhave taught in any school  what am i to think that god will think of it  will god condemn him  we must leave that to him sobbed mrs wortle  yes but in thinking of our souls we must reflect a little as to what we believe to be probable  he you say has sinnedis sinning still in calling me his wife  am i not to believe that if he were called to his long account he would stand there pure and bright in glorious garmentsone fit for heaven because he has loved others better than he has loved himself because he has done to others as he might have wished that they should do to him  i do believe it  believe  i know it  and if so what am i to think of his sin or of my own  not to obey him not to love him not to do in everything as he counsels methat to me would be sin  to the best of my conscience he is my husband and my master  i will not go into the rooms of such as you mrs wortle good and kind as you are but it is not because i do not think myself fit  it is because i will not injure you in the estimation of those who do not know what is fit and what is unfit  i am not ashamed of myself  i owe it to him to blush for nothing that he has caused me to do  i have but two judgesthe lord in heaven and he my husband upon earth  nobody has condemned you here  yesthey have condemned me  but i am not angry at that  you do not think mrs wortle that i can be angry with youso kind as you have been so generous so forgivingthe more kind because you think that we are determined headstrong sinners  oh no  it is natural that you should think sobut i think differently  circumstances have so placed me that they have made me unfit for your society  if i had no decent gown to wear or shoes to my feet i should be unfit alsobut not on that account disgraced in my own estimation  i comfort myself by thinking that i cannot be altogether bad when a man such as he has loved me and does love me  the two women when they parted on that morning kissed each other which they had not done before and mrs wortle had been made to doubt whether after all the sin had been so very sinful  she did endeavour to ask herself whether she would not have done the same in the same circumstances  the woman she thought must have been right to have married the man whom she loved when she heard that that first horrid husband was dead  there could at any rate have been no sin in that and then what ought she to have done when the dead mandead as he was supposed to have beenburst into her room  mrs wortlewho found it indeed extremely difficult to imagine herself to be in such a positiondid at last acknowledge that in such circumstances she certainly would have done whatever dr wortle had told her  she could not bring it nearer to herself than that  she could not suggest to herself two men as her own husbands  she could not imagine that the doctor had been either the bad husband who had unexpectedly come to lifeor the good husband who would not in truth be her husband at all but she did determine in her own mind that however all that might have been she would clearly have done whatever the doctor told her  she would have sworn to obey him even though when swearing she should not have really married him  it was terrible to think ofso terrible that she could not quite think of it but in struggling to think of it her heart was softened towards this other woman  after that day she never spoke further of the womans sin  of course she told it all to the doctornot indeed explaining the working of her own mind as to that suggestion that he should have been in his first condition a very bad man and have been reported dead and have come again in a second shape as a good man  she kept that to herself but she did endeavour to describe the effect upon herself of the description the woman had given her of her own conduct  i dont quite know how she could have done otherwise said mrs wortle  nor i either i have always said so  it would have been so very hard to go away when he told her not  it would have been very hard to go away said the doctor if he had told her to do so  where was she to go  what was she to do  they had been brought together by circumstances in such a manner that it was so to say impossible that they should part  it is not often that one comes across events like these so altogether out of the ordinary course that the common rules of life seem to be insufficient for guidance  to most of us it never happens and it is better for us that it should not happen but when it does one is forced to go beyond the common rules  it is that feeling which has made me give them my protection  it has been a great misfortune but placed as i was i could not help myself  i could not turn them out  it was clearly his duty to go and almost as clearly mine to give her shelter till he should come back  a great misfortune jeffrey  i am afraid so  look at this  then he handed to her a letter from a nobleman living at a great distanceat a distance so great that mrs stantiloup would hardly have reached him thereexpressing his intention to withdraw his two boys from the school at christmas  he doesnt give this as a reason  no we are not acquainted with each other personally and he could hardly have alluded to my conduct in this matter  it was easier for him to give a mere notice such as this  but not the less do i understand it  the intention was that the elder mowbray should remain for another year and the younger for two years  of course he is at liberty to change his mind nor do i feel myself entitled to complain  a school such as mine must depend on the credit of the establishment  he has heard no doubt something of the story which has injured our credit and it is natural that he should take the boys away  do you think that the school will be put an end to  it looks very like it  altogether  i shall not care to drag it on as a failure  i am too old now to begin again with a new attempt if this collapses  i have no offers to fill up the vacancies  the parents of those who remain of course will know how it is going with the school  i shall not be disposed to let it die of itself  my idea at present is to carry it on without saying anything till the christmas holidays and then to give notice to the parents that the establishment will be closed at midsummer  will it make you very unhappy  no doubt it will  a man does not like to fail  i am not sure but what i am less able to bear such failure than most men  but you have sometimes thought of giving it up  have i  i have not known it  why should i give it up  why should any man give up a profession while he has health and strength to carry it on  you have another  yes but it is not the one to which my energies have been chiefly applied  the work of a parish such as this can be done by one person  i have always had a curate  it is moreover nonsense to say that a man does not care most for that by which he makes his money  i am to give up over £2000 ayear which i have had not a trouble but a delight in making it is like coming to the end of ones life  oh jeffrey  it has to be looked in the face you know  i wishi wish they had never come  what is the good of wishing  they came and according to my way of thinking i did my duty by them  much as i am grieved by this i protest that i would do the same again were it again to be done  do you think that i would be deterred from what i thought to be right by the machinations of a shedragon such as that  has she done it  well i think so said the doctor after some little hesitation  i think it has been in truth her doing  there has been a grand opportunity for slander and she has used it with uncommon skill  it was a wonderful chance in her favour  she has been enabled without actual lieslies which could be proved to be liesto spread abroad reports which have been absolutely damning  and she has succeeded in getting hold of the very people through whom she could injure me  of course all this correspondence with the bishop has helped  the bishop hasnt kept it as a secret  why should he  the bishop has had nothing to do with the school said mrs wortle  no but the things have been mixed up together  do you think it would have no effect with such a woman as lady anne clifford to be told that the bishop had censured my conduct severely  if it had not been for mrs stantiloup the bishop would have heard nothing about it  it is her doing  and it pains me to feel that i have to give her credit for her skill and her energy  her wickedness you mean  what does it signify whether she has been wicked or not in this matter  oh jeffrey  her wickedness is a matter of course  we all knew that beforehand  if a person has to be wicked it is a great thing for him to be successful in his wickedness  he would have to pay the final penalty even if he failed to be wicked and to do nothing is to be mean all round  i am afraid that mrs stantiloup will have succeeded in her wickedness    chapter viii  lord bracys letter  the school and the parish went on through august and september and up to the middle of october very quietly  the quarrel between the bishop and the doctor had altogether subsided  people in the diocese had ceased to talk continually of mr and mrs peacocke  there was still alive a certain interest as to what might be the ultimate fate of the poor lady but other matters had come up and she no longer formed the one topic of conversation at all meetings  the twenty boys at the school felt that as their numbers had been diminished so also had their reputation  they were less loud and as other boys would have said of them less cocky than of yore  but they ate and drank and played and let us hope learnt their lessons as usual  mrs peacocke had from time to time received letters from her husband the last up to the time of which we speak having been written at the ogden junction at which mr peacocke had stopped for fourandtwenty hours with the object of making inquiry as to the statement made to him at st louis  here he learned enough to convince him that robert lefroy had told him the truth in regard to what had there occurred  the people about the station still remembered the condition of the man who had been taken out of the car when suffering from delirium tremens and remembered also that the man had not died there but had been carried on by the next train to san francisco  one of the porters also declared that he had heard a few days afterwards that the sufferer had died almost immediately on his arrival at san francisco  information as far as this mr peacocke had sent home to his wife and had added his firm belief that he should find the mans grave in the cemetery and be able to bring home with him testimony to which no authority in england whether social episcopal or judicial would refuse to give credit  of course he will be married again said mrs wortle to her husband  they shall be married here and i will perform the ceremony  i dont think the bishop himself would object to that and i shouldnt care a straw if he did  will he go on with the school whispered mrs wortle  will the school go on  if the school goes on he will go on i suppose about that you had better ask mrs stantiloup  i will ask nobody but you said the wife putting up her face to kiss him  as this was going on everything was said to comfort mrs peacocke and to give her hopes of new life  mrs wortle told her how the doctor had promised that he himself would marry them as soon as the forms of the church and the legal requisitions would allow  mrs peacocke accepted all that was said to her quietly and thankfully but did not again allow herself to be roused to such excitement as she had shown on the one occasion recorded  it was at this time that the doctor received a letter which greatly affected his mode of thought at the time  he had certainly become hipped and lowspirited if not despondent and clearly showed to his wife even though he was silent that his mind was still intent on the injury which that wretched woman had done him by her virulence  but the letter of which we speak for a time removed this feeling and gave him as it were a new life  the letter which was from lord bracy was as follows   my dear doctor wortlecarstairs left us for oxford yesterday and before he went startled his mother and me considerably by a piece of information  he tells us that he is over head and ears in love with your daughter  the communication was indeed made three days ago but i told him that i should take a day or two to think of it before i wrote to you he was very anxious when he told me to go off at once to bowick and to see you and your wife and of course the young ladybut this i stopped by the exercise of somewhat peremptory parental authority  then he informed me that he had been to bowick and had found his ladylove at home you and mrs wortle having by chance been absent at the time  it seems that he declared himself to the young lady who in the exercise of a wise discretion ran away from him and left him planted on the terrace that is his account of what passed and i do not in the least doubt its absolute truth  it is at any rate quite clear from his own showing that the young lady gave him no encouragement  such having been the case i do not think that i should have found it necessary to write to you at all had not carstairs persevered with me till i promised to do so  he was willing he said not to go to bowick on condition that i would write to you on the subject  the meaning of this is that had he not been very much in earnest i should have considered it best to let the matter pass on as such matters do and be forgotten  but he is very much in earnest  however foolish it isor perhaps i had better say unusualthat a lad should be in love before he is twenty it is i suppose possible  at any rate it seems to be the case with him and he has convinced his mother that it would be cruel to ignore the fact  i may at once say that as far as you and your girl are concerned i should be quite satisfied that he should choose for himself such a marriage  i value rank at any rate as much as it is worth but that he will have of his own and does not need to strengthen it by intermarriage with another house of peculiarly old lineage  as far as that is concerned i should be contented  as for money i should not wish him to think of it in marrying  if it comes tant mieux  if not he will have enough of his own  i write to you therefore exactly as i should do if you had happened to be a brother peer instead of a clergyman  but i think that long engagements are very dangerous and you probably will agree with me that they are likely to be more prejudicial to the girl than to the man  it may be that as difficulties arise in the course of years he can forget the affair and that she cannot  he has many things of which to think whereas she perhaps has only that one  she may have made that thing so vital to her that it cannot be got under and conquered whereas without any fault or heartlessness on his part occupation has conquered it for him  in this case i fear that the engagement if made could not but be long  i should be sorry that he should not take his degree  and i do not think it wise to send a lad up to the university hampered with the serious feeling that he has already betrothed himself  i tell you all just as it is and i leave it to your wisdom to suggest what had better be done  he wished me to promise that i would undertake to induce you to tell miss wortle of his conversation with me  he said that he had a right to demand so much as that and that though he would not for the present go to bowick he should write to you  the young gentleman seems to have a will of his ownwhich i cannot say that i regret  what you will do as to the young ladywhether you will or will not tell her what i have writteni must leave to yourself  if you do i am to send word to her from lady bracy to say that she shall be delighted to see her here  she had better however come when that inflammatory young gentleman shall be at oxford  yours very faithfully  bracy   this letter certainly did a great deal to invigorate the doctor and to console him in his troubles  even though the debated marriage might prove to be impossible as it had been declared by the voices of all the wortles one after another still there was something in the tone in which it was discussed by the young mans father which was in itself a relief  there was at any rate no contempt in the letter  i may at once say that as far as you and your girl are concerned i shall be very well pleased that at any rate was satisfactory  and the more he looked at it the less he thought that it need be altogether impossible  if lord bracy liked it and lady bracy liked itand young carstairs as to whose liking there seemed to be no reason for any doubthe did not see why it should be impossible  as to maryhe could not conceive that she should make objection if all the others were agreed  how could she possibly fail to love the young man if encouraged to do so  suitors who are goodlooking rich of high rank sweettempered and at the same time thoroughly devoted are not wont to be discarded  all the difficulty lay in the lads youth  after all how many noblemen have done well in the world without taking a degree  degrees too have been taken by married men  and again young men have been persistent before now even to the extent of waiting three years  long engagements are badno doubt everybody has always said so  but a long engagement may be better than none at all  he at last made up his mind that he would speak to mary but he determined that he would consult his wife first  consulting mrs wortle on his part generally amounted to no more than instructing her  he found it sometimes necessary to talk her over as he had done in that matter of visiting mrs peacocke but when he set himself to work he rarely failed she had nowhere else to go for a certain foundation and support therefore he hardly doubted much when he began his operation about this suggested engagement  i have got that letter this morning from lord bracy he said handing her the document  oh dear  has he heard about carstairs  you had better read it  he has told it all she exclaimed when she had finished the first sentence  he has told it all certainly  but you had better read the letter through  then she seated herself and read it almost trembling however as she went on with it  oh dearthat is very nice what he says about you and mary  it is all very nice as far as that goes  there is no reason why it should not be nice  it might have made him so angry  then he would have been very unreasonable  he acknowledges that mary did not encourage him  of course she did not encourage him  he would have been very unlike a gentleman had he thought so  but in truth my dear it is a very good letter  of course there are difficulties  ohit is impossible  i do not see that at all  it must rest very much with him no doubtwith carstairs and i do not like to think that our girls happiness should depend on any young mans constancy  but such dangers have to be encountered  you and i were engaged for three years before we were married and we did not find it so very bad  it was very good  oh i was so happy at the time  happier than youve been since  well i dont know  it was very nice to know that you were my lover  why shouldnt mary think it very nice to have a lover  but i knew that you would be true  why shouldnt carstairs be true  remember he is so young  you were in orders  i dont know that i was at all more likely to be true on that account  a clergyman can jilt a girl just as well as another  it depends on the nature of the man  and you were so good  i never came across a better youth than carstairs  you see what his father says about his having a will of his own  when a young man shows a purpose of that kind he generally sticks to it  the upshot of it all was that mary was to be told and that her father was to tell her  yes papa he did come she said  i told mamma all about me  and she told me of course  you did what was quite right and i should not have thought it necessary to speak to you had not lord bracy written to me  lord bracy has written said mary  it seemed to her as it had done to her mother that lord bracy must have written angrily but though she thought so she plucked up her spirit gallantly telling herself that though lord bracy might be angry with his own son he could have no cause to be displeased with her  yes i have a letter which you shall read  the young man seems to have been very much in earnest  i dont know said mary with some little exultation at her heart  it seems but the other day that he was a boy and now he has become suddenly a man  to this mary said nothing but she also had come to the conclusion that in this respect lord carstairs had lately changedvery much for the better  do you like him mary  like him papa  well my darling how am i to put it  he is so much in earnest that he has got his father to write to me  he was coming over himself again before he went to oxford but he told his father what he was going to do and the earl stopped him  theres the letter and you may read it  mary read the letter taking herself apart to a corner of the room and seemed to her father to take a long time in reading it  but there was very much on which she was called upon to make up her mind during those few minutes  up to the present timeup to the moment in which her father had now summoned her into his study she had resolved that it was impossible  she had become so clear on the subject that she would not ask herself the question whether she could love the young man  would it not be wrong to love the young man  would it not be a longing for the top brick of the chimney which she ought to know was out of her reach  so she had decided it and had therefore already taught herself to regard the declaration made to her as the ebullition of a young mans folly  but not the less had she known how great had been the thing suggested to herhow excellent was this top brick of the chimney and as to the young man himself she could not but feel that had matters been different she might have loved him  now there had come a sudden change but she did not at all know how far she might go to meet the change nor what the change altogether meant  she had been made sure by her fathers question that he had taught himself to hope  he would not have asked her whether she liked himwould not at any rate have asked that question in that voicehad he not been prepared to be good to her had she answered in the affirmative  but then this matter did not depend upon her fathers wishesor even on her fathers judgment  it was necessary that before she said another word she should find out what lord bracy said about it there she had lord bracys letter in her hand but her mind was so disturbed that she hardly knew how to read it aright at the spur of the moment  you understand what he says mary  i think so papa  it is a very kind letter  very kind indeed  i should have thought that he would not have liked it at all  he makes no objection of that kind  to tell the truth mary i should have thought it unreasonable had he done so  a gentleman can do no better than marry a lady  and though it is much to be a nobleman it is more to be a gentleman  some people think so much of it  and then his having been here as a pupil  i was very sorry when he spoke to me  all that is past and gone  the danger is that such an engagement would be long  very long  you would be afraid of that mary  mary felt that this was hard upon her and unfair  were she to say that the danger of a long engagement did not seem to her to be very terrible she would at once be giving up everything  she would have declared then that she did love the young man or at any rate that she intended to do so  she would have succumbed at the first hint that such succumbing was possible to her  and yet she had not known that she was very much afraid of a long engagement  she would she thought have been much more afraid had a speedy marriage been proposed to her  upon the whole she did not know whether it would not be nice to go on knowing that the young man loved her and to rest secure on her faith in him  she was sure of thisthat the reading of lord bracys letter had in some way made her happy though she was unwilling at once to express her happiness to her father  she was quite sure that she could make no immediate reply to that question whether she was afraid of a long engagement  i must answer lord bracys letter you know said the doctor  yes papa  and what shall i say to him  i dont know papa  and yet you must tell me what to say my darling  must i papa  certainly  who else can tell me  but i will not answer it today  i will put it off till monday  it was saturday morning on which the letter was being discusseda day of which a considerable portion was generally appropriated to the preparation of a sermon  in the mean time you had better talk to mamma and on monday we will settle what is to be said to lord bracy    chapter ix  at chicago  mr peacocke went on alone to san francisco from the ogden junction and there obtained full information on the matter which had brought him upon this long and disagreeable journey  he had no difficulty in obtaining the evidence which he required  he had not been twentyfour hours in the place before he was in truth standing on the stone which had been placed over the body of ferdinand lefroy as he had declared to robert lefroy that he would stand before he would be satisfied  on the stone was cut simply the names ferdinand lefroy of kilbrack louisiana and to these were added the dates of the days on which the man had been born and on which he died  of this stone he had a photograph made of which he took copies with him and he obtained also from the minister who had buried the body and from the custodian who had charge of the cemetery certificates of the interment  armed with these he could no longer doubt himself or suppose that others would doubt that ferdinand lefroy was dead  having thus perfected his object and feeling but little interest in a town to which he had been brought by such painful circumstances he turned round and on the second day after his arrival again started for chicago had it been possible he would fain have avoided any further meeting with robert lefroy  short as had been his stay at san francisco he had learnt that robert after his brothers death had been concerned in buying mining shares and paying for them with forged notes  it was not supposed that he himself had been engaged in the forgery but that he had come into the city with men who had been employed for years on this operation and had bought shares and endeavoured to sell them on the following day  he had however managed to leave the place before the police had got hold of him and had escaped so that no one had been able to say at what station he had got upon the railway  nor did any one in san francisco know where robert lefroy was now to be found  his companions had been taken tried and convicted and were now in the state prisonwhere also would robert lefroy soon be if any of the officers of the state could get hold of him luckily mr peacocke had said little or nothing of the man in making his own inquiries  much as he had hated and dreaded the man much as he had suffered from his companionshipgood reason as he had to dislike the whole familyhe felt himself bound by their late companionship not to betray him  the man had assisted mr peacocke simply for money but still he had assisted him  mr peacocke therefore held his peace and said nothing  but he would have been thankful to have been able to send the money that was now due to him without having again to see him  that however was impossible  on reaching chicago he went to an hotel far removed from that which lefroy had designated  lefroy had explained to him something of the geography of the town and had explained that for himself he preferred a modest quiet hotel  the modest quiet hotel was called mrs joness boardinghouse and was in one of the suburbs far from the main street  you neednt say as youre coming to me lefroy had said to him nor need you let on as you know anything of mrs jones at all  people are so curious and it may be that a gentleman sometimes likes to lie perdu  mr peacocke although he had but small sympathy for the taste of a gentleman who likes to lie perdu nevertheless did as he was bid and found his way to mrs joness boardinghouse without telling any one whither he was going  before he started he prepared himself with a thousand dollars in banknotes feeling that this wretched man had earned them in accordance with their compact  his only desire now was to hand over the money as quickly as possible and to hurry away out of chicago  he felt as though he himself were almost guilty of some crime in having to deal with this man in having to give him money secretly and in carrying out to the end an arrangement of which no one else was to know the details  how would it be with him if the police of chicago should come upon him as a friend and probably an accomplice of one who was wanted on account of forgery at san francisco  but he had no help for himself and at mrs joness he found his wifes brotherinlaw seated in the bar of the publichousethat everlasting resort for american loungerswith a cigar as usual stuck in his mouth loafing away his time as only american frequenters of such establishments know how to do  in england such a man would probably be found in such a place with a glass of some alcoholic mixture beside him but such is never the case with an american  if he wants a drink he goes to the bar and takes it standingwill perhaps take two or three one after another but when he has settled himself down to loafe he satisfies himself with chewing a cigar and covering a circle around him with the results  with this amusement he will remain contented hour after hournay throughout the entire day if no harder work be demanded of him  so was robert lefroy found now  when peacocke entered the hall or room the man did not rise from his chair but accosted him as though they had parted only an hour since  so old fellow youve got back all alive  i have reached this place at any rate  well thats getting back aint it  i have come back from san francisco  hsh exclaimed lefroy looking round the room in which however there was no one but themselves  you neednt tell everybody where youve been  i have nothing to conceal  that is more than anybody knows of himself  its a good maxim to keep your own affairs quiet till theyre wanted  in this country everybody is spry enough to learn all about everything  i never see any good in letting them know without a reason  wellwhat did you do when you got there  it was all as you told me  didnt i say so  what was the good of bringing me all this way when if youd only believed me you might have saved me the trouble  aint i to be paid for that  you are to be paid  i have come here to pay you  thats what you owe for the knowledge  but for coming  aint i to be paid extra for the journey  you are to have a thousand dollars  hshyou speak of money as though every one has a business to know that you have got your pockets full  whats a thousand dollars seeing all that i have done for you  its all that youre going to get  its all indeed that i have got to give you  gammon  its all at any rate that youre going to get  will you have it now  you found the tomb did you  yes i found the tomb  here is a photograph of it  you can keep a copy if you like it  what do i want of a copy said the man taking the photograph in his hand  he was always more trouble than he was worthwas ferdy  its a pity she didnt marry me  id ve made a woman of her  peacocke shuddered as he heard this but he said nothing  you may as well give us the picteritll do to hang up somewhere if ever i have a room of my own  how plain it is  ferdinand lefroyof kilbrack  kilbrack indeed its little either of us was the better for kilbrack  some of them psalmsinging rogues from new england has it nowor perhaps a rightdown nigger  i shouldnt wonder  one of our own lot maybe  oh thats the money is ita thousand dollars all that im to have for coming to england and telling you and bringing you back and showing you where you could get this pretty picter made  then he took the money a thick roll of notes and crammed them into his pocket  youd better count them  it aint worth the while with such a trifle as that  let me count them then  youll never have that plunder in your fists again my fine fellow  i do not want it  and now about my expenses out to england on purpose to tell you all this  you can go and make her your wife nowor can leave her just as you please  you couldnt have done neither if i hadnt gone out to you  you have got what was promised  but my expensesgoing out  i have promised you nothing for your expenses going outand will pay you nothing  you wont  not a dollar more  you wont  certainly not  i do not suppose that you expect it for a moment although you are so persistent in asking for it  and you think youve got the better of me do you  you think youve carried me along with you just to do your bidding and take whatever you please to give me  thats your idea of me  there was a clear bargain between us  i have not got the better of you at all  i rather think not peacocke  i rather think not  youll have to get up earlier before you get the better of robert lefroy  you dont expect to get this money back againdo you  certainly notany more than i should expect a pound of meat out of a dogs jaw  mr peacocke as he said this was waxing angry  i dont suppose you dobut you expected that i was to earn it by doing your biddingdidnt you  and you have  yes i have but how  you never heard of my cousin did youferdinand lefroy of kilbrack louisiana  heard of whom  my cousin ferdinand lefroy  he was very well known in his own state and in california too till he died  he was a good fellow but given to drink  we used to tell him that if he would marry it would be better for himbut he never wouldhe never did  robert lefroy as he said this put his left hand into his trouserspocket over the notes which he had placed there and drew a small revolver out of his pocket with the other hand  i am better prepared now he said than when you had your sixshooter under your pillow at leavenworth  i do not believe a word of it  its a lie said peacocke  very well  youre a chap thats fond of travelling and have got plenty of money  youd better go down to louisiana and make your way straight from new orleans to kilbrack  it aint above forty miles to the southwest and theres a rail goes within fifteen miles of it  youll learn there all about ferdinand lefroy as was our cousinhim as never got married up to the day he died of drink and was buried at san francisco  theyll be very glad i shouldnt wonder to see that pretty little picter of yours because they was always uncommon fond of cousin ferdy at kilbrack  and ill tell you what youll be sure to come across my brother ferdy in them parts and can tell him how youve seen me  you can give him all the latest news too about his own wife  hell be glad to hear about her poor woman  mr peacocke listened to this without saying a word since that last exclamation of his  it might be true  why should it not be true  if in truth there had been these two cousins of the same name what could be more likely than that his money should be lured out of him by such a fraud as this  but yetyet as he came to think of it all it could not be true  the chance of carrying such a scheme to a successful issue would have been too small to induce the man to act upon it from the day of his first appearance at bowick  nor was it probable that there should have been another ferdinand lefroy unknown to his wife and the existence of such a one if known to his wife would certainly have been made known to him  its a lie said he from beginning to end  very well very well  ill take care to make the truth known by letter to dr wortle and the bishop and all them pious swells over there  to think that such a chap as you a minister of the gospel living with another mans wife and looking as though butter wouldnt melt in your mouth  i tell you what ive got a little money in my pocket now and i dont mind going over to england again and explaining the whole truth to the bishop myself  i could make him understand how that photograph aint worth nothing and how i explained to you myself as the ladys righteous husband is all alive keeping house on his own property down in louisiana do you think we lefroys hadnt any place beside kilbrack among us  certainly you are a liar said peacocke  very well  prove it  did you not tell me that your brother was buried at san francisco  oh as for that that dont matter  it dont count for much whether i told a crammer or not  that picter counts for nothing  it aint my word you were going on as evidence  you is able to prove that ferdy lefroy was buried at frisco  true enough  i buried him  i can prove that  and i would never have treated you this way and not have said a word as to how the dead man was only a cousin if youd treated me civil over there in england  but you didnt  i am going to treat you worse now said peacocke looking him in the face  what are you going to do now  its i that have the revolver this time as he said this he turned the weapon round in his hand  i dont want to shoot younor yet to frighten you as i did in the bedroom at leavenworth  not but what i have a pistol too  and he slowly drew his out of his pocket  at this moment two men sauntered in and took their places in the further corner of the room  i dont think there is to be any shooting between us  there may said lefroy  the police would have you  so they wouldfor a time  what does that matter to me  isnt a fellow to protect himself when a fellow like you comes to him armed  but they would soon know that you are the swindler who escaped from san francisco eighteen months ago  do you think it wouldnt be found out that it was you who paid for the shares in forged notes  i never did  thats one of your lies  very well  now you know what i know and you had better tell me over again who it is that lies buried under the stone thats been photographed there  what are you men doing with them pistols said one of the strangers walking across the room and standing over the backs of their chairs  we are alooking at em said lefroy  if youre agoing to do anything of that kind youd better go and do it elsewhere said the stranger  just so said lefroy  thats what i was thinking myself  but we are not going to do anything said mr peacocke  i have not the slightest idea of shooting the gentleman and he has just as little of shooting me  then what do you sit with em out in your hands in that fashion for said the stranger  its a decent widow woman as keeps this house and i wont see her set upon  put em up  whereupon lefroy did return his pistol to his pocketupon which mr peacocke did the same  then the stranger slowly walked back to his seat at the other side of the room  so they told you that lie did theyat frisco asked lefroy  that was what i heard over there when i was inquiring about your brothers death  youd believe anything if youd believe that  id believe anything if id believe in your cousin  upon this lefroy laughed but made no further allusion to the romance which he had craftily invented on the spur of the moment  after that the two men sat without a word between them for a quarter of an hour when the englishman got up to take his leave  our business is over now he said and i will bid you goodbye  ill tell you what im athinking said lefroy  mr peacocke stood with his hand ready for a final adieu but he said nothing  ive half a mind to go back with you to england  there aint nothing to keep me here  what could you do there  id be evidence for you as to ferdys death you know  i have evidence  i do not want you  ill go nevertheless  and spend all your money on the journey  youd helpwouldnt you now  not a dollar said peacocke turning away and leaving the room  as he did so he heard the wretch laughing loud at the excellence of his own joke  before he made his journey back again to england he only once more saw robert lefroy  as he was seating himself in the railway car that was to take him to buffalo the man came up to him with an affected look of solicitude  peacocke he said there was only nine hundred dollars in that roll  there were a thousand  i counted them halfanhour before i handed them to you  there was only nine hundred when i got em  there were all that you will get  what kind of notes were they you had when you paid for the shares at frisco  this question he asked out loud before all the passengers  then robert lefroy left the car and mr peacocke never saw him or heard from him again    conclusion  chapter x  the doctors answer  when the monday came there was much to be done and to be thought of at bowick  mrs peacocke on that day received a letter from san francisco giving her all the details of the evidence that her husband had obtained and enclosing a copy of the photograph  there was now no reason why she should not become the true and honest wife of the man whom she had all along regarded as her husband in the sight of god  the writer declared that he would so quickly follow his letter that he might be expected home within a week or at the longest ten days from the date at which she would receive it  immediately on his arrival at liverpool he would of course give her notice by telegraph  when this letter reached her she at once sent a message across to mrs wortle  would mrs wortle kindly come and see her  mrs wortle was of course bound to do as she was asked and started at once  but she was in truth but little able to give counsel on any subject outside the one which was at the moment nearest to her heart  at one oclock when the boys went to their dinner mary was to instruct her father as to the purport of the letter which was to be sent to lord bracyand mary had not as yet come to any decision  she could not go to her father for aidshe could not at any rate go to him until the appointed hour should come and she was therefore entirely thrown upon her mother  had she been old enough to understand the effect and the power of character she would have known that at the last moment her father would certainly decide for herand had her experience of the world been greater she might have been quite sure that her father would decide in her favour but as it was she was quivering and shaking in the dark leaning on her mothers very inefficient aid nearly overcome with the feeling that by one oclock she must be ready to say something quite decided  and in the midst of this her mother was taken away from her just at ten oclock  there was not in truth much that the two ladies could say to each other  mrs peacocke felt it to be necessary to let the doctor know that mr peacocke would be back almost at once and took this means of doing so  in a week said mrs wortle as though painfully surprised by the suddenness of the coming arrival  in a week or ten days  he was to follow his letter as quickly as possible from san francisco  and he has found it all out  yes he has learned everything i think  look at this  and mrs peacocke handed to her friend the photograph of the tombstone  dear me said mrs wortle  ferdinand lefroy  and this was his grave  that is his grave said mrs peacocke turning her face away  it is very sad very sad indeedbut you had to learn it you know  it will not be sad for him i hope said mrs peacocke  in all this i endeavour to think of him rather than of myself  when i am forced to think of myself it seems to me that my life has been so blighted and destroyed that it must be indifferent what happens to me now  what has happened to me has been so bad that i can hardly be injured further  but if there can be a good time coming for himsomething at least of relief something perhaps of comfortthen i shall be satisfied  why should there not be comfort for you both  i am almost as dead to hope as i am to shame  some year or two ago i should have thought it impossible to bear the eyes of people looking at me as though my life had been sinful and impure  i seem now to care nothing for all that  i can look them back again with bold eyes and a brazen face and tell them that their hardness is at any rate as bad as my impurity  we have not looked at you like that said mrs wortle  no and therefore i send to you in my trouble and tell you all this the strangest thing of all to me is that i should have come across one man so generous as your husband and one woman so softhearted as yourself there was nothing further to be said then  mrs wortle was instructed to tell her husband that mr peacocke was to be expected in a week or ten days and then hurried back to give what assistance she could in the much more important difficulties of her own daughter  of course they were much more important to her  was her girl to become the wife of a young lordto be a future countess  was she destined to be the motherinlaw of an earl  of course this was much more important to her  and then through it allbeing as she was a dear good christian motherly womanshe was well aware that there was something in truth much more important even than that  though she thought much of the earlship and the countessship and the great revenue and the big house at carstairs and the fine park with its magnificent avenues and the carriage in which her daughter would be rolled about to london parties and the diamonds which she would wear when she should be presented to the queen as the bride of the young lord carstairs yet she knew very well that she ought not in such an emergency as the present to think of these things as being of primary importance  what would tend most to her girls happinessand welfare in this world and the next  it was of that she ought to thinkof that only  if some answer were now returned to lord bracy giving his lordship to understand that they the wortles were anxious to encourage the idea then in fact her girl would be tied to an engagement whether the young lord should hold himself to be so tied or no  and how would it be with her girl if the engagement should be allowed to run on in a doubtful way for years and then be dropped by reason of the young mans indifference  how would it be with her if after perhaps three or four years a letter should come saying that the young lord had changed his mind and had engaged himself to some nobler bride  was it not her duty as a mother to save her child from the too probable occurrence of some crushing grief such as this  all of it was clear to her mindbut then it was clear also that if this opportunity of greatness were thrown away no such chance in all probability would ever come again  thus she was so tossed to and fro between a prospect of glorious prosperity for her child on one side and the fear of terrible misfortune for her child on the other that she was altogether unable to give any salutary advice  she at any rate ought to have known that her advice would at last be of no importance  her experience ought to have told her that the doctor would certainly settle the matter himself  had it been her own happiness that was in question her own conduct her own greatness she would not have dreamed of having an opinion of her own she would have consulted the doctor and simply have done as he directed but all this was for her child and in a vague vacillating way she felt that for her child she ought to be ready with counsel of her own  mamma said mary when her mother came back from mrs peacocke what am i to say when he sends for me  if you think that you can love him my dear  oh mamma you shouldnt ask me  my dear  i do like himvery much  if so  but i never thought of it beforeand then if heif he  if he what my dear  if he were to change his mind  ah yesthere it is  it isnt as though you could be married in three months time  oh mamma  i shouldnt like that at all  or even in six  oh no  of course he is very young  yes mamma  and when a young man is so very young i suppose he doesnt quite know his own mind  no mamma  but  well my dear  his father says that he has gotsuch a strong will of his own said poor mary who was anxious unconsciously anxious to put in a good word on her own side of the question without making her own desire too visible  he always had that  when there was any game to be played he always liked to have his own way  but then men like that are just as likely to change as others  are they mamma  but i do think that he is a lad of very high principle  papa has always said that of him  and of fine generous feeling  he would not change like a weathercock  if you think he would change at all i would ratherratherrather  oh mamma why did you tell me  my darling my child my angel  what am i to tell you  i do think of all the young men i ever knew he is the nicest and the sweetest and the most thoroughly good and affectionate  oh mamma do you said mary rushing at her mother and kissing her and embracing her  but if there were to be no regular engagement and you were to let him have your heartand then things were to go wrong  mary left the embracings gave up the kissings and seated herself on the sofa alone  in this way the morning was passedand when mary was summoned to her fathers study the mother and daughter had not arrived between them at any decision  well my dear said the doctor smiling what am i to say to the earl  must you write today papa  i think so  his letter is one that should not be left longer unanswered were we to do so he would only think that we didnt know what to say for ourselves  would he papa  he would fancy that we are halfashamed to accept what has been offered to us and yet anxious to take it  i am not ashamed of anything  no my dear you have no reason  nor have you papa  nor have i  that is quite true  i have never been wont to be ashamed of myselfnor do i think that you ever will have cause to be ashamed of yourself  therefore why should we hesitate  shall i help you my darling in coming to a decision on the matter  yes papa  if i can understand your heart on this matter it has never as yet been given to this young man  no papa  this mary said not altogether with that complete power of asseveration which the negative is sometimes made to bear  but there must be a beginning to such things  a man throws himself into it headlongas my lord carstairs seems to have done  at least all the best young men do  mary at this point felt a great longing to get up and kiss her father but she restrained herself  a young woman on the other hand if she is such as i think you are waits till she is asked  then it has to begin  the doctor as he said this smiled his sweetest smile  yes papa  and when it has begun she does not like to blurt it out at once even to her loving old father  papa  thats about it isnt it  havent i hit it off  he paused as though for a reply but she was not as yet able to make him any  come here my dear  she came and stood by him so that he could put his arm round her waist  if it be as i suppose you are better disposed to this young man than you are likely to be to any other just at present  oh yes papa  to all others you are quite indifferent  yesindeed papa  i am sure you are  but not quite indifferent to this one  give me a kiss my darling and i will take that for your speech  then she kissed himgiving him her very best kiss  and now my child what shall i say to the earl  i dont know papa  nor do i quite  i never do know what to say till ive got the pen in my hand  but youll commission me to write as i may think best  oh yes papa  and i may presume that i know your mind  yes papa  very well  then you had better leave me so that i can go to work with the paper straight before me and my pen fixed in my fingers  i can never begin to think till i find myself in that position  then she left him and went back to her mother  well my dear said mrs wortle  he is going to write to lord bracy  but what does he mean to say  i dont know at all mamma  not know  i think he means to tell lord bracy that he has got no objection  then mrs wortle was sure that the doctor meant to face all the dangers and that therefore it would behove her to face them also  the doctor when he was left alone sat a while thinking of the matter before he put himself into the position fitted for composition which he had described to his daughter  he acknowledged to himself that there was a difficulty in making a fit reply to the letter which he had to answer when his mind was set on sending an indignant epistle to the bishop the words flew from him like lightning out of the thunderclouds  but now he had to think much of it before he could make any light to come which should not bear a different colour from that which he intended  of course such a marriage would suit my child and would suit me he wished to saynot only or not chiefly because your son is a nobleman and will be an earl and a man of great property  that goes a long way with us  we are too true to deny it  we hate humbug and want you to know simply the truth about us  the title and the money go farbut not half so far as the opinion which we entertain of the young mans own good gifts  i would not give my girl to the greatest and richest nobleman under the british crown if i did not think that he would love her and be good to her and treat her as a husband should treat his wife  but believing this young man to have good gifts such as these and a fine disposition i am willing on my girls behalfand she also is willingto encounter the acknowledged danger of a long engagement in the hope of realising all the good things which would if things went fortunately thus come within her reach  this was what he wanted to say to the earl but he found it very difficult to say it in language that should be natural   my dear lord bracywhen i learned through marys mother that carstairs had been here in our absence and made a declaration of love to our girl i was i must confess annoyed  i felt in the first place that he was too young to have taken in hand such a business as that and in the next that you might not unnaturally have been angry that your son who had come here simply for tuition should have fallen into a matter of love  i imagine that you will understand exactly what were my feelings there was however nothing to be said about it  the evil so far as it was an evil had been done and carstairs was going away to oxford where possibly he might forget the whole affair  i did not at any rate think it necessary to make a complaint to you of his coming  to all this your letter has given altogether a different aspect  i think that i am as little likely as another to spend my time or thoughts in looking for external advantages but i am as much alive as another to the great honour to myself and advantage to my child of the marriage which is suggested to her  i do not know how any more secure prospect of happiness could be opened to her than that which such a marriage offers  i have thought myself bound to give her your letter to read because her heart and her imagination have naturally been affected by what your son said to her i think i may say of my girl that none sweeter none more innocent none less likely to be overanxious for such a prospect could exist  but her heart has been touched and though she had not dreamt of him but as an acquaintance till he came here and told his own tale and though she then altogether declined to entertain his proposal when it was made now that she has learnt so much more through you she is no longer indifferent this i think you will find to be natural  i and her mother also are of course alive to the dangers of a long engagement and the more so because your son has still before him a considerable portion of his education  had he asked advice either of you or of me he would of course have been counselled not to think of marriage as yet  but the very passion which has prompted him to take this action upon himself showsas you yourself say of himthat he has a stronger will than is usual to be found at his years  as it is so it is probable that he may remain constant to this as to a fixed idea  i think you will now understand my mind and marys and her mothers lord bracy as he read this declared to himself that though the doctors mind was very clear mrs wortle as far as he knew had no mind in the matter at all  i would suggest that the affair should remain as it is and that each of the young people should be made to understand that any future engagement must depend not simply on the persistency of one of them but on the joint persistency of the two  if after this lady bracy should be pleased to receive mary at carstairs i need not say that mary will be delighted to make the visitbelieve me my dear lord bracy yours most faithfully  jeffrey wortle   the earl when he read this though there was not a word in it to which he could take exception was not altogether pleased  of course it will be an engagement he said to his wife  of course it will said the countess  but then carstairs is so very much in earnest  he would have done it for himself if you hadnt done it for him  at any rate the doctor is a gentleman the earl said comforting himself    chapter xi  mr peacockes return  the earls rejoinder to the doctor was very short so let it be  there was not another word in the body of the letter but there was appended to it a postscript almost equally short lady bracy will write to mary and settle with her some period for her visit  and so it came to be understood by the doctor by mrs wortle and by mary herself that mary was engaged to lord carstairs  the doctor having so far arranged the matter said little or nothing more on the subject but turned his mind at once to that other affair of mr and mrs peacocke  it was evident to his wife who probably alone understood the buoyancy of his spirit and its corresponding susceptibility to depression that he at once went about mr peacockes affairs with renewed courage  mr peacocke should resume his duties as soon as he was remarried and let them see what mrs stantiloup or the bishop would dare to say then  it was impossible he thought that parents would be such asses as to suppose that their boys morals could be affected to evil by connection with a man so true so gallant and so manly as this  he did not at this time say anything further as to abandoning the school but seemed to imagine that the vacancies would get themselves filled up as in the course of nature  he ate his dinner again as though he liked it and abused the liberals and was anxious about the grapes and peaches as was always the case with him when things were going well  all this as mrs wortle understood had come to him from the brilliancy of marys prospects  but though he held his tongue on the subject mrs wortle did not  she found it absolutely impossible not to talk of it when she was alone with mary or alone with the doctor  as he counselled her not to make mary think too much about it she was obliged to hold her peace when both were with her but with either of them alone she was always full of it  to the doctor she communicated all her fears and all her doubts showing only too plainly that she would be altogether brokenhearted if anything should interfere with the grandeur and prosperity which seemed to be partly within reach but not altogether within reach of her darling child  if he carstairs should prove to be a recreant young lord  if aristotle and socrates should put love out of his heart  if those other wicked young lords at christchurch were to teach him that it was a foolish thing for a young lord to become engaged to his tutors daughter before he had taken his degree  if some better born young lady were to come in his way and drive mary out of his heart  no more lovely or better girl could be found to do soof that she was sure  to the latter assertion the doctor agreed telling her that as it was so she ought to have a stronger trust in her daughters charmstelling her also with somewhat sterner voice that she should not allow herself to be so disturbed by the glories of the bracy coronet  in this there was i think some hypocrisy  had the doctor been as simple as his wife in showing her own heart it would probably have been found that he was as much set upon the coronet as she  then mrs wortle would carry the doctors wisdom to her daughter  papa says my dear that you shouldnt think of it too much  i do think of him mamma  i do love him now and of course i think of him  of course you do my dearof course you do  how should you not think of him when he is all in all to you  but papa means that it can hardly be called an engagement yet  i dont know what it should be called but of course i love him  he can change it if he likes  but you shouldnt think of it knowing his rank and wealth  i never did mamma but he is what he is and i must think of him  poor mrs wortle did not know what special advice to give when this declaration was made  to have held her tongue would have been the wisest but that was impossible to her  out of the full heart the mouth speaks and her heart was very full of lord carstairs and of carstairs house and of the diamonds which her daughter would certainly be called upon to wear before the queenif only that young man would do his duty  poor mary herself probably had the worst of it  no provision was made either for her to see her lover or to write to him  the only interview which had ever taken place between them as lovers was that on which she had run by him into the house leaving him as the earl had said planted on the terrace  she had never been able to whisper one single soft word into his ear to give him even one touch of her fingers in token of her affection  she did not in the least know when she might be allowed to see himwhether it had not been settled among the elders that they were not to see each other as real lovers till he should have taken his degreewhich would be almost in a future world so distant seemed the time  it had been already settled that she was to go to carstairs in the middle of november and stay till the middle of december but it was altogether settled that her lover was not to be at carstairs during the time  he was to be at oxford then and would be thinking only of his greek and latinor perhaps amusing himself in utter forgetfulness that he had a heart belonging to him at bowick parsonage  in this way mary though no doubt she thought the most of it all had less opportunity of talking of it than either her father or her mother  in the mean time mr peacocke was coming home  the doctor as soon as he heard that the day was fixed or nearly fixed being then as has been explained in full good humour with all the world except mrs stantiloup and the bishop bethought himself as to what steps might best be taken in the very delicate matter in which he was called upon to give advice  he had declared at first that they should be married at his own parish church but he felt that there would be difficulties in this  she must go up to london and meet him there he said to mrs wortle  and he must not show himself here till he brings her down as his actual wife  then there was very much to be done in arranging all this  and something to be done also in making those who had been his friends and perhaps more in making those who had been his enemies understand exactly how the matter stood  had no injury been inflicted upon him as though he had done evil to the world in general in befriending mr peacocke he would have been quite willing to pass the matter over in silence among his friends but as it was he could not afford to hide his own light under a bushel  he was being punished almost to the extent of ruin by the cruel injustice which had been done him by the evil tongue of mrs stantiloup and as he thought by the folly of the bishop  he must now let those who had concerned themselves know as accurately as he could what he had done in the matter and what had been the effect of his doing  he wrote a letter therefore which was not however to be posted till after the peacocke marriage had been celebrated copies of which he prepared with his own hand in order that he might send them to the bishop and to lady anne clifford and to mr talbot andnot indeed to mrs stantiloup but to mrs stantiloups husband  there was a copy also made for mr momson though in his heart he despised mr momson thoroughly  in this letter he declared the great respect which he had entertained since he had first known them both for mr and mrs peacocke and the distress which he had felt when mr peacocke had found himself obliged to explain to him the factsthe facts which need not be repeated because the reader is so well acquainted with them  mr peacocke he went on to say has since been to america and has found that the man whom he believed to be dead when he married his wife has died since his calamitous reappearance  mr peacocke has seen the mans grave with the stone on it bearing his name and has brought back with him certificates and evidence as to his burial  under these circumstances i have no hesitation in reemploying both him and his wife and i think that you will agree that i could not do less  i think you will agree also that in the whole transaction i have done nothing of which the parent of any boy intrusted to me has a right to complain  having done this he went up to london and made arrangements for having the marriage celebrated there as soon as possible after the arrival of mr peacocke  and on his return to bowick he went off to mr puddicombe with a copy of his letter in his pocket  he had not addressed a copy to his friend nor had he intended that one should be sent to him  mr puddicombe had not interfered in regard to the boys and had on the whole shown himself to be a true friend  there was no need for him to advocate his cause to mr puddicombe  but it was right he thought that that gentleman should know what he did and it might be that he hoped that he would at length obtain some praise from mr puddicombe  but mr puddicombe did not like the letter  it does not tell the truth he said  not the truth  not the whole truth  as how  where have i concealed anything  if i understand the question rightly they who have thought proper to take their children away from your school because of mr peacocke have done so because that gentleman continued to live with that lady when they both knew that they were not man and wife  that wasnt my doing  you condoned it  i am not condemning you  you condoned it and now you defend yourself in this letter  but in your defence you do not really touch the offence as to which you are according to your own showing accused  in telling the whole story you should say they did live together though they were not marriedand under all the circumstances i did not think that they were on that account unfit to be left in charge of my boys  but i sent him away immediatelyto america  you allowed the lady to remain  then what would you have me say demanded the doctor  nothing said mr puddicombenot a word  live it down in silence there will be those like myself who though they could not dare to say that in morals you were strictly correct will love you the better for what you did  the doctor turned his face towards the dry hardlooking man and showed that there was a tear in each of his eyes  there are few of us not so infirm as sometimes to love best that which is not best  but when a man is asked a downright question he is bound to answer the truth  you would say nothing in your own defence  not a word  you know the french proverb who excuses himself is his own accuser the truth generally makes its way  as far as i can see a slander never lives long  ten of my boys are gone said the doctor who had not hitherto spoken a word of this to any one out of his own familyten out of twenty  that will only be a temporary loss  that is nothingnothing  it is the idea that the school should be failing  they will come again  i do not believe that that letter would bring a boy  i am almost inclined to say dr wortle that a man should never defend himself  he should never have to defend himself  it is much the same thing  but ill tell you what ill do dr wortleif it will suit your plans  i will go up with you and will assist at the marriage  i do not for a moment think that you will require any countenance or that if you did that i could give it you  no man that i know so efficiently  but it may be that mr peacocke will like to find that the clergymen from his neighbourhood are standing with him  and so it was settled that when the day should come on which the doctor would take mrs peacocke up with him to london mr puddicombe was to accompany them  the doctor when he left mr puddicombes parsonage had by no means pledged himself not to send the letters  when a man has written a letter and has taken some trouble with it and more specially when he has copied it several times himself so as to have made many letters of itwhen he has argued his point successfully to himself and has triumphed in his own mind as was likely to be the case with dr wortle in all that he did he does not like to make waste paper of his letters  as he rode home he tried to persuade himself that he might yet use them  he could not quite admit his friends point  mr peacocke no doubt had known his own condition and him a strict moralist might condemn  but hehedr wortlehad known nothing  all that he had done was not to condemn the other man when he did know  nevertheless as he rode into his own yard he made up his mind that he would burn the letters  he had shown them to no one else  he had not even mentioned them to his wife  he could burn them without condemning himself in the opinion of any one  and he burned them  when mr puddicombe found him at the station at broughton as they were about to proceed to london with mrs peacocke he simply whispered the fate of the letters  after what you said i destroyed what i had written  perhaps it was as well said mr puddicombe  when the telegram came to say that mr peacocke was at liverpool mrs peacocke was anxious immediately to rush up to london  but she was restrained by the doctoror rather by mrs wortle under the doctors orders  no my dear no  you must not go till all will be ready for you to meet him in the church  the doctor says so  am i not to see him till he comes up to the altar  on this there was another consultation between mrs wortle and the doctor at which she explained how impossible it would be for the woman to go through the ceremony with due serenity and propriety of manner unless she should be first allowed to throw herself into his arms and to welcome him back to her  yes she said he can come and see you at the hotel on the evening before and again in the morningso that if there be a word to say you can say it  then when it is over he will bring you down here the doctor and mr puddicombe will come down by a later train  of course it is painful said mrs wortle but you must bear up  to her it seemed to be so painful that she was quite sure that she could not have borne it to be married for the third time and for the second time to the same husband  to mrs peacocke as she thought of it the pain did not so much rest in that as in the condition of life which these things had forced upon her  i must go up to town tomorrow and must be away for two days said the doctor out loud in the school speaking immediately to one of the ushers but so that all the boys present might hear him  i trust that we shall have mr peacocke with us the day after tomorrow  we shall be very glad of that said the usher  and mrs peacocke will come and eat her dinner again like before asked a little boy  i hope so charley  we shall like that because she has to eat it all by herself now  all the school down even to charley the smallest boy in it knew all about it  mr peacocke had gone to america and mrs peacocke was going up to london to be married once more to her own husbandand the doctor and mr puddicombe were both going to marry them  the usher of course knew the details more clearly than thatas did probably the bigger boys there had even been a rumour of the photograph which had been seen by one of the maidservantswho had it is to be feared given the information to the french teacher  so much however the doctor had felt it wise to explain not thinking it well that mr peacocke should make his reappearance among them without notice  on the afternoon of the next day but one mr and mrs peacocke were driven up to the school in one of the broughton flys  she went quickly up into her own house when mr peacocke walked into the school  the boys clustered round him and the three assistants and every word said to him was kind and friendlybut in the whole course of his troubles there had never been a moment to him more difficult than thisin which he found it so nearly impossible to say anything or to say nothing  yes i have been over very many miles since i saw you last  this was an answer to young talbot who asked him whether he had not been a great traveller whilst he was away  in america suggested the french usher who had heard of the photograph and knew very well where it had been taken  yes in america  all the way to san francisco suggested charley  all the way to san francisco charleyand back again  yes i know youre come back again said charley because i see you here  there are only twenty boys this half said one of the twenty  then i shall have more time to attend to you now  i suppose so said the lad not seeming to find any special consolation in that view of the matter  painful as this first reintroduction had been there was not much more in it than that  no questions were asked and no explanations expected  it may be that mrs stantiloup was affected with fresh moral horrors when she heard of the return and that the bishop said that the doctor was foolish and headstrong as ever  it may be that there was a good deal of talk about it in the close at broughton  but at the school there was very little more said about it than what has been stated above    chapter xii  marys success  in this last chapter of our short story i will venture to run rapidly over a few months so as to explain how the affairs of bowick arranged themselves up to the end of the current year  i cannot pretend that the reader shall know as he ought to be made to know the future fate and fortunes of our personages  they must be left still struggling  but then is not such always in truth the case even when the happy marriage has been celebratedeven when in the course of two rapid years two normal children make their appearance to gladden the hearts of their parents  mr and mrs peacocke fell into their accustomed duties in the diminished school apparently without difficulty  as the doctor had not sent those illjudged letters he of course received no replies and was neither troubled by further criticism nor consoled by praise as to his conduct indeed it almost seemed to him as though the thing now that it was done excited less observation than it deserved  he heard no more of the metropolitan press and was surprised to find that the broughton gazette inserted only a very short paragraph in which it stated that they had been given to understand that mr and mrs peacocke had resumed their usual duties at the bowick school after the performance of an interesting ceremony in london at which dr wortle and mr puddicombe had assisted the press as far as the doctor was aware said nothing more on the subject  and if remarks injurious to his conduct were made by the stantiloups and the momsons they did not reach his ears  very soon after the return of the peacockes there was a grand dinnerparty at the palace to which the doctor and his wife were invited  it was not a clerical dinnerparty and so the honour was the greater  the aristocracy of the neighbourhood were there including lady anne clifford who was devoted with almost repentant affection to her old friend  and lady margaret momson was there the only clergymans wife besides his own who declared to him with unblushing audacity that she had never regretted anything so much in her life as that augustus should have been taken away from the school  it was evident that there had been an intention at the palace to make what amends the palace could for the injuries it had done  did lady anne say anything about the boys asked mrs wortle as they were going home  she was going to but i would not let her  i managed to show her that i did not wish it and she was clever enough to stop  i shouldnt wonder if she sent them back said mrs wortle  she wont do that  indeed i doubt whether i should take them  but if it should come to pass that she should wish to send them back you may be sure that others will come  in such a matter she is very good as a weathercock showing how the wind blows  in this way the dinnerparty at the palace was in a degree comforting and consolatory  but an incident which of all was most comforting and most consolatory to one of the inhabitants of the parsonage took place two or three days after the dinnerparty  on going out of his own halldoor one saturday afternoon immediately after lunch whom should the doctor see driving himself into the yard in a hired gig from broughtonbut young lord carstairs  there had been no promise or absolute compact made but it certainly had seemed to be understood by all of them that carstairs was not to show himself at bowick till at some long distant period when he should have finished all the trouble of his education  it was understood even that he was not to be at carstairs during marys visitso imperative was it that the young people should not meet  and now here he was getting out of a gig in the rectory yard  halloa  carstairs is that you  yes dr wortlehere i am  we hardly expected to see you my boy  noi suppose not  but when i heard that mr peacocke had come back and all about his marriage you know i could not but come over to see him  he and i have always been such great friends  ohto see mr peacocke  i thought hed think it unkind if i didnt look him up  he has made it all right hasnt he  yeshe has made it all right i think  a finer fellow never lived but hell tell you all about it  he travelled with a pistol in his pocket and seemed to want it too  i suppose you must come in and see the ladies after we have been to peacocke  i suppose i can just see them said the young lord as though moved by equal anxiety as to the mother and as to the daughter  ill leave word that you are here and then well go into the school so the doctor found a servant and sent what message he thought fit into the house  lord carstairs here  yes indeed miss  hes with your papa going across to the school  he told me to take word in to missus that he supposes his lordship will stay to dinner  the maid who carried the tidings and who had received no commission to convey them to miss mary was no doubt too much interested in an affair of love not to take them first to the one that would be most concerned with them  that very morning mary had been bemoaning herself as to her hard condition  of what use was it to her to have a lover if she was never to see him never to hear from himonly to be told about himthat she was not to think of him more than she could help  she was already beginning to think that a long engagement carried on after this fashion would have more of suffering in it than she had anticipated  it seemed to her that while she was and always would be thinking of him he never never would continue to think of her  if it could be only a word once a month it would be somethingjust one or two written words under an envelopeeven that would have sufficed to keep her hope alive  but never to see himnever to hear from him  her mother had told her that very morning that there was to be no meetingprobably for three years till he should have done with oxford  and here he was in the houseand her papa had sent in word to say that he was to eat his dinner there  it so astonished her that she felt that she would be afraid to meet him before she had had a minute to think of it all her mother was with her carstairs love is here  oh mamma what has brought him  he has gone into the school with your papa to see mr peacocke  he always was very fond of mr peacocke  for a moment something of a feeling of jealousy crossed her heartbut only for a moment  he would not surely have come to bowick if he had begun to be indifferent to her already  papa says that he will probably stay to dinner  then i am to see him  yesof course you must see him  i didnt know mamma  dont you wish to see him  oh yes mamma  if he were to come and go and we were not to meet at all i should think it was all over then  onlyi dont know what to say to him  you must take that as it comes my dear  two hours afterwards they were walking the two of them alone together out in the bowick woods  when once the lawwhich had been rather understood than spokenhad been infringed and set at naught there was no longer any use in endeavouring to maintain a semblance of its restriction  the two young people had met in the presence both of the father and mother and the lover had had her in his arms before either of them could interfere  there had been a little scream from mary but it may probably be said of her that she was at the moment the happiest young lady in the diocese  does your father know you are here said the doctor as he led the young lord back from the school into the house  he knows im coming for i wrote and told my mother  i always tell everything but its sometimes best to make up your mind before you get an answer  then the doctor made up his mind that lord carstairs would have his own way in anything that he wished to accomplish  wont the earl be angry mrs wortle asked  nonot angry  he knows the world too well not to be quite sure that something of the kind would happen  and he is too fond of his son not to think well of anything that he does  it wasnt to be supposed that they should never meet  after all that has passed i am bound to make him welcome if he chooses to come here and as marys lover to give him the best welcome that i can  he wont stay i suppose because he has got no clothes  but he hasjohn brought in a portmanteau and a dressingbag out of the gig  so that was settled  in the mean time lord carstairs had taken mary out for a walk into the wood and she as she walked beside him hardly knew whether she was going on her head or her heels  this indeed it was to have a lover  in the morning she was thinking that when three years were past he would hardly care to see her ever again  and now they were together among the falling leaves and sitting about under the branches as though there was nothing in the world to separate them  up to that day there had never been a word between them but such as is common to mere acquaintances and now he was calling her every instant by her christian name and telling her all his secrets  we have such jolly woods at carstairs he said but we shant be able to sit down when were there because it will be winter  we shall be hunting and you must come out and see us  but you wont be there when i am she said timidly  wont i  thats all you know about it  i can manage better than that  youll be at oxford  you must stay over christmas mary thats what you must do  you musnt think of going till january  but lady bracy wont want me  yes she will  we must make her want you  at any rate theyll understand this if you dont stay for me i shall come home even if its in the middle of term  ill arrange that  you dont suppose im not going to be there when you make your first visit to the old place  all this was being in paradise  she felt when she walked home with him and when she was alone afterwards in her own room that in truth she had only liked him before  now she loved him  now she was beginning to know him and to feel that she would reallyreally die of a broken heart if anything were to rob her of him  but she could let him go now without a feeling of discomfort if she thought that she was to see him again when she was at carstairs  but this was not the last walk in the woods even on this occasion  he remained two days at bowick so necessary was it for him to renew his intimacy with mr peacocke  he explained that he had got two days leave from the tutor of his college and that two days in college parlance always meant three  he would be back on the third day in time for gates and that was all which the strictest college discipline would require of him  it need hardly be said of him that the most of his time he spent with mary but he did manage to devote an hour or two to his old friend the schoolassistant  mr peacocke told his whole story and carstairs whose morals were perhaps not quite so strict as those of mr puddicombe gave him all his sympathy  to think that a man can be such a brute as that he said when he heard that ferdinand lefroy had shown himself to his wife at st louisonly on a spree  there is no knowing to what depth utter ruin may reduce a man who has been born to better things  he falls into idleness and then comforts himself with drink  so it seems to have been with him  and that other fellowdo you think he meant to shoot you  never  but he meant to frighten me  and when he brought out his knife in the bedroom at leavenworth he did  my pistol was not loaded  why not  because little as i wish to be murdered i should prefer that to murdering any one else  but he didnt mean it  his only object was to get as much out of me as he could  as for me i couldnt give him more because i hadnt got it  after that they made a league of friendship and mr peacocke promised that he would on some distant occasion take his wife with him on a visit to carstairs  it was about a month after this that mary was packed up and sent on her journey to carstairs  when that took place the doctor was in supreme goodhumour  there had come a letter from the father of the two mowbrays saying that he had again changed his mind  he had he said heard a story told two ways  he trusted dr wortle would understand him and forgive him when he declared that he had believed both the stories  if after this the doctor chose to refuse to take his boys back again he would have he acknowledged no ground for offence  but if the doctor would take them he would intrust them to the doctors care with the greatest satisfaction in the worldas he had done before  for a while the doctor had hesitated but here perhaps for the first time in her life his wife was allowed to persuade him  they are such leading people she said  who cares for that  i have never gone in for that  this however was hardly true  when i have been sure that a man is a gentleman i have taken his son without inquiring much farther  it was mean of him to withdraw after i had acceded to his request  but he withdraws his withdrawal in such a flattering way  then the doctor assented and the two boys were allowed to come  lady anne clifford hearing this learning that the doctor was so far willing to relent became very piteous and implored forgiveness  the noble relatives were all willing now  it had not been her fault  as far as she was concerned herself she had always been anxious that her boys should remain at bowick  and so the two cliffords came back to their old beds in the old room  mary when she first arrived at carstairs hardly knew how to carry herself  lady bracy was very cordial and the earl friendly but for the first two days nothing was said about carstairs  there was no open acknowledgment of her position  but then she had expected none and though her tongue was burning to talk of course she did not say a word but before a week was over lady bracy had begun and by the end of the fortnight lord bracy had given her a beautiful brooch  that means said lady bracy in the confidence of her own little sittingroom upstairs that he looks upon you as his daughter  does it  yes my dear yes  then they fell to kissing each other and did nothing but talk about carstairs and all his perfections and his unalterable love and how these three years could be made to wear themselves away till the conversationsimmering over as such conversation is wont to dogave the whole household to understand that miss wortle was staying there as lord carstairss future bride  of course she stayed over the christmas or went back to bowick for a week and then returned to carstairs so that she might tell her mother everything and hear of the six new boys who were to come after the holidays  papa couldnt take both the buncombes said mrs wortle in her triumph and one must remain till midsummer  sir george did say that it must be two or none but he had to give way  i wanted papa to have another bed in the east room but he wouldnt hear of it  mary went back for the christmas and carstairs came and the house was full and everybody knew of the engagement  she walked with him and rode with him and danced with him and talked secrets with himas though there were no oxford no degree before him  no doubt it was very imprudent but the earl and the countess knew all about it  what might be or would be or was the end of such folly it is not my purpose here to tell  i fear that there was trouble before them  it may however be possible that the degree should be given up on the score of love and lord carstairs should marry his brideat any rate when he came of age  as to the school it certainly suffered nothing by the doctors generosity and when last i heard of mr peacocke the bishop had offered to grant him a licence for the curacy  whether he accepted it i have not yet heard but i am inclined to think that in this matter he will adhere to his old determination                                           textual
