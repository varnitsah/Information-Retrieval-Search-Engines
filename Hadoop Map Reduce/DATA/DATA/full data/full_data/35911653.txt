35911653	ungava by rm ballantyne  introduction  the following story is intended to illustrate one of the many phases of the furtraders life in those wild regions of north america which surround hudsons bay  most of its major incidents are factsfiction being employed chiefly for the purpose of weaving these facts into a readable form  if this volume should chance to fall into the hands of any of those who acted a part in the first settlement of ungava we trust that they will forgive the liberty that has been taken with their persons and adventures remembering that transpositions modifications and transformations are necessary in constructing a tale out of the raw material  we take this opportunity of expressing to the leader of the adventurous band our grateful acknowledgements for his kindness in placing at our disposal the groundwork on which this story has been reared  rm  ballantyne    chapter one  the forest and the leaders of the folornhopea good shota consultationan icefloe and a narrow chance of escape in a small way  hallo where are you shouted a voice that rang through the glades of the forest like the blast of a silver trumpet testifying to lungs of leather and a throat of brass  the ringing tones died away and naught was heard save the rustling of the leafy canopy overhead as the young man whose shout had thus rudely disturbed the surrounding echoes leaned on the muzzle of a long rifle and stood motionless as a statue his right foot resting on the trunk of a fallen tree and his head bent slightly to one side as if listening for a reply  but no reply came  a squirrel ran down the trunk of a neighbouring pine and paused with tail and ears erect and its little black eyes glittering as if with surprise at the temerity of him who so recklessly dared to intrude upon and desecrate with his powerful voice the deep solitudes of the wilderness  they stood so long thus that it seemed as though the little animal and the man had been petrified by the unwonted sound  if so the spell was quickly broken  the loud report of a fowlingpiece was heard at a short distance  the squirrel incontinently disappeared from the spot on which it stood and almost instantaneously reappeared on the topmost branch of a high tree while the young man gave a smile of satisfaction threw the rifle over his shoulder and turning round strode rapidly away in the direction whence the shot proceeded  a few minutes walk brought him to the banks of a little brook by the side of which on the projecting root of a tree sat a man with a dead goose at his feet and a fowlingpiece by his side  he was dressed in the garb of a hunter and from the number of gray hairs that shone like threads of silver among the black curls on his temples he was evidently past the meridian of lifealthough from the upright bearing of his tall muscular frame and the quick glance of his fearless black eye it was equally evident that the vigour of his youth was not yet abated  why stanley exclaimed the young man as he approached ive been shouting till my throat is cracked for at least half an hour  i verily began to think that you had forsaken me altogether  in which case frank replied the other i should have treated you as you deserve for your empty gamebag proves you an unworthy comrade in the chase  so so friend do not boast replied the youth with a smile if i mistake not that goose was winging its way to the far north not ten minutes agone  had i come up half an hour sooner i suspect we should have met on equal terms but the fact is that i have not seen hair or feather save a treesquirrel since i left you in the morning  well to say truth i was equally unfortunate until i met this luckless goose and fired the shot that brought him down and brought you up  but ive had enough o this now and shall back to the fort again  what say you  will you go in my canoe or walk  the young man was silent for a few seconds then without replying to his companions question he saidbythebye is it not tonight that you mean to make another attempt to induce the men to volunteer for the expedition  it is replied stanley with a alight frown  and what if they still persist in refusing to go  ill try once more to shame them out of their cowardice  but if they wont agree ill compel them to go by means of more powerful arguments than words  tis not cowardice you do the men injustice said frank shaking his head  well well i believe i do lad youre right replied stanley while a smile smoothed out the firm lines that had gathered round his lips for a few seconds  no doubt they care as little for the anticipated dangers of the expedition as any men living and they hesitate to go simply because they know that the life before them will be a lonely one at such an outotheway place as ungava  but we cant help that frank the interests of the company must be attended to and so go they must willing or not willing  but im annoyed at this unexpected difficulty for theres a mighty difference between men who volunteer to go and men who go merely because they must and cant help it  the young man slowly rubbed the stock of his rifle with the sleeve of his coat and looked as if he understood and sympathised with his friends chagrin  if prince were only here just now said he looking up there would be no difficulty in the matter  these fellows only want a bold hearty comrade to step forward and show them the way and they will follow to the north pole if need be  they look upon our willingness to go as a mere matter of course though i dont see why we should be expected to like banishment more than themselves  but if prince were  well well prince is not here so we must do the best we can without him said stanley  as he spoke the trumpet note of a goose was heard in the distance  there he goesdown with you exclaimed frank darting suddenly behind the stump of the tree while his companion crouched beside him and both began to shout at the top of their voices in imitation of the goose  the bird was foolish enough to accept the invitation immediately although had it been other than a goose it would have easily recognised the sound as a wretched counterfeit of the goose language  it flew directly towards them as geese always do in spring when thus enticed but passed at such a distance that the elder sportsman was induced to lower his piece  ah hes too far off  youd better give him a shot with the rifle frank but youre sure to miss  to hit you mean cried his companion flushing with momentary indignation at this disparaging remark  at the same moment he took a rapid aim and fired  for a few yards the goose continued its forward flight as if unhurt then it wavered once or twice and fell heavily to the ground  bravo boy cried stanley  there dont look nettled i only jested with you knowing your weakness on the score of rifleshooting  now pick up your bird and throw it into the canoe for i must away  frank finished reloading his piece as his friend spoke and went to pick up the goose while the other walked down to the edge of the rivulet and disengaged a light birchbark canoe from the long grass and sedges that almost hid it from view  make haste frank he shouted theres the ice coming up with the floodtide and bearing down on the creek here  at a short distance from the spot where the sportsmen stood the streamlet already alluded to mingled its waters with a broad river which a few miles farther down flows into jamess bay  as every one knows this bay lies to the south of hudsons bay in north america here the river is about two miles wide and the shores on either side being low it has all the appearance of an extensive lake  in spring after the disruption of the ice its waters are loaded with large floes and fields of ice and later in the season after it has become quite free from this wintry encumbrance numerous detached masses come up with every floodtide  it was the approach of one of these floes that called forth stanleys remark  the young man replied to it by springing towards the canoe in which his companion was already seated  throwing the dead bird into it he stooped and gave the light bark a powerful shove into the stream exclaiming as he did so there strike out youve no time to lose and ill go round by the woods  there was indeed no time to lose  the huge mass of ice was closing rapidly into the mouth of the creek and narrowing the only passage through which the canoe could escape into the open water of the river beyond  stanley might indeed drag his canoe up the bank if so disposed and reach home by a circuitous walk through the woods but by doing so he would lose much time and be under the necessity of carrying his gun blanket tin kettle and the goose on his back  his broad shoulders were admirably adapted for such a burden but he preferred the canoe to the woods on the present occasion  besides the only risk he ran was that of getting his canoe crushed to pieces  so plunging his paddle vigorously in the water he shot through the lessening channel like an arrow and swept out on the bosom of the broad river just as the ice closed with a crash upon the shore and ground itself to powder on the rocks  well done shouted frank with a wave of his cap as he witnessed the success of his friends exploit  all right replied stanley glancing over his shoulder  in another moment the canoe disappeared behind a group of willows that grew on the point at the rivers mouth and the young man was left alone  for a few minutes he stood contemplating the point behind which his companion had disappeared then giving a hasty glance at the priming of his rifle he threw it across his shoulder and striding rapidly up the bank was soon lost to view amid the luxuriant undergrowth of the forest    chapter two  headquartersthe mendisputation and uncertaintynew uses for the skins of dead boysmutinous resolves  moose fort the headquarters and depot of the furtraders who prosecute their traffic in almost all parts of the wild and uninhabited regions of north america stands on an island near the mouth of moose river  like all the establishments of the furtraders it is a solitary group of wooden buildings far removed beyond the influencesalmost beyond the kenof the civilised world and surrounded by the primeval wilderness the only tenants of which were at the time we write of a few scattered tribes of muskigon indians and the wild animals whose flesh furnished them with food and whose skins constituted their sole wealth  there was little of luxury at moose fort  the walls of the houses within the stockade that served more as an ornament than a defence were of painted in some cases unpainted planks  the floors ceilings chairs tables and in short all the articles of furniture in the place were made of the same rough material  a lofty scaffolding of wood rose above the surrounding buildings and served as an outlook whence at the proper season longing eyes were wont to be turned towards the sea in expectation of the ship which paid the establishment an annual visit from england  several large iron fieldpieces stood before the front gate but they were more for the sake of appearance than use and were never fired except for the purpose of saluting the said ship on the occasions of her arrival and departure  the first boom of the cannon unlocks the longclosed portals of connection between moose fort and england the second salvo shuts them up again in their frozen domains for another year  a century and a half ago the band of adventurers trading into hudsons bay felled the first trees and pitched their tents on the shores of jamess bay and successive generations of furtraders have kept the post until the present day yet there is scarcely a symptom of the presence of man beyond a few miles round the establishment  years ago the fort was built and there it stands now with new tenants it is true but in its general aspect unchanged and there it is likely to remain wrapped in its barrier of all but impregnable solitude for centuries to come  nevertheless moose is a comfortable place in its way and when contrasted with other trading establishments is a very palace and temple of luxury  there are men within its walls who can tell of loghuts and starvation solitude and desolation compared with which moose is a terrestrial paradise  frank morton whom we have introduced in the first chapter said on his arrival at moose that it appeared to him to be the very fagend of creation  he had travelled night and day for six weeks from what he considered the very outskirts of civilisation through uninhabited forests and almost unknown rivers in order to get to it and while the feeling of desolation that overwhelmed him on his first arrival was strong upon him he sighed deeply and called it a horrid dull hole  but frank was of a gay hearty joyous disposition and had not been there long ere he loved the old fort dearly  poor fellow far removed though he was from his fellowmen at moose he afterwards learned that he had but obtained an indistinct notion of the signification of the word solitude  there were probably about thirty human beings at moose when mr george stanley one of the principal furtraders of the place received orders from the governor to make preparations and select men for the purpose of proceeding many hundred miles deeper into the northern wilderness and establishing a station on the distant almost unknown shores of ungava bay  no one at moose had ever been there before no one knew anything about the route except from the vague report of a few indians and the only thing that was definitely known about the locality at all was that its inhabitants were a few wandering tribes of esquimaux who were at deadly feud with the indians and generally massacred all who came within their reach  what the capabilities of the country were in regard to timber and provisions nobody knew and fortunately for the success of the expedition nobody cared  at least those who were to lead the way did not and this admirable quality of total indifference to prospective dangers is that which to a great extent insures success in a forlorn hope  of the leaders of this expedition the reader already knows something george stanley was nearly six feet high forty years of age and endued with a decision of character that but for his quiet good humour would have been deemed obstinacy  he was deliberate in all his movements and exercised a control over his feelings that quite concealed his naturally enthusiastic disposition  moreover he was married and had a daughter of ten years of age  this might be thought a disadvantage in his present circumstances but the governor of the furtraders a most energetic and active ruler thought otherwise  he recommended that the family should be left at moose until an establishment had been built and a winter passed at ungava  afterwards they could join him there as for frank morton he was an inch taller than his friend stanley and equally powerful fairhaired blueeyed hilarious romantic twentytwo years of age and so impulsive that on hearing of the proposed expedition from one of his comrades who happened to be present when stanley was reading the dispatches he sprang from his chair which he upset dashed out at the door which he banged and hurried to his friends quarters in order to be first to volunteer his services as second in command which offer was rendered unnecessary by stanleys exclaiming the moment he entered his room  ha frank my lad the very man i wanted to see  heres a letter from headquarters ordering me off on an expedition to ungava  now i want volunteers will you go  it is needless to add that franks blue eyes sparkled with animation as he seized his friends hand and replied to the north pole if you like or farther if need be  it was evening  the sun was gilding the top of the flagstaff with a parting kiss and the inhabitants of moose fort having finished their daily toil were making preparations for their evening meal  on the end of the wharf that jutted out into the stream was assembled a picturesque group of men who from the earnest manner in which they conversed and the energy of their gesticulations were evidently discussing a subject of more than ordinary interest  most of them were clad in corduroy trousers gartered below the knee with thongs of deerskin and coarse striped cotton shirts open at the neck so as to expose their sunburnt breasts  a few wore caps which whatever might have been their original form were now so much soiled and battered out of shape by long and severe service that they were nondescript but most of these hardy backwoodsmen were content with the covering afforded by their thick bushy locks  no no exclaimed a short thickset powerful man with a somewhat ascetic cast of countenance ive seen more than enough o these rascally huskies esquimaux  tis well for me that im here this blessed day an not made into a dan to bob about in hudsons straits at the tail of a white whale like that poor boy peter who was shot by them varmints  whats a dan asked a young halfbreed who had lately arrived at moose and knew little of esquimau implements  what a greenhorn you must be francois not to know what a dan is replied another who was inclined to be quizzical  why its a sort of seacarriage that the esquimaux tie to the tail of a walrus or seahorse when they feel inclined for a drive  when they cant get a seahorse they catch a white whale asleep and wake him up after fastening the dan to his tail  i suppose they have conjurers or wizards among them since massan told us just now that poor peter was  bah gammon interrupted francois with a smile as he turned to the first speaker  but tell me massan what is a dan  its a sort o float or buoy lad used by the huskies and is made out o the skin o the seal  they tie it with a long line to their whale spears to show which way the fish bolts when struck  and did they use peters skin for such a purpose inquired francois earnestly  they did replied massan  and did you see them do it  yes i did  francois gazed intently into his comrades face as he spoke but massan was an adept at what is usually called drawing the long bow and it was with the most imperturbable gravity that he continued  yes i saw them do it but i could not render any assistance to the poor child for i was lying close behind a rock at the time with an arrow sticking between my shoulders and a score o them oily varmints ashoutin and yellin and flourishing their spears in search o me  tell us how it happened massan  lets hear the story chorused the men as they closed round their comrade  well then began the stout backwoodsman proceeding leisurely to fill his pipe from an ornamented bag that hung at his belt here goes  it was about the yearai forget the year but it dont matterthat we were ordered off on an expedition to the huskies xactly sich a one as they wants us to go on now andbut youve heerd o that business lads havent you  yes yes weve heard all about it go on  well continued massan i neednt be wastin time tellin you how we failed in that affair and how the huskies killed some of our men and burnt our ship to the waters edge  after it was all over and they thought they had killed us all i was as i said lyin behind a great rock in a sort o cave lookin at the dirty villains as they danced about on the shore and took possession of all our goods  suddenly i seed two o them carry peter down to the beach an i saw as they passed me that he was quite dead  in less time than i can count a hundred they took the skin off him cut off his head sewed up the hole tied his arms and legs in a knot blew him full o wind till he was fit to bust an then hung him up to dry in the sun  in fact they made a dan of him  a loud shout of laughter greeted this startling conclusion  in truth we must do massan the justice to say that although he was much in the habit of amusing his companions by entertaining them with anecdotes which originated entirely in his own teeming fancy he never actually deceived them but invariably either by a sly glance or by the astounding nature of his communication gave them to understand that he was dealing not with fact but fiction  but seriously lads said francois whose intelligence added to a grave manly countenance and a tall muscular frame caused him to be regarded by his comrades as a sort of leader both in action and in council what do you think of our bourgeois plan  for my part im willing enough to go to any reasonable part o the country where there are furs and indians but as for this ungava from what massan says theres neither indians nor furs nor victualsnothin but rocks and mountains and eternal winter and if we do get the huskies about us theyll very likely serve us as they did the last expedition to richmond gulf  ay ay cried one of the others you may say that francois  nothin but frost and starvation and nobody to bury us when were dead  except the huskies broke in another who would save themselves the trouble by converting us all into dans  tush man stop your clapper cried francois impatiently let us settle this business  you know that monsieur stanley said he would expect us to be ready with an answer tonightwhat think you gaspard shall we go or shall we mutiny  the individual addressed was a fine specimen of an animal but not by any means a good specimen of a man  he was of gigantic proportions straight and tall as a poplar and endowed with the strength of a hercules  his glittering dark eyes and long black hair together with the hue of his skin bespoke him of halfbreed extraction  but his countenance did not correspond to his fine physical proportions  true his features were good but they wore habitually a scowling sulky expression even when the man was pleased and there was more of sarcasm than joviality in the sound when gaspard condescended to laugh  ill be shot if i go to such a hole for the best bourgeois in the country said he in reply to francois question  youll be dismissed the service if you dont remarked massan with a smile  to this gaspard vouchsafed no reply save a growl that to say the best of it did not sound amiable  well i think that were all pretty much of one mind on the point continued francois and yet i feel half ashamed to refuse after all especially when i see the good will with which messieurs stanley and morton agree to go  i suppose you expect to be a bourgeois too some day growled gaspard with a sneer  eh tu gros chien cried francois as with flashing eyes and clinched fists he strode up to his illtempered comrade  come come francois dont quarrel for nothing said massan interposing his broad shoulders and pushing him vigorously back  at that moment an exclamation from one of the men diverted the attention of the others  voila the canoe  ay its monsieur stanleys canoe  i saw him and monsieur morton start for the swamp this morning  i wonder what dick prince would have done in this business had he been here said francois to massan in a low tone as they stood watching the approach of their bourgeois canoe  cant say  i half think he would have gone  theres no chance of him coming back in time i fear  none unless he prevails on some goose to lend him a pair of wings for a day or two  he wont be back from the hunt for three weeks good  in a few minutes more the canoe skimmed up to the wharf  here lads cried mr stanley as he leaped ashore and dragged the canoe out of the water one of you come and lift this canoe up the bank and take these geese to the kitchen  two of the men instantly hastened to obey and stanley with the gun and paddles under his arm proceeded towards the gateway of the fort  as he passed the group assembled on the wharf he turned and said  youll come to the hall in an hour lads i shall expect you to be ready with an answer by that time  ay ay sir replied several of the men  but we wont go for all your expectations said one in an undertone to a comrade  i should think not whispered another  ill be hanged and burnt and frozen if i do said a third  in the meantime mr stanley walked briskly towards his dwelling and left the men to grumble over their troubles and continue their debate as to whether they should or should not agree to go on the pending expedition to the distant regions of ungava    chapter three  shows how stanley deigned to consult with womankindthe opinions of a child developedpersuasion failsexample triumphsthe first volunteers to ungava  on reaching his apartment which was in an angle of the principal edifice in the fort mr stanley flung down his gun and paddles and drawing a chair close to his wife who was working with her needle near a window took her hand in his and heaved a deep sigh  why george thats what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship  true jessie he replied patting her shoulder with a hand that rough service had rendered hard and long exposure had burnt brown  but the producing cause then was different from what it is now  then it was love now it is perplexity  stanleys wife was the daughter of english parents who had settled many years ago in the fur countries  being quite beyond the reach of any school they had been obliged to undertake the instruction of their only child jessie as they best could  at first this was an easy matter but as years flew by and little jessies mind expanded it was found to be a difficult matter to carry on her education in a country in most parts of which books were not to be had and schoolmasters did not exist when the difficulty first presented itself they talked of sending their little one to england to finish her education but being unable to bring themselves to part with her they resolved to have a choice selection of books sent out to them  jessies mother was a clever accomplished and ladylike woman and decidedly pious so that the little flower which was indeed born to blush unseen grew up to be a gentle affectionate womanone who was a lady in all her thoughts and actions yet had never seen polite society save that of her father and mother  in process of time jessie became mrs stanley and the mother of a little girl whose voice was at the time her father entered ringing cheerfully in an adjoining room  mrs stanleys nature was an earnest one and she no sooner observed that her husband was worried about something than she instantly dropped the light tone in which she at first addressed him  and what perplexes you now dear george she said laying down her work and looking up in his face with that straightforward earnest gaze that in days of yore had set the stout backwoodsmans heart on fire and still kept it in a perennial blaze  nothing very serious he replied with a smile only these fellows have taken it into their stupid heads that ungava is worse than the land beyond the styx and so after the tough battle that i had with you this morning in order to prevail on you to remain here for a winter without me ive had to fight another battle with them in order to get them to go on this expedition  have you been victorious inquired mrs stanley  no not yet  do you really mean to say they are afraid to go  has prince refused are francois gaspard and massan cowards she inquired her eye kindling with indignation  nay my wife not so  these men are not cowards nevertheless they dont feel inclined to go and as for dick prince he has been off hunting for a week and i dont expect him back for three weeks at least by which time we shall be off  mrs stanley sighed as if she felt the utter helplessness of woman in such affairs  why jessie thats what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship said stanley smiling  ah george like you i may say that the cause is now perplexity for what can i do to help you in your present difficulty  truly not much  but i like to tell you of my troubles and to make more of them than they deserve for the sake of drawing forth your sympathy  bless your heart he said in a sudden burst of enthusiasm i would gladly undergo any amount of trouble every day if by so doing i should secure that earnest loving anxious gaze of your sweet blue eyes as a reward  stanley imprinted a hearty kiss on his wifes cheek as he made this loverlike speech and then rose to place his fowlingpiece on the pegs from which it usually hung over the fireplace  at that moment the door opened and a little girl with bright eyes and flaxen hair bounded into the room  o mamma mamma she said holding up a sheet of paper while a look of intense satisfaction beamed on her animated countenance see i have drawn chimos portrait  is it like mamma  do you think it like  come here eda my darling come to me said stanley seating himself on a chair and extending his arms  edith instantly left the portrait of the dog in her mothers possession and without waiting for an opinion as to its merits ran to her father jumped on his knee threw her arms round his neck and kissed him  edith was by no means a beautiful child but miserable indeed must have been the taste of him who would have pronounced her plainlooking  her features were not regular her nose had a strong tendency to what is called snubbed and her mouth was large but to counterbalance these defects she had a pair of large deepblue eyes soft golden hair a fair rosy complexion and an expression of sweetness at the corners of her mouth that betrayed habitual goodnature  she was quick in all her movements combined with a peculiar softness and grace of deportment that was exceedingly attractive  would you like to go my pet said her father to a country far far away in the north where there are high mountains and deep valleys inhabited by beautiful reindeer and large lakes and rivers filled with fish where there is very little daylight all the long winter and where there is scarcely any night all the long bright summer  would my eda like to go there  the child possessed that fascinating quality of being intensely interested in all that was said to her  as her father spoke her eyes gradually expanded and looked straight into his while her head turned slowly and very slightly to one side  as he concluded she replied oh very very very much indeed with a degree of energy that made both her parents laugh  ah my darling would that my lazy men were endued with some of your spirit said stanley patting the childs head  is prince a lazy man papa inquired edith anxiously  no certainly prince is not  why do you ask  because i love prince  and do you not love all the men  no replied edith with some hesitation at least i dont love them very much and i hate one  hate one echoed mrs stanley  come here my darling  eda slipped from her fathers knee and went to her mother feeling and looking as if she had said something wrong  mrs stanley was not one of those mothers who whenever they hear of their children having done anything wrong assume a look of intense solemnised horror that would lead an ignorant spectator to suppose that intelligence had just been received of some sudden and appalling catastrophe  she knew that children could not be deceived by such pieces of acting  she expressed on her countenance precisely what she felta slight degree of sorrow that her child should cherish an evil passion which she knew existed in her heart in common with all the human race but which she expected by gods help and blessing to subdue effectually at last  kissing edas forehead she said kindlywhich of them do you hate darling  gaspard replied the child  and why do you hate him  because he struck my dog said eda while her face flushed and her eyes sparkled and he is always rude to everybody and very very cruel to the dogs  that is very wrong of gaspard but dearest eda do you not remember what is written in gods wordlove your enemies  it is wrong to hate anybody  i know that mamma and i dont wish to hate gaspard but i cant help it  i wish if i didnt hate him but it wont go away  well my pet replied mrs stanley pressing the child to her bosom but you must pray for him and speak kindly to him when you meet him and that will perhaps put it away  and now let us talk of the faroff country that papa was speaking about  i wonder what he has to tell you about it  stanley had been gazing out of the window during the foregoing colloquy apparently inattentive though in reality deeply interested in what was said  turning round he said  i was going to tell eda that you had arranged to follow me to that country next year and that perhaps you would bring her along with you  nay george you mistake  i did not arrange to do soyou only proposed the arrangement but to say truth i dont like it and i cant make up my mind to let you go without us  i cannot wait till next year  well well jessie i have exhausted all my powers of persuasion  i leave it entirely to yourself to do as you think best  at this moment the sound of deep voices was heard in the hall which was separated from stanleys quarters by a thin partition of wood  in a few seconds the door opened and george barney the irish butler and general factotum to the establishment announced that the min wos in the hall awaitin  giving eda a parting kiss stanley rose and entered the hall where francois massan gaspard and several others were grouped in a corner on their bourgeois entering they doffed their bonnets and bowed  well lads began stanley with a smile youve thought better of it i hope and have come to volunteer for this expedition he checked himself and frowned for he saw by their looks that they had come with quite a different intention  what have you to say to me he continued abruptly  the men looked uneasily at each other and then fixed their eyes on francois who was evidently expected to be spokesman  come francois speak out said stanley if you have any objections out with them youre free to say what you please here  as he spoke and ere francois could reply frank morton entered the room  ah he exclaimed as he deposited his rifle in a corner and flung his cap on the table in time i see to help at the council  i was just asking francois to state his objections to going said stanley as his young friend took his place beside him  objections repeated frank what objections can bold spirits have to go on a bold adventure  the question should have been who will be first to volunteer  at this moment the door of stanleys apartment opened and his wife appeared leading eda by the hand  here are two volunteers she said with a smile pray put us at the head of your list  we will go with you to any part of the world  bravo shouted frank catching up eda with whom he was a great favourite and hugging her tightly in his arms  nay but wife this is sheer folly  you know not the dangers that await you  perhaps not interrupted mrs stanley but you know them and that is enough for me  indeed jessie i know them not  i can but guess at thembut ah well tis useless to argue further  be it so we shall head the list with you and eda  and put my name next said a deeptoned voice from behind the other men  all turned round in surprise  dick prince they exclaimed you here  ay lads said a tall man of about forty who was not so remarkable for physical development though in this respect he was by no means deficient as for a certain decision of character that betrayed itself in every outline of his masculine intelligent countenanceay lads im here an sorry am i that ive jist comed in time to hear that youre sich poorspirited rascals as to hang back when ye should jump forard  but how came you so opportunely prince inquired stanley  i met an injin sir as told me you was goin off so i thought you might want me and comed straight back  and now sir im ready to go and so is francois he continued turning to that individual who seized his hand and exclaimed that am i my boyto the moon if ye like  and massan too continued prince  all right book me for nova zembla replied that worthy  so so cried mr stanley with a satisfied smile  i see lads that were all of one mind now  is it not so  are we agreed  agreed agreed they replied with one voice  thats well he continued  now then lads clear out and get your kits readyand ho  barney give these men a glass of grogprince i shall want to talk with you this evening  come to me an hour hence and now he added taking eda by the hand come along my gentle volunteers lets go to supper    chapter four  explanatory but not drymurderous designs thwarted by vigorous treatmentthe cattle pay for itpreparations for a long long voyage  in order to render our story intelligible it is necessary here to say a few words explanatory of the nature and object of the expedition referred to in the foregoing chapters  many years previous to the opening of our tale it was deemed expedient by the rulers of the hudsons bay fur company to effect if possible a reconciliation or treaty of peace between the muskigon indians of jamess bay and the esquimaux of hudsons straits  the muskigons are by no means a warlike race on the contrary they are naturally timid and only plucked up courage to make war on their northern neighbours in consequence of these poor people being destitute of firearms while themselves were supplied with guns and ammunition by the furtraders the esquimaux however are much superior to the muskigon indians physically and would have held their adversaries in light esteem had they met on equal terms or indeed on any terms at all but the evil was that they never met  the indians always took them by surprise and from behind the rocks and bushes sent destruction into their camps with the deadly bullet while their helpless foes could only reply with the comparatively harmless arrow and spear  thus the war was in fact an annual raid of murderers  the conceited muskigons returned to their wigwams in triumph with bloody scalps hanging at their belts while the esquimaux pushed farther into their icebound fastnesses and told their comrades with lowering brows and heaving bosoms of the sudden attack and of the wives and children who had been butchered in cold blood or led captive to the tents of the cowardly red men  at such times those untutored inhabitants of the frozen regions vowed vengeance on the indians and cursed in their hearts the white men who supplied them with the deadly gun  but the curse was unmerited  in the councils of the furtraders the subject of esquimau wrongs had been mooted and plans for the amelioration of their condition devised trading posts were established on richmond gulf and little whale river but owing to circumstances which it is unnecessary to detail here they turned out failures and were at length abandoned  still those in charge of the districts around hudsons bay and labrador continued to use every argument to prevail on the indians to cease their murderous assaults on their unoffending neighbours but without much effect  at length the governor of east maina territory lying on the eastern shores of jamess bayadopted an argument which proved eminently successful at least for one season  his fort was visited by a large band of muskigons from albany and moose districts who brought a quantity of valuable furs for which they demanded guns and ammunition making no secret of their intention to proceed on an expedition against their enemies the esquimaux  on hearing of this the governor went out to them and in a voice of extreme indignation assured them that they should not have an ounce of supplies for such a purpose  but we will pay you for what we ask  we are not beggars exclaimed the astonished indians into whose calculations it had never entered that white traders would refuse good furs merely in order to prevent the death of a few esquimaux  see cried the angry governor snatching up the nearest bale of furssee thats all i care for you or your payment and hurling the pack at its owners head he felled him therewith to the ground  no he continued shaking his fist at them ill not give you as much powder or shot as would blow off the tail of a rabbit if you were to bring me all the skins in labrador  the consequence of this vigorous conduct was that the indians retired crestfallenutterly discomfited  but in the camp that night they plotted revenge  in the darkness of the night they slaughtered all the cattle around the establishment and before daybreak were over the hills and far away in the direction of their huntinggrounds loaded with fresh beef sufficient for the supply of themselves and their families for the winter  it was a heavy price to pay but the poor esquimaux remained unmolested that year while the indians received a salutary lesson  but the compulsory peace was soon broken and it became apparent that the only effectual way to check the bloodthirsty propensity of the indians was to arm their enemies with the gun  the destruction of the first expedition to the esquimaux and the bad feeling that existed in the minds of the natives of richmond gulf consequent thereon induced the furtraders to fix on another locality for a new attempt  it was thought that the remote solitudes of ungava bay at the extreme north of labradorwhere the white mans axe had never yet felled the stunted pines of the north nor the ring of his rifle disturbed its echoeswould be the spot best suited for the erection of a wooden fort  accordingly it was appointed that mr george stanley should select a coadjutor and proceed with a party of picked men to the scene of action as early in the spring as the ice would permit and there build a fort as he best could with the best materials he could find live on whatever the country afforded in the shape of food establish a trade in oil whalebone arctic foxes etcetera etcetera if they were to be got and bring about a reconciliation between the esquimaux and the indians of the interior if that were possible  with the careful minuteness peculiar to documents stanleys instructions went on to point out that he was to start from moosewith two halfsized canoes each capable of carrying ten pieces or packages of 90 pounds weight each besides the crewand bore through the ice if the ice would allow him till he should reach richmond gulf cross this gulf and ascend if practicable some of the rivers which fall into it from the height of land supposed but not positively known to exist somewhere in the interior  passing this height he was to descend by the rivers and lakes if such existed leading to the eastward until he should fall upon a river reported to exist in these lands and called by the natives caniapuscaw or south river down which he was to proceed to the scene of his labours ungava bay on reaching which he was considerately left to the unaided guidance of his own discretion  reduced to their lowest term and widest signification the instructions directed our friend to start as early as he could with whom he chose and with what he liked travel as fast as possible over terra incognita to a land of ice perhaps also of desolationand locate himself among bloody savages it was hoped that there would be found a sufficiency of trees wherewith to build him a shelter against a prolonged winter in the meantime he might enjoy a bright arctic summer sky for his canopy  but it was known or at least supposed that the esquimaux were fierce and cruel savages if not cannibals  their very name implies something of the sort  it signifies eaters of raw flesh and was bestowed on them by their enemies the muskigons  they call themselves innuitmen or warriors and although they certainly do eat raw flesh when necessity compels themwhich it often doesthey asserted that they never did so from choice  however be this as it may the remembrance of their misdeeds in the first expeditions was fresh in the minds of the men in the service of the furtraders and they evinced a decided unwillingness to venture into such a country and among such a peoplean unwillingness which was only at length overcome when mrs stanley and her little daughter heroically volunteered to share the dangers of the expedition in the manner already narrated  stanley now made vigorous preparations for his departure  some of the men had already been enrolled as we have seen and there were more than enough of able and active volunteers ready to complete the crews  come hither lads he cried beckoning to two men who were occupied on the bank of the river near the entrance to moose fort in repairing the side of a canoe  the men left their work and approached  they were both esquimaux and good stout broadshouldered thickset specimens of the race they were one was called oolibuck this name is spelt as it should be pronounced  the correct spelling is ouligbuck the other augustus both of which names are now chronicled in the history of arctic adventure as having belonged to the welltried and faithful interpreters to franklin back and richardson in their expeditions of northwest discovery  im glad to see you busy at the canoe boys said stanley as they came up  of course you are both willing to revisit your countrymen  yes sir we is  glad to go where you choose send us answered oolibuck whose broad oily countenance lighted up with goodhumour as he spoke  it will remind you of your trip with captain franklin continued stanley addressing augustus  me no like to member dat said the esquimau with a sorrowful shake of the head  me love bourgeois franklin but tink me never see him more  i dont know that old fellow returned stanley with a smile franklin is not done with his discoveries yet theres a talk of sending off another expedition some of these days i hear so you may have a chance yet  augustuss black eyes sparkled with pleasure as he heard this  he was a man of strong feeling and during his journeyings with our great arctic hero had become attached to him in consequence of the hearty and unvarying kindness and consideration with which he treated all under his command  but the spirit of enterprise had been long slumbering and poor augustus who was now past the prime of life feared that he should never see his kind master more  now i want you lads to get everything in readiness for an immediate start continued stanley glancing upwards at the sky if the weather holds we shant be long off paying your friends a visit  are both canoes repaired  yes sir they is replied oolibuck  and the baggage is it laid out  and  pardon monsieur interrupted massan walking up and touching his cap  ive jest been down at the point and theres a riglar norwester acomin down  the ice is sweepin into the river an itll be choked up by tomorrow im afraid  stanley received this piece of intelligence with a slight frown and looked seaward where a dark line on the horizon and large fields of ice showed that the mans surmise was likely to prove correct  it matters not said stanley hastily ive made arrangements to start tomorrow and start we shall in spite of ice or wind if the canoes will float  massan who had been constituted principal steersman of the expedition in virtue of his welltried skill and indomitable energy felt that the tone in which this was said implied a want of confidence in his willingness to go under any circumstances so he said gravely  pardon monsieur i did not say we could not start  true true massan dont be hurt  i was only grumbling at the weather answered stanley with a laugh  just then the first puff of the coming breeze swept up the river ruffling its hitherto glassy surface  there it comes cried stanley as he quitted the spot  now massan see to it that the crews are assembled in good time on the beach tomorrow  we start at daybreak  oui monsieur replied massan as he turned on his heel and walked away  parbleu we shall indeed start to morrow an it please you if all the ice and wind in the polar regions was blowed down the coast and crammed into the rivers mouth  cest vrai    chapter five  ice looks unpropitiousthe startan important member of the party nearly forgottenchimo  stanleys forebodings and massans prognostications proved partly incorrect on the following morning  the mouth of the river and the sea beyond were quite full of ice but it was loose and intersected in all directions by lanes of open water  moreover there was no wind  the gray light of early morning brightened into dawn and the first clear ray of the rising sun swept over a scene more beautiful than ever filled the fancy of the most imaginative poet of the temperate zones the sky was perfectly unclouded and the surface of the sea was completely covered with masses of ice whose tops were pure white like snow and their sides a delicate greenishblue their dull frosted appearance forming a striking contrast to the surrounding water which shone when the sun glanced upon it like burnished silver  the masses of ice varied endlessly in form and size some being flat and large like fields others square and cornered like bastions or towershere a miniature temple with spires and minarets there a crystal fortress with embrasures and battlements and in the midst of these thousands of broken fragments having all the varied outlines of the larger masses appearing like the smaller houses cottages and villas of this floating city of ice  oh how beautiful exclaimed little edith as her father led her and mrs stanley towards the canoes which floated lightly in the water while the men stood in a picturesque group beside them leaning on their bright red paddles  it is indeed my pet replied stanley a smile almost of sadness playing around his lips  come george dont let evil forebodings assail you today said mrs stanley in a low tone  it does not become the leader of a forlorn hope to cast a shade over the spirits of his men at the very outset  she smiled as she said this and pressed his arm but despite herself there was more of sadness in the smile and in the pressure than she intended to convey  stanleys countenance assumed its usual firm but cheerful expression while she spoke  true jessie i must not damp the men but when i look at you and our darling eda i may be forgiven for betraying a passing glance of anxiety  may the almighty protect you  is the country we are going to like this papa inquired eda whose intense admiration of the fairylike scene rendered her oblivious of all else  yes dear more like this than anything else you have ever seen but the sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now and sometimes there are terrible snowstorms  but we will build you a nice house eda with a very large fireplace so that we wont feel the cold  the entire population of moose fort was assembled on the beach to witness the departure of the expedition  the party consisted of fifteen souls  as we shall follow them to the icy regions of ungava it may be worth while to rehearse their names in order as follows    mr and mrs stanley and edith   frank morton   massan the guide   dick prince principal hunter to the party   la roche stanleys servant and cook   bryan the blacksmith   francois the carpenter   oolibuck augustus and moses esquimau   interpreters   gaspard labourer and fisherman   oostesimow and maistequan indian guides   and hunters  the craft in which these were about to embark were three canoes two of which were large and one small  they were made of birch bark a substance which is tough light and buoyant and therefore admirably adapted for the construction of craft that have not only to battle against strong and sometimes shallow currents but have frequently to be carried on the shoulders of their crews over rocks and mountains  the largest canoe was sixteen feet long by five feet broad in the middle narrowing gradually towards the bow and stern to a sharp edge  its loading consisted of bales kegs casks and bundles of goods and provisions each bale or cask weighed exactly 90 pounds and was called a piece there were fifteen pieces in the canoe besides the crew of six men and mr stanley and his family who occupied the centre where their bedding tied up in flat bundles and covered with oiled cloth formed a comfortable couch  notwithstanding the size and capacity of this craft it had been carried down to the beach on the shoulders of massan and dick prince who now stood at its bow and stern preventing it with their paddles from rubbing its frail sides against the wharf for although the bark is tough and will stand a great deal of tossing in water and plunging among rapids it cannot sustain the slightest blow from a rock or other hard substance without being cracked or having the gum which covers the seams scraped off  to those who are unacquainted with travelling in the wild regions of the north it would seem impossible that a long journey could be accomplished in such tender boats but a little experience proves that by judicious treatment and careful management voyages of great length may be safely accomplished in themthat they are well adapted for the necessities of the country and can be taken with greater ease through a rough broken and mountainous region than ordinary wooden boats even of smaller size could be  the second canoe was in all respects similar to the one we have described excepting that it was a few inches shorter  the third was much smallerso small that it could not contain more than three men with their provisions and a few bales and so light that it could with the greatest ease be carried on the shoulders of one man  it was intended to serve as a sort of pioneer and hunting craft which should lead the way dart hither and thither in pursuit of game and warn the main body of any danger that should threaten them ahead  it was manned by the two indian guides oostesimow and maistequan and by frank morton who being acknowledged one of the best shots of the party was by tacit understanding regarded as commissarygeneral  it might have been said that frank was the best shot were it not for the fact that the aim of dick prince was perfect and it is generally admitted that perfection cannot be excelled  although differing widely in their dispositions and appearance the men of the expedition were similar at least in one respectthey were all firstrate and had been selected as being individually superior to their comrades at moose fort  and a noble set of fellows they looked as they stood beside their respective canoes leaning on their little brilliantly coloured paddles awaiting the embarkation of their leaders they all wore new suits of clothes which were sufficiently similar to give the effect of a uniform yet so far varied in detail as to divest them of monotony and relieve the eye by agreeable contrast of bright colours  all of them wore lightblue cloth capotes with hoods hanging down behind all had corduroy trousers gartered below the knee and all wore moccasins and had firebags stuck in their belts in which were contained the materials for producing fire tobacco and pipes  so far they were alike but the worsted belts of some were scarlet of others crimson and of others striped  some gartered their trousers with thongs of leather others used elegant bands of beadworkthe gifts probably of sorrowing sweethearts sisters or motherswhile the firebags besides being composed some of blue some of scarlet cloth were ornamented more or less with flowers and fanciful devices elegantly wrought in the gailydyed quills of the porcupine  on seeing stanley and his wife and child approaching massan gave the order to embark  in a moment every man divested himself of his capote which he folded up and placed on the seat he was to occupy then shaking hands all round for the last time they stepped lightly and carefully into their places  all ready i see massan said stanley as he came up and the ice seems pretty open  how say you shall we make a good day of it  massan smiled dubiously as he presented his thick shoulder as a support to mrs stanley while she stepped into her place  he remembered the conversation of the previous evening and determined that whatever should happen he at least would not cast the shadow of a doubt on their prospects  but in his own mind he suspected that their progress would be interrupted ere long as the wind although very lightalmost imperceptiblewas coming from the northwest  itll be full flood in less nor half an hour he replied andtake care miss edith give me your little hand there now jump lightand well be past the pint by that time and git the good o the ebb till sundown  i fear said frank morton approaching that the ice is rather thick for us but it dont much matter it will only delay us a bitand at any rate well make good way as far as the point  true true said stanley and its a great matter to get fairly started  once off we must go forward  all ready lads  ay ay sir  now frank into your canoe and show us the way mind we trust to your guidance to keep us clear of blind alleys among these lanes of water in the ice  at this moment edithwho had been for the last few minutes occupied in alternately drying her eyes and kissing her hands to a group of little children who had been her playfellows during her sojourn at the fort uttered a loud exclamation  oh oh papa mammachimoweve forgot chimo  oh me dont go away yet  so we have said her father dear me how stupid to forget our old friendhallo  frank frank weve forgot the dog shouted stanley to his young comrade who was on the point of starting  on hearing this frank gave a long shrill whistle  thatll bring him if hes within earshot  when the wellknown sound broke upon chimos ear he was lying coiled up in front of the kitchen fire being privileged to do so in consequence of his position as ediths favourite  the cook having gone out a few minutes previously had left chimo to enjoy his slumbers in solitude so that when he started suddenly to his feet on hearing franks whistle he found himself a prisoner  but chimo was a peculiarly strongminded and strongbodied dog and was possessed of an iron will  he was of the esquimau breed and bore some resemblance to the newfoundland but was rather shorter in the legs longer in the body and more powerfully made  moreover he was more shaggy and had a stout blunt straightforward appearance which conveyed to the beholder the idea that he scorned flattery and would not consent to be petted on any consideration  indeed this was the case for he always turned away with quiet contempt from any of the men who attempted to fondle him  he made an exception however of little edith whom he not only permitted to clap him to any extent but deliberately invited her to do so by laying his great head in her lap rubbing himself against her and wagging his bushy tail as if to say now little girl do what you will with me and eda never refused the animals dumbshow request  when she was very young and had not much senseat which time chimo was young too but possessed of a great deal of senseshe formed a strong affection for the esquimau dog an affection which she displayed by putting her little arms round his neck and hugging him until he felt a tendency to suffocation she also pulled his ears and tail and stuffed her fat little hands into his eyes and mouthall of which dreadful actions she seemed to think in her childish ignorance must be very pleasant to chimo and all of which the dog appeared really to enjoy  at all events whether he liked it or not he came regularly to have himself thus treated every day  as eda grew older she left off choking her favourite and poking out his eyes and contented herself with caressing him  chimo also evinced a partiality for mr stanley and frank morton and often accompanied the latter on his hunting excursions but he always comported himself towards them with dignified hauteur accepting their caresses with a slight wag of acknowledgment but never courting their favour  on jumping up as we have already said and observing that the door was shut the dog looked slowly and calmly round the apartment as if to decide on what was best to be done for chimo was a dog of great energy of character and was never placed in any circumstances in which he did not pursue some decided course of action  on the present occasion there was not a hole except the keyhole by which he could hope to make his escape  yes bythebye there was a hole in the window which was made of parchment but as that was merely the bullethole through which the animal that had given his skin for a window had been shot and was not larger than a shilling it did not afford much hope  nevertheless chimo regarded it with a steady gaze for a minute or two then he turned to the fire and having satisfied himself that the chimney was impracticable being full of flames and smoke he faced the window once more and showed his teeth as if in chagrin  whewew  chimooo came franks voice floating faintly from afar chimo took aim at the bullethole  one vigorous bounda horrible crash that nearly caused the returning cook to faintand the dog was free  ah here he comesgood dog cried frank as the animal came bounding over intervening obstacles towards the canoes  chimo made straight for the small canoe in answer to his masters call but like many dogs and not a few men he owned a higher power than that of a master  the voice of his little mistress sounded sweetly in his ear like the sound of a silver bell  o chimo chimo my darling pet come herehere  it was a soft tiny voice at the loudest and was quite drowned amid the talking and laughter of the men but chimo heard it  turning at a sharp angle from his course he swept past the light canoe and bounding into that of mr stanley lay down beside eda and placed his head in her lap where it was immediately smothered in the caresses of its young mistress  mr stanley smiled and patted his little girl on the shoulder as he said thats right eda the love of a faithful dog is worth having and cherishing  then turning towards the stern of the canoe where massan stood erect with his steering paddle ready for action he said to that worthy  now massan all ready give the word  ho ho boys forward  the paddles dipped simultaneously in the water with a loud gurgling sound the two large canoes shot out into the stream abreast of each other preceded by the light one which urged forward by the powerful arms of frank and the two indians led the way among the floating fields of ice  the people on shore took off their caps and waved a last farewell  dick prince who possessed a deep loud sonorous voice began one of those beautiful and wild yet plaintive songs peculiar to the voyageurs of the wilderness  the men joined with a full rich swell in the chorus as they darted forward with arrowlike speedand the voyage began    chapter six  character partially developedducks for suppera threatened nip bundled out on the ice  fortunately the wind veered round to the southeast soon after the departure of the canoes from moose fort and although there was not enough of it to ruffle the surface of the river it had the effect of checking the influx of ice from jamess bay  the tide too began to ebb so that the progress of the canoes was even more rapid than it appeared to be and long before the sun set they were past the point at the mouth of the river and coasting along the shores of the salt ocean  outside of them the sea was covered with hummocks and fields of ice some of which ever and anon met in the cross currents caused by the river with a violent shock  close to the shore however the thickness of the ice caused it to strand leaving a lane of open water along which the canoes proceeded easily the depth of water being much more than sufficient for them as the largest canoe did not draw more than a foot  sometimes however this space was blocked up by smaller fragments and considerable difficulty was experienced in steering the canoes amongst them  had the party travelled in boats they would have easily dashed through many of these checks but with canoes it is far otherwise  not only are their bark sides easily broken but the seams are covered with a kind of pitch which becomes so brittle in icecold water that it chips off in large lumps with the slightest touch  for the sea therefore boats are best but when it comes to carrying the craft over waterfalls and up mountain sides for days and weeks together canoes are more useful owing to their lightness  take care massan said mr stanley on approaching one of these floes  dont chip the gum off if you can help it  if we spring a leak we shant spend our first night on a pleasant campingground for the shore just hereabouts does not look inviting  no fear sir replied massan  dick prince is in the bow and as long as his mouths shut i keep my mind easy  you appear to have unlimited confidence in prince said stanley with a smile  does he never fail in anything that you are so sure of him  fail exclaimed the steersman whose paddle swept constantly in a circle round his head while he changed it from side to side as the motions of the canoe requiredfail ay that does he sometimes mortal man must get on the wrong side o luck now and then  ive seen dick prince fail but i never saw him make a mistake  well ive no doubt that he deserves your good opinion  nevertheless be more than ordinarily careful  if you had a wife and child in the canoe massan you would understand my anxiety better  stanley smiled as he said this and the worthy steersman replied in a grave tonei have the wife and child of my bourgeois under my care  true true massan said stanley lying back on his couch and conversing with his wife in an undertone  tis curious said he to observe the confidence that massan has in prince and yet it would be difficult to say wherein consists the superiority of the one over the other  perhaps it is the influence of a strong mind over a weaker suggested his wife  it may be so  yet prince is an utterly uneducated man  true he shoots a hairsbreadth better than massan but he is not a better canoeman neither is he more courageous and he is certainly less powerful nevertheless massan looks up to him and speaks of him as if he were greatly his superior  the secret of his power must lie in that steady neverwavering inflexibility of purpose that characterises our good bowman in everything he does  papa said edith who had been holding a long conversation with chimo on the wonders of the scene around themif we may call that a conversation where the one party does all the talking and the other all the listeningpapa where shall we all sleep tonight  the thought seemed to have struck her for the first time and she looked up eagerly for an answer while chimo gave a deep sigh of indifference and went to sleep or pretended to do so where he was  in the woods eda  how do you think you will like it  oh im sure i shall like it very much replied the little one  ive often wished to live in the woods altogether like the indians and do nothing but wander about and pull berries  ah jessie said stanley what an idle little baggage your daughter is  i fear shes a true chip of the old block  which do you consider the old block retorted mrs stanleyyou or me  never mind wife well leave that an open questionbut tell me eda dont you think that wandering about and pulling berries would be a very useless sort of life  no replied edith gravely  mamma often tells me that god wants me to be happy and im quite sure that wandering about all day in the beautiful woods would make me happy  but my darling said stanley smiling at the simplicity of this plausible argument in favour of an idle life dont you know that we ought to try to make others happy too as well as ourselves  oh yes replied eda with a bright smile i know that papa and i would try to make everybody happy by going with them and showing them where the finest flowers and berries were to be found and so we would all be happy together and thats what god wants is it not  mr stanley glanced towards his wife with an arch smile  there jessie what think you of that  nay husband what think you  i think he replied in an undertone that your sagacious teaching against idleness and in favour of diligence and attention to duty and so forth has not taken very deep root yet  and i think said mrs stanley that however wise you men may be in some things you are all most incomprehensibly stupid in regard to the development of young minds  take care now jessie youre verging upon metaphysics  but you have only given me your opinion of men as yet you have still to say what you think of edas acknowledged predilection for idleness  well replied mrs stanley i think that my sagacious teaching as you are pleased to call it has taken pretty firm root already and that edas speech is one of the first bright beautiful blossoms from which we may look for much fruit hereafter for to make ones self and ones fellowcreatures happy because such is the will of god seems to me a simple and comprehensive way of stating the whole duty of man  stanleys eyes opened a little at this definition  hum multum in parvo it may be so he said and casting down his eyes he was soon lost in a profound reverie while the canoe continued to progress forward by little impulsive bounds under the rapid stroke of the paddles  eda rested her fair cheek on the shaggy brow of chimo and accompanied him to the land of nod until the sun began to sink behind the icebergs on the seaward horizon where a dark line indicated an approaching breeze  massan cast an uneasy glance at this from time to time  at length he called to his friend in the bow hello prince will it come stiff think ye  no replied prince rising and shading his eyes with his hand itll be only a puff but thats enough to drive the ice down on us an shut up the open water  its my pinion said massan that we should hold away for the pint yonder an camp there  dick prince nodded assent and resumed his paddle  as he did so the report of a gun came sharply over the water  ha exclaimed stanley looking out ahead whats that  only mr frank said massan hes dowsed two birds  i seed them splash into the water  thats right said stanley we shall have something fresh for the kettle tonight  and by the way well need all we can kill for we havent much provision to depend on and part of it must be reserved in case of accidents so that if frank does not do his duty we shall have to live on birch bark massan  that would be rayther tough  im afeerd replied the steersman laughing  ive tried the tail o a deerskin coat afore now an it wasnt much to boast of but i niver tried a birchbark steak  i doubt it would need a power o chewin  by this time the two large canoes had drawn gradually nearer to the leading one  as they approached frank ordered his men to cease paddling  well frank what success said stanley as they came up  theres our supper cried frank tossing a large duck into the canoe and theres a bite for the men he added sending a huge gray goose into the midst of them  i saw a herd of reindeer on the other side of the point but the ice closed up the passage and prevented me from getting within range  it will stop our further progress for tonight too so i waited to advise you to camp here  there it comes cried dick prince  jump out on the ice lads and unload as fast as you can  as dick spoke he sprang on to a field of ice which was attached to the shore and drawing the canoe alongside began hastily to remove the cargo  his example was instantly followed by the men who sprang over the gunwales like cats and in less than five minutes the cargoes were scattered over the ice  meanwhile the breeze which massan had observed continued to freshen and the seaward ice bore rapidly down on the shore gradually narrowing and filling up the lanes of water among which the travellers had been hitherto wending their way  dick princes sudden action was caused by his observing a large solid field which bore down on them with considerable rapidity  his warning was just in time for the goods were scarcely landed and the three canoes lifted out of the water when the ice closed in with a crash that would have ground the frail barks to pieces and the passage was closed up  so completely was every trace of water obliterated that it seemed as though there never had been any there before    chapter seven  shows how the party made themselves at home in the bushtalk round the camp firea flash of temperturning in  the spot where they were thus suddenly arrested in their progress was a small bay formed by a low point which jutted from the mainland and shut out the prospect in advance  there was little or no wood on the point except a few stunted willows which being green and small would not as la roche the cook remarked make a fire big enough to roast the wing of a mosquito  there was no help for it however  the spot on which massan had resolved to encamp for the night was three miles on the other side of the point and as the way was now solid ice instead of water there was no possibility of getting there until a change of wind should drive the ice off the shore  moreover it was now getting dark and it behoved them to make their preparations with as much speed as possible  accordingly massan and prince shouldered one canoe francois and gaspard carried the other and the light one was placed on the shoulders of bryan the blacksmith la roche took the provisionbasket and cooking utensils under his special charge while the three esquimau interpreters and the two indian guides busied themselves in carrying the miscellaneous goods and baggage into camp  as for chimo he seated himself quietly on a lump of ice and appeared to superintend the entire proceedings while his young mistress and her mother accompanied by frank and stanley crossed the ice to the shore to select a place for their encampment  but it was some time ere a suitable place could be found as the point happened to be low and swampy and poor edas first experience of a life in the woods was stepping into a hole which took her up to the knees in mud and water  she was not alone however in misfortune for just at the same moment bryan passed through the bushes with his canoe and staggered into the same swamp exclaiming as he did so in a rich brogue which many years residence among the french halfbreeds of ruperts land had failed to soften thunder an turf such a blackguard counthry i niver did see  och bryan dear why did ye iver lave yer native land  pourquoi why mon boy for ver goot raison cried la roche in a horrible compound of french and broken english as he skipped lightly past with a loud laugh for ver goot raisondey was tired of you to home vraiment  you was too grande raskale dey could not keep you no longer  thrue for ye la roche replied the blacksmith thrue for ye boy they sartinly could not keep me on nothin an as the murphies was all spiled wi the rot i had to lave or starve  at last after a long search frank morton found a spot pretty well adapted for their purpose  it was an elevated plot of gravel which was covered with a thin carpet of herbage and surrounded by a belt of willows which proved a sufficient shelter against the wind  a low and rather shaggy willowtree spread its branches over the spot and gave to it a good deal of the feeling and appearance of shelter if not much of the reality  this was of little consequence however as the night proved fine and comparatively mild so that the black vault of heaven spangled with hosts of brilliant stars amply compensated for the want of a leafy canopy  under the willowtree frank and la roche busied themselves in spreading a very small white tent for mr stanley and his family  frank himself although entitled from his position in the companys service to the luxury of a tent scorned to use one preferring to rough it like the men and sleep beneath the shelter of the small canoe  meanwhile mr stanley proceeded to strike a light with his flint and steel and bryan having deposited his burden near the tent soon collected a sufficiency of driftwood to make a good fire  edith and her mother were not idle in the midst of this busy scene  they collected a few bundles of dried twigs to make the fire light more easily and after the blaze was casting its broad glare of light over the camp and the tent was pitched they assisted la roche in laying the cloth for supper  of course in a journey like this none but necessary articles were taken and these were of the most homely character  the kettle was the teapot the cups were tin pannikins and the tablecloth was a large towel while the table itself was the ground from the damp of which however the party in the tent were protected by an ample oilcloth  when all the things were carried up and the men assembled the camp presented the following appearance in the centre of the open space which nature had arranged in the form of a circle blazed the fire and a right jovial sputtering outrageous fire it was sending its sparks flying in all directions like the artillery of a beleaguered fortress in miniature and rolling its flames about in fierce and wayward tongues that seemed bent on licking in and swallowing up the entire party but more especially la roche who found no little difficulty in paying due attention to his pots and kettles  sometimes the flames roared fiercely upwards singeing off the foliage of the overhanging willow as they went and then bursting away from their parent fire portions of them floated off for a few seconds on the night air  on the weather side of this fire stood mr stanleys tent under the willowtree as before described its pure white folds showing strongly against the darkness of the sky beyond  the doorway or curtain of the tent was open displaying the teaequipage within and the smiling countenances of stanley and his wife frank and eda who seated on blankets and shawls around the towel were preparing to make an assault on the fat duck before mentioned  this duck had been split open and roasted on a piece of stick before the blaze and now stood with the stumps of its wings and legs extended as if demanding urgently to be eatena demand which chimo who crouched near the doorway could scarce help complying with  to the right of the tent was placed the small canoe bottom up so as to afford a partial protection to the bedding which oostesimow was engaged in spreading out for frank and himself and his comrade maistequan facing this at the other side of the fire and on the left of the tent the largest canoe was turned up in a similar manner and several of the men were engaged in covering the ground beneath it with a layer of leaves and branches above which they spread their blankets while others lounged around the fire and smoked their beloved pipes or watched with impatient eyes the operations of bryan who being accustomed to have familiar dealings with the fire had been deemed worthy of holding the office of cook to the men and was inducted accordingly  it is due to bryan to say that he fully merited the honour conferred upon him for never since the days of vulcan was there a man seen who could daringly dabble in the fire as he did  he had a peculiar sleightofhand way of seizing hold of and tossing about redhot coals with his naked hand that induced one to believe he must be made of leather  flames seemed to have no effect whatever on his sinewy arms when they licked around them and as for smoke he treated it with benign contempt  not so la roche with the mercurial temperament of his class he leaped about the fire during his culinary operations in a way that afforded infinite amusement to his comrades and not unfrequently brought him into violent collision with bryan who usually received him on such occasions with a strong irish growl mingled with a disparaging or contemptuous remark  beyond the circle of light thrown by the fire was the belt of willows which encompassed the camp on all sides except towards the sea where a narrow gap formed a natural entrance and afforded a glimpse of the ocean with its fields and hummocks of ice floating on its calm bosom and glancing in the faint light of the moon which was then in its first quarter  how comfortable and snug everything is said mrs stanley as she poured out the tea while her husband carved the duck  yes isnt it eda said frank patting his favourite on the head as he held out her plate for a wing  there give her a bit of the breast too he added  i know shes ravenously hungry for i saw her looking at chimo just before we landed as if she meant to eat him for supper without waiting to have him cooked  o frank how can you be so wicked said eda taking up her knife and fork and attacking the wing with so much energy as almost to justify her friends assertion  snug said you jessie yes thats the very word to express it said stanley  theres no situation that i know of and i wasnt born yesterday that is so perfectly snug and in all respects comfortable as an encampment in the woods on a fine night in spring or autumn  or winter added frank swallowing a pannikin of tea at a draught nodding to chimo as much as to say do that if you can old fellow and handing it to mrs stanley to be replenished  dont omit winter cold sharp sunny winter  an encampment in the snow in fine weather is as snug as this  rather cold is it not said mrs stanley  cold not a bit replied frank making a reckless dive with his hand into the biscuitbag if you have enough wood to get up a roaring fire six feet long by three broad and four deep with a bank of snow five feet high all around ye a pinetree with lots of thick branches spreading overhead to keep off the snow and two big green blankets to keep out the frostanother leg of that widgeon pleaseyouve no notion how snug it is i assure you  hum ejaculated stanley with a dubious smile you forgot to adda youthful robust frame with the blood careering through the veins like wildfire to your catalogue of requisites  no doubt it is pleasant enough in its way but commend me to spring or autumn for thorough enjoyment when the air is mild and the waters flowing and the woods green and beautiful  why dont you speak of summer papa said eda who had been listening intently to this conversation  summer my pet because  allow me to explain interrupted frank laying down his knife and fork and placing the forefinger of his right hand in his left palm as if he were about to make a speech  because eda because there is such a thing as heatlongcontinued neverending sweltering heat  because there are such reprehensible and unutterably detestable insects as mosquitoes and sandflies and bulldogs and there is such a thing as being bitten and stung and worried and sucked into a sort of partial madness and i have seen such sights as men perpetually slapping their own faces and scratching the skin off their own cheeks with their own nails and getting no relief thereby but rather making things worse and i have moreover seen mens heads swelled until the eyes and noses were lost and the mouths only visible when opened and their general aspect like that of a scotch haggis and there is a time when all this accumulates on man and beast till the latter takes to the water in desperation and the former takes to intermittent insanity and that time issummeranother cup please mrs stanley  pon my conscience it creates thirst to think of it  at this stage the conversation of the party in the tent was interrupted by a loud peal of laughter mingled with not a few angry exclamations from the men  la roche in one of his frantic leaps to avoid a tongue of flame which shot out from the fire with a vicious velocity towards his eyes came into violent contact with bryan while that worthy was in the act of lifting a seething kettle of soup and boiled pork from the fire  fortunately for the party whose supper was thus placed in jeopardy bryan stood his ground but la roche tripping over a log fell heavily among the pannikins tin plates spoons and knives which had been just laid out on the ground in front of the canoe  ach mauvais chien growled gaspard as he picked up and threw away the fragments of his pipe youre always cuttin and jumpin about like a monkey  oh pauvre crapaud cried francois laughing dont abuse him gaspard  hes a useful dog in his way  tare an ages youve done it now ye have  bad luck to ye wasnt i for iver tellin ye that same  shure if it wasnt that yere no bigger or heavier than a wisp o pea straw yed have druve me and the soup into the fire ye would  be the big toe o st patrick not to mintion his riverince the pope  come come bryan cried massan dont speak ill o the pope an down wi the kettle  the kittle is it  sorra a kittle yell touch massan till its cool enough to let us all start fair at wance  yeve got yer mouth and throat lined wi brass i believe an would ate the half ot before a soul of us could taste it  dont insult me you redfaced racoon retorted massan while he and his comrades circled round the kettle and began a vigorous attack on the scalding mess my throat is not so used to swallowin fire as your own  i never knowed a man that payed into the grub as you dobah how hot it isi say oolibuck doesnt it remember you o the dogs o yer own country when they gits the stone kettle to clean out  oolibucks broad visage expanded with a chuckle as he lifted an enormous wooden spoonful of soup to his ample mouth  me tink de dogs of de innuit esquimaux make short work of dis kettle if e had im  do the dogs of the huskies eat with their masters inquired francois as he groped in the kettle with his fork in search of a piece of pork  dey not eat wid der masters but dey alays clean hout de kettle replied moses somewhat indignantly  ha exclaimed massan pausing for a few minutes to recover breath yes they always let the dogs finish off the feast  ye must know comrades that ive seed them do it myselfanyways ive seed a man that knew a feller who said he had a comrade that wintered once with the huskies which is pretty much the same thing  an he said that sometimes when they kill a big seal they boil it whole an have a riglar feast  ye must understand mes garcons that the huskies make thumpin big kettles out o a kind o soft stone they find in them parts an some o thems big enough to boil a whole seal in  well when the beast is cooked they take it out o the pot an while theyre tuckin into it the dogs come and sit in a ring round the pot to wait till the soups cool enough to eat  they knows well that its too hot at first an that they must have a deal o patience but afore long some o the young uns cant hold on so they steps up somewhat desperate like and pokes their snouts in  of course they pulls them out pretty sharp with a yell and sit down to rub their noses for a bit longer then the old uns take courage an make a snap at it now and again but very tenderly till it gits cooler at last an then at it they go worryin an scufflin an barkin an gallopin just like moses there till the pots as clean as the day it wos made  ha ha oh ver goot tres bien ah mon coeur just tres splendiferous shouted la roche whose risibility was always easily tickled  its quite true thoughisnt it moses said massan as he once more applied to the kettle while some of his comrades cut up the goose that frank had shot in the afternoon  why moses what a capacity you have for grub said francois  if your countrymen are anything like you i dont wonder that they have boiled seals and whales for dinner  itll take a screamin kittle for a whale spluttered bryan with his mouth full an a power o dogs to drink the broth  you tink you funny bryan retorted moses while an oily smile beamed on his fat goodhumoured countenance but you not you most dreadful stupid  thrue for ye moses i was oncommon stupid to let you sit so long beside the kittle replied the irishman as he made a futile effort to scrape another spoonful from the bottom of it  och but yeve licked it as clane as one of yer own dogs could ha done it  mind your eye growled gaspard at the same time giving la roche a violent push as that volatile worthy in one of his eccentric movements nearly upset his can of water  oh pardon monsieur exclaimed la roche in pretended sorrow at the same time making a grotesque bow that caused a general peal of laughter  why one might as well travel with a sick bear as with you gaspard said francois half angrily  hold your jaw replied gaspard  not at your bidding retorted francois half rising from his reclining posture while his colour heightened  gaspard had also started up and it seemed as if the little camp were in danger of becoming a scene of strife when dick prince who was habitually silent and unobtrusive preferring generally to listen rather than to speak laid his hand on gaspards broad shoulder and pulled him somewhat forcibly to the ground  shame on you comrades he said in a low grave voice that instantly produced a dead silence shame on you to quarrel on our first night in the bush  weve few enough friends in these parts i think that we should make enemies o each other  thats well said cried massan in a very decided tone  it wont do to fall out when theres so few of us  and the stout voyageur thrust his foot against the logs on the fire causing a rich cloud of sparks to ascend as if to throw additional light on his remark  pardon me mes comrades cried francois i did not intend to quarrel and he extended his hand to gaspard who took it in silence and dropping back again to his recumbent posture resumed his pipe  this little scene was witnessed by the party in the tent who were near enough to overhear all that was said by the men and even to converse with them if they should desire to do so  a shade of anxiety crossed mr stanleys countenance and some time after recurring to the subject he said  i dont feel quite easy about that fellow gaspard  he seems a sulky dog and is such a hercules that he might give us a deal of trouble if he were highspirited  a slight smile of contempt curled franks lip as he said a strong arm without a bold heart is not of more value than that of my eda here in the hour of danger  but i think better of gaspard than you seem to do hes a sulky enough dog tis true but he is a good hard worker and does not grumble and i sometimes have noticed traces of a better spirit than usually meets the eye  as for his bulk i think nothing of it he wants high spirit to make it available  francois could thrash him any day  perhaps so replied stanley i hope they wont try their mettle on each other sooner than we expect  not that i care a whit for any of the men having a round or two now and then and be done with it but this fellow seems to nurse his wrath to keep it warm  on such an expedition as ours it behoves us to have a good understanding and a kindly feeling in the camp  one black sheep in the flock may do much damage  hes only piebald not black said frank laughing as he rose to quit the tent  but i must leave you  i see that edas eyes are refusing to keep open any longer so goodnight to you all and a sound sleep  franks concluding remarks in reference to him were overheard by gaspard who had risen to look at the night and afterwards kneeled near the tent in order to be at some distance from his comrades while he said his prayers for strange though it may seem many of the rough and reckless voyageurs of that country most of whom are roman catholics regularly retire each night to kneel and pray beneath a tree before lying down on their leafy couches and deem the act quite consistent with the swearing and quarrelling life that too many of them lead  such is human nature  as gaspard rose from his knees franks words fell upon his ear and when he drew his blanket over his head that night there was a softer spot in his heart and a wrinkle less on his brow  when frank stepped over to the place where his canoe lay the aspect of the camp was very different from what it had been an hour before  the fire had burned low and was little more than a mass of glowing embers from which a fitful flame shot forth now and then casting a momentary glare on the forms of the men who having finished their pipes were all extended in a row side by side under the large canoe  as they possessed only a single green blanket each they had to make the most of their coverings by rolling them tightly around their bodies and doubling the ends down under their feet and over their heads so that they resembled a row of green bolsters all their feet being presented towards the fire and all their heads resting on their folded capotes a good deal of loud and regular snoring proved that toil and robust health seldom court the drowsy god long in vain  turning to his own canoe frank observed that his indian friends were extended out under it with a wide space between them in which his own bedding was neatly arranged  the grave sons of the forest had lain down to rest long before their white comrades and they now lay as silent and motionless as the canoe that covered their heads  being a small canoe it did not afford protection to their legs and feet but in fine weather this was of no consequence and for the morrow they cared not  before lying down frank kneeled to commend himself and his comrades to the protection of god then stirring up the embers of the fire he pulled out a small bible from his breast pocket and sat down on a log to read  frank was a careless rollicking kindhearted fellow and how much there was of true religion in these acts none but himself could tell  but the habit of reading the word and of prayer had been instilled into him from infancy by a godly mother and he carried it with him into the wilderness  when he drew his blanket over him and laid his head on his capote the stars were still twinkling and the moon still sailed in a clear sky and gave silver edges to the ice upon the sea  all was calm and solemn and beautiful and it seemed as if it could never be otherwise in such a tranquil scene  but nature does not always smile  appearances are often deceitful    chapter eight  bryans adventure with a polar bear etcetera  ice ice ice everything seemed to have been converted into ice when the day broke on the following morning and awoke the sleepers in the camp  a sharp frost during the night accompanied by a fall of snow had as if by magic converted spring into winter  icy particles hung upon and covered not only the young leaves and buds of the bushes but the branches also giving to them a white and extremely airy appearance snow lay on the upper sides of the canoes and weighed heavily on the tent causing its folds once seemingly so pure and white to look dirty by contrast  snow lay on the protruding legs of the men and encircled the black spot where rested the ashes of last nights brilliant fire ice grated on the pebbles of the shore ice floated on the sea icy hummocks and mounds rose above its surface and icebergs raised their pinnacles on the faroff horizon and cut sharply into the bright blue sky  it was cold but it was not cheerless for when eda put out her head at the curtain doorway of the tent and opened her eyes upon the magic scene the suns edge rose above the horizon as if to greet her and sent a flood of light far and near through the spacious universe converting the sea into glass with islands of frosted silver on its bosom  it was a gorgeous scene worthy of its great creator who in his mysterious working scatters gems of beauty oftentimes in places where there is scarce a single human eye to behold their excellence  although the sea was covered with ice there were nevertheless several lanes of open water not far from the shore so that when stanley called a council composed of frank morton dick prince and massan it was agreed unanimously that they should attempt to proceed  and it was well that they did so for they had not advanced many miles winding their way cautiously among the canals of open water when they doubled a promontory beyond which there was little or no ice to be seen merely a few scattered fragments and fields that served to enhance the beauty of the scene by the airy lightness of their appearance in contrast with the bright blue of the sea and sky but did not interrupt the progress of the travellers  the three canoes always maintained their relative positions during the journey as much as possible  that is to say frank and the two indians went first in the small canoe to lead the way while the two large canoes kept abreast of each other when the open water was wide enough to permit of their doing so  this besides being more sociable enabled the two crews to join in the chorus of those beautiful songs with which they frequently enlivened the voyage  during all this day and for many days following they continued to enjoy fine weather and to make rapid progress  sometimes the ice was pretty thick and once or twice they narrowly escaped being nipped by collapsing masses which caused them to jump out hastily throw the baggage on the ice and haul the canoes out of the water  on these occasions the men proved themselves to be sterling fellows nearly all of them being cool prompt and collected in the moment of danger  no doubt there were exceptions  la roche when any sudden crisis of danger arose usually threw himself blindly over the side of the canoe on to the ice with the lightness and agility of a harlequin  he recked not whether he came down on his head or his feet and more than once nearly broke his neck in consequence of his precipitancy  but la roche was no coward and the instant the first burst of excitement was over he rushed to render effective assistance  bryan too although not so mercurial as la roche was apt to lose selfcommand for about five minutes when any sudden danger assailed him so that he frequently sat still staring wildly straight before him while the others were actively unloading the canoes and once when the danger was more critical than usual having sat till the canoe was empty and paid no attention to a prompt gruff order to jump ashore he had been seized by the strong arms of gaspard and tossed out of the canoe like a puppy dog  on these occasions he invariably endeavoured to make up for his fault by displaying on recovery the most outrageous and daring amount of unnecessary recklessnessuttering at the same time an amazing number of strange expressions among which tare an ages  och murder and several others less lucid in signification predominated  chimo was always first ashore and instantly wheeled round to greet eda who was also always second thanks to the strong and prompt arm of francois who sat just in front and by tacit agreement took her under his special charge  as for mrs stanley the arm that was rightfully her own and had been her shield in many a scene of danger proved ever ready and able to succour the first volunteer to ungava  at times the sea was quite free of ice and many miles were soon added to the space which separated the little band of adventurers from the rest of the human world  their encampments varied according to the nature of the coast being sometimes among pinetrees or surrounded by dwarf willows at other times on the bare sand of the seashore and occasionally at the extremity of longprojecting capes and promontories where they had to pitch their tent and make their beds in the clefts of the solid rock  but wherever they laid them down to reston the rock or on the sand or within the shade of the forestit was always found as mrs stanley remarked of the first nights encampment that they were extremely comfortable and eminently snug  they were successful too in procuring an ample supply of fresh provisions  there were ducks and geese of various kinds and innumerable quantities of plover cormorants gulls and eiderducks the eggs of which they found in thousands  many of these birds were good for food and the eggs of most of them especially those of the eiderduck were excellent  reindeer were also met with and among other trophies of his skill as a hunter frank one day brought in a black bear parts of which were eaten with great gusto by the esquimaux and indians to the immense disgust of bryan who expressed his belief that the haythens was barely fit to live and were most justly locked out from society in thim dissolate polar raygeons  there were many seals also in the sea which put up their ugly grotesque heads ever and anon gazed at the canoes with their huge fishy eyes as in surprise at the sight of such novel marine monsters and then sank slowly beneath the wave  these animals were never molested out of respect to the feelings of the two indians who believed them to be gods and assured stanley that the destruction of one would infallibly bring down illluck and disaster on the heads of the party  stanley smiled inwardly at this but gave orders that no seals should be shot an order which all were very willing to obey as they did not require the animals either for food or any other purpose  several white polar bears were seen but they also were spared as they require a great deal of shot to kill them if not hit exactly behind the ear and besides neither their bodies nor skins were of any use to the travellers  thus all went favourably for a time  but life is a chequered story and the sun of prosperity does not always shine as we shall see  one fine morning as they were paddling cheerfully along in the neighbourhood of cape jones it struck mr stanley that he might prove the correctness of his sextant and other instruments before entering upon the country which to most of the party was terra incognita  this was the more necessary that he could not depend on the guidance of oostesimow and maistequan they having travelled only once long ago through part of the country while the latter part of it was totally unknown to them  it was one of those beautiful mornings that are peculiar to arctic regions when the air is inexpressibly still and all inanimate nature seems hushed in profound reposea repose which is rather rendered more effective than otherwise by the plaintive cries of wildfowl or the occasional puffing of a whale  there was a peculiar brilliancy too in the atmosphere caused by the presence of so many fields and hummocks of white ice looming fantastically through a thin dry gauzelike haze which while it did not dim the brightness of the solar rays lent an additional charm to every object by shrouding it in a veil of mystery  on passing the point the men ceased rowing and proceeded to solace themselves with a fiveminutes pipean indulgence which voyageurs always claim as their due after a long spell at the oars or paddles  put ashore here massan said stanley turning to the guide i shall take an observation if possible and you can set the men to hunt for eggs  we shall want them as the larder is rather low just now  massan muttered assent and shouting to the other canoe to put ashore ran alongside the rocks  youd better hail the little canoe said stanley as he landed  i shall want mr morton to assist me  massan stepped upon an elevated rock and shading his eyes with his hands looked earnestly ahead where he observed the little canoe almost beyond vision and just going to double a point of land  transferring his hands to his mouth he used them as a trumpet and gave forth a shout the like of which had never startled the echoes of the place before  its no use sir said massan hes past hearin  im afeerd that theyre off in the direction o the white bear hills in hopes o gittin a shot  try again massan urged stanley raise your pipe a little higher perhaps it will reach them  massan shook his head  try it bryan he said turning to the irishman who was sitting on a rock leisurely filling his short black pipe  is it to halloo ye want me replied bryan rising  shure the great gun of athlone itself could niver hold a candle to ye massan at yellin but ill try anyhow and putting his hands to his mouth he gave forth a roar compared to which massans was nothing  there was a sort of crack in the tone of it however that was so irresistibly ridiculous that the whole party burst incontinently into a fit of laughter  loud though it was it failed to reach the ears of those in the little canoe which in a few seconds doubled the point and disappeared  ah bad luck to it said bryan in disgust the pipes damaged intirely  small pace to ye bob mahone for shure it was howlin and screechin at your wake like a born scrandighowl that broke it  never mind lad what remains of it is not bad said stanley laughing as he proceeded to open the box containing his scientific instruments  meanwhile his wife and edith wandered along the rocks picking up shells and pebbles and the men dispersed some to smoke and chat others to search for eggs  bryan and la roche who were both aspiring geniuses and had formed a sort of rough attachment to each other asked permission to take a walk to the point ahead where they would wait for the canoes  having obtained it they set off at a good round pace that would have been throublesome to kape up as bryan remarked with payse in yer shoes  why you come for to jine de company inquired la roche as they jogged along  why bekase id nothin else to do as the ould song says  ye see losh bryan had invented a contraction for his friends name which he said was convanientye see losh there may be more nor wan raison for a gintleman lavin his native land in order to thravel in furrin parts  its thrue i had nothin in the univarse to do for i could niver git work nohow an whin i got it i could niver kape it  i niver could onderstan why but so it was  nivertheless i managed to live well enough in the ould cabin wid the murphies  vat is murphies inquired la roche  bliss yer innocent face dont ye know its praties  tis vat  praties boy or pittaties if i must be particlar  ah goot goot i understanpettitoes  oui oui ye call him pomme de terre  hum well as i was sayin i got on pretty well wid the pumdeterres an the pig but the pig died wan daychoked hisself on a murphythat

i should have to list for a sodger  well bob mahone died o dhrink and starvation an we had a beautiful wake but there was a riglar shindy got up an two or three o the county plice misbehaved themselves so i jist floored them all wan after the other an bolted  well i wint straight to dublin an there i met wid an ould friend who was the skipper o a ship bound for new york  says he bryan will ye go says i av coorse an shure enough i wint an got over the say to meriky  but i could niver settle down so wan way or another i came at last to montreal and jined the company an afther knockin about in the columbia and mackenzies river for some years i was sint to moose an here i am losh yer sarvant to command  goot ver goot mais peculiaire said la roche whose intimacy with this son of erin had enabled him to comprehend enough of his jargon to grasp the general scope of his discourse  av ye mane that lavin the ould country was goot said bryan stooping to pick up a stone and skim it along the smooth surface of the sea praps yere right but theres wan thing i niver could make my mind aisy about and the blacksmiths voice became deep and his face grave as he recalled these bygone days  vat were dat inquired la roche  why ye see losh i was so hard druve by the plice that i was forced to lave widout sayin good day to my ould mother an they tould me it almost broke her heart but ive had wan or two screeds from the priest wid her cross at them since and shes got over it an lookin out for my returninbliss her sowlan ive sint her five pounds ivery year since i left so ye see losh ive great hope o seein her yit for although shes ould shes oncommon tough an having come o a longwinded stock ive great hopes o her  poor bryan it never entered into his reckless brain to think that considering the life of almost constant peril he led in the land of his pilgrimage there was more hope of the longevity of his old mother than of himself  like many of his countrymen he was a man of strong passionate warm feelings and remarkably unselfish  is your contry resemblance to dat inquired la roche pointing as he spoke towards the sea which was covered with fields and mountains of ice as far out as the eye could discern  be the nose o my greatgrandmother an that was be no manes a short wan no replied bryan with a laugh  the say that surrounds ould ireland is niver covered with sich sugarplums as these  but what have we here  as he spoke they reached the point at which they were to await the coming up of the canoes and the object which called forth bryans remark was the little canoe which lay empty on the beach just beyond the point  from the manner in which it lay it was evident that frank and his indians had placed it there but there was no sign of their presence save one or two footprints on the sand  while la roche was examining these his companion walked towards a point of rock that jutted out from the cliffs and intercepted the view beyond  on turning round this he became suddenly rooted to the spot with horror  and little wonder for just two yards before him stood an enormous polar bear whose career was suddenly arrested by bryans unexpected appearance  it is difficult to say whether the man or the beast expressed most surprise at the rencounter  they both stood stock still and opened their eyes to the utmost width  but the poor irishman was evidently petrified by the apparition  he turned deadly pale and his hands hung idly by his sides while the bear recovering from his surprise rose on his hind legs and walked up to hima sure sign that he was quite undaunted and had made up his mind to give battle  as for la roche the instant he cast his eyes on the ferociouslooking quadruped he uttered a frightful yell bounded towards a neighbouring tree and ceased not to ascend until its topmost branches were bending beneath his weight  meanwhile the bear walked up to bryan but not meeting with the anticipated grapple of an enemy and feeling somewhat uneasy under the cataleptic stare of the poor mans eyesfor he still stood petrified with horrorit walked slowly round him putting its cold nose on his cheek as if to tempt him to move  but the five minutes of bewilderment that always preceded bryans recovery from a sudden fright had not yet expired  he still remained perfectly motionless so that the bear disdaining apparently to attack an unresisting foe dropped on his forelegs again  it is difficult to say whether there is any truth in the wellknown opinion that the calm steady gaze of a human eye can quell any animal  doubtless there are many stories more or less authentic corroborative of the fact but whether this be true or not we are ready to vouch for the truth of this factnamely that under the influence of the blacksmiths gaze or his silence it may be the bear was absolutely discomfited  it retreated a step or two and walked slowly away looking over its shoulder now and then as it went as if it half anticipated an onslaught in the rear  we have already said that bryan was no craven and that when his faculties were collected he usually displayed a good deal of reckless valour on occasions of danger  accordingly no sooner did he see his shaggy adversary in full retreat than the truant blood returned to his face with a degree of violence that caused it to blaze with fiery red and swelled the large veins of his neck and forehead almost to bursting uttering a truly irish halloo he bounded forward like a tiger tore the cap off his head and flung it violently before him drew the axe which always hung at his belt and in another moment stood face to face with the white monster which had instantly accepted the challenge and rose on its hind legs to receive him  raising the axe with both hands the man aimed a blow at the bears head but with a rapid movement of its paw it turned the weapon aside and dashed it into the air  another such blow and the reckless blacksmiths career would have been brought to an abrupt conclusion when the crack of a rifle was heard  its echo reverberated along the cliffs and floated over the calm water as the polar bear fell dead at bryans feet  hurrah shouted frank morton as he sprang from the bushes knife in hand ready to finish the work which his rifle had so well begun  but it needed not  frank had hit the exact spot behind the ear which renders a second ball unnecessarythe bear was already quite dead    chapter nine  a storm brewingit bursts and produces consequencesthe party take to the water per forceall saved  ah bryan a friend in need is a friend indeed said frank as he sat on a rock watching the blacksmith and his two indians while they performed the operation of skinning the bear whose timely destruction has been related in the last chapter  i must say i never saw a man stand his ground so well with a brute like that stealing kisses from his cheek  were they sweet bryan  did they remind you of the fair maid of derry hey  ah thrue for ye replied the blacksmith as he stepped to a rock for the purpose of whetting his knife yer honour was just in time to save me a power o throuble  bad skran to the baste it would have taken three or four rounds at laste to have finished him nately off for theres no end o fat on his ribs that would have kep the knife from goin far in  frank laughed at this freeandeasy way of looking at it  so you think you would have killed him do you if i had not saved you the trouble  av coorse i do  shure a man is better than a baste any day and besides had i not a frind at my back ridy to help me  bryan cast a comical leer at la roche as he said this and the poor frenchman blushed for he felt that his conduct in the affair had not been very praiseworthy  it is due to la roche to say however that no sooner had he found himself at the top of the tree and had a moment to reflect than he slid rapidly to the bottom again and ran to the assistance of his friend not however in time to render such assistance available as he came up just at the moment the bear fell  in half an hour afterwards the two large canoes came up and bryan and his little friend had to undergo a rapid fire of witticism from their surprised and highlyamused comrades  even moses was stirred up to say that bryan him do pratty well he most good nuff to make an eskimo  having embarked the skin of the bear the canoes once more resumed their usual order and continued on their way  the carcass of the bear being useless for food was left for the wolves and the claws which were nearly as large as a mans finger were given by frank to the blacksmith that he might make them into a necklace as the indians do and keep it in remembrance of his rencounter  but the weather was now beginning to change  dick prince whose black eye was ever roving about observantly told massan that a storm was brewing and that the sooner he put ashore in a convenient spot the better  but stanley was anxious to get on having a long journey before him at the termination of which there would be little enough time to erect a sufficient protection against the winter of the north so he continued to advance along shore until they came to a point beyond which there was a very deep bay that would take them many hours to coast  by making a traverse however in a direct line to the next point they might cross it in a much shorter time  how say you prince shall we cross asked stanley as they rested on their paddles and cast furtive glances up at the dark clouds and across the still quiet bay  prince shook his head  i fear we wont have time to cross  the clouds are driving too fast and growin black  well then we had better encamp said stanleyis there a proper place massan hereabouts  no sir replied the guide  the stones on the beach are the only pillows within six mile o us  ho then forward boys make a bold push for it cried stanley if it does begin to blow before were over we can run back again at all events  in another moment the canoes swept out to sea and made for the point far ahead like racehorses  although the clouds continued to gather the wind did not rise and it seemed as though they would get over easily when a sudden gust came off the shorea direction whence from the appearance of the clouds it had not been expected  ruffling the surface of the water for a few seconds it passed away  give way boys give way cried massan using his large steering paddle with a degree of energy that sent the canoe plunging forward we cant go back an if the storm bursts off the shore  a loud peal of thunder drowned the remainder of the sentence and in a few seconds the wind that had been dreaded came whistling violently off the shore and covered the sea with foam  the waves soon began to rise and ere long the frail barks which were ill calculated to weather a storm were careering over them and shipping water at every plunge  it now became a matter of life and death with them that they should gain the point for deeply loaded as they were it was impossible that they could float long in such a sea  it is true that a wind off the shore does not usually raise what sailors would consider much of a sea but it must be remembered that although it was off shore the bay which they were crossing extended far inland so that the gale had a wide sweep of water to act upon before it reached them  besides this as has already been explained canoes are not like boats  their timbers are weak the bark of which they are made is thin the gum which makes their seams tight is easily knocked off in cold water and in short they cannot face a sea on which a boat might ride like a seagull  for a considerable time the men strained every nerve to gain the wishedfor point of land but with so little success that it became evident they would never reach it  the men began to show signs of flagging and cast uneasy glances towards stanley as if they had lost all hope of accomplishing their object and waited for him to suggest what they should do  poor mrs stanley sat holding on to the gunwale with one hand and clasping edith round the waist with the other as she gazed wistfully towards the cape ahead which was now almost lost to view under the shadow of a dark cloud that rolled towards them like a black pall laden with destruction  god help us murmured stanley in an undertone as he scanned the seaward horizon which was covered with leaden clouds and streaks of lurid light beneath which the foaming sea leaped furiously  call upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee said mrs stanley who overheard the exclamation  stanley either heard her not or his mind was too deeply concentrated on the critical nature of their position to make any reply  as she buried her face in her hands edith threw her trembling arms round her mother and hid her face in her bosom  even chimo seemed to understand their danger for he crept closer to the side of his young mistress and whined in a low tone as if in sympathy  the waves had now increased to such a degree that it required two of the men to bail incessantly in order to prevent their being swamped and as stanley cast a hurried glance at the other canoes which were not far off he observed that it was as much as they could do to keep afloat  could we not run back massan asked stanley in despair  unpossble sir replied the guide whose voice was almost drowned by the whistling of the wind  were more nor halfway over an it would only blow us farther out to sea if we was to try  while the guide spoke stanley was gazing earnestly in the direction of the horizon  round with you massan he exclaimed suddenly put the canoe about and paddle straight out to seahallo he shouted to the other canoes follow us out to seastraight out  the men looked aghast at this extraordinary order  look alive lads continued their leader i see an island away there to leeward  perhaps its only a rock but any way its our only chance  the canoes heads were turned round and in another moment they were driving swiftly before the wind in the direction of the open sea  right right murmured dick prince as they made towards this new source of hope mayhap its only a bit o ice but even thats better than nothin  if tis only ice cried la roche ye have ver pauvre chance at all  shure an if we are to go ashore at all at all said bryan whose spirits had suddenly risen with this gleam of hope from fifty degrees below to fifty above zeroif we are to go ashore at all at all its better to land on the ice than on the wather  with such a breeze urging them on the three canoes soon approached what appeared to be a low sandbank on which the sea was dashing in white foam  but from the tossing of the waves between them and the beach it was difficult to form a conjecture as to its size  indeed at times they could scarcely see it at all owing to the darkness of the day and the heavy rain which began to fall just as they approached and more than once stanleys heart sank when he lost sight of the bank and he began to think that he had made a mistake and that they were actually flying out to the deep sea in which case all hope would be gone for ever  but gods mercy was extended to them in this hour of peril  the island appeared to grow larger as they neared it and at last they were within a stonesthrow of the shore  but a new danger assailed them here  the largest canoe which neared the island first had begun to leak and took in water so fast that the utmost efforts of those who bailed could not keep it under and from the quantity that was now shipped they made very little way  to add to the horror of the scene the sky became very dark and another crash of thunder pealed forth accompanied by a blinding flash of lightning  paddle boys paddle for your lives cried stanley throwing off his coat and seizing a tin dish with which he began to throw out the water  the canoe rose on a huge wave which broke all round it  this nearly filled it with water and carried it towards the shore with such velocity that it seemed as if they should be dashed in pieces but they fell back into the trough of the sea and lay motionless like a heavy log and in a sinking condition  now lads look out for the next wave and give way with a will cried massan  the worthy steersman acted rather too energetically on his own advice for he dipped his paddle with such force that it snapped in two  be ready to jump out cried dick prince standing up in the bow in order to give more power to his strokes  as he spoke stanley turned to his wife and said jessie hold on by my collar ill take eda in my arms  at that instant the canoe gave a lurch and before stanley could grasp his child they were all struggling in the sea  at this awful moment instead of endeavouring to do as her husband directed mrs stanley instinctively threw her arms around edith and while the waves were boiling over her she clasped the child tightly to her bosom with her left arm while with her right she endeavoured to raise herself to the surface  twice she succeeded and twice she sank when a box of merchandise providentially struck her arm seizing this she raised herself above the water and poor edith gasped convulsively once or twice for air  then the box was wrenched from her grasp by a wave and with a wild shriek she sank again  just then a strong arm was thrown around her her feet touched the ground and in a few seconds she was dragged violently from the roaring waves and fell exhausted on the beach  thanks be to god we are saved murmured mrs stanley as her husband assisted her to rise and led her beyond the reach of the waves while edith still clung with a deadly grasp to her mothers neck  ay jessie thank god indeed  but for his mercy we should have all been lost  i was floundering about beside the canoe when your scream showed me where you were and enabled me to save you  but rest here in the lee of this balei cannot stay by you  frank is in danger still  without waiting for a reply he sprang from her side and hurried down to the beach  here everything was in the utmost confusion  the two large canoes had been saved and dragged out of the reach of the waves and the men were struggling in the boiling surf to rescue the baggage and provisions on which latter their very lives depended  as stanley reached the scene of action he observed several of the men watching the small canoe which contained frank and his two indians  it had been left some distance behind by the others and was now approaching with arrow speed on the summit of a large wave  suddenly the top of the billow curled over and in another moment the canoe was turned bottom up  like a cork it danced on the waves white crest then falling beneath the thundering mass of water it was crushed to pieces and cast empty upon the beach  but frank and his men swam like otters and the party on shore watched them with anxious looks as they breasted manfully over the billows  at last a towering wave came rolling majestically forward  it caught the three swimmers in its rough embrace and carrying them along on its crest launched them on the beach where it left them struggling with the retreating water  those who have bathed in rough weather on an exposed coast know well how difficult it is to regain a firm footing on loose sand while a heavy wave is sweeping backward into its parent ocean  frank and the two indians experienced this and they might have struggled there till their strength had been exhausted were it not for stanley prince and massan who rushed simultaneously into the water and rescued them  as the whole party had now by the goodness of god reached the land in safety they turned their undivided energies towards the bales and boxes which were rolling about in the surf  many of these had been already collected and were carried to the spot where mrs stanley and edith lay under the shelter of a bale  as the things were successively brought up they were piled around the mother and child who soon found themselves pretty well sheltered from the wind though not from the rain which still fell in torrents  soon after frank came to them and said that all the things were saved and that it was time to think of getting up some sort of shelter for the night  this was very much needed for poor edith was beginning to shiver from the wet and cold  now then francois massan shouted frank lend a hand here to build a house for eda  well be all as snug as need be in a few minutes  despite the cold and her recent terror the poor child could not help smiling at the idea of building a house in a few minutes and it was with no little curiosity that she watched the operations of the men meanwhile mr stanley brought some wine in a pannikin and made edith and his wife drink a little  this revived them greatly and as the rain had now almost ceased they rose and endeavoured to wring the water out of their garments  in less than half an hour the men piled the bales and boxes in front of the largest canoe which was turned bottom up and secured firmly in that position by an embankment of sand  over the top of all three oilcloths were spread and lashed down thus forming a complete shelter large enough to contain the whole party  at one end of this curious house mr stanley made a separate apartment for his wife and child by placing two large bales and a box as a partition and within this little space edith soon became very busy in arranging things and putting the house to rights as she said as long as the daylight lasted for after it went away they had neither candles nor fire as the former had been soaked and broken and as for the latter no wood could be found on the island  the mens clothes were of course quite wet so they cut open a bale of blankets which had not been so much soaked as the other goods having been among the first things that were washed ashore  at the time they were wrecked the dashing spray and the heavy rain together with the darkness of the day had prevented the shipwrecked voyageurs from ascertaining the nature of the island on which they had been cast and as the night closed in while they were yet engaged in the erection of their temporary shelter they had to lie down to rest in ignorance on this point  after such a day of unusual fatigue and excitement they all felt more inclined for rest than food so instead of taking supper they all lay down huddled together under the canoe and slept soundly while the angry winds whistled round them and the great sea roared and lashed itself into foam on the beach as if disappointed that the little band of adventurers had escaped and were now beyond the reach of its impotent fury    chapter ten  the sandbankdismal prospectsconsultationsinternal arrangements exposed and detailed  of all the changes that constantly vary the face of nature the calm that succeeds a storm is one of the most beautiful and the most agreeable perhaps to the feelings of man  few conditions of nature convey to the mind more thoroughly the idea of complete reposeof deep rest after mortal strife of sleep after exhausting toil and those who have passed through the violence of the storm and done battle with its dangers are by the physical rest which they enjoy after it is over the more fitted to appreciate and sympathise with the repose which reigns around them  when the sun rose on the morning after the storm it shone upon a scene so calm and beautiful so utterly unconnected with anything like the sin of a fallen world and so typical in its deep tranquillity of the mind of him who created it that it seemed almost possible for a moment to fancy that the promised land was gained at last and that all the dark clouds the storms and dangers the weary journeyings and the troubles of the wilderness were past and gone for ever  so glorious was the scene that when edith rising from her rude couch and stepping over the prostrate forms of her still slumbering companions issued from the shelter of the canoe and cast her eyes abroad upon the glassy sea she could not restrain her feelings and uttered a thrilling shout of joy that floated over the waters and reverberated among the glittering crags of the surrounding icebergs  the island on which the travellers had been cast was a mere knoll of sand not more than a few hundred yards in circumference that scarcely raised its rounded summit above the level of the water and at full tide was reduced to a mere speck utterly destitute of vegetation  the sea around it was now smooth and clear as glass though undulated by a long regular swell which rolled at slow solemn intervals in majestic waves towards the sandbank where they hovered for a moment in curved walls of darkgreen water then lipping over at their crests fell in a roar of foam that hissed a deep sigh on the pebbles of the beach and left the silence greater than before  masses of ice floated here and there on the surface of the deep the edges and fantastic points of which were tipped with light  not far from the northern extremity of the sandbank a large iceberg had grounded from the sides of which several pinnacles had been hurled by the shock and now lay stranded on the beach  the shout with which edith had welcomed the morning roused the whole party and in a few minutes they were all assembled outside of their little hut some admiring the scene othersof a less enthusiastic and more practical turnexamining the circumstances of their position and considering the best course that should be pursued in their difficulty  mr stanley dick prince and massan as was their wont held a council upon the existing state of things and after much gazing round at the sea and up at the sky and considerable grunting of his deep voice and rubbing of his capacious chin on the part of the latter he turned to dick prince as if appealing to his superior sagacity and said  well ye see my pinions jist this yonders the mainland there pointing to the eastward where about ten miles distant the rocks and trees were seen distorted and faintly looming through a tremulous haze an theres our canoes there jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the large canoes whose torn sides and damaged ribs as they lay exposed on the sand bore sad testimony to the violence of the previous nights storm and theres the little canoe yonder glancing towards the craft in question which lay on the beach a hopelesslydestroyed mass of splinters and shreds of bark that projected and bristled in all directions as in uncontrollable amazement at the suddenness and entirety of its own destruction  now that bein the case an the baggage all wet an the day parfitly beautiful an the sun about hot enough to bile the sea we cant do better nor stay where we are an mend the canoes dry the goods an start fair tomorrow mornin  stanley looked at prince as if expecting a remark from him but the grave countenance of the silent bowman indicated that he was absorbed in contemplation  tis quite evident massan said stanley that we must repair the canoes but a few hours could do that and i dont like the idea of staying another night on a strip of sand like this which i verily believe another stiff norwester would blow away altogetherbut what say you prince  do you advise our remaining  yes replied dick i do  ye see theres no fear of another storm soon  tis a good chance for dryin the goods so i vote for stoppin  well then we shall stay replied stanley  to say truth i agreed with you at first massan but its always advisable to look at both sides of a question  yes and in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom said frank morton coming up at the moment and tapping his friend on the shoulder if you will include me in your confabulation you shall have the benefit of deep experience and farsighted sagacity  come then master frank replied stanley what does your sagacity advise on the point of our staying on this sandbank  shall we spend another night on it in order to dry the goods or shall we up and away to terra firma as soon as the canoes are seaworthy  stay of course said frank  as to the sandbank tis firm enough to my mind after resisting the shock of the wave that dashed me ashore last night  then we have everything we needshelter and food and even fuel  as frank mentioned the last word he glanced round with a rueful countenance and pointed to the bark and timbers of his broken canoe  true frank we have wherewith to boil the kettle and as the watercask was full when we started yesterday morning there will be enough at least for one or two days  by the way that reminds me that eda and your wife are particularly desirous of having breakfast said frank  in fact they sent me specially to lay their melancholy case before you and i have great fears that eda will lay violent hands on the raw pork if her morning meal is delayed much longer  as for chimo he is rushing about the island in a state of ravenous despair so pray let us be going  be it so frank said stanley taking his friends arm and sauntering towards the canoe while massan and prince went to inform their comrades of the determination of their leader  in an hour after the above discourse breakfast was over and the men under stanleys inspection arranged and examined the baggage which considering that it had been rolled about by the surf for a considerable time was not so much soaked as might have been expected  the two kegs of gunpowder were first inspected being the most valuable part of the cargo as on them depended much of their future livelihood  they were found to be quite dry except a small portion of powder at the seams of the staves which having caked with the moisture had saved the rest from damage  some of the bales however containing knives and other hardware were very wet and had to be opened out and their contents wiped and spread out to dry  blankets too and other woollen garments that had suffered were also spread out on the sand so that in a short time the little island was quite covered with a strange assortment of miscellaneous articles that gave to it the appearance of a crowded store  the entire wealth of the furtraders was now exposed to view and it may perhaps be interesting to enumerate the different articles in order to give some idea of the outfit deemed necessary on such an expedition  and first there were two kegs of gunpowder as before mentioned containing each thirty pounds with four bags of ball and three of shot of various sizesin all about 250 pounds of lead  six nets of four and a half inch mesh  a large quantity of twine for making netsmost of the men being able to construct these useful articles  a small bag of gunflints  sixty pounds of roll tobacco  twelve large axes  six augers  seven dozen scalpingknives  six pounds of variouslycoloured beads  two dozen firesteels and a pretty large assortment of awls needles thread nails and such like small articles which though extremely useful were too numerous and comparatively insignificant to mention in detail  besides these there was a small bale containing gaudy ornaments and attractive articles which were intended as propitiatory presents to the esquimaux when they should be met with then there were two runlets of salt pork containing about ninety pounds each and in the centre of each runlet were two hams  a barrel of flour and a barrel of oatmeal constituted all their provision if we except a small cask of hard biscuit and a little tea and sugar which were the private property of stanley and frank morton  there was also a large deerskin tent capable of holding from twenty to thirty men which was intended to be used while they were engaged in building their winter residence at ungava  as to arms each man had one of the long singlebarrelled fowlingpieces that are supplied by the fur company to the natives and are styled indian guns  stanley had a doublebarrelled flint fowlingpiece and frank had a rifle besides a single gun of a description somewhat finer than that supplied to the indians  of course each man carried a scalpingknife and an axe in his belt not for the purpose of selfdefence but for carving their food and cutting their fuel  it may be well to remark here that the goods and provisions which we have detailed above were merely intended as a supply for their immediate necessities and to enable them to commence active operations at once on arriving at their destination while the heavy stores and goods necessary for the years trade were to be forwarded in a small sloop from the depot direct through hudsons straits to ungava bay  when the work of unpacking and exposing the things to dry in the sun was accomplished it was long past noon and high time for dinner so a fire was lighted by bryan who cut up another portion of franks canoe for the purpose  a rasher of pork and a flour cake were disposed of by each of the party in a surprisingly short time and then the men bestirred themselves in mending the canoes  this was a more troublesome job than they expected but being accustomed not only to mend but to make canoes they worked with a degree of skill and diligence that speedily put all to rights  in massans canoe there was a hole large enough as bryan remarked to stick his head through though it was a big wan an no mistake  taking up a roll of bark which was carried with them for the purpose massan cut from it a square patch which he sewed over the hole using an awl for a needle and the fibrous roots of the pine tree called wattape for thread  after it was firmly sewed on the seams were covered with melted gum and the broken spot was as tight and strong as ever  there were next found several long slits one of them fully three feet which were more easily managed as they merely required to be sewed and covered with gum  several broken ribs however were not so easily repaired  had there been any wood on the island massans quick knife would have soon fashioned new ribs as it was he had to make the best job he could by splicing the old ones with several pieces abstracted from franks little canoe  it was sunset before all was put in complete order the goods repacked and placed in readiness for a start at daybreak on the following morning  after all was done the remains of the small canoe were converted into a bonfire round which the tired and hungry travellers assembled to smoke and chat while supper was being prepared by the indefatigable bryan and his friend la roche  as the day faded away the stars came out one by one until they glittered in millions in the sky while the glare of the fire became every moment more and more intense as the darkness deepened  it was a strange wild sceneespecially when viewed from the extremity of the little sandbank which was so low as to be almost indiscernible in the dark night and seemed scarce a sufficient foundation for the little busy group of human beings who stood radiant in the red light of their campfire like a blazing gem cast upon the surface of the great cold sea    chapter eleven  start afreshsuperstitious notionsthe whirlpoolthe interior fishing in the old way on new ground and what came of ita cold bath the rescuesaveddeeper and deeper into the wilderness  as if to make amends for its late outrageous conduct the weather after the night of the great storm continued unbrokenly serene for many days enabling our travellers to make rapid progress towards their destination it would be both tiresome and unnecessary to follow them step by step throughout their journey as the part of it which we have already described was in many respects typical of the whole voyage along the east coast of hudsons bay  sometimes indeed a few incidents of an unusual character did occur  once they were very nearly being crushed between masses of ice twice the larger canoe struck on a hummock and had to be landed and repaired and frequently mishaps of a slighter nature befell them  their beds too varied occasionally  at one time they laid them down to rest on the sand of the seashore at another on the soft turf and springy moss of the woods  sometimes they were compelled to content themselves with a couch of pebbles few of which were smaller than a mans fist and not unfrequently they had to make the best they could of a flat rock whose unyielding surface seemed to put the idea of anything like rest to flight causing the thin men of the party to growl and the fat ones to chuckle  bryan was one of the wellfavoured being round and fleshy while his poor little friend la roche possessed a framework of bones that were so sparingly covered with softer substance as to render it a matter of wonder how he and the stones could compromise the matter at all and called forth from his friend frequent impertinent allusions to thridpapers bags o bones idges o knives half fathoms o pump water and such like curious substances  but whatever the bed it invariably turned out that the whole party slept soundly from the time they lay down till the time of rising which was usually at the break of day  owing to the little indian canoe having been wrecked on the sandbank frank and his men had to embark in the smaller of the large canoes a change which was in some respects a disadvantage to the party as frank could not now so readily dash away in pursuit of game  however this did not much matter as in a few days afterwards they arrived at the mouth of the river by which they intended to penetrate into the interior of the country  the name of the river is deer river and it flows into richmond gulf which is situated on the east shore of hudsons bay in latitude 56 degrees north  richmond gulf is twenty miles long and about the same in breadth but the entrance to it is so narrow that the tide pours into it like a torrent until it is full  the pentup waters then rush out on one side of this narrow inlet while they are running in at the other causing a whirlpool which would engulf a large boat and greatly endanger even a small vessel  of course it was out of the question to attempt the passage of such a vortex in canoes except at half flood or half ebb tide at which periods the waters became quiet on arriving at the mouth of the gulf the travellers found the tide out and the entrance to it curling and rolling in massive volumes as if all the evil waterspirits of the north were holding their orgies there oostesimow and maistequan being by nature and education intensely superstitious told stanleyafter they had landed to await the flow of the tidethat it was absolutely necessary to perform certain ceremonies in order to propitiate the deities of the place otherwise they could not expect to pass such an awful whirlpool in safety  their leader smiled and told them to do as they thought fit adding however that he would not join them as he did not believe in any deities whatever except the one true god who did not require to be propitiated in any way and could not be moved by any other means than by prayer in the name of jesus christ  the red men seemed surprised a little at this but with their proverbial stoicism refrained from any further or more decided expression of feeling  nevertheless the indians sufficiently showed their faith in their own doctrines by immediately setting about a series of curious and elaborate ceremonies which it was impossible to comprehend and decidedly unprofitable to describe  they appeared however to attach much importance to their propitiatory offerings the chief among which seemed to be a few inches of tobacco with which it was fondly hoped the deities of the gulf would condescend to smoke the pipe of peace while their red children ventured to trespass a little on their domain and hard indeed must have been the hearts of the said spirits had they refused so valuable an offering for tobacco is the life and marrow the quintessence of terrestrial felicity the very joy and comfort of a voyageur and the poor indians had but little of it to spare  while this was going on bryan stood with his back to the fire a remarkably short and peculiarly black pipe in his mouth and his head inclined sagaciously to one side as if he designed by dint of a combination of intense mental abstraction partial closing of his eyes severe knitting of his brows and slow but exceedingly voluminous emission of smoke to come to a conclusion in regard to the unfathomable subject of indian superstition  la roche steeped in unphilosophic indifference on such matters and keenly alive to the gross cravings of hunger busied himself in concocting a kettle of soup while the rest of the party rambled about the beach or among the bushes in search of eggs in this latter search frank and edith were very successful and returned with pockets laden with excellent eggs of the eiderduck which were immediately put into the kettle and tended not a little to increase the excellence of the soup and the impatience of the men  meanwhile the tide rose the power of the current was gradually checked and towards noon they passed the dangerous narrows in safety  from the view that was now obtained of the interior it became evident that the worst of their journey yet lay before them  on arriving at the mouth of deer river the mountains were seen to rise abruptly and precipitously while far away inland their faint blue peaks rose into the sky  indeed from this point the really hard work of the voyage may be said to have commenced for scarcely had they proceeded a few miles up the river when their further progress at least by water was effectually interrupted by a rapid which came leaping madly down its rocky bed as if the streams rejoiced to escape from the chasms and mountain gorges and find rest at last on the ample bosom of the great deep  what think ye of that boy said stanley to frank morton as they leaped from their respective canoes and stood gazing at the rugged glen from which the rapid issued and the wild appearance of the hills beyond  it seems to me that report spoke truly when it said that the way to clearwater lake was rugged  here is no despicable portage to begin with and yonder cliffs that look so soft and blue in the far distance will prove to be dark and hard enough when we get at them i warrant  when we get at them echoed mrs stanley as she approached leading edith by the hand  get at them george  had any one asked me if it were possible to pass over these mountains with our canoes and cargoes i should have answered decidedly not  and yet you were so foolish and reckless as to be the first to volunteer for this decidedly impossible expedition replied stanley  there you are inconsistent said mrs stanley smiling  if reckless i cannot be foolish according to your own showing for i have heard you give it as your opinion that recklessness is one of the most essential elements in the leaders of a forlorn hope  but really the thing does seem to my ignorant mind impossiblewhat think you eda  mrs stanley bent down and looked into the face of her child but she received no reply  the expanded eyes indeed spoke volumes and the parted lips on which played a fitful exulting smile the heightened colour and thickcoming breath told eloquently of her anticipated delight in these new regions which seemed so utterly different from the shores of the bay but her tongue was mute  and well might mrs stanley think the passage over these mountains impossible for except to men accustomed to canoe travelling in the american lakes and rivers such an attempt would have appeared as hopeless as the passage of a ship through the icelocked polar seas in winter  not so thought the men  already several of the most active of them were scrambling up the cliffs with heavy loads on their backs and while stanley and his wife were yet conversing two of them approached rapidly bearing the large canoe on their shoulders  the exclamation that issued from the foremost of these proved him to be bryan  now bad luck to ye gaspard cant ye go stidy  its mysilf thatll be down on me blissid nose av ye go staggerin about in that fashion sure its losh the spalpeen that would carry the canoe better than you  gaspard made no reply  bryan staggered on growling as he went and in another minute they were hid from view among the bushes  what do you see frank inquired stanley you stare as earnestly as bryan did at the white bear last week  what ist man  speak  a fish replied frank  i saw him rise in the pool and im certain hes a very large one  very likely frank there ought to be a fish of some sort there  ive been toldhist there hes again  as i live a salmon a salmon frank  now for your rod my boy  but frank heard him not for he was gone  in a few minutes he returned with a fishingrod which he was busily engaged in putting up as he hurried towards the rocks beside the pool  now frank morton was a fisher  we do not mean to say that he was a fisher by profession nor do we merely affirm that he was rather fond of the gentle art of angling or generally inclined to take a cast when he happened to be near a good stream  by no means  frank was more than that implies  he was a steady thoroughgoing disciple of izaak walton one who in the days of his boyhood used to flee to the waterside at all seasons in all weathers and despite all obstacles  not only was it his wont to fish when he could or how he could but too often was he beguiled to fish at times and in ways that were decidedly improper sometimes devoting those hours which were set apart expressly for the acquirement of greek and latin to wandering by mountain stream or tarn rod in hand up to the knees in water among the braes and woodlands of his own native country  and franks enthusiasm did not depend entirely on his success  it was a standing joke among his schoolfellows that frank would walk six miles any day for the chance of a nibble from the ghost of a minnow  indeed he was often taunted by his ruder comrades with being such a keen fisher that he was quite content if he only hooked a drowned cat during a days excursion  but frank was goodnatured he smiled at their jests and held on the even tenor of his way whipping the streams more pertinaciously than his master whipped him for playing truant content alike to bear ignominy and chastisement so long as he was rewarded by a nibble and overjoyed beyond expression when he could return home with the tail of a twopounder hanging over the edge of his basket  far be it from us to hold up to ridicule the weakness of a friend but we cannot help adding that master frank made the most of his tails  his truthful and manly nature indeed would not stoop to actual deception but he had been known on more than one occasion to offer to carry a friends waterproof fishingboots in his basket when his doing so rendered it impossible to prevent the tails of his trout from protruding arrogantly as if to insinuate that there were shoals within  another of franks weaknesses was upon the hooking of every fish to assert with overweening confidence and considerable excitement that it was a tremendously big one  experience had during all his piscatorial career contradicted him ninetynine times out of every hundred but franks firm belief in his last minnow being a big troutat least until it lay gasping on the bank at his feetwas as unshaken after long years of mistaken calculation as when first he sallied forth to the babbling brook with a willow branch a fathom of twine and a crooked pin  such untiring devotion of course could not fail to make frank particularly knowing in all the details and minutiae of his muchloved sport  he knew every hole and corner of the rivers and burns within fifteen miles of his fathers house  he became mysteriously wise in regard to the weather knew precisely the best fly for any given day and in the event of being unhappily destitute of the proper kind could dress one to perfection in ten minutes  as he grew older and taller and the muscles on his large and wellmade limbs began to develop frank slung a more capacious basket on his back shouldered a heavier rod and with a pair of thick shoes and a homespun shooting suit stretched away over the highland hills towards the romantic shores of the west coast of scotland  here he first experienced the wild excitement of salmonfishing and here the waltonian chains that had been twining and thickening around him from infancy received two or three additional coils and were finally riveted for ever  during his sojourn in america he had happened to dwell in places where the fishing though good was not of a very exciting nature and he had not seen a salmon since the day he left home so that it is not matter for wonder that his stride was rapid and his eye bright while he hurried towards the pool as before mentioned  he who has never left the beaten tracks of men or trod the unknown wilderness can have but a faint conception of the feelings of a true angler as he stands by the brink of a dark pool which has hitherto reflected only the antlers of the wild deerwhose dimpling eddies and flecks of foam have been disturbed by no fisher since the world began except the polar bear  besides the pleasurable emotions of strong hope there is the additional charm of uncertainty as to what will rise and of certainty that if there be anything piscatine beneath these fascinating ripples it undoubtedly will riseand bite too  then there is the peculiar satisfaction of catching now and then a drop of spray from and hearing the thunder of a cataract whose free surging bound is not yet shackled by the tourists sentimental description and the novelty of beholding ones image reflected in a liquid mirror whose geographical position is not yet stereotyped on the charts of man  alas for these maps and charts  despite the wishes of scientific geographers and the ignorance of unscientific explorers we think them far too complete already and we can conceive few things more dreadful or crushing to the enterprising and romantic spirits of the world than the arrival of that time if it ever shall arrive when it shall be said that terra incognita exists no longerwhen every one of those fairylike isles of the southern seas and all the hidden wonders of the polar regions shall be put down in cold blood on black and white exposed profanely on the schoolroom walls and drummed into the thick heads of wretched little boys who dont want to learn by the unsympathising hands of dominies who it may be care but little whether they do or not  but to return  while frank stood on the rocks attaching to the line a salmonfly which he had selected with much consideration from his book he raised his eyes once or twice to take a rapid glance at his position and the capabilities of the place  about fifty yards further up the river the stream curled round the base of a large rock and gushed into a pool which was encircled on all sides by an overhanging wall except where the waters issued forth in a burst of foam  their force however was materially broken by another curve round which they had to sweep ere they reached this exit so that when they rushed into the larger pool below they calmed down at once and on reaching the point where frank stood assumed that oily gurgling surface dimpled all over with laughing eddies that suggests irresistibly the idea of fish not only being there as a matter of course but being there expressly and solely for the purpose of being caught  a little further down the river took a slight bend and immediately after recurring to its straight course it dashed down for a distance of fifty yards in a tumultuous rapid which swept into sudden placidity a few hundred yards below  having taken all this in at a glance frank dropped the fly into the water and raised his rod to make a cast  in this act he almost broke the rod to his amazement for instead of whipping the fly lightly out of the water he dragged a trout of a pound weight violently up on the bank  bravo cried stanley laughing heartily at his friends stare of mingled wonder and amazementbravo frank  im no fisher myself but ive always understood that fish required a little play before being landed  however you have convinced me of my ignorance  i see that the proper way is to toss them over your head  a salmon must be rather troublesome to toss but no doubt with your strong arms youll manage it easily hey  why what an appetite they must have replied frank answering his friends badinage with a smile  if the little fellows begin thus what will not the big ones do  as he spoke he disengaged the fish and threw it down and made the next cast so rapidly that if another trout was waiting to play him a similar trick it must have been grievously disappointed  the line swept lightly through the air and the fly fell gently on the stream where it had not quivered more than two seconds when the water gurgled around it the next moment franks rod bent like a hoop and the line flew through the rings with whirring rapidity filling these lonely solitudes for the first time with the pleasant music of the reel  almost before frank had time to take a step in a downward direction fifty yards were run out the waters were suddenly cleft and a salmon sprang like a bar of burnished silver twice its own height into the air  with a sounding splash it returned to its native element but scarcely had its fins touched the water when it darted towards the bank  being brought up suddenly here it turned at a tangent and flashed across the pool again causing the reel to spin with renewed velocity  here the fish paused for a second as if to collect its thoughts and then coming apparently to a summary determination as to what it meant to do it began steadily to ascend the stream not indeed so rapidly as it had descended but sufficiently so to give frank some trouble by means of rapidly winding up to keep the line tight  having bored doggedly towards the head of the rapid the fish stopped and began to shake its head passionately as if indignant at being foiled in its energetic attempts to escape  after a little time it lay sulkily down at the bottom of the pool where it defied its persecutor to move it an inch  whats to be done now asked stanley who stood ready to gaff the fish when brought near to the bank  we must rouse him up said frank as he slowly wound up the line just take up a stone and throw it at him  stanley looked surprised for he imagined that such a proceeding would frighten the fish and cause it to snap the line but seeing that frank was in earnest he did as he was directed  no sooner had the stone sunk than the startled fish once more dashed across the river then taking a downward course it sped like an arrow to the brink of the rough water below  to have allowed the salmon to go down the rapid would have been to lose it so frank arrested the spinning of his reel and held on  for a second or two the rod bent almost in a circle and the line became fearfully rigid  youll break it frank cried stanley in some anxiety  it cant be helped said frank compressing his lips he must not go down there  the tackle is new i think it will hold him  fortunately the tackle proved to be very good  the fish was arrested and after one or two short runs which showed that its vigour was abated it was drawn carefully towards the rocks  as it drew near it rolled over on its side once or twicean evident sign of being much exhausted  now stanley be careful said frank as his friend stepped cautiously towards the fish and extended the gaff  ive seen many a fine salmon escape owing to careless gaffing  dont be in a hurry  be sure of your distance before you strike and do it quickly  now thentheregive it him  hurrah he shouted as stanley passed the iron hook neatly into the side of the fish and lifted it high and dry on the rocks  the cheer to which frank gave vent on this successful termination to the struggle was reechoed heartily by several of the men who on passing the spot with their loads had paused and become deeply interested spectators of the sport  powerful big fish sir said bryan throwing down his pack and taking up the salmon by the gills  twinty pounds at laste av its an ounce  scarcely that bryan said stanley but its not much less i believe  ah oui tis ver pritty  ver superb for supper remarked la roche  the little frenchman was right in saying that it was pretty  unlike the ordinary salmon it was marked with spots like a trout its head was small and its shoulders plump while its silvery purity was exceedingly dazzling and beautiful  tis a hearnesalmon said massan approaching the group  ive seed lots o them on the coast to the southard o this an ive no doubt well find plenty o them at ungava  while the men were discussing the merits of the fish frank had hooked another which although quite as large gave him much less trouble to land and before the men had finished carrying the canoes and goods over the portage he had taken three fish out of the same pool  wishing however to try for a larger one nearer the sea he proceeded to take a cast below the rapid  meanwhile la roche whose activity had enabled him to carry over his portion of the cargo long before his comrades came to the pool which frank had just left and seating himself on a large stone drew forth his tobaccopouch  with a comical leer at the water which had so recently been deprived of its denizens he proceeded leisurely to fill a pipe  it is impossible to foresee and difficult to account for the actions of an impulsive human being  la roche sat down to smoke his pipe but instead of smoking it he started to his feet and whirled it into the river  this apparently insane action was followed by several others which as they were successively performed gradually unfolded the drift of his intentions  drawing the knife which hung at his girdle he went into the bushes whence he quickly returned dragging after him a large branch  from this he stripped the leaves and twigs  fumbling in his pocket for some time he drew forth a piece of stout cord about four yards long with a codhook attached to the end of it  this line had been constructed some weeks before when the canoes were windbound at a part of the coast where la roche desirous of replenishing the kettle had made an unsuccessful attempt at seafishing  fastening this line to the end of his extemporised rod la roche proceeded to dress his hook this he accomplished by means of the feather of a duck which frank shot the day before and a tag from his scarlet worsted belt and when finished it had more the appearance of some hideous reptile than a gay fly  however la roche surveyed it for a moment or two with an expression of deep satisfaction and then hurrying to the brink of the water made a violent heave  oh cent milles tonnerres he exclaimed angrily as the enormous hook caught in the leg of his trousers  the large and clumsy barb was deeply imbedded so there was no help for it but to use the knife  the second throw was more successful and the hook alighted in the water with a splash that ought to have sent all the fish in the pool away in consternation  instead of this however no sooner did the reptile trail upon the stream than a trout dashed at it in such violent haste that it nearly missed it altogether  as it was it hooked itself very slightly and the excitable frenchman settled the matter by giving the line a violent tug in his anxiety to land the fish that pulled the hook entirely out of its mouth  ah cest dommage ver great mais try it encore my boy exclaimed the mortified angler  the next throw although well accomplished produced nothing but at the third attempt ere the reptile had settled on the water for a second it was engulfed by a salmon fully six pounds weight and la roches rod was almost drawn out of his grasp  hilloa losh what have ye got there exclaimed bryan as with several of the men he approached to where the frenchman and the salmon strove in uncertain conflict  by the mortial hes hucked a whale  out with it boy afore it pulls ye in said the irishman running to the rescue  just then the salmon gave a pull of more than ordinary vigour at the same moment la roche slipped his foot and ere bryan could lay hold of him fell headlong into the water and disappeared  bryans hands hung helplessly down his jaw dropped and his eyes opened wide as he gazed in mute wonderment at the spot where his friends toes had vanished suddenly he wrenched off his cap and flung it down and proceeded to tear off his coat preparatory to leaping into the river to the rescue when his arms were pinioned to his sides by the powerful grip of massan  come bryan said he you know very well that you cant swim youd only make things worse  och murder he cant swim neither  let me go ye black villain thunder an turf will ye see the poor lad drownded forenint yer two eyes cried the poor irishman as he made violent but unavailing struggles to get free  but massan knew that to allow him to escape would only add to the number requiring to be saved and as he himself could not swim he saw at once that the only service he could render under the circumstances would be to hold the irishman down  clasping him therefore as in a vice he raised his head and gave a shout for help that rolled in deep echoes among the overhanging cliffs  another shout was uttered at the same instant  edith who happened to come up just as la roches head emerged from the water gasping for breath uttered a wild shriek that made more than one heart among the absentees leap as they flew to the rescue  meanwhile la roche rose and sank several times in the surges of the pool  his face on these occasions exhibited a mingled expression of terror and mischievous wildness for although he could not swim a stroke the very buoyancy of his mercurial temperament seemed partially to support him and a feeling of desperate determination induced him to retain a deathlike gripe of the rod at the end of which the salmon still struggled  but his strength was fast going and he sank for the fourth time with a bubbling cry when a step was heard crashing through the adjacent bushes and dick prince sprang down the slope like a deer he did not pause when the scene burst upon his view but a smile of satisfaction played upon his usually grave face when he saw edith safe on the banks of the stream  another spring and an agile bound sent him headlong into the pool about a yard from the spot where la roche had last sunk  scarcely had he disappeared when the dog chimo bounded towards the scene of action and with what intent no one could tell leaped also into the water  by this time frank stanley and nearly all the party had assembled on the bank of the river ready to render assistance  in a few seconds they had the satisfaction of seeing dick prince rise holding poor la roche by the collar of his capote with his left hand while he swam vigorously towards the shore with his right but during the various struggles which had taken place they had been gradually sucked into the stream that flowed towards the lower rapid and it now became apparent to prince that his only chance of safety was in catching hold of the point of rock that formed the first obstruction to the rush of water  abandoning all effort therefore to gain the bank beside him he swam with the current but edged towards the shore as he floated down  hallo  la roche he exclaimed loudly  do you hear do you understand me  ah oui vraiment  i not dead yit  then let go that rod and seize my collar and mind sink deep in the water  show only enough o your face to breathe with or ill drown ye  the frenchman obeyed to the extent of seizing dicks collar and sinking deep in the water so as not to overburden his friend but nothing could induce him to quit the rod to which he had clung so long and so resolutely  princes arms being now free one or two powerful strokes placed him beyond the influence of the strong current and as he passed the rocks before mentioned he seized an overhanging branch of a small shrub by which he endeavoured to drag himself ashore  this however he found to be impossible partly owing to the steepness of the shelving rock and partly to the fact that chimo in his illdirected attempts to share in the dangers of his friends had seized la roche by the skirts of the coat in order to prevent himself from going down the stream those on shore on seeing prince make for the rock ran towards the spot but having to make a slight detour round the bend of the river they did not reach it until he seized the branch and when frank who was the first sprang down the slope to the rescue he found them streaming out and waving to and fro in the current like some monstrous reptiledick holding on to the branch with both hands la roche holding on to dick chimo holding on by his teeth to la roche and the unfortunate salmon holding on to the line which its halfdrowned captor scorned to let go  a few seconds sufficed to drag them dripping from the stream and the energetic little frenchman no sooner found his feet on solid ground than he hauled out his fish and landed it triumphantly with his own hand  tis a pretty fish la roche said frank laughing as he busied himself in taking down his rod while several of the men assisted dick prince to wring the water out of his clothes and others crowded round la roche to congratulate him on his escapetis a pretty fish but it cost you some trouble to catch it  throuble indeed echoed bryan as he sat on a rock smoking his pipe troth its more nor him came to throuble by that same fish it guve me the throuble o bein more nor half choked by massan  half choked bryan what mean you asked frank  mane  i just mane what i say an the raison whys best known to himself  a loud peal of laughter greeted massans graphic explanation of the forcible manner in which he had prevented the irishman from throwing himself into the river  the party now turned earnestly to the more serious duties of the journey  already too much time had been lost in this playing themselves with fish as stanley expressed it and it behoved them to embark as speedily as possible  about a mile above the pool which had nearly proved fatal to la roche was the head of a series of insurmountable rapids which extended all the way down to the waterfall beyond this was a pretty long reach of calm water up which they proceeded easily but as they advanced the current became so strong that no headway could be made with the paddles and it was found necessary to send a party of the men ashore with a long line by means of which the canoes were slowly dragged against the current  at length they came to shallow water which necessitated another portage and as it was about sunset when they reached it stanley ordered the tent to be pitched for the night and the fire lighted under the shadow of a stupendous mountain the rocky sides of which were sprinkled with dwarf pine trees and partially covered with brush and herbage  here edith and her mother discovered multitudes of berries the most numerous being cloud and crow berries both of which were found to be good especially the former and a fragrant dish of these graced the towel that evening at supper  thus day by day our adventurous travellers penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of the wilderness which became more savage and mountainous as they left the coast  stanley drew forth his quadrant and compass wherewith he guided the party towards their future home  at night after the labour of the day was over he and frank would spread their charts in the blaze of the camp fire and study the positions of the land so far as it was laid down while edith sat beside her mother helping her to repair the torn and wayworn habiliments of her husband and frank or listening with breathless interest to the men as they recounted their experiences of life in the different regions through which they had travelled  many of these tales were more or less coloured by the fancy of the narrators but most of them were founded on fact and proved an unfailing source of deep interest to the little child  franks fishingrod was frequently in requisition and often supplied the party with more than enough of excellent fish and at every new bend and turn of the innumerable lakes and rivers through which they passed reindeer were seen bounding on the mountainsides or trotting down the ravines to quench their thirst and cool their sides in the waters so that food was abundant and their slender stock of provisions had not to be trenched upon while the berries that grew luxuriantly everywhere proved a grateful addition to their store  thus day by day they slowly retreated farther and farther from the world of mankind living in safety under the protection of the almighty and receiving the daily supply of all their necessities from his fatherly and bountiful hand thus day by day they rose with the sun and lay down at night to rest upon the mountains side or by the rivers bank and thus day by day they penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of the unknown wilderness    chapter twelve  a new scenethe esquimaudeerslayingenemies in the bush  turn we now to another a more distant and a wilder scene  near the bleak shores of hudsons straits there flows a river which forms an outlet to the superfluous waters of the almost unknown territory lying between the uninhabited parts of labrador and that tract of desert land which borders hudsons bay on the east and is known to the furtraders by the appellation of east main  this river is called the caniapuscaw and discharges itself into ungava bay  the scene to which we would turn the readers attention is upwards of twenty miles from the mouth of this river at a particular bend where the stream spreads itself out into a sheet of water almost worthy of being called a lake and just below which two bold cliffs shut out the seaward view and cause an abrupt narrowing of the river  the scene is peculiar and surpassingly grand  on each side of the stream majestic mountains raise their bald and rugged peaks almost into the clouds little herbage grows on the more exposed places and nothing save here and there a stunted and weatherworn pine breaks the sharp outline of the cliffs  but in the gorges and dark ravinesfor there are no valleysclumps of smallsized sprucefir and larch trees throw a softness over some of the details of a spot whose general aspect is one of sterility  the mountains rise in a succession of irregular steps or terraces whose faces are so precipitous that they cannot be ascended to accomplish the feat of scaling the mountaintops it would be necessary to clamber up a ravine until the first terrace should be gained then walking along that ascend the next ravine and so on  at the upper end of the lake as we shall hereafter call this wide part of the river lies a low island fringed with a scanty growth of willows and not far from this on the eastern bank of the river lies a small patch of level sand  this spot is somewhat peculiar inasmuch as it is backed by a low platform of rock whose surface is smooth as a table at the foot of this rock bubbles a little spring which meandering through a tangled spot of stunted shrubbery ere it mingles with the sand gives unusual greenness and vitality to the surrounding herbage on the edge of this rocky platform sat the figure of a man  it was evening  the declining sun shot its last few rays over the brow of the opposite mountains and bathed him in mellow light as he sat apparently contemplating the scene before him  the mans costume bespoke him a native of the savage region in the midst of which he seemed the only human being  but although an esquimau he exhibited several physical peculiarities not commonly supposed to belong to that people  to an altitude of six feet three he added a breadth of shoulder and expansion of chest seldom equalled among men of more highlyfavoured climes and his real bulk being very greatly increased by his costume he appeared to be a very giantno unfitting tenant of such giant scenery  the said costume consisted of an extremely loose coat or shirt of deerskin having the hair outside and a capacious hood which usually hung down behind but covered his head at this time in order to protect it from a sharp northwest breeze that whirled among the gullies of the mountains and surging down their sides darkened the surface of the water  a pair of long sealskin boots encased his limbs from foot to thigh and a little wallet or bag of sealskin with the hair outside hung from his shoulders  simple although this costume was it had a bulky rotundity of appearance that harmonised well with the giants frank goodhumoured countenance which was manly firm and massive besides being rosy oily and fat  in the latter peculiarity he partook of the wellknown characteristic of his tribe but the effeminacy in appearance that is produced by a round fat face was done away in the case of our giant by a remarkably black though as yet downy moustache and beard of a length suitable to twentythree winters  his hair was long straight and black besides being uncommonly glossyan effect attributable to the prevalence of whaleoil in these regions  on the forehead the locks were cut short so as to afford free scope to his black eyes and sturdylooking nose  by his side lay a long hunting spear and a doublebladed paddle fully fifteen feet long which latter belonged to a kayak or esquimau canoe that lay on the sand close to the waters edge  sitting there motionless as the rocks around him the giant looked like a colossal statue of an esquimau  he was no figure of stone however but a veritable human being as was proved by his starting suddenly from his reverie and hastening towards the spring before mentioned at which he stooped and drank rapidly like one who had to make up for lost time  after a few hurried gulps the man strode towards his canoe but as he went his restless eye became fixed on the branching antlers of a deer that were tossed in the air on the summit of a neighbouring cliff  like one who is suddenly paralysed the esquimau stood transfixed in the attitude in which he had been arrested  he did not even seem to breathe as the antlers moved to and fro clearly defined against the blue sky  at length they disappeared and the animal to which they belonged slowly descended a ravine towards the river  then as if set free from a spell the man glided into his kayak and swept rapidly but noiselessly behind a projecting point of rock where he waited patiently till the deer took to the water  he had not long to wait however for in a few minutes afterwards the deer followed by several companions walked out upon the patch of sand snuffed the air once or twice and entered the stream with the intention of crossing  but there was an enemy near whom they little dreamed ofnot an enemy who would dash excitedly into the midst of them or awaken the thunders of the place with his noisy gun but a foe who could patiently bide his time and take cool and quiet advantage of it when it came  when the deer had proceeded about a hundred yards into the river the esquimau dipped his paddle twice and the narrow sharppointed canoe which at a short distance seemed little more than a floating plank darted through the water and ranged alongside of the startled animals  the fattest of the herd was separated from its fellows and driven towards the shore from which it had started while the others struggled across the river  once or twice the separated deer endeavoured to turn to rejoin its comradesan attempt which was frustrated by the esquimau who could paddle infinitely faster over the water in his skin canoe than the deer could swim  as they neared the shore the giant cast on it one or two glances and having made up his mind as to the most convenient spot for landing he urged the point of his canoe between the antlers of the deer and steered it in this manner to the sandbank  the deer thus directed had no resource but to land where its persecutor chose but no sooner did its foot touch ground than it sprang convulsively forward in the vain hope to escape  the same instant its captors canoe shot beside it  grasping the long lance before mentioned in his hand he placed its glittering point on the deers side tickled it slowly to ascertain that it was between two ribs and with a quick thrust stabbed it to the heart  a convulsive shudder as the deers head sank in the stream proved that though coldblooded in appearance the action was more effective and less cruel than many other more approved methods of killing game  our esquimau thought neither of the method of slaying his deer nor of mans opinion regarding it  his sole object was to procure supper having tasted nothing since early morning and the manner in which he ate showed at once the strength of his appetite and his total indifference to cookery for he ate it raw  there was a certain appearance of haste in all his actions which however seemed unaccountable considering the peaceful nature of the vast solitudes around him  scarcely had he cut off and devoured a portion of the deer than he hastened again to his canoe and darted like an arrow from the shore  this is no exaggerated simile  the long thin sharp esquimau kayak is highly suggestive of an arrow in its form and much more so in its extraordinary speed  it consists of an extremely light framework of wood covered with sealskin parchment which is stretched upon it all over as tight as a drum  the top of the canoe being covered as well as the bottom it is thus as it were decked and a small hole in the middle of this deck admits its occupant  the kayak can only hold one person  the paddle as already said is a long pole with a blade at each end  it is dipped alternately on each side and is used not only to propel the kayak but to prevent it from upsetting  indeed so liable is it to upset that nothing but the wonderful adroitness of its occupant prevents it from doing so with every swing of his body  quick however though the kayak sped over the rippling wave it could not have escaped the messenger of death that seemed about to be dispatched after it by a darkskinned redpainted indian who at the moment the vessel left the shore leapt from behind a rocky point and levelling a long gun took a steady aim at the unconscious esquimau  a little puff of powder answered to the click of the lock as the gun missed fire  with an exclamation of anger the savage seized his powderhorn to reprime when a rude grasp was laid on his shoulder and another indian who from the eagle feather in his hair and his general bearing appeared to be a chief exclaimed  fool you have the impatience of a woman and you have not yet shown that you have the heart of a man  would the scalp of yon eaterofrawflesh pay us for coming so far from our huntinggrounds if your gun had spoken among these mountains we would have found the empty wigwams of his people instead of fringing our belts with their scalps  with a frown of anger the chief turned on his heel and retraced his steps into the ravine from which he had emerged followed by his abashed and silent companion  meanwhile the esquimau ignorant of the fate from which he had just escaped continued to ply his paddle with right good will  the little craft obedient to the powerful impulse combined as it was with the current of the ebbtide flew rather than floated toward the narrows through which it passed and opened up a view of the iceencumbered waters of ungava bay  directing his course along the western shores of the river the esquimau speedily reached the coast at a point where several low roughbuilt summer huts clustered near the shore  here he ran his kayak into a little creek and having lifted it beyond tide mark betook himself to his dwelling    chapter thirteen  savage lovea wife purchasedthe attackthe flightthe escapethe wounded man  scarcely had the stout esquimau proceeded a few steps along the shore when he was met by a young girl who laid her hand on his arm  taking her gently by the shoulders he drew her towards him and kissed her on both cheeksan action which caused her to blush deeply as with a half smile half frown on her face she pushed him away  love is the same all the world over whether it glows beneath the broadcloth and spotless linen of a civilised gentleman or under the deerskin coat of a savage  and its expression we suspect is somewhat similar everywhere  the coy repulse of pretended displeasure came as naturally from our plump little arctic heroine as it could have done from the most civilised flirt and was treated with wellsimulated contrition by our arctic giant as they walked slowly towards the huts but the esquimau had other matters than love in his head just then and the girls face assumed a grave and somewhat anxious look as he continued to whisper in her ear  at the little hamlet they separated and the maiden went to her grandfathers abode while her lover lifting the skincurtain door of a rudelyconstructed hut entered his own humble dwelling  the room was empty and its owner did not seem as if he meant to cheer it with his presence long  in one corner lay a pile of miscellaneous articles which he removed and taking the tusk of a walrus which lay near his hand began to dig with it in the sand  in a few seconds it struck a hard substance and the esquimau putting his hand into the hole drew forth a glittering axe upon which he gazed with supreme satisfaction  now be it known to you reader that among the esquimaux of the frozen north iron is regarded with about as much delight as gold is by ourselves  and the reason is simple enough  these poor people live entirely upon the produce of the chase  polar bears seals walruses and whales are their staff of life  to procure these animals spears are necessary to skin and cut them up knives are needful  but bone and stone make sorry knives and spears so that when a bit of iron no matter how poor its quality or small its size can be obtained it is looked on as the most valuable of possessions and the ingenuity displayed by esquimaux in fashioning the rudest piece of metal into the most useful of implements is truly astonishing proving in the most satisfactory way that necessity is indeed the mother of invention  the precious metal is obtained in two ways by the discovery of a wreck which is extremely rare and by barter with those tribes which sometimes visit the moravian settlements of labrador  but neither source is very productive  even a nail is treasured as a blessing while an axe is a fortune  when our giant therefore drew forth the shining implement and gazed with delight at its keen edge he experienced as great satisfaction as a miser does when gloating over his bankers book  having satisfied himself that the axe was free from all approximation to rust he stuck it into a belt of raw hide which he put on for the express purpose of sustaining it as esquimaux do not generally wear belts  he then sallied forth and walked with the air of a man who wears the grand cross of the legion of honour  as he went to the hut in which lived the oldest man of the tribe the shade of anxiety which had clouded his brow more than once during the day again rested on his face  on entering he observed the old esquimau listening with anxious countenance to the young girl whom we have already introduced to the reader  now this girlaneetka by namewas by no means an angel in esquimau habiliments  among civilised folk probably she would not have been deemed even pretty  nevertheless in the eyes of her lover she was most decidedly beautiful and round and fat and rosy and young awkward and comfortable  and the giant loved hernever so strongly perhaps as when he saw her striving to allay the fears of her old grandfather but this same grandfather was obstinate  he wanted her to become the wife of an esquimau who lived far to the westward and who once had dealings with the furtraders and from whom he expected to derive considerable advantages and gifts of bits of hoopiron and nails  but she wanted to become the giants wife so there the matter stood  the spirits o the wind and sea protect us and may the god o the mist cover us said the old man as the young esquimau sat down on a dead seal beside him  is it true that you saw the men of fire  this was of course said in the language of the esquimaux and we render it as literally as possible  yes it is true replied the young man  i saw them at the rapid water in caniapuscaw and i took kayak to bring the news  various exclamations of mingled surprise and anger escaped from the compressed lips of several stalwart natives who had crowded into the tent on hearing of the arrival of their comrade  yes continued the young man we must go away this night  they had firetubes and there were thirty men  we have only ten  again a murmur ran through the listeners but no one spoke for a few seconds  did they see you asked the old man anxiously  no  i came on them suddenly when i was chasing deer and almost ran into their camp but i saw and fell in the grass  i thought the chief raised his head quickly when i fell but he looked down again and i crawled away  in this the young esquimau was mistaken  he knew little of the craft and the quickness of the red indian and easily fell into the snare of his savage enemy who having been momentarily startled by the sudden sound of the esquimau approach had endeavoured to throw him off his guard by pretending that although he heard the sound he thought nothing of it  but no sooner had the esquimau retired than he was closely followed and watched by the whole party  they could have easily shot him but refrained from doing so that he might unwittingly be their guide to the habitations of his people  the rapid flight of his kayak distanced his pursuers at first but they made up for this during an hour or two in the night when the tired esquimau allowed himself a short season of repose to recruit his energies for the following days journey  during this period the indians shot far ahead of him and when he arrived at the coast next day they were not much in the rear  and now old man said our young esquimau it is time that i should have my wife  if the allat see note 1 come here tonight as i know they will i want to have a right to defend her and carry her away when we flee  are you willing  the young giant said this with a degree of roughness and decision that at any other time would have made the obstinate old grandfather refuse point blank but as there was every probability of having to flee for his life ere the break of another day and as his old heart trembled within him at the thought of the dreaded guns of the indians he merely shook his head and pondered a little  what will you give me he said looking up  the young man answered by drawing the axe from his belt and laying it on the ground before him  the old mans eyes glistened with pleasure as he surveyed the costly gift  good that will do  take her and go  a second bidding was not needed  the young man arose hastily took his blushing bride by the hand and led her from the tent of her grandfather towards his own  here she set to work instantly to assist her husband in hurriedly packing up their goods and chattels and immediately afterwards the little village became a perfect babel of confusion as the alarmed inhabitants on learning the threatened danger prepared for instant flight  in less than an hour the most of them were ready  the men launched their kayaks while the women having loaded their oomiaks with their goods tossed their dogs and children on the top of them  the oomiak or womens boat is quite a different affair from the kayak in which the men travel singly  it is usually made large and capacious in order to hold the entire household of the esquimau  like the kayak it is made of skin but has no covering above and is propelled by means of short singlebladed paddles which are worked by the women upon whom devolves the entire care and management of the oomiak  it is a clumsy affair to look at but like the boats of savages generally it is uncommonly useful and a good seaboat  while the esquimaux were busied in completing their arrangements one of the dogs rushed towards the bushes that lined the shore just behind the village and barked vociferously  instantly it was joined by the whole pack and the esquimaux who ever since they had heard of the proximity of their indian foes were in a state of the utmost trepidation made a general rush towards their canoes  before they reached them however a volley of musketry was fired from the bushes and three of their numbera man and two womenfilled the air with their deathshriek as they fell dead upon the beach while the indians sprang from their concealment and brandishing their knives and tomahawks rushed with a fearful yell upon the terrorstricken esquimaux  shrill and terrible though the indian warcry is proverbially known to be it was excelled in appalling wildness by the shriek which arose from the esquimaux as they hurried tumultuously into their canoes and put off to sea  these poor creatures were naturally bravemuch more so indeed than their assailants but the murderous effects of the terrible gun caused the sternest brow among them to blanch and the stoutest heart to quail  the arrow and the spear however rapid could be avoided if observed in time but this dreaded implement of destruction was so mysterious to them and its deathdealing bullet so quick and the smoke the fire and the loud report so awful that they shuddered even when they thought of it  no wonder then that they uttered a despairing cry when it actually sounded in their ears  when the dogs first gave tongue our tall esquimau was alone in his hut having just sent his wife down with a bundle to the oomiak  when the volley rang in his ears he rushed towards the beach supposing that she was there before him  this was not the case however  aneetka had gone towards her grandfathers hut and when the indians fired she rushed in to assist him to fly  but the old man was already gone  turning instantly she sprang nimbly towards the shore  at that moment a single shot was fired and she saw her husband stumble forward and fall headlong to the earth where he lay motionless  her first impulse was to run towards the body and throw herself upon it but this intention was effectually checked by a strong darkskinned arm which encircled her waist and despite her cries and struggles bore her away into the bushes  her captor was the indian whose gun once before on that day had been levelled at her lovers head  when the young esquimau fell as already related he was so close to the water that he stumbled into it and fortunately not a yard distant from an oomiak which the women were frantically thrusting into the sea they had no time to lift so heavy a weight on board but as the light craft darted from the shore an old woman who had often received kind attentions from the goodnatured youth leant over the stern and seized him by the hair  in this manner he was dragged through the water until they were out of gunshot when he was lifted inside and laid beside the dogs and children  meanwhile the indians had rushed into the water up to their middle in the hope of catching the last of the little fleet but without success mad with disappointed rage they waded back to the shore and standing in a line along the edge of the waves reloaded their guns with the utmost rapidity  the poor esquimaux knew well what would follow and strained every nerve to increase their distance  once more the guns belched forth their leaden shower which went skipping over the water towards the flotilla  only one kayak was hit by the discharge  it was that of the old grandfather already mentioned  the ball ripped up the side of the canoe which filled and upset and the poor old man would certainly have been drowned but for the opportune coming up of the oomiak containing his wounded grandson  the old woman who had already saved the life of the young giant of the tribe again put forth her skinny hand and grasped the patriarch who was soon hauled on board in safety  a few minutes more placed the whole party out of danger  in the meantime the indians furious with disappointment scalped the three dead bodies and tossed them into the sea after which they went into the huts in order to collect all the valuables that might have been left behind  very little however was to be found as the entire property of an esquimau is not worth much to a red man  the most useful thing they laid hands on was the axe which the old grandfather had left behind in his hurried flight  having taken all they could carry the savages destroyed the rest and then setting fire to the village they returned to the bush  here a fire was made and a council of war held  when the indian who had captured the esquimau girl led her forward towards the fire there was a general yell of indignation  tomahawks were grasped and more than one knife was unsheathed  but the chief commanded silence  what does white heart mean to do with the eaterofrawflesh he inquired turning to the young man  he will take her to the huntinggrounds of the crees  that cannot be said the chief  the girl must die and white heart must kill her  the young man made no reply  if continued the chief sarcastically white heart is afraid to see blood on his knife another warrior will show him how to do it  as he spoke a darkvisaged savage drew his scalpingknife and with one stride stood beside the trembling girl who during the consultation of the savages had stood silently beside her captor listening intently to the words which she did not comprehend  seizing her by the shoulder the savage plunged his knife at her bosom but ere the keen point reached it the arm was caught by the young indian and the scowling savage was hurled violently back  with dilated eye and expanded nostril the young man not deigning to bestow a glance upon his fallen comrade turned to his chief and said  did not i take her  the girl is mine  i will carry her to my tent and make her my wife  be it so replied the chief abruptly  then turning to his followers he gave orders to start immediately  in a few minutes all was ready  the chief led the way into the bush the esquimau girl and her captor followed and the whole band silently and in single file commenced to retrace their steps to the far distant huntinggrounds of the cree indians    note 1  esquimau name for indians    chapter fourteen  the pursuitsealspearingthe giants despair  when the young esquimau began to recover from the lethargic state into which his wound had thrown him he found himself lying at the bottom of the womens oomiak with his old grandfather by his side and a noisy crew of children and dogs around him  raising himself on his elbow he brushed the clotted blood and hair from his temples and endeavoured to recall his scattered faculties  seeing this the old crone who had saved his life laid down her paddle and handed him a sealskin cup of water which he seized and drank with avidity  fortunately the wound on his forehead although it had stunned him severely at first was trifling and in a few minutes after partaking of the cool water he recovered sufficiently to sit up and look around him  gradually his faculties returned and he started up with a troubled look  where are the allat  where is my wife he exclaimed vehemently as his eye fell on the prostrate form of his still insensible grandfather  gone answered several of the women  gone repeated the youth gazing wildly among the faces around him in search of that of his wife  gone  tell me is she in one of the other oomiaks  the women trembled as they answered no  have the allat got her  there was no reply to this question but he did not need one  springing like a tiger to the stern of the oomiak he seized the steering paddle and turning the head of the boat towards the shore paddled with all his energy  nearly two hours had elapsed since they had commenced their flight and as all danger of pursuit was over the moment the indians turned their backs on the sea the esquimaux had gradually edged inshore again so that a few minutes sufficed to run the prow of the oomiak on the shingle of the beach  without saying a word the young man sprang over the side drew a huntingspear from the bottom of the boat and hurried back in the direction of the deserted village at the top of his speed  the women knew that nothing could stop him and feeling that he was quite able to take care of himself they quietly put to sea again and continued their voyage  the limbs of the young esquimau as we have already said were gigantic and powerful enabling him to traverse the country at a pace which few of his fellows could keep up with and although a sternchase is proverbially a long one and the distance between two parties travelling in opposite directions is amazingly increased in a short space of time there is no doubt that he would have overtaken his indian foes ere many hours had passed but for the wound in his head which although not dangerous compelled him more than once to halt and sit down in order to prevent himself from falling into a swoon  hunger had also something to do with this state of weakness as he had eaten nothing for many hours  in his hasty departure from the boat however he had neglected to take any provisions with him so that he had little hope of obtaining refreshment before arriving at the village where some scraps might perhaps be picked up  slowly and with a reeling brain he staggered on but here no relief awaited him for every scrap of food had been either taken away or destroyed by the indians and it was with a heavy sigh and a feeling akin to despair that he sat down beside the blackened ruins of his late home  but esquimaux more than other men are accustomed to reverses of fortune and the sigh with which he regarded the ruins of his hut had no reference whatever to the absence of food  he knew that about this time the mouth of the river would be full of ice carried up by the floodtide and that seals would in all probability be found on it so he started up and hastening along the beach soon gained the floes which he examined carefully  a glance or two sufficed to show him that he was right in his conjecture  on a sheet of ice not more than a couple of hundred yards from shore were two seals fast asleep  these he prepared to stalk  between the floe and the shore ran a stream of water twenty yards broad  over this he ferried himself on a lump of loose ice and on reaching the floe he went down on his hands and knees holding the spear in his right hand as he advanced cautiously towards his victim  the esquimau sealspear is a curious weapon and exhibits in a high degree the extraordinary ingenuity of the race  the handle is sometimes made of the horn of the narwal but more frequently of wood  it has a movable head or barb to which a long line of walrus hide or sealskin is attached  this barb is made of ivory tipped with iron and is attached to the handle in such a way that it becomes detached from it the instant the animal is struck and remains firmly imbedded in the wound with the line fastened to it while the handle floats away on the water or falls on the ice as the case may be  when the esquimau had approached to within a hundred yards he lay down at full length and slowly worked himself forward  meanwhile the seals raised their heads but seeing as they imagined a companion coming towards them they did not make for their holes which were a few yards distant from them  having drawn near enough to render the animals suspicious the young giant now sprang up rushed forward and got between one seal and its hole just as its more active companion dived into the water  in another moment the deadly lance transfixed its side and killed it  this was a fortunate supply to the esquimau whose powers of endurance were fast failing  he immediately sat down on his victim and cutting a large steak from its side speedily made a meal that far exceeded the powers of any alderman whatsoever  it required but a short time to accomplish however and a shorter time to transfer several choice junks chunks to his wallet with which replenished store he resumed his journey  although the mans vigour was restored for a time so that he travelled with great speed it did not last long owing to the wound in his head which produced frequent attacks of giddiness and at last compelled him much against his will to halt for a couple of hours repose  glancing round in order to select a suitable camping ground he soon observed such a spot in the form of a broad overhanging ledge of rock beneath which there was a patch of scrubby underwood  here he lay down with the seal blubber for a pillow and was quickly buried in deep untroubled slumber  in little more than two hours he awoke with a start and after a second application to the contents of the wallet resumed his solitary march  the short rest seemed to have quite restored his wonted vigour for he now stalked up the banks of the river at a rate which seemed only to accelerate as he advanced  as has been already said these banks were both rugged and precipitous  in some places the rocks jutted out into the water forming promontories over which it was difficult to climb and frequently these capes terminated in abrupt precipices necessitating a detour in order to advance  in other places the coast was indented with sandy bays which more than doubled the distance the traveller would have had to accomplish had he possessed a kayak  unfortunately in his hasty departure he neglected to take one with him but he did his best to atone for this oversight by making almost superhuman exertions  he strode over the sands like an ostrich of the desert and clambered up the cliffs and over the rockslooking in his hairy garments like a shaggy polar bear  the thought of his young and pretty bride a captive in the hands of his bitterest foes and doomed to a life of slavery almost maddened him and caused his dark eye to flash and his broad bosom to heave with pentup emotion while it spurred him on to put forth exertions that were far beyond the powers of any member of his tribe and could not under less exciting circumstances have been performed even by himself  as to what were his intentions should he overtake the indians he knew not  the agitation of his spirits combined with the influence of his wound induced him to act from impulse and the wild tumult of his feelings prevented him from calculating the consequences or perceiving the hopelessness of an attack made by one man armed only with knife and spear against a body of indians who possessed the deadly gun  alas for the sorrows of the poor human race  in all lands they are much the same whether civilised or savagevirtue and vice alternately triumphing  bravery candour heroism in fierce contest with treachery cowardice and malevolence form the salient points of the record among all nations and in all ages  no puissant knight of old ever buckled on his panoply of mail seized his sword and lance mounted his charger and sallied forth singlehanded to deliver his mistress from enchanted castle in the face of appalling perils with hotter haste or a more thorough contempt of danger than did our esquimau giant pursue the indians who had captured his bride but like many a daring spirit of romance the giant failed and that through no fault of his  on arriving at the rocky platform beside the spring where we first introduced him to the reader the esquimau sat down and casting his spear on the ground gazed around him with a look of despair  it was not a slight matter that caused this feeling to arise  notwithstanding his utmost exertions he had been unable to overtake the indians up to this point and beyond this point it was useless to follow them  the mountains here were divided into several distinct gorges each of which led into the interior of the country and it was impossible to ascertain which of these had been taken by the indians as the bare rocky land retained no mark of their light moccasined feet  had the pursuer been an indian the wellknown sagacity of the race in following a trail however slight might have enabled him to trace the route of the party but the esquimaux are unpractised in this stealthy doglike quality their habits and the requirements of their condition render it almost unnecessary so that in difficult circumstances their sagacity in this respect is not equal to the emergency  add to this the partial confusion created in the young giants brain by his wound and it will not appear strange that despair at length seized him when after a severe journey he arrived at a spot where as it were half a dozen crossroads met and he had not the most distant idea which he had to follow  it is true the valley of the river seemed the most probable route but after pursuing this for a whole day without coming upon a vestige of the party he gave up the pursuit and returning to the spring beside the rock passed the night there with a heavy heart  when the sun rose on the following morning he quitted his lair and taking a long draught at the bubbling spring prepared to depart  before setting out he cast a melancholy glance around the amphitheatre of gloomy hills shook his spear in the bitterness of his heart towards the dark recesses which had swallowed up the light of his eyes perchance for ever then turning slowly towards the north with drooping head and with the listless tread of a heartbroken man he retraced his steps to the seacoast and rejoining his comrades was soon far away from the banks of the caniapuscaw river    chapter fifteen  end of the voyageplans and prospectsexploring parties sent out  three weeks alter the departure of the esquimaux from the neighbourhood of ungava bay the echoes of these solitudes were awakened by the merry song of the canadian voyageurs as the two canoes of stanley and his comrades swept down the stream and approached the spring at the foot of the flat rock  as the large canoe ran its bow lightly on the sand the first man who leaped ashore was la roche  he seemed even more sprightly and active than formerly but was a good deal darker in complexion and much travelstained  indeed the whole party bore marks of having roughed it pretty severely for some time past among the mountains  ediths face was decidedly darker than when she left moose and her short frock considerably shorter in consequence of tear and wear  bad luck to ye losh  out o the way an let yer betters land before ye exclaimed bryan as he jumped into the water and dragged the canoe towards the beach  the only marks that rough travelling had put on bryan were one or two additional wrinkles in his battered white hat as for his face it was already so thoroughly bronzed by long exposure that a week or two more or less made no difference in its hue  jump into my arms miss edith said francois as he stood in the water beside the canoe  steady boy mind the gum cried massan as oolibuck strained the canoe roughly in shouldering a package  look out ashore there cried dick prince throwing the tent poles on the beach as he spoke  regardless of the warning gaspard did not look out and received a rap on the leg from one of the poles whereat he growled savagely and threw down a sack which rested on his shoulder so violently that it nearly knocked over maistequan who was passing at the time with the campkettle in his hand  what an ould buffalo it is exclaimed bryan pushing gaspard rudely aside with his left shoulder and hitching off la roches cap with his right as he sprang back to the canoe for another load  pardonay mwa losh may garson he exclaimed with a broad grin  now thin boys out wid the fixins  faix its mysilf is plazed to git ashore anyhow for theres nothin gone into my intarior since brickfust this mornin  at this moment the bow of the other canoe grated on the sand and frank morton leaped ashore  capital place to camp frank said stanley who had just finished pitching the tent on the scrimp herbage that forced its way through the sand  theres a splendid spring of pure water below yonder rock  ive just left my wife and eda busy with the teacups and la roche preventing them from getting things ready by way of helping them  it does indeed seem a good place replied frank and might do for temporary headquarters perhaps while we make excursions to the coast to fix on a spot for our new home  stanley gazed contemplatively around him as his friend spoke  hand me the telescope frank it strikes me we are nearer the sea than you think  the water here is brackish and yonder opening in the mountains might reveal something beyond if magnified by the glass  after a lengthened survey of the surrounding hills frank and stanley came to the conclusion that they could make nothing of it at least that night and as it was becoming gradually dark they resolved to postpone all further consideration of the subject till the next day  meanwhile the men busied themselves in preparing supper and chimo unexpectedly lent them some assistance by bringing into camp a ptarmigan which he had just killed  true chimo had in his innocence designed this little delicacy of the season for his own special table but no sooner was he seen with the bird between his teeth than it was snatched from him and transferred to the pot forthwith  the following day was an era in the existence of the travellers  for the first time since commencing their arduous voyage the cargoes were left behind and the canoes paddled away light and buoyant on a trip of investigation  stanley had rightly judged that they were now near the sea and the great breadth of the river led him to believe that there might be water sufficient to float the vessel in which the goods for the station were to be forwarded  if this should turn out as he expected there could not be a better spot for establishing a fort than that on which they had encamped as it was situated just below the last rapids of the river had a fine spring of fresh water in its vicinity and was protected from the cold blasts of winter to some extent at least by the surrounding mountains  now frank added mr stanley after stating his opinion on this point what i mean to do is this i shall take the large canoe with dick prince francois gaspard la roche and augustusthe last to interpret should we fall in with esquimaux whom i am surprised not to have found hereabouts  with these i will proceed to the sea examine the coast observe whether there be any place suitable for building on and if all goes well be back to supper before sunset  you will take the other canoe with bryan massan oolibuck and maistequan and proceed down the opposite side of the river a short way  examine the shores there and above the island see whether there be any place better than where we stand for a permanent residence and at night we shall compare notes  my wife and eda shall remain in camp under the care of oostesimow and moses  and pray who is to defend your poor wife and innocent child in the event of an attack by a band of savage natives inquired mrs stanley as she joined her husband and frank  no fear of the wife and child replied stanley patting his better half on the shoulder  if indians should find out the camp oostesimow can palaver with them and should esquimaux pay you a visit moses will do the polite  besides had you not interrupted i was going to have given special instructions to frank regarding you  so master frank be pleased to take eda off your shoulder and give ear to my instructions while you are examining the other side of the water you will keep as much as possible within eyeshot and always within earshot of the camp  in a still day like this a gunshot can be heard five or six miles off and should you see any sign of the natives having been here recently return instantly to the camp  frank promised implicit obedience to these instructions and the whole party then set to work to pile the goods on a ledge in the steep cliffs behind the spring so that a fortress was soon formed which with two such stout and courageous men as moses and oostesimow armed with two guns each a brace of pistols two cutlasses and an ample supply of ammunition could have stood a prolonged siege from much more practised enemies than indians or esquimaux  after having completed these defensive arrangements and provided occupation for those who remained in camp by laying on them the duty of having the goods examined in order to see that nothing had been damaged by wet or rough usage the two canoes pushed from the shore and bounded lightly away while the men sang merrily at their easy labour for now that the canoes were light they might have been propelled by two men  frank directed his course obliquely up the river towards the island already alluded to and stanley proceeded with the current towards the narrows beyond which he expected to catch sight of the sea  after passing above the island which was found to be low and thinly covered with vegetation and a few scrubby bushes frank and his men pushed over to the other side and proceeded carefully to examine the coast  it was found to be much the same as that which they had just left  a narrow belt of sandy and shingly beach extended along the margin of the river or as it might be more appropriately termed the lake at least in as far as appearance went  this strip or belt was indented here and there with numerous bays and inlets and in many places was intersected by rocky capes which jutted out from the mountains  these mountains were bare and precipitous rising abruptly like those on the other side from the edge of the sand and ascending in a succession of terraces whose faces were so steep that it was almost impossible to scale them  they could be ascended in succession however by means of the ravines and numerous gullies which rose in rugged and zigzag lines from the beach to the mountain tops  in the very first of these gullies in which the exploring party landed they found the remains of an esquimau summer encampment  these consisted of a few stunted trees which appeared to have been built in the form of rude huts but they were thrown about in some confusion and altogether bore evidence of having remained in a state of ruin for many years another discovery of a more satisfactory kind was madenamely the tracks of deer which were so fresh as to induce frank to take his rifle and mount the ravine in search of the animals accompanied by massan whose natural temperament was exceedingly prone to enjoy the excitement of the chase  so much indeed was this the case that the worthy guide had more than once been on the point of making up his mind to elope to the backwood settlements of the states purchase a rifle and ammunition there don a deerskin huntingshirt and make tracks as he styled it for the prairies there to dwell and hunt until his eye refused to draw the sight and his finger to pull the trigger of a kentucky rifle  but massans sociable disposition came in the way of this plan and the thought of leading a solitary life always induced him to forego it  its my pinion sir remarked the guide as he followed frank up the ravine the sheltered parts of which were covered with a few clumps of stunted pinesits my pinion that well have to cut our logs a long bit up the river for theres nothin fit to raise a fort with hereabouts  true massan replied frank glancing from side to side hunter fashion as he walked swiftly over the broken ground theres not a tree that i can see big enough to build a backwoods shanty with  well master twill do for firewood if its fit for nothin else and thats a blessin thats not always to be comed by everywhere  lets be thankful for small matters  i see sticks growin up them gullies thatll do for stakes for the nets an axe handles an paddles an spear shafts an  the honest guides enumeration of the various articles into which the small timber of the place might be converted was brought to a sudden pause by frank who laid his hand on his shoulder and while he pointed with the butt of his rifle up the ravine whispered dont you see anything else up yonder besides trees massan  the guide looked in the direction indicated and by an expressive grunt showed that his eye had fallen on the object referred to by his companion  it was a deer which stood on an overhanging ledge of rock high up the cliffsso high that it might easily have been mistaken for a much smaller animal by less practised sportsmen  below the shelf on which it stood was a yawning abyss which rendered any attempt to get near the animal utterly hopeless  what a pity said frank as he crouched behind a projecting rock that its out of shot  it would take us an hour at least to get behind it and theres little chance i fear of its waiting for us  no chance whatever replied massan decidedly  but hes big enough to cover from where we stand  to cover  ay truly i could point straight at his heart easy enough indeed i would think it but slight boasting to say i could cover his eye from this spotbut the bullet would refuse to go massan its far beyond shot  try sir try exclaimed the guide quickly for as they spoke the deer moved  ive been huntin on the rocky mountains afore now an i know that distance cheats you in sich places  its not so far as you think  he had scarcely finished speaking when franks rifle poured forth its contents  the loud echoes of the crags reverberated as the smoke floated away to leeward  the next instant the deer sprang with one wild bound high into the airover the cliffand descending with lightning speed through the dark space was dashed almost in pieces on the rocks below  massan gave a low chuckle of satisfaction as he walked up to the mangled animal and pointing to a small round hole just over its heart he said the old spot mr frank ye always hit them there  having paid frank this compliment massan bled the animal which was in prime condition with at least two inches of fat on its flanks and having placed it on his shoulders returned with his companion to the canoe  while frank was thus engaged stanley had descended towards the shores of ungava bay which he found to be about twentyfive miles distant from the encampment beside the spring  he made a rapid survey of the coast as they descended and sounded the river at intervals  when he reached its mouth he had made two important discoveries  the one was that there did not seem to be a spot along the whole line of coast so well fitted in all respects for an establishment as the place whereon their tents were already pitched  the other was that the river from its mouth up to that point was deep enough to float a vessel of at least three or four hundred tons burden  this was very satisfactory and he was about to return to the camp when he came upon the deserted esquimau village which a few weeks before had been the scene of a murderous attack and a hasty flight  on a careful examination of the place the marks of a hasty departure were so apparent that stanley and his men made a pretty near guess at the true state of affairs and the former rightly conjectured that having made a precipitate flight in consequence of some unexpected attack there was little probability of their returning soon to the same locality  this was unfortunate but in the hope that he might be mistaken in these conjectures and that the natives might yet return before winter he set up a pole on a conspicuous place and tied to the top of it a bag containing two dozen knives one dozen firesteels some awls and needles several pounds of beads and a variety of such trinkets as were most likely to prove acceptable to a savage people  while bryan was engaged in piling a heap of stones at the foot of this pole to prevent its being blown down by the wind the rest of the party reembarked and prepared to return home for although the camp beside the spring was scarcely one day old the fact that it was likely to become the future residence of the little party had already invested it with a species of homelike attraction  man is a strange animal and whatever untravelled philosophers may say to the contrary he speedily makes himself at home anywhere  hallo bryan shouted stanley from the canoe look sharp were waiting for you  ay ay yer honour replied the irishman lifting a huge mass of rock jist wan more an itll be stiff an stidy as the north pole himself then in an undertone he added look sharp is it ye say  its blunt ye are to spake that way to yer betters  musha but its mysilf wouldnt give a tinpinny for all that bag houlds twinty times doubled an yit thim haythens thim porkfaced huskimos ll dance round this here pole wi delight till theyre fit to dhrop  och but salvages is a quare lot an bryan yer a cliver boy to come this far all the way to see thim  with this selfcomplimentary conclusion bryan resumed his place at the paddle and the party returned to the camp  here they found things in a most satisfactory state  frank and his party had returned and the deer now cut up into joints and steaks was impaled on a number of stakes of wood and stuck up to roast round a large and cheering fire  the savoury steam from these with the refreshing odour of the teakettle produced a delectable sensation in the nostrils of the hungry explorers  stanleys tent was erected with its back towards the mountains and its open door towards the fire which lighted up its snug interior and revealed mrs stanley and edith immersed in culinary operations and chimo watching them with a look of deep grave sagacityhis ears very erect and his head a good deal inclined to one side as if that position favoured the peculiar train of his cogitations  la roche was performing feats of agility round the fire that led one to believe he must be at least half a salamander  at a respectful distance from stanleys tent but within the influence of the fire the men were employed in pitching for the first time the large skin tent which was to be their residence until they should build a house for themselves and on a log within dangerous proximity to the mercurial la roche sat frank morton busily employed in entering in his journal the various events of the day  there was much talk and loud laughter round the fire that night for the different parties had much to tell and much to hear regarding the discoveries that had been made and discussions as to the prospects of the expedition were earnest and long  it was generally admitted that first appearances were upon the whole favourable although it could not be denied that the place looked dreadfully barren and rugged  under the happy influence of this impression and the happier influence of the savoury steaks on which they had supped the entire party lay down to rest and slept so profoundly that there was neither sound nor motion to indicate the presence of human beings in the vast solitudes of ungava save the fitful flame of the fire as it rose and fell casting a lurid light on the base of the rugged mountains and a sharp reflection on the dark waters    chapter sixteen  resources of the country begin to developbryan distinguishes himself fishing extraordinary  there is a calm but deepseated and powerful pleasure which fills the heart and seems to permeate the entire being when one awakens to the conviction that a day of arduous toil is about to begintoil of an uncertain kind perhaps connected with danger and adventure in an unexplored region of the earth  ignorance always paints coming events in glowing colours and the mere fact that our adventurers knew not the nature of the country in which their tent was pitchedknew not whether the natives would receive them as friends or repel them as foesknew not whether the nature and capabilities of the country were such as would be likely to convert the spot on which they lay into a comfortable home or a premature gravethe mere fact of being utterly ignorant on these points was in itself sufficient to fill the poorest spirit of the band had there been a poor spirit among them with a glow of pleasurable excitement and a firm resolve to tax their powers of doing and suffering to the uttermost  when the sun rose on the following morning the whole party was astir the fire lighted and an early breakfast in course of preparation  much had to be done and it behoved them to set about it with energy and at once for the short autumn of these arctic regions was drawing on apace and a winter of great length and of the utmost severity lay before them  there was also one consideration which caused some anxiety to stanley and frank although it weighed little on the reckless spirits of the men and this was the possibility of the nonarrival of the ship with their winter supply of provisions and goods for trade  without such a supply a winter on the shores of ungava bay would involve all the hardships and extreme perils that too often fall to the lot of arctic discoverers and he who has perused the fascinating journals of those gallant men knows that these hardships and perils are neither few nor light  the leaders of the expedition were not indeed men to anticipate evils or to feel unduly anxious about possible dangers but they would have been more or less than human had they been able to look at mrs stanley and little edith without a feeling of anxiety on their account  this thought however did not influence them in their actions or if it did it only spurred them on to more prompt and vigorous exertions in the carrying out of their undertaking  after breakfast stanley assembled his men and gave each special directions what to do  one of the most important points to ascertain was whether there were many fish in the river  on this hung much of the future comfort and wellbeing perhaps even the existence of the party gaspard was therefore ordered to get out his nets and set them opposite the encampment  oolibuck being officially an interpreter of the esquimau language and when not employed in his calling regarded as a sort of male maidofallwork was ordered to assist gaspard  the next matter of primary importance was to ascertain what animals inhabited the region and whether they were numerous  dick prince being the recognised hunter of the party was directed to take his gun and a large supply of ammunition and sally forth over the mountains in search of game and as massan was a special friend of his a good shot and moreover a sagacious fellow he was ordered to accompany him they were also directed to observe particularly the state of the woods and the quality of the timber growing therein but as this last required special attention the style and size of the future fort being dependent on it francois the carpenter was appointed to make a journey of observation up the caniapuscaw river in company with augustus the esquimau and maistequan the indianit being thought probable that if natives were to be met with at all they would be on the banks of the river rather than in the mountains  it was further arranged that frank morton should ascend the mountains in company with bryan and ascertain if there were any lakes and whether or not they contained fish  as for mr stanley he resolved to remain by the camp  on entering his tent after dispatching the several parties he said to his wife  im going to stay by you today jessie  all the men except moses oostesimow gaspard and la roche are sent off to hunt and fish in the mountains and i have kept these four to paddle about this neighbourhood in order to take soundings and examine the coast more carefully because you see it would be an unfortunate thing if we began our establishment in a place not well suited for it  mrs stanley and edith were of course quite pleased with this arrangement and while the males of the party were absent the former employed herself in dressing the skin of the deer that had been shot the day before  she accomplished this after the indian fashion by scraping and rubbing it with the animals brains  afterwards she smoked it over a fire of green wood and in this way produced a soft pliant substance similar to chamois leather but coarser and stouter  as for edith she rambled at will among the bushes of the nearest ravine under the faithful guardianship of chimo and hurried back to the camp almost every hour laden with cloudberries cranberries blaeberries and crowberries which grew in profusion everywhere  opposite to the camp the water was found to be eight fathoms deep  this was of great importance as affording facility for unloading the ship abreast of the establishment  higher up the river the ground was more favourable for building both on account of its being more sheltered and better wooded with timber fit for the construction of houses but the water was too shallow to float the ship and the island before mentioned which was named cross island proved an effectual barrier to the upward progress of any craft larger than a boat  but as stanley surveyed the spot on which the tent was pitched and observed the sheltering background of mountains with their succession of terraces the creek or ravine to the right with its growth of willows and stunted pines the level parcel of greensward with the little fountain under the rock and the fine sandy bay in which gaspard and oolibuck were busily engaged in setting a couple of netswhen he surveyed all this he felt that although not the best locality in the neighbourhood it was nevertheless a very good one and well suited in many respects for the future establishment  please sir the net him set shouted oolibuck from the shore to his master who floated in the bay at the distance of a hundred yards busily engaged with the soundingline  on receiving this piece of information stanley ran the canoe on the beach and said to his follower  oolibuck i have been thinking much about that river which we saw yesterday off the mouth of this one and i cannot help fearing that the ship will run into it instead of into this for the land is very deceptive  me tink dat is true answered the esquimau with a look of grave perplexity  if de ship go into dat rivr he tink we no arrive and so he go way and we all starve  nay oolibuck i trust that such would not be the sad result of the ship failing to find us but in order to prevent this if possible i intend to send you down to the coast with a few days provisions to keep a lookout for the ship and light a fire if you see her so that she may be guided to the right place  so get a blanket and your gun as fast as you can and be off  i can only afford you four days provisions oolibuck so you will have to prove yourself a good hunter else youll starve  will four days provisions do  oolibucks eyes disappeared  we do not mean to say that they flew away or were annihilated  but oolibuck was fatso fat that when he laughed his eyes reduced themselves into two little lines surrounded by wrinkles a result which was caused by a physical incapacity to open the mouth and eyes at the same time  as a general rule when oolibucks mouth was open his eyes were shut and when his eyes were open his mouth was shut  being a goodhumoured fellow and of a risible nature the alternations were frequent  it was the idea of stanley doubting the sufficiency of four days provisions that closed the eyes of the esquimau on the present occasion  two days grub more dan nuff said oolibuck  give me plenty powder and shot and me no starveno fear  very well rejoined stanley laughing take as much ammunition as you require but be careful of it if the ship fails us we shall need it all  and dont be too eager after the deer oolibuck keep a sharp lookout seaward be on the hilltops as much as you can and keep your eyes open  oolibuck replied by closing the said eyes with a smile as he hurried towards the tent to prepare for his expedition  in the meantime stanley directed oostesimow and la roche to set about building a small canoe out of the birch bark which they had carried with them for the purpose the large canoes being too cumbrous for the purpose of overhauling the nets  the nets had been set by gaspard in the usual waythat is with stones attached to the lower lines to act as sinkers and floats attached to the upper lines to keep them spread and it was with no little impatience that the party in the camp awaited the issue  indeed they scarcely permitted an hour to pass without an inspection being ordered but to their chagrin instead of finding fish they found the nets rolled up by the conflicting currents of the river and the tide into the form of two ropes  this will never do cried stanley as they brought the nets ashore we must set stakenets immediately  it is nearly low tide now so if we work hard they may be ready to set up before the tide has risen much  in pursuance of this plan stanley and his men went to the ravine of which mention has been already made and proceeded to cut stakes for the nets while oolibuck having explained to mrs stanley and edith that he was going to look hout for de ship shouldered his wallet and gun and ascending the ravine speedily gained the first terrace of the mountains along which he hastened in the direction of the seacoast  while the party in the camp were thus engaged frank morton and bryan instituted a thorough investigation of the country that lay directly in the rear of the camp in the course of which investigation they made sundry interesting discoveries  after ascending the ravine in which we left stanley and his men cutting stakes for the nets frank and bryan reached the first terrace and proceeded along it in the opposite direction from that pursued by oolibuck  a walk of a quarter of a mile or less brought them to another ravine into which they turned and the first thing that greeted them as they pushed their way through the stunted willows that thickly covered this gorge in the mountains was a covey of ptarmigan  these birds are similar in form and size to ordinary grouse perhaps a little smaller  in winter they are pure whiteso white that it is difficult to detect them amid the snow but in summer their coats become brown though there are a few of the pure white feathers left which never change their colour  being unaccustomed to the sight of man they stood gazing at frank and bryan in mute surprise until the latter hastily threw forward his gun when they wisely took to flight  but frank arrested his followers arm  dont waste your powder and shot bryan on such small game  there may be something more worthy of a shot among the mountains and if you once raise the echoes among these wild cliffs i fear the game will not wait to inquire the cause thereof  maybe not sir replied bryan as he fell back a pace and permitted frank to lead the way but theres an ould proverb that says a bird in the hands worth two in the buss an ive great belaif in that same  very true bryan there is much wisdom in old proverbs but there are exceptions to every rule and this is a case in point as you will admit if you cast your eyes over yonder valley and observe the edge of the mountaintop that cuts so clear a line against the sky  frank pointed as he spoke to the shoulder or spur of one of the mountains which rose at a considerable distance in the interior and from which they were separated by a dark glen or gorge for none of the ravines in this part of the country merited the name of valley save that through which flowed the caniapuscaw river  the ravine up which they had been toiling for some time led into this darksome glen and it was on rounding a bold precipice which had hitherto concealed it from view that franks quick eye caught sight of the object to which he directed the attention of his companion  tis a crow said bryan after a gaze of five minutes during which he had gone through a variety of strange contortionsscrewing up his features shading his eyes with his hand standing on tiptoe although there was nothing to look over and stooping low with a hand on each knee though there was nothing to look under in the vain hope to increase by these means his power of vision  frank regarded him with a quiet smile as he said look again bryan saw you ever a crow with antlers  anthlers exclaimed the irishman once more wrinkling up his expressive face and peering under his palm anthlers say you  sorra a thing duv i see xcept a black spot on the sky  if ye see anthlers on it yere nothin more nor less than a walkin spyglass  nevertheless i see them bryan and they grace the head of a noble buck  now you see it is well you did not fire at the ptarmigan  away with you lad down into that ravine and clamber up the mountain through yonder gap with the fallen rock in the middle of itdye see and wait there lest the deer should turn back  in the meantime ill run round by the way we came and descend to the waters edge to receive him when he arrives there  now dont lose yourself and take care not to fire at smaller game  as frank concluded these orders which he issued in a quick low voice he threw his gun into the hollow of his left arm and strode rapidly away leaving his companion gazing after him with an expression of blank stupidity on his face  gradually his cheeks and brow were overspread with a thousand wrinkles and a smile took possession of his lips  dont lose yersilf  faix master frank yere free an aisy  arrah now bryan dear dont lose yersilf you thats crossed the salt saes an followed the red injins to the prairie and hunted in the rocky mountains and found yer way to ungavanot to mintion havin comed oraginally from ould irelandwhich ov itsilf secures ye agin mistakes of every kind whatsumdiver  lose yersilf  musha but ye had better git some wan to look after ye bryan boy  take care now go softly and kape yer eyes open for fear ye lose yersilf  as bryan mumbled forth this bantering soliloquy he lifted up a large bag which contained a couple of fishinglines and a few hooks and throwing it across the stock of his gun and both across his shoulder he took his way down the rugged but wellbeaten deerpath which led to the ravine or glen  the idea of losing himself seemed to have taken such a hold of bryans mind and afforded him so much amusement and such scope for the continued flow of bantering soliloquy to which he was in truth much addicted that he failed to note the fact that he was walking along the edge of a steep declivity at the foot of which lay a small dark sheet of water which was connected by a short river or strait with a larger lake whose wavelets rippled at the base of the mountain beyond  the scene was magnificently wild and lonely and would have riveted the attention and excited the admiration of any one less absent than bryan  high rugged and to all appearance inaccessible mountains surrounded the vale on all sides and although there were several outlets from it these were so concealed by the peculiar formation of the wild mountains that they could not be seen until they were actually entered  had bryans eyes been more active he would have seen that the fringe of bushes by the side of the deertrack along which he walked concealed a declivity so steep that it almost merited the name of a precipice  but bryan was lost in philosophic contemplation and the first thing that awakened him to the fact was the slipping of a stone which caused him to trip and fall headlong over the bank  the irishman grasped convulsively at the bushes to arrest his fall but the impetus with which he had commenced the descent tore them from his grasp and after one or two unpleasant bounds and a good deal of crashing through shrubs that tore his garments sadly he found himself stretched at full length on the margin of the river that connected the two lakes  so nearly had he been hurled into this strait by the violence of his descent that his head was hanging over the bank ere he stopped  being partially stunned by the fall bryan lay for a few seconds motionless  as his shaken faculties returned however he became aware of the fact that a fish of fully two feet long lay at the bottom of the pool over which his head hung  starting up and totally forgetting his bruises he turned to look for the bag containing the fishinglines and observing it lying on the ground not far distant still wrapped round the gun he ran to pick it up  oh wow poor thing he exclaimed on lifting up his gun which though fortunately not broken was sadly bent yere fit for nothin but shootin round the corner now  its well for you bryan ye spalpeen that your backbone is not in the same fix  while he thus muttered to himself bryan drew from the bag a stout codline to which he fastened a hook of deadly dimensions and dressed it into the form of a fly much in the same manner as was formerly done by la roche  this line and fly he fastened to the end of a short stout pole which he cut from a neighbouring tree and approaching cautiously to the bank of the straitfor there was too little motion in it to entitle it to be called a streamhe cast the fly with a violent splash into the water  the violence was unintentionalat least the exclamations of reproach that followed the cast would lead us to suppose so  the fish here were as tame as those caught in deer river  in a few seconds the fly was swallowed and bryan applying main force to the pole tossed a beautiful trout of about two pounds weight over his head  och ye purty crature exclaimed the delighted irishman rubbing his hands with glee as he gazed at the fish after having unhooked it shure yell make a beautiful fagure in the kittle this night  an musha theres wan o yer relations to kape ye company he added as exerting an enormous degree of unnecessary force he drew another trout violently from the water  the second trout was larger than the first and bryan soon became so excited in the sport that he totally forgot franks orders and the deer and everything else in the world for the time being  having caught six or seven trout varying from two to four pounds in weight he changed his position a little and made a cast over a deep pool nearer to the large lake  as heretofore the fly was engulfed the instant it fell on the water but bryan did not as heretofore haul the fish violently out of its native element  it is true he attempted to do so but the attempt proved utterly futile moreover the fish darted with such velocity and strength towards the lake that the angler albeit entirely ignorant of his art experienced an inward conviction that the thick cord would snap altogether if not eased of the enormous strain  he therefore followed the fish at the top of his speed uttering incomprehensible sounds of mingled rage and amazement as he went and tripping over rocks and bushes in his headlong career  after a smart run of half a minute the fish stopped turned and darted back so rapidly that bryan tripped in turning and fell into the water  the place was shallow but having fallen on his back he was thoroughly drenched from head to foot  he did not lose the grasp of his rod however  spluttering and gasping and dripping he followed the fish in its wild career until it turned again at a tangent and darted towards the bank on which he stood  there was a shelving bed of pebbles where the water shoaled very gradually  bryan saw this availing himself of the fishs impetus and putting all his force to the rod he dragged it into two inches of water when the line broke instantly the fish struggled towards deep water but it was so large and the place to which it had been dragged so shallow that it afforded the excited angler time to rush forward and throw himself bodily on the top of it  the battle that now ensued was of an energetic and deadly character on the part of both man and fish  those who have not grasped a live salmon in their arms have no conception of the strength of a fish and perhaps it may be said with equal truth that those who have never wielded a forehammer have but a faint conception of the strength of a blacksmiths knuckles  bryan had thrown his whole weight on the fish and grasped it as with a vice in both hands but at every struggle of its powerful frame he felt how uncertain was the hold he had of its slippery body once it almost escaped and dashed the spray over its adversarys face with its tail as it wriggled out of his grasp but with a desperate plunge bryan seized it by the head and succeeded in thrusting his thumb under its gill and choking it while himself was wellnigh choked at the same moment by unintentionally swallowing a gulp of the muddy compound which they had stirred up in their struggles  slowly and with caution bryan rose on one knee while he crushed the fish against the bottom with both hands then making a last exertion he hurled it up the bank where it fell beyond all hope of return to its native element  the fish thus captured was a beautiful trout of about twenty pounds weight  the lake trout of north america are some of them of enormous size being not unfrequently taken of sixty pounds weight so that as a specimen of those inhabiting these lakes this was by no means a large one  nevertheless it was a splendid fish and certainly the largest that had ever been captured by the worthy son of vulcan  the thick coat of liquid mud with which his face was covered could not entirely conceal the smile of intense satisfaction with which he regarded his prize as he sat down on the bank before it  kape quiet now honey he exclaimed as the trout made a last fluttering attempt to escape kape quiet  have patience darlint its o no manner o use to hurry natur  just lie still an itll be soon over  with this consolatory remark bryan patted the fish on the head and proceeded to wring the water from his upper garments after which he repaired his broken tackle and resumed his sport with an eagerness and zest that cold and water and mud could not diminish in the smallest degree    chapter seventeen  successes and encouragementbryan lost and found  it was evening before the tide began to fall and uncover the stakenets which were eagerly and earnestly watched by those who had remained in the camp  mrs stanley and edith were seated on an empty box by the margin of the sandy bay mr stanley sat on a nailkeg beside them la roche and the indian were still working at the small canoe a few yards from the tent and gaspard with folded arms and an unusual smile of good humour playing on his countenance stood close behind stanley  none of the hunting and exploring parties had returned although the sun had long since disappeared behind the mountains and the mellow light of evening was deepening over the bay  theres a tail sir said gaspard as he hurried towards the net  so it is cried stanley leaping up  come along eda and take the first fish  edith needed no second invitation but bounded towards the edge of the water which was now gradually leaving the nets  gaspard had already disengaged a white fish from the mesh and wading to the beach gave it to the little girl who ran with it joyously to her mother  meanwhile another and another fish was left by the tide and stanley soon after brought up a splendid salmon of about twentyfive pounds weight and laid it at ediths feet  oh how very beautiful cried the child as she gazed in delight at the silvery scales of the fish  my mind is much relieved by this jessie said stanley reseating himself on the keg while oostesimow and la roche carried the fish ashore as gaspard freed them from the nets  i now see that there are plenty of fish in the river and if the hunters bring in a good report tonight our anxiety on the score of food will be quite removed  although none of the party had ever set a net on stakes before they had frequently heard of this manner of fishing and their first attempt proved eminently successful  at low tide stakes had been driven into the sand extending from the edge of the water towards highwater mark on these the nets had been spread and thus the misfortune which had attended the setting of the nets with floats and sinkers was avoided the quantity of fish taken gave promise of an ample supply for the future  there were two hearnesalmon that is spotted like trout and one large common salmon besides thirty whitefish averaging between two to six pounds weight each all of which were in excellent condition the whitefish is of the salmon species but white in the flesh and being less rich than the salmon is much preferred by those who have to use it constantly as an article of food  this is a most fortunate supply remarked stanley and will prevent the necessity of putting the men on short allowance  short allowance exclaimed his wife i thought we had more than enough of food to last us till the arrival of the ship  ay so we have  but until now i did not feel at liberty to use it for if through any accident the ship does not come and if there had chanced to be no fish in the river the only course open to us would be to retrace our steps and as that would be a long and slow process we would require to economise our food  in fact i had resolved to begin operations by putting the men on short allowance but this haul of fish shows me that we shall have more than enough  but who comes here he added on observing the figure of a man approaching the camp  he seems to carry a burden on his back as far as i can make out in the uncertain light  did any of the men go out alone inquired mrs stanley  no but i suppose that this one must have separated from his comrade hallo who goes there  the man tossed the bundle from his shoulders and hastening forward revealed the flushed countenance of frank morton  what  frank why man you seem to have had a hard day of it if i may judge by your looks  not so hard but that a good supper will put its effects to flight replied frank as he rested his gun against a rock and seated himself on the keg from which stanley had risen  the fact is i have slain a noble buck and being desirous that the men should have as much of it as possible i loaded myself rather heavily  the ground too is horribly bad but pray send gaspard for the bundle  i should have been here sooner but for the time required to dissect the animal  where is bryan frank inquired mrs stanley  you went away together  bryan  i know not  he and i parted in the mountains some hours ago and as he failed to keep his appointment with me i concluded that he must have become footsore and returned to camp  he has not returned said stanley but i have no fear for the honest blacksmith  hes too old a norwester to lose himself and hes too tough to kill  but come frank let us to our tent  i see that la roche has already prepared our salmon for the kettle and so  salmon interrupted frank  ay lad salmon a twentyfive pounder too  but come change your footgear and then we shall have our supper in the course of which we shall exchange news  as they proceeded towards the camp the voices of some of the men were heard in the distance it was now too dark to see them  in a few minutes francois followed by augustus and maistequan strode into the circle of light around the fire and laying aside their guns proceeded to light their pipes while they replied to the questions of frank and stanley  you do not come emptyhanded remarked the latter as francois and his comrades threw down several fat ducks and a few grouse which after the fashion of hunters they had carried pendent by the necks from their belts  we only shot a few monsieur replied francois to put in the kettle for supper  we might have loaded a canoe had we chosen  that is well said stanley but the kettle is full already and supper prepared  see frank has shot a deer so that we shall fare well tonightah prince come along  what more game he added as dick and massan entered the halo of light and threw down the choice morsels of a fat deer which they had killed among the mountains  ah oui monsieur said massan chuckling as he laid aside his axe and gun we might ha killed three o them if we had been so minded but we couldnt ha brought them into camp an as dick said tis a pity to kill deer to feed the wolves with  right exclaimed frank but did any of you see bryan  he gave me the slip in the mountains and i fear has lost himself  to this the men replied in the negative and some of them smiled at the idea of the blacksmith being lost  no fear vraiment  he no lost cried la roche with a laugh as he lifted the huge kettle from the fire and placed it in the midst of the men having previously abstracted the best portions for the special benefit of his master  no fear of bryan certainment he like one bad shillinghe come up toujours  ah mauvais chien him give me all de trouble ov get supper ready mylone  i trust it may be so said stanley  we are all here except him and oolibuck whom i have sent to the coast for a few days to watch for the ship  but let us have supper la roche and spread ours nearer the fire tonightit is rather cold besides i want to hear the reports of the men  in compliance with this order the lively frenchman spread the supper for his masters family close beside that of the men and in a few minutes more a most vigorous attack was made on the viands during the first part of which the hungry travellers maintained unbroken silence but as the cravings of nature began to be satisfied their tongues found time to remark on the excellence of the fare  the salmon was superb even edith who seldom talked about what she ate pronounced it very good  the whitefish were better than any of the party had ever eaten in their lives although most of them had travelled over the length and breadth of the north american wilderness  the ducks were perfect  even the ptarmigan were declared passable and the venison with an inch of fat on the hauncheswords were not found sufficiently expressive to describe it  those who are philosophically inclined may suspect that some of this superexcellence lay in the keen appetites of the men well perhaps it did  while the travellers were in the midst of this and ere yet their tongues were fairly loosened a loud unearthly shout rang with appalling reverberations among the surrounding cliffs causing the entire party to start up and rush for their arms  again the cry was heard  ah bad skran to ye loshhould on moses ye fat villain  lave me wan mouthful jist wan to kape me from givin up the ghost intirely  a shout of laughter greeted the advent of bryans voice but it was nothing to the peals that burst forth on the appearance of that individual in propria persona  to say that he was totally dishevelled would convey but half the truth  besides being covered and clotted with mud he was saturated with water from head to foot his clothes rent in a most distressing manner and his features quite undistinguishable  why bryan what ails you  where have you been inquired stanley in a tone of sympathy  bin is it  sorra wan o me knows where ive bin  its mysilf is glad to be sartin im here anyhow  im glad youre certain of it said frank for if it were not for the sound of your voice i should doubt it  ah monsieur said la roche make your mind easy on dat  no von but bryan ever regard de kettle dat way  taizy voo ye petit varmint said bryan approaching the said kettle and smiling rapturously through the mud that encrusted his face on beholding its contents  without waiting to change his garments the hungry blacksmith began supper having first however directed attention to the bag which he had brought in  from this bag la roche now extracted about a dozen trout some of which were of great size especially one whose bulk exceeded that of the large salmon  theres plinty more where thim comed from said bryan through a mouthful of venison but ill tell ye ov it afther supper  ah true dont let us interrupt him just now said stanley  in the meantime francois since you seem to be about done tell us what you have seen and let us hear what you have to say of the country  francois having lighted his pipe cleared his throat and began  well monsieur after we had paddled a short bit beyond the point below the last rapid in caniapuscaw river we shoved the canoe ashore and landed prince and massan who set off to look for game leavin augustus maistequan and me to paddle up the river as well as we could  but we soon found that three men in a big canoe could not make much way agin the strong current of the river so we put ashore again and took to our legs  after making a long tramp up the banks o the river we fell in with some goodsized pines but although they are big for this part of the country they are not big enough for building  then we pushed into the gullies which are sheltered from the cold winds off the bay and here we found the trees a good deal bigger  there are pines and larch in abundance and some of the larch are even bigger than we require  are they far inland inquired stanley  no monsieur they are only a few hundred yards from the banks of the river and growin on the edge of a small creek which i noticed is deep enough to float them down  good very good said stanley filling his pipe with a fresh charge of tobacco that is most fortunate for it will save time and take fewer men to bring them here  go on francois  bien monsieur  then i felled one or two o the trees to see what like they are and i found that they are very tough and good  the pines are firmer and tougher than any i ever saw in the indian country owing i suppose to their stunted growth  while i was thus employed augustus shot the grouse we brought home and we saw a great many coveys of them in fact we might have shot many more but as we did not know how far we should have to walk we thought it best not to burden ourselves too much  we also saw a great many ducks and shot a few as you see  did you see goose inquired la roche whose mind had a natural tendency to culinary matters  no replied francois i saw no geese but i did not go out of my way to look for them  i was more taken up with the timber than replenishing the kettle  ah that ver great pity  oui grand dommage  de kittle toujours de most importance ting on de voyage  if you forget him you goot for noting  mais francois did you look into the deep clear pool at de foot of de rapid  francois emitted a cloud of smoke with a negative in the middle of it  an said la roche with a sigh i thought not mais it was pity  you see one goose for certain if you have look straight down into dat pool  bien continued francois turning to stanley  i then went into one or two more gullies and saw some more sticks fit for building but after all it is only in the gullies they grow and there are not very many  the trees on the banks of the river are chiefly pines and only fit for firewood  and an important item is firewood as we shall find ere long remarked stanley  your account of the timber is very satisfactory francois did you see traces of indians or esquimaux  no i saw none  perhaps you did prince continued stanley turning to that worthy who was stretched along with massan at full length before the blaze and had been listening attentively to the conversation while he solaced himself with his pipe  yes sir we seed the marks they left behind them answered prince while he glanced towards massan as if to invite him to give the desired information  ay we saw their marks no doubt said the guide knocking the ashes out of his pipe and raising himself from his reclining posture to that of a tailor the more conveniently to recharge that beloved implement ay we saw their marks and they was by no means pleasant to look on after we had landed above the pint as francois told ye dick prince and me went up one o the gullies an then gettin on one o them flat places that run along the face of all the mountains hereabouts we pushed straight up the river  we had not gone far when on turnin a pint we both clapped eyes at the same moment on the most illlookin blackguard of a wolf i ever saw  up went both our guns at once and i believe we were very near puttin a bullet in each of his eyes when we noticed that these same eyes were not bookin at us but starin most awful earnest like up a gully in the mountains so we looked up an sure enough there we saw a deer on the mountaintop tossin its head and snuffin round to see that the coast was clear before it came down to the water  we noticed that a regular beaten deertrack passed down this gully and master wolf who knowed the walk very well was on the lookout for his dinner so we waited quiet till the deer came down an dick put a bullet in its heart an i put one into the wolfs head so they both tumbled down the cliffs together  the shot made another deer that we had not seen start off into the river but before it got a few yards from the shore dick loaded again and put a bullet into its head too an it was washed ashore at the pint below us  havin fixed them off comfortably we cut up the deer and put all we could carry on our shoulders for we knowed that if we left them wed find nothin but the bones when we came back  about an hour after this we came upon a deserted camp of indians  it was so fresh that we think they must have passed but a few weeks ago  the whole camp was strewed with bones of deer as if the red varmints had been havin a feast  an sure enough a little farther on we came upon the dead carcasses of ninetythree deer  the rascals had taken nothin but the tongues an titbits leavin the rest for the wolves  ay theyre a reckless improvident set remarked stanley  ive been told that the esquimaux are quite different in this respect  they never kill what they dont require but the redskins slaughter the deer by dozens for the sake of their tongues  we also found the broken head of an esquimau sealspear and this little bit of sealskin  massan handed these as he spoke to stanley  i fear said frank this looks as if they had made an attack on the esquimaux very recently  i fear it much said stanley examining the little shred of sealskin which had beautifully glossy hair on one side and on the other which was dressed there were sundry curious marks one of which bore a rude resemblance to an indian wigwam with an arrow pointing towards it  i found the bit o sealskin hanging on a bush a little apart from the place where they camped an from what ive seen o the ways o redskins its my pinion that it was put there for some purpose or other  very likelytake care of it jessie said stanley throwing it to his wife it may be explained some daywell massan did you see any other animals  yes sir lots o them  we saw deer on the hilltops and might ha shot more o them if we could have brought them into camp  an we saw porcupines in all the pine bluffs  an we saw fish in the lakes among the mountains  there are lots o them lakessmall things some o themin all the gullies and fish in most o them but we had neither lines nor hooks so we catched none  faix if ye catched none yer betters catched plinty said bryan who having concluded supper and changed his garments was now luxuriating in a smoke  the blacksmith pointed as he spoke to the bag of splendid trout which lay at a short distance from the fire  tis mysilfs the boy to catch them  i would have brought ye two times as much if it wasnt that i lost my hook and line  i think it must have bin a freshwater whale the last wan bad luck to it for it pulled me into the wather three times an wint off at last with two fathom o codline trailin behind it  so then bryan said frank it must have been the yells with which you accompanied your fishing that frightened the deer i was after and caused me to lose him  however as i got another soon afterwards which must have been frightened towards me by the same halloos i forgive you  frank now gave the party an account of what he had seen but as his experience merely corroborated that of dick prince and massan we will not trouble the reader with the details  the evidence of the various exploring parties when summed up was undoubtedly most satisfactory and while it relieved the mind of the leaders of the band it raised and cheered the spirits of the men  timber although not plentiful or very large was to be had close to the spot where they proposed to erect their fort game of all kinds swarmed in the mountains in abundance and the lakes and rivers were well stocked with excellent fish so that upon the whole they considered that they had made an auspicious commencement to their sojourn in the land of the esquimaux    chapter eighteen  outpostbuildingfort chimoan unexpected arrival which causes much joy  the band of furtraders now set earnestly about the erection of their winter dwelling  the season was so far advanced that the men could no longer be spared from the work to hunt or fish in the mountains so that they lived chiefly on the produce of the stakenets in front of the camp and a small allowance of the provisions with which they had started from moose fort  occasionally frank sallied forth and returned with the best parts of a deer on his shoulders but these excursions were rare as both he and stanley worked with the men in the erection of the fort  no one was idle for a moment from the time of rising shortly after daybreakto the time of going to rest at night  even little edith found full occupation in assisting her mother in the performance of a host of little household duties too numerous to recapitulate  the dog chimo was the only exception to the general rule he hunted the greater part of the forenoon for his own special benefit and slept when not thus occupied or received with philosophical satisfaction the caresses of his young mistress  the future fort was begun on the centre of the level patch of greensward at the foot of the flat rock by the spring where the party had originally encamped  a square was traced on the ground to indicate the stockade and within this stanley marked off an oblong patch close to the back stockade for the principal dwellinghouse facing the river  two other spaces were on either side of thisone for a store the other for a dwelling for the men  when finished the fort would thus have the form of three sides of a square surrounded by a stockade in the centre of this and the first thing that was erected was a flagstaff on which the hbchudsons bay companyflag was hoisted and saluted with three cheers as its crimson folds fluttered out in the breeze for the first time  the plan on which the houses were constructed was that on which all the dwellings of the furtraders are builtnamely a framework of timber the interstices of which are filled up with logs sliding into grooves cut in the main posts and beams  this manner of building is so simple that a house can be erected without any other instruments than an axe an auger and a large chisel and the speed with which it is put up would surprise those whose notions of housebuilding are limited to stone edifices  the axes of the woodcutters resounded among the gullies and ravines of ungava and awakened the numerous echoes of the mountains  the encampment no longer presented a green spot watered by a tiny rill but was strewn with logs in all stages of formation and chips innumerable the frameworks of the dwellinghouses began to rise from the earth presenting in their unfinished condition a bristling uncomfortable appearance suggesting thoughts in the beholders mind highly disparaging to art and deeply sympathetic with outraged nature  the tents still stood and the campfire burned but the superior proportions of the rising fort threw these entirely into the shade  a rude wharf of unbarked logs ran from the beach into the river  it had been begun and finished in a couple of days for the convenience of gaspard while visiting his nets as he sometimes did before the water left them everything in short bore evidence of the most bustling activity and persevering energy and in a few weeks from the time of their first landing the dwellinghouses were sufficiently weathertight to be habitable and the other portions of the establishment in an advanced condition  the openings between the logs of the houses were caulked with a mixture of mud and moss and left in that condition in the meantime until the pitsaw could be set to work to produce boards for the better protection of the walls without and within  the window and door frames were also made and covered temporarily with parchment until the arrival of the ship should enable them to fill the former with glass and the latter with broad panels  the effect of the parchmentcovered door however was found to be somewhat troublesome  being large and tightly covered it sounded when shut violently with a noise so strongly resembling the report of a distant cannon that during the first day after its erection the men more than once rushed down to the beach in the expectation of seeing the long and ardently wishedfor ship which was now so much beyond the time appointed for her arrival that stanley began to entertain serious apprehensions for her safety  this ship was to have sailed from york fort the principal depot of the furtraders in hudsons bay with supplies and goods for trade with the esquimaux during the year  she was expected at ungava in august and it was now september  the frost was beginning even at this early period to remind the expedition of the long winter that was at hand and in the course of a very few weeks hudsons straits would be impassable so that the anxiety of the traders was natural  just before the partitions of the chief dwellinghouse were completed stanley went to the tent in which his wife and child were busily employed in sewing  can you spare edith for a short time wife said he as his partner looked up to welcome him  yes for a short time but she is becoming so useful to me that i cannot afford to spare her long  im afraid said stanley as he took his child by the hand and led her away that i must begin to put in my claim to the services of this little baggage who seems to be so useful  what say you eda will you allow me to train you to shoot and fish and walk on snowshoes and so make a trader of you  i would like very much papa to learn to walk on snowshoes but i think the gun would hurt meit seems to kick so  dont you think i am too little to shoot a gun off  stanley laughed at the serious way in which the child received the proposal  well then we wont teach you to shoot yet eda but as you say the snowshoe walking is worth learning for if you cannot walk on the long shoes when the snow falls i fear youll not be able to leave the fort at all  yes and francois has promised to make me a pair said edith gaily and to teach me how to use them and mamma says i am old enough to learn now  is it not kind of francois  he is always very good to me  indeed it is very kind of him my pet but all the men seem to be very good to youare they not  oh yesall of them  even gaspard is kind now  he never whips chimo and he patted me on the head the other day when i met him alone in the ravinethe berry ravine you know where i go to gather berries  i wonder if there are berries in all the other ravinesbut i dont care much for there are thousands and thousands of all kinds in my own ravine andwhere are you going papa  this abrupt question was caused by her father turning into the square of the new fort in which the most of the men were at work  im going to show you our house eda and to ask you to fix on the corner you like best for your own room  the partitions are going to be put up so we must fix at once  as he spoke they passed through the open doorway of the new dwelling which was a long low building and placing his little daughter in the centre of the principal hall stanley directed her to look round and choose a corner for herself  for a few minutes edith stood with an expression of perplexity on her bright face then she began to examine the views from each of the corner windows  this could only be done by peeping through the bullethole in the parchment skins that in the meantime did duty for glass  the two windows at the back corners looked out upon the rocky platform behind which the mountains rose like a wall so they were rejected but edith lingered at one of them for from it she saw the spring at the foot of the rock with its soft bed of green moss and surrounding willowbushes from the front corner on the left hand cross island and the valley of the river beyond were visible but from the window on the right the view embraced the whole sweep of the wide river and the narrow outlet to the bay which with its frowning precipices on either side and its bold flanking mountains seemed a magnificent portal to the arctic sea  i think this is the nicest corner said edith turning with a smile to her father  then this shall be yours said stanley  but exclaimed edith as a sudden thought occurred to her perhaps frank would like this corner  i would not like to have it if frank wants it  frank doesnt want it and frank shant have it  there now run to your mother you little baggage she cant get on without you  off you go quick  with a merry laugh edith bounded through the doorway and disappeared like a sunbeam from the room  on the 25th of september stanley was standing on the beach opposite the fort watching with a smile of satisfaction the fair happy face of his daughter as she amused herself and chimo by throwing a stick into the water which the latter dutifully brought out and laid at her feet as often as it was thrown in  frank was also watching them  what shall we call the fort frank said his companion  we have a fort good hope and a fort resolution and a fort enterprise already it seems as if all the vigorous and hearty words in the english language were used up in naming the forts of the hudsons bay company  what shall we call it  chimo  chimo  chimo shouted edith to the dog as the animal bounded along the beach  both gentlemen seemed to be struck with the same idea simultaneously  theres an answer to your question said frank call the fort chimo  the very thing replied stanley i wonder it did not occur to me before  nothing could be more appropriate  i salute thee fort chimo and stanley lifted his cap to the establishment  in order that the peculiar appropriateness of the name may appear to the reader it may be as well to explain that chimo the i and o of which are sounded long is an esquimau word of salutation and is used by the natives when they meet with strangers  it signifies are you friendly by those who speak first and seems to imply we are friendly when returned as an answer  so well known is the word to the furtraders who traffic with the natives of hudsons straits that they frequently apply it to them as a name and speak of the esquimaux as chimos  it was therefore a peculiarly appropriate name for a fort which was established on the confines of these icy regions for the double purpose of entering into friendly traffic with the esquimaux and of bringing about friendly relations between them and their old enemies the muskigon indians of east main  after playing for some time beside the low wharf edith and her dog left the beach together and rambled towards a distant eminence whence could be obtained a commanding birdseye view of the new fort  she had not sat many minutes here when her eye was arrested by the appearance of an unusual object in the distance  frank who was yet engaged in conversation with stanley on the beach also noticed it  laying his hand on the arm of his companion he pointed towards the narrows where a small white triangular object was visible against the dark cliff as they gazed a second object of similar form came into view then a fore and top sail made their appearance and in another second a schooner floated slowly through the opening  ere the spectators of this silent apparition could give utterance to their joy a puff of white smoke sprang from the vessels bow and a cannonshot burst upon the mountains  leaping on from cliff to crag it awakened a crash of magnificent echoes which after prolonged repetitions died away in low mutterings like distant thunder  it was followed by a loud cheer from the schooners deck and the hbc flag was run up to the main while the union jack floated at the peak  now frank give the word cried stanley taking off his cap while the men ran down to the beach en masse  hip hip hurrah  hurrah echoed the men and a cheer arose among the cliffs that moved to the very centre the hearts of those who heard and gave it  again and again the stirring shout arose from the fort and was replied to from the schooner  it was no matter of form or cheer of ceremony there was a deep richness and a prolonged energy in the tone which proved that the feelings and lungs of the men were roused to the uttermost in its delivery  it told of long gathering anxieties swept entirely away and of deep joy at seeing friendly faces in a sterile land where lurking foes might be more likely to appear  at all times the entrance of a ship into port is a noble sight and one which touches the heart and evokes the enthusiasm of almost every human being but when the ship arriving is almost essential to the existence of those who watch her snowy sails swelling out as they urge her to the landwhen her keel is the first that has ever ploughed the waters of their distant bayand when her departure will lock them up in solitude for a long long yearsuch feelings are roused to their utmost pitch of intensity  cheer upon cheer rose and fell and rose again among the mountains of ungava  even ediths tiny voice helped to swell the enthusiastic shout and more than one cheer was choked by the rising tide of emotion that forced the tears down more than one bronzed cheek despite the iron wills that bade them not to flow    chapter nineteen  bustle and businessa great feast in which bryan and la roche are prime moversnew ideas in the art of cooking  the scene at fort chimo was more bustling and active than ever during the week that followed the arrival of the schooner  the captain told stanley as they sat sipping a glass of madeira in the hall of the new fort that he had been delayed by ice in the straits so long that the men were afraid of being set fast for the winter and were almost in a state of mutiny when they fortunately discovered the mouth of the river  as had been anticipated by stanley the ship entered false river by mistake unseen by oolibuck notwithstanding the vigilance of his lookout  fortunately he observed it as it came out of the river just at the critical period when the seamen began to threaten to take the law into their own hands if the search were continued any longer  oolibuck no sooner beheld the object of his hopes than he rushed to the top of a hill where he made a fire and sent up a column of smoke that had the immediate effect of turning the vessels head towards him  soon afterwards a boat was sent ashore and took the esquimau on board who explained in his broken english that he had been watching for them for many days and would be happy to pilot the vessel up to the fort  you may be sure continued the captain that i was too happy to give the ship in charge to the fellow who seemed to understand thoroughly what he was about  he is already quite a favourite with the men who call him oilybuss much to his own amusement and he has excited their admiration and respect by his shooting having twice on the way up shot a goose on the wing  not an unusual exhibition of skill among furtraders said stanley but i suppose your men are not much used to the gun  and now captain when must you start  the moment the cargo is landed sir replied the captain who was distinguished by that thorough selfsufficiency and prompt energy of character which seem peculiar to seacaptains in general  we may have trouble in getting out of the straits and after getting to quebec i am bound to carry a cargo of timber to england  i will do my best to help you captain  your coming has relieved my mind from a load of anxiety and one good turn deserves another so ill make my fellows work night and day till your ship is discharged  stanley was true to his word  not only did the men work almost without intermission but he and frank morton scarce allowed themselves an hours repose during the time that the work was going on  night and day yo heave ho of the jack tars rang over the water and the party on shore ran to and fro from the beach to the store with bales kegs barrels and boxes on their shoulders  there were blankets and guns and axes and knives powder and shot and beads and awls and nets and twine  there were kettles of every sort and size cloth of every hue capotes of all dimensions and minute etceteras without end so that had it been possible to prevail on the spirits of the ice to carry to the esquimaux intelligence of the riches contained in the store at chimo an overwhelming flood of visitors would speedily have descended on that establishment  but no such messengers could be foundalthough bryan asserted positively that more than wan o them had been seen by him since his arrival so the traders had nothing for it but to summon patience to their aid and bide their time  when the work of discharging was completed and while stanley and the captain were standing on the beach watching the removal of the last boatload to the store the former said to the latter now captain i have a favour to request which is that you and your two mates will dine with me tomorrow  your men will be the better of a days rest after such a long spell of hard work  you could not well get away till the evening of tomorrow at any rate on account of the tide and it will be safer and more pleasant to start early on the day after  i shall be most happy replied the captain heartily  thats right said stanley  dinner will be ready by four oclock precisely and give my compliments to your crew and say that my men will expect them all to dinner at the same hour  ten minutes after this stanley entered his private apartment in the fort which under the tasteful management of his wife was beginning to look elegant and comfortable  wife said he i will order la roche to send you a box of raisins and an unlimited supply of flour butter etcetera wherewith you will be so kind as to make or cause to be madeon pain of my utmost displeasure in the event of failurea plumpudding large enough to fill the largest sized washingtub and another of about quarter that size both to be ready boiled by four tomorrow afternoon  sir your commands shall be obeyed  i suppose you intend to regale the sailors before they leave  is it not so  you have guessed rightly for once and take care that you dont let eda drown herself in the compost before it is tied up  i must hasten to prepare the men  two minutes later and stanley stood in the midst of his men who having finished their days work were now busy with supper in their new house into which they had but recently moved  lads said stanley you have stuck to your work so hard of late that i think it a pity to allow you to fall into lazy habits again  i expect you all to be up by break of day tomorrow  och musha sighed bryan as he laid down his knife and fork with a look of consternation  i have invited the ships crew continued stanley to dine with you before they leave us  as the larder is low just now youll all have to take to the hills for a fresh supply  make your arrangements as you please but see that there is no lack of venison and fish  ill guarantee the pudding and grog  so saying he turned and left the house followed by a tremendous cheer  oh parbleu vat shall i do said la roche with a look of affected despair  i am most dead for vant of sleep already  cest impossible to cook pour everybody demain  i vill be sure to fall sleep over de fire prehaps fall into him  och losh losh when will ye larn to think nothin o yoursilf  yell only have to cook for the bourgeois but think o me  all the min an the ships crew to boot  the blacksmith concluded by knocking la roches pipe out of his mouth in the excess of his glee at the prospective feast after which he begged his pardon solemnly in bad french and ducked his head to avoid the tin can that was hurled at it by the indignant frenchman  at the first streak of dawn the following morning and long before the sun looked down into the ravines of ungava massan and dick prince were seen to issue with noiseless steps from the fort with their guns on their shoulders and betake themselves to the mountains  half an hour later bryan staggered out of the house with a bag on his shoulder scarcely half awake rubbing his eyes and muttering to himself in a low tone as he plunged rather than walked into the ravine which led to the first terrace on the mountain  when the sun rose over the mountaintops and looked down upon the calm surface of the river there was not a man remaining in the fort with the exception of stanley and frank and their active servant la roche  a deep calm rested on the whole scene  the sailors of the vessel having risen to dispatch breakfast retired to their hammocks again and went to sleep stanley frank and their household were busy within doors chimo snored in the sunshine at the front of the fort and the schooner floated on a sheet of water so placid that every spar and delicate rope was clearly reflected  nothing was heard save the soft ripple on the shore the distant murmur of mountain streams and once or twice through the day the faint reverberation of a fowlingpiece  but as the day advanced evidences of the approaching feast began to be apparent  early in the forenoon massan and prince returned with heavy loads of venison on their shoulders and an hour later bryan staggered into the fort bending under the weight of a wellfilled bag of fish  he had been at his favourite fishing quarters in the dark valley and was dripping wet from head to foot having fallen as usual into the water bryan had a happy facility in falling into the water that was quite unaccountableand rather enviable in warm weather  as the cooking operations were conducted on an extensive scale a fire was kindled in the open air in the rear of the mens house round which fire in the course of the forenoon bryan and la roche performed feats of agility so extravagant and apparently so superhuman that they seemed to involve an element of wickedness from their very intensity  of course no large dinner ever passed through the ordeal of being cooked without some accidents or misfortunes more or less  even in civilised life where the most intricate appliances are brought to bear on the operation by artistes thoroughly acquainted with their profession infallibility is not found  it would be unjust therefore to expect that two backwoodsmen should be perfectly successful especially when it is remembered that their branch of the noble science was what might be technically termed plain cookery the present being their first attempt in the higher branches  their first difficulty arose from the larger of the two plumpuddings which la roche had compounded under the directions of mrs stanley and the superintendence of edith  i say losh cried bryan to his companion whose head was at the moment hid from view in a cloud of steam that ascended from a large pot over which he bent apparently muttering incantations  vell fat you want  faix and its just fat that i dont want said bryan pointing as he spoke to the large pudding which being much too large for the kettle was standing on the rim thereof like the white ball of foam that caps a tankard of double x  its more nor twice too fat already  the kittle wont hould it no how  oh stuff him down dat is de way suggested la roche  stuff it down avic an whats to come o the wather said bryan  ah true dat is perplexible vraiment  at this moment the large pot boiled over and a cloud of scalding steam engulfed the sympathetic frenchman causing him to yell with mingled pain and rage as he bounded backwards  musha but yell come to an early death losh if ye dont be more careful o yer driedup body  taisez vous donc muttered his companion half angrily  taisin ye avic sorra wan o mes taisin ye  but since ye cant help me out o me throubles ill try to help mysilf  in pursuance of this noble resolve bryan went to the store and fetched from thence another large tin kettle  he then undid the covering of the unwieldy pudding which he cut into two equal parts and having squeezed them into two balls tied them up in the cloth which he divided for the purpose and put them into the separate kettles with the air of a man who had overcome a great difficulty by dint of unfathomable wisdom  it was found however that the smaller pudding intended for stanleys table was also too large for its kettle but the energetic blacksmith whose genius was now thoroughly aroused overcame this difficulty by cutting off several pounds of it and transferring the pudding thus reduced to the kettle saying in an undertone as he did so theres more nor enough for the six o ye yit av yer only raisonable in yer appetites  but the superfluity of the pudding thus caused became now a new source of trouble to bryan  whats to be done wid it losh  i dont like to give it to the dogs an its too small intirely to make a dumplin of  you better heat him raw suggested la roche  faix an ive half a mind to but it would spile my dinner  hallo look out for the vainison losh  ah oui oh misere cried la roche springing over the fire and giving a turn to the splendid haunch of venison which depended from a wooden tripod in front of the blaze and having been neglected for a few minutes was beginning to singe  what have ye in the pot there inquired bryan  von goose two duck trois plovre et von leetle birdi not know de name ofput him in pour experiment  very good losh out wid the goose and well cram the bit o dumplin into him for stuffin  ah superb excellent cried la roche laughing as he lifted out the goose into which bryan thrust the mass of superfluous pudding after which the hole was tied up and the bird reconsigned to the pot  everything connected with this dinner was strikingly suggestive of the circumstances under which it was given  the superabundance of venison and wildfowl the cooking done in the open air the absence of women and the performance of work usually allotted to them by bronzed and stalwart voyageurs the wild scenery in the midst of which it took place and the mixture of irish english french indian esquimau and compound tones that fell upon the ear as the busy work went onall tended to fill the mind with a feeling of wild romance and to suggest powerfully the idea of being if we may so express it far far away as the proceedings advanced towards completion this feeling was rather increased than removed  tables and chairs were a luxury that still remained to be introduced at fort chimo when the men found leisure from more urgent duties to construct them  therefore the diningtable in stanleys hall was composed of three large packingcases turned bottom up  there was no cloth wherewith to cover its rough boards but this was a matter of little importance to the company which assembled round it punctually at the hour of four  in place of chairs there were good substantial nailkegs rather low it is true and uncommonly hard but not to be despised under the circumstances  owing to the unusual demand for dishes the pewter plates and spoons and tin drinkingcupsfor they had little crockerywere of every form and size that the store contained and the floor on which it all stood was the beaten ground for the intended plank flooring was still growing in the mountain glens  but if the equipage was homely and rude the fare was choice and abundant and an odour that might have gladdened the heart of an epicure greeted the nostrils of the captain and his two mates when they entered the hall dressed in blue surtouts with bright brass buttons white duck trousers and richly flowered vests waistcoats  there was a splendid salmon of twenty pounds weight at one end of the board and beside it on the same dish a laketrout of equal size and beauty  at the other end smoked a haunch of venison covered with at least an inch of fat and beside it a bowl of excellent cranberry jam the handiwork of the hostess  a boiled goose and peasepudding completed the catalogue afterwards these gave place to the pudding which had caused bryan so much perplexity and several dishes of raisins and figs  last but not least there was a bottle of brandy and two of port wine which along with the raisins and figs formed part of the limited supply of luxuries furnished by the hudsons bay company to stanley in common with all the gentlemen in the service in order to enable them now and then on great occasions to recall through the medium of a feast the remembrance of civilised life  the display in the mens house was precisely similar to that in the hall  but the table was larger and the viands more abundant  the raisins and figs too were wanting and instead of wine or brandy there was a small supply of rum  it was necessarily small being the gift of stanley out of his own diminutive store which could not even if desired be replenished until the return of the ship next autumn  on the arrival of the guests a strange contrast was presented  the sailors in white ducks blue jackets with brass buttons striped shirts pumps and straw hats landed at the appointed hour and in hearty goodhumour swaggered towards the mens house where they were politely received by the quiet manlylooking voyageurs who in honour of the occasion had put on their best capotes their brightest belts their gayest garters and most highlyornamented moccasins  the french canadians and halfbreeds bowed shook hands and addressed the tars as messieurs  the sailors laughed slapped their entertainers on the shoulders and called them messmates  the indians stood grave and silent but with looks of goodhumour in the background while the esquimaux raised their fat cheeks totally shut up their eyes and grinned perpetually not to say horribly from ear to ear  but the babel that followed is beyond the powers of description therefore we wont attempt it  here however the characteristic peculiarity of our scene ceases  the actual demolition of food is pretty much the same among all nations that are not absolutely savage and however much contrast might have been observed in the strange mixture of human beings assembled under the hospitable roof of fort chimo there was none whatever in the manner in which they demolished their viands  as the evening advanced a message was sent to monsieur stanley for the loan of his violin  ay said he as the instrument was delivered to bryan who happened to be the messenger and also the performeray i thought it would come to that ere long  dont be too hard on the strings lad  twill be a rough ball where there are no women  thrue yer honour replied the blacksmith as he received the instrument theres a great want of faymales in thim parts but the sailors have consinted to ripresint the purty craytures on the present occasion which is but right for ye see the most o thims shorter nor us an their wide breeches are more like the pitticoats than our leggins  many were the stories that were told and retold believed disbelieved and doubted on that memorable night and loud were the songs and long and strong the dancing that followed  but it was all achieved under the influence of pure animal spirits for the rum supplied afforded but a thimbleful to each  the consequence was that there were no headaches the following morning and the men were up by break of day as fresh and light as larks  a feeling of sadness however gradually crept over the band as the dawn advanced and the schooner prepared for her departure  by six oclock the floodtide turned and a few minutes later all the sailors were aboard hoisting the sails and anchor while the men stood silently on the beach where they had just parted from their guests  goodbye once more mr stanley goodbye mr morton said the captain as he stepped into his boat  i wish you a pleasant winter and a good trade  thank you thank you captain replied stanley and dont forget us out here in this lonely place when you drink the health of absent friends at christmas time  in a few minutes the anchor was up and the schooner bending round with a fair wind and tide made for the narrows  give them a cheer lads said frank  obedient to the command the men doffed their caps and raised their voices but there was little vigour in the cheer  it was replied to from the schooners deck  just as the flyingjib passed the point a gun was fired which once more awakened the loud echoes of the place  when the smoke cleared away the schooner was gone  thus was severed the last link that bound the civilised world to the inhabitants of fort chimo    chapter twenty  winter approachesesquimaux arriveeffect of a worda sucking baby prospects of trade  for many days after the ships departure the work of completing the fort went forward with the utmost rapidity and not until the houses and stores were rendered weathertight and warm did stanley consider it advisable to send out hunting and fishing parties into the mountains now however the frosts continued a great part of the day as well as during the night so it was high time to kill deer and fish in order to freeze and so preserve them for winters consumption  up to this time no further traces of esquimaux had been discovered and stanley began to express his fears to frank that they had left the neighbourhood altogether in consequence of the repeated attacks made upon them by indians  soon after this however the furtraders were surprised by a sudden visit from a party of these denizens of the north  it happened on the afternoon of a beautiful day towards the close of autumn that charming but brief season which in consequence of its unbroken serenity has been styled the indian summer  the men had all been dispatched into the mountains in various directions some to fish others to shoot and none were left at the fort except its commandant with his wife and child and oolibuck the esquimau  stanley was seated on a stone at the margin of the bay admiring the vivid alterations of light and shade as the sun dipped behind the mountains of the opposite shore when his eye was attracted towards one or two objects on the water near the narrows  presently they advanced and were followed by several others  in a few minutes he perceived that they were esquimau canoes  jumping hastily up stanley ran to the fort and bidding his wife and child keep out of sight put two pair of pistols in his pockets and returned to the beach where he found oolibuck gazing at the approaching flotilla with intense eagerness  well oolibuck here come your countrymen at last said stanley  do they look friendly think you  me no can tell they most too quiet replied the interpreter  esquimaux in general are extremely noisy and full of animated gesticulation on meeting with strangers especially when they meet on decidedly friendly terms  the silence therefore maintained by the natives as they advanced was looked upon as a bad sign  the fleet consisted of nine kayaks and three large oomiaks full of women and children and a curious appearance they presented at a distance for the low kayaks of the men being almost invisible it seemed as if their occupants were actually seated on the water  the oomiaks being much higher were clearly visible  on coming to within a quarter of a mile of the fort the men halted to allow the women to come up then forming in a crescent in front of the oomiaks the whole flotilla advanced slowly towards the beach  when within a hundred yards or so stanley said now oolibuck give them a hail  chimo  chimo  chimooo shouted the interpreter  the word acted like a talisman  chimo yelled the esquimaux in reply and the kayaks shot like arrows upon the sand while the women followed as fast as they could  in another minute a loud chattering and a brisk shaking of hands was taking place on shore  the natives were dressed in the sealskin garments with which arctic travellers have made us all more or less acquainted  they were stout burly fellows with fat oily and bearded faces  now tell them oolibuck the reason of our coming here said stanley  oolibuck instantly began by explaining to them that they had come for the purpose of bringing about peace and friendship between them and the indians on hearing which the esquimaux danced and shouted for nearly a minute with joy  but when the interpreter went on to say that they intended to remain altogether among them for the purpose of trading their delight knew no bounds they danced and jumped and whooped and yelled tossed up their arms and legs and lay down on the sand and rolled in ecstasy  in the midst of all this mrs stanley rushed out of the house followed by edith in great terror at the unearthly sounds that had reached her ears but on seeing her husband and oolibuck laughing in the midst of the grotesque group her fears vanished and she stood an amused spectator of the scene  meanwhile stanley went down and stepped into the midst of one of the oomiaks with a few beads and trinkets in his hands and while oolibuck entertained the men on shore he presented gifts to the women who received them with the most childish demonstrations of joy  there was something irresistibly comic in the childlike simplicity of these poor natives  instead of the stiff reserve and haughty demeanour of their indian neighbours they danced and sang and leaped and roared embraced each other and wept with the most reckless indifference to appearances and seemed upon all occasions to give instant vent to the feelings that happened to be uppermost in their minds  as stanley continued to distribute his gifts the women crowded out of the other oomiaks into the one in which he stood until they nearly sank it some of them extending their arms for beads others giving a jolt to the hoods on their backs which had the effect of bringing to light fat greasyfaced little babies who were pointed to as being peculiarly worthy of attention  at length stanley broke from them and leaped ashore where he was soon followed by the entire band  but here new objectsnamely mrs stanley and edithattracted their wondering attention  approaching towards the former they began timidly to examine her dress which was indeed very different from theirs and calculated to awaken curiosity and surprise the esquimau women were dressed very much like the mennamely in long shirts of sealskin or deerskin with the hair on short breeches of the same material and long sealskin boots  the hoods of the women were larger than those of the men and their boots much more capacious and while the latter had a short stump of a tail or peak hanging from the hinder part of their shirts the women wore their tails so long that they trailed along the ground as they walked  in some cases these tails were four and six inches broad with a round flap at the end and fringed with ermine  it was therefore with no little surprise that they found mrs stanley entirely destitute of a tail and observed that she wore her upper garment so long that it reached the ground  becoming gradually more familiar on seeing that the strange woman permitted them to handle her pretty freely one of them gently lifted up her gown to see whether or not she wore boots but receiving a somewhat prompt repulse she began to caress her and assured her that she did not mean to give offence  by this time frank and some of the men had joined the group on the shore and as it was getting late stanley commanded silence  tell them i have somewhat to say to them oolibuck  the interpreters remark instantly produced a dead silence  now ask them if they are glad to hear that we are going to stay to trade with them  a vociferous jabbering followed the question which by oolibucks interpretation meant that their joy was utterly inexpressible  have they been long on the coast  no they had just arrived and were on their way up the river to obtain wood for building their kayaks  did they see the bundle of presents we left for them at the coast  yes they had seen it but not knowing whom it was intended for they had not touched it  on being told that the presents were intended for them the poor creatures put on a look of intense chagrin which however passed away when it was suggested to them that they might take the gifts on their return to the coast  and now said stanley in conclusion tis getting late  go down to the point below the fort and encamp there for the night  we thank you for your visit and will return it in the morning  goodnight  on this being translated the esquimaux gave a general yell of assent and immediately retired bounding and shouting and leaping as they went looking in their gleesome rotundity like the infant progeny of a race of giants  i like the look of these men very much said stanley as he walked up to the house with frank  their genuine trustfulness is a fine trait in their character  no doubt of it replied frank  there is much truth in the proverb evil dreaders are evil doers  those who fear no evil intend none had they been indians now we should have had more trouble with them  i doubt it not frank  you would have been pleased to witness the prompt alacrity with which the poor creatures answered to our cry of chimo and ran their kayaks fearlessly ashore although for all they knew to the contrary the rocks might have concealed a hundred enemies  and yet said frank with an air of perplexity the esquimau character seems to me a difficult problem to solve  when we read the works of arctic voyagers we find that one mans experience of the esquimaux proves them to be inveterate thieves and liars while another speaks of them as an honest truthful peopleand that too being said of the same tribe  nay further i have read of a tribe being all that is good and amiable at one time and all that is bad and vile at another  now the conduct of these goodnatured fellows in reference to the bundle of trinkets we left at the mouth of the river indicates a degree of honesty that is almost too sensitive for the merest exertion of commonsense would show that a bundle hung up in an exposed place to public view must be for the public good  nevertheless they seem both honest and friendly returned stanley and i trust that our experience of them may never change  tomorrow i shall give them some good advice in regard to procuring furs and show them the wealth of our trading store  when the morrow came the visit of the esquimaux was returned by the entire force of fort chimo and the childish delight with which they were received was most amusing  the childishness however was only applicable to these natives when expressing their strong feelings  in other respects particularly in their physical actions they were most manly and the thick black beards and moustaches that clothed the chins of most of the men seemed very much the reverse of infantine  the children were so exactly like to their parents in costume that they seemed miniature representations of them  in fact were a child viewed through a magnifying glass it would become a man and were a man viewed through a diminishing glass he would become a childalways of course excepting the beard  bryan became a special favourite with the natives when it was discovered that he was a worker in iron and the presents with which he was overwhelmed were of a most extraordinary and in some cases perplexing nature  one man who seemed determined to get into his good graces offered him a choice morsel of broiled seal  no thankee lad said bryan ive had my brickfust  supposing that the broiling had something to do with the blacksmiths objection the esquimau hastily cut off a slice of the raw blubber and tendered it to him  dye think im a haythen said bryan turning away in disgust  ah try it bryan cried la roche turning from an esquimau baby in the contemplation of which he had been absorbedtry it tis ver goot i sure you  ver goot for your complaint bryan  but come here vitementjust regardez dat hinfant  come here queek  thus urged bryan broke away from his host who had just split open the shinbone of a deer and offered him the raw marrow but without success and going towards la roche regarded the baby in question it was a remarkably fine child seemingly about ten months old with a round rosy oily face coalblack hair and large round coalblack eyes with which it returned the stare of the two men with interest but that which amused the visitors most was a lump of fat or blubber with a skewer thrust through it which its mother had given to the child to suck and which it was endeavouring to thrust down its throat with both hands  come here oolibuck pourquoi is de stick  ho ho ho laughed oolibuck  dat is for keep de chile quiet and de stick is for no let him choke him no can swallow de stick  musha but it would stick av he did swallow it said bryan turning away with a laugh  in the course of the day stanley and frank conducted the natives to the fort and having given them all an excellent dinner and a few gifts of needles scissors and knives led them to the store where the goods for trade were ranged temptingly on shelves round the walls  a counter encompassed a space around the entrancedoor within which the natives stood and gazed on wealth which to their unsophisticated minds seemed a dream of enchantment  having given them time to imbibe a conception of the room and its treasures stanley addressed them through the interpreter but as reference to this worthy individual is somewhat hampering we will discard him forthwithretaining his style and language however for the benefit of his fellowcountrymen  now you see what useful things i have got here for you but i cannot give them to you for nothing  they cost us much and give us much trouble to bring them here  but i will give them for skins and furs and oil and the tusks of the walrus and when you go to your friends on the seacoast you can tell them to bring skins with them when they come  ye vill do vat you vish  ye most happy you come  ye vill hunt very mush and make your house empty of all dese tings if ye can  thats well  and now i am in need of boots for my men and you have a good many i see so if you can spare some of these we will begin to trade at once  on hearing this the natives dispatched several of their number down to the camp who soon returned laden with boots  these boots are most useful articles  they are neatly made of sealskin the feet or soles being of walrus hide and perfectly waterproof  they are invaluable to those who have to walk much in icecold water or among moist snow as is the case in those regions during spring and autumn  in winter the frost completely does away with all moisture so that the indian moccasin is better at that season than the esquimau boot  for these boots and a few articles of native clothing stanley paid the natives at the rates of the regular tariff throughout the country and this rate was so much beyond the poor esquimau estimate of the relative value of boots and goods that they would gladly have given all the boots and coats they possessed for what they received as the value of one pair  overjoyed at their good fortune and laden with treasure they returned to their camp to feast and to sing the praises of the kublunat as they termed the furtraders    chapter twenty one  silent conversationraw foodfemale tailsa terrible battle terminated by the interposition of a giant  of all the people at fort chimo no one was more interested in the esquimaux than little edith  she not only went fearlessly among them and bestowed upon them every trinket she possessed but in her childlike desire for the companionship and sympathy of human beings of her own age and sex she took forcible possession of two little girls who happened to be cleaner and therefore prettier than the others and led them away to her own ravine where she introduced them to her favourite berries and to her dog chimo  at first the dog did not seem to relish the intrusion of these new favourites but seeing that they did not induce his mistress to caress him less than before he considerately tolerated them  besides the esquimaux had brought their dogs along with them and chimo being of an amicable disposition had entered into social fellowship with his own kind  we have said that chimo was sagacious and it is quite possible he may have felt the propriety of granting to edith that liberty which he undoubtedly claimed for himself  but ediths intercourse with her little esquimau protegees was necessarily confined to looksthe language of the eye making up for the absence of that of the tongue  there were many things however in which language was not required as a medium of communication between the children  when the berries were good the brightening eyes and smacking lips spoke a language common to all the human race  so also when the berries were sour or bitter the expression of their faces was peculiarly emphatic  the joyous shout too as they discovered a new scene that pleased their eyes while they roved hand in hand through the ravines or the shrinking glance of fear as they found themselves unexpectedly on the edge of a precipice was sufficiently intelligible to the trio  the little friends presented a striking and grotesque contrast  it would have been difficult to say whether the little esquimaux were boys or girls  if anything the costume seemed more to indicate the former than the latter  like their mothers they wore loose deerskin shirts with the hair on the outside which gave them a round soft burly appearancean appearance which was increased by their little boots which were outrageously wide and quite as long as their legs  the frocks or shirts had hoods and tails which latter according to fashion were so long that they trailed on the ground  the inconvenience of the tail is so great that the women while travelling on a journey get rid of it by drawing it between their legs and lifting up the end fastening it in front to a button sewed to their frock for the purpose  in travelling therefore esquimau women seem to be destitute of this appendage but on arriving at camp they undo the fastening and walk about with flowing tails behind them  ediths costume consisted of a short frock made of dark blue cloth and a headdress peculiar to the indian women among the crees  it was preferred by the little wearer to all other styles of bonnet on account of the ease with which it could be thrown off and on  she also wore ornamented leggings and moccasins  altogether with her graceful figure flaxen curls and picturesque costume she presented a strong contrast to the fat dark hairy little creatures who followed her by brook and bush and precipice the livelong day  one morning about two weeks after the arrival of the esquimaux edith went down to the camp after breakfast and found her two companions engaged in concluding their morning meal  the elder whose name was arnalooa was peering with earnest scrutiny into the depths of a marrowbone from which she had already extracted a large proportion of the raw material  the younger okatook seized a lump of raw seals flesh as edith entered their hut and cutting therefrom a savoury morsel put it into her mouth as she rose to welcome her visitor  oh how can you said edith with a look of disgust at this ravenous conduct on the part of her friend  but edith had said oh how can you and oh shocking and oh why dont you give up eating it raw and oh why wont you have it cooked nearly every day for the last two weeks without producing any other effect than a gleeful laugh from the little esquimaux for although they did not comprehend her words they clearly understood her looks of disapproval  but although they would not give up the habit of eating raw flesh which they had been accustomed to from their infancy they were prevailed on so far to break through the habits of their people as to wash their hands and faces before going out to play  this they did because edith positively refused to go with them unless they did so  lifting up the end of her tail and wiping her mouth therewith arnalooa smiled at ediths look of reproach and ran laughing towards the shore where she and okatook washed their hands after which they followed edith and chimo to their favourite ravine  although she knew that they did not understand a word of what she said edith invariably kept up a running fire of small talk in reference chiefly to the objects of nature by which they were surrounded  to this the little hairy creatures listened intently with smiling faces and sometimes they laughed prodigiously as though they understood what was said so that their companion felt as if she were really conversing with them although she was sadly perplexed at the utter impossibility of obtaining an intelligible reply to a question when she chanced to put one  oh what a lovely glen cried edith her eyes beaming with delight as on turning the point of a projecting crag she and her companions found themselves in a spot which they had not before seen during their rambles  it was a wild savage gorge full of fallen rocks hemmed in with high cliffs fringed here and there with willows and mosses among which were a few brilliant wildflowers  the lights and shadows of the spot were thrown into powerful contrast by a gleam of sunshine which flashed down among the rugged masses lighting up peaks and sharp edges in some spots while in others they were thrown into the profoundest gloom  oh is it not a delightful place cried edith as she bounded up the rugged path followed by chimo while the two esquimau girls buttoned up their tails and followed her as fast as their more cumbrous habiliments would permit  for a quarter of an hour the party toiled up the steep ascent pausing now and then to pluck a flower or to look back on the wild path by which they had come until they reached a ridge of rock beyond which lay a small lake or pool  so dark and still did it lie within the shadow of the overhanging cliffs that it resembled a pool of ink  here the adventurous explorers sat down to recover breath and to gaze in childish delight not unmixed with awe at the wild scene around them  the peculiar wildness of the spot seemed to exercise an unusual influence over the dog for instead of lying down as it was wont to do at the feet of its young mistress it moved about uneasily and once or twice uttered a low growl  come here chimo said edith when these symptoms of restlessness had attracted her attention what is the matter with you my dear dog surely you are not frightened at the appearance of this wild place speak dog see arnalooa is laughing at you  edith might have said with more propriety that arnalooa was laughing at herself for the little esquimau was much amused at the serious manner in which her kublunat friend spoke to her dog  but chimo refused to be comforted  he raised his snout snuffed the air once or twice and then descending the gorge a short distance put his nose close to the ground and trotted away  that is very odd of chimo said edith looking into arnalooas face with an expression of perplexity  as she spoke okatook pointed with an eager glance up the ravine turning her eyes hastily in the direction indicated edith beheld a deer bounding towards them  it was closely followed by a savage wolf  the deer seemed to be in the last stage of exhaustion  its flanks were wet with moisture its eyes starting from their sockets and its breath issued forth in deep sobs as it bounded onwards seemingly more by the force of its impetus than by any voluntary exertion  more intent on the danger behind than on that which lay before it the deer made straight for the pass in which the three girls stood and scarcely had they time to spring to the sides of the cliff when it swept by like an arrow instantly after and ere it had taken two bounds past them the wolf sprang forward caught it by the throat and dragged it to the ground where in a few seconds it worried the noble animal to death  it is probable that the chase now terminated had begun at early dawn that day for deer being fleeter than wolves they prolong the chase until overcome by the superior strength and dogged perseverance of their ravenous enemies  over mountain and hill they had bounded along together through glen and gorge across river and lake bursting headlong through bush and brake or under the shadow of frowning cliffs and toiling at a foot pace and with panting sides up the steep hills in the fierce blaze of the sun the one impelled by hunger the other by fear until at length the scene closed in the wild pass almost at the feet of the three children  but retribution was in store for the savage destroyer  ere yet the lifes blood had teased to flow from the throat of the dying deer and while the wolfs fangs were still dripping with its gore a fierce bark followed by a terrific growl rang among the cliffs and chimo with his ears laid back and his formidable row of teeth exposed rushed up the gorge and seized the wolf by the neck  thus assailed the wolf returned the bite with interest and immediately a fight of the most energetic character ensued  the wolf was much larger and more powerful than chimo but was greatly exhausted by its long chase while the dog was fresh and vigorous  once or twice chimo tossed his huge adversary by main strength but as often he was overturned and dreadfully shaken while the long fangs of the wolf met in his neck and mingled the blood of the deer which bespattered his black muzzle with the lifes blood that began to flow copiously from chimos veins  at this moment a shout was heard farther up the ravine  the three girls turned hastily and saw on a point of rock which projected from the mountain side and overhung the dark pool the figure of a man of such immense proportions that they instinctively shrank back with terror  the position in which he stood made him appear larger than he really was  the scattered gleams and slant rays of sunshine that played around the spot invested him as with a supernatural halo while a bright glow of light on the cliff behind detached him prominently from the surrounding shadows  he poised a spear in his right hand and while edith gazed at him in terror the weapon flew whistling through the air and was buried in the side of the wolf  but so close did the spear pass that edith involuntarily stepped back as she heard it whiz  in doing so she lost her balance and fell over the cliff  fortunately arnalooa caught her by the dress and partially broke her fall but the descent was sufficiently steep and rugged to render the child insensible  when edith recovered consciousness her first emotion was that of terror on beholding a large darkbearded face bending over her but a second glance showed her that the eyes of the stranger gazed upon her with a look of tenderness and that arnalooa and okatook were kneeling beside her with an expression of anxiety  had anything further been wanting to allay her fears the sight of chimo would have done it  it is true the sturdy dog panted heavily and occasionally licked his wounds as he sat on his haunches at her feet but he was wonderfully calm and collected after his recent mortal conflict and regarded his young mistress from time to time with an air of patronising assurance  as edith opened her eyes the stranger muttered some unintelligible words and rising hastily went to a neighbouring spring at which he filled a rude cup with water  in doing this he revealed the huge proportions of the gigantic esquimau whom we introduced to our reader in a former chapter  he was dressed in the same manner as when we first saw him but his face was somewhat altered and his black eyebrows were marked by that peculiar curve which is expressive of deep melancholy returning quickly from the spring he kneeled beside the little girl and raising her head on his broad hand held the goblet to her lips  thank you said edith faintly as she swallowed a few drops i think i had better go home  is chimo safe  chimo  she started up as the recollection of the fight with the wolf flashed upon her but the fall had stunned her rather severely and scarcely had she risen to her feet when she staggered and fell back into the arms of the esquimau  seeing that she was quite unable to walk he raised her in his powerful arm as if she had been a young lamb  catching the dead wolf by the neck as he passed and springing from rock to rock with catlike agility he bore his burden down the ravine and strode towards the fort under the guidance of okatook and arnalooa    chapter twenty two  maximusdeer spearinga surprisingly bad shotcharacter of the natives  hallo what have we here exclaimed stanley starting from his seat in amazement as the giant entered the hall of fort chimohis left hand grasping a bloodstained wolf by the throat and edith resting in his right arm  at first the startled father imagined his child must have been wounded if not killed by the savage animal but his mind was immediately relieved on this point by edith herself who was no sooner laid on her bed than she recovered sufficiently to narrate the circumstances attending her fall  well maximus said stanley returning to the hall and applying to the bulky savage the term that seemed most appropriate to him shake hands with me my good fellow  youve saved chimos life it seems and thats a good turn ill not forget  but a  i see you dont understand a word i say  hallo  moses moses you deaf rascal come here he shouted as that worthy passed the window  yis mossue said moses entering the hall  oh me what a walrus am dis  me do blieve him most high as a tree an more broader nor iveryting  hold thy tongue moses and ask the fellow where he came from but tell him first that im obliged to him for saving chimo from that villainous wolf  while moses interpreted arnalooa and okatook being privileged members of the tribe crossed over to ediths room  well what says he inquired stanley at the end of a long address which the giant had delivered to moses  him say he heered we have come to trade from eskeemo to westard and so him come for to see us  a most excellent reason said stanley  has he brought any furs  yis him brought one two fox and two tree deer  no have much furs in dis country him say  sorry to hear that  perhaps his opinion may change when he sees the inside of our store  but i would like him to stay about the fort as a hunter moses he seems a firstrate man  ask him if he will consent to stay for a time  praps he fussrate praps not muttered moses in a disparaging tone as he turned to put the question  him say yis  very good then take him to your house moses and give him some food and a pipe and teach him english as fast as you can and see that it is grammatical  dye hear  yis mossue me quite sure for to teach him dat  as moses turned to quit the hall stanley called him back  ask maximus bythebye if he knows anything of a party of esquimaux who seem to have been attacked not long ago by indians in this neighbourhood  no sooner was this question put than the face of maximus which had worn a placid smiling expression during the foregoing conversation totally changed  his brows lowered and his lips were tightly compressed as he regarded stanley for a few moments ere he ventured to reply  then in a deep earnest tone he related the attack the slaughter of his people their subsequent escape and the loss of his bride  even moses was agitated as he went on and showed his teeth like an enraged mastiff when the esquimau came to speak of his irreparable loss  stay one moment said stanley when maximus concluded  i have something to show you and hastening into his room he quickly returned with the little piece of sealskin that had been found at the deserted indian camp  do you know anything of this maximus  do you understand these marks  the esquimau uttered a cry of surprise when his eye fell on the piece of skin and he seemed much agitated while he put several quick earnest questions to moses who replied as earnestly and quickly then turning rapidly on his heel he sprang through the doorway and was soon lost to view in the stunted woods of the ravine above the fort  that fellow seems in a hurry exclaimed frank morton entering the room just as the savage made his exit  who is he and wherefore in so great haste  as to who he is answered stanley ill tell you that after moses has explained the cause of his sudden flight  he say that hims wife make dat skin and de arrow on him skin show dat de injuns take her to deir tents  but did you not tell him that we found the skin long ago and that the indians must be far far away by this timenobody knows where demanded frank  yis me tell him  but he go for to see de spot  tink him find more tings praps  oh messieurs voila shouted la roche pointing towards the river as he rushed breathless with haste into the hall les esquimaux dem kill all de deer dans le kontry  oui voila dans les kayak  two dozen at voncevraiment  without waiting a reply the excited frenchman turned round and rushed out of the house followed by stanley and frank who seized their guns which always hung ready loaded on the walls of the apartment  on reaching the waters edge the scene that met their eye was indeed sufficient to account for the excitement of la roche  a herd of perhaps fifty or sixty deer on their way to the coast and ignorant of the foes who had so recently invaded their solitudes had descended the ravine opposite the fort with the intention of crossing the river  the esquimaux had perceived this and keeping themselves and their kayaks concealed until most of the animals were in the water and the leaders of the herd more than twothirds over they then gave chase and getting between the deer and the opposite shore cut off their retreat and drove them towards their encampment  here the slaughter commenced and stanley and frank arrived at the scene of action while they were in the midst of the wholesale destruction  in all directions the kayaks with their solitary occupants were darting about hither and thither like arrows in the midst of the affrighted animals none of which however were speared until they were driven quite close to the shore  in their terror the deer endeavoured to escape by swimming in different directions but the long doublebladed paddles of the esquimaux sent the light kayaks after them like lightning and a sharp prick on their flanks turned them in the right direction  there were so many deer however that a few succeeded in gaining the land but here the guns of the traders awaited them  in the midst of this wild scene franks attention was arrested by the cool proceedings of an esquimau whose name was chacooto  he had several times exhibited a degree of shrewdness beyond his fellows during his residence near the fort and was evidently a man of importance in the tribe  chacooto had collected together a band of the herd amounting to fifteen and by dint of cool decision and quick movements had driven them to within a few yards of the shore exactly opposite the spot whereon his tent stood  one young buck of about two years old darted away from the rest more than once but with a sweep of the paddle and a prick of the lance chacooto turned it back again while a quiet sarcastic smile played on his countenance  having driven the herd close enough in for his purpose the esquimau ended the career of the refractory buck with a single thrust of his lance and then proceeded coolly to stab them all one after another  och the spalpeen said a voice at franks ear  tis himsilf knows how to do it an no mistake  musha his lance goes out and in like a thailors needle an he niver strikes more nor wance the haythen  he certainly does know how to do it bryan replied frank and its a comfort to know that every thrust kills in a moment  i like to see as little of the appearance of cruelty as possible in work of this kind  arrah theres wan thatll chate im anyhow cried bryan throwing forward his gun in nervous haste as one of the deer gained the land despite chacootos rapidity and bounded towards the hills  frank smiled at the eager haste of his companion who was one of the poor shots of the party and consequently always in a hurry  now bryan theres a chance  take your time  just behind the shoulder a little low for that gun kicks horribly  murder and blazes she wont go off cried the exasperated irishman as after a wavering effort to take aim he essayed unsuccessfully to pull the trigger  halfcock man  cock it said frank quickly  so tis be the mortial  och bryan yer too cliver ye are he exclaimed rectifying his error with a force that nearly tore off the doghead  at that instant there was a sharp crack and the deer bounding into the air fell dead on the sand at the edge of the willows  forgive me bryan said massan chuckling and reloading his piece as he walked up to his comrade  i would not ha takent out o yer teeth lad if ye had been ready but one bound more would ha put the beast beyond the reach o a bullet  faix massan ye desarve to be hanged for murther  shure i was waitin till the poor crayture got into the bushes to give it a chance o its life before i fired  thats the way that gintlemen from the ould country does when were out sportin  we always put up the birds first and fire afterwards but you salvages murther a poor brute on the sand whin its only two fathoms from ye  shame on ye massan  see massan cried frank pointing to another deer which having escaped its pursuers had gained the heights above  that fellow is beyond us both i fear  be ready when it comes into view beyond the cliff there  but massan did not move and when frank threw forward his gun he felt his arm arrested  pardon me monsieur said massan respectfully theres a sure bullet about to start for that deer  as he spoke he pointed to dick prince who ignorant of the fact that the deer had been seen by frank was watching its reappearance from behind a neighbouring rock at some distance from where they stood  in a second it came into viewthe bullet spedand the deer bounded lightly into the bushes evidently unhurt  it is difficult to say whether dick prince or his comrades exhibited most amazement in their looks at this result  that the crack shot of the partythe man who could hit a button in the centre at a hundred yards and cut the head off a partridge at a hundred and fiftyshould miss a deer at ninety yards was utterly incomprehensible  is it yer own gun yeve got inquired bryan as the discomfited marksman walked up  no its yours replied prince  a smile which resolved itself into a myriad of wrinkles flitted over the blacksmiths face as he said  ah prince yell requare long practice to come to the parfect use o that wipon  ive always fired three yards at laste to the left iver since we fell over the hill togither  if its a very long shot it requares four to take the baste in the flank or four an a half if ye want to hit the shoulder besides an allowance o two feet above its head to make up for the twist i gave it the other day in the forge in tryin to put it right  this explanation was satisfactory to all parties especially so to prince who felt that his credit was saved and if prince had a weakness at all it was upon this point  the deer were now all killed with the exception of those of the band that had been last in entering the river  these with a few stragglers had returned to the shore from which they started  the remainder of the evening was devoted to skinning and cutting up the carcassesan operation requiring considerable time skill and labour  while the people at the fort were thus employed maximus who adopted at once the name given to him by stanley returned from his fruitless journey to the indian camp and assisted the men at their work  he made no allusion whatever to his visit to the deserted indian camp but from the settled expression of deep sadness that clouded his countenance it was inferred that what he had seen there had not tended to raise his hopes  the supply of deer obtained at this time was very seasonable for the frost had now begun to set in so steadily that the meat could be hung up to freeze and thus be kept fresh for winters consumption  some of it however was dried and stored away in bales while a small quantity was pounded after being dried made into pemmican and reserved for future journeys  as for the esquimaux they gave themselves up during the first night to feasting and rejoicing  during the short time that they had been at the fort they had converted the promontory on which they were encamped into a scene of the utmost confusion and filth  a regard for truth constrains us to say that although these poor creatures turned out to be honest and simple and kindhearted they did not by any means turn out to be cleanly quite the reverse  they had erected four summer tents on the beach which were composed of skins sewed together and supported on poles in such a way as to afford ample room for the accommodation of their families  the entrance to each tent was through a passage which was also made of skins hung over a line fastened to a pole at the distance of twelve or fifteen feet from the tent  each side of this entrance was lined with piles of provisionsseals fish ducks and venison in various stages of decay which rendered the passage into the interior a trying operation  true it was intended that the frost should prevent this decay but unfortunately the frost did not always do its duty  the manner in which they cut up their deer and prepared them for future use was curious  after cutting the animals into two without skinning them they pinned up the front half with the heart and liver in the cavity the other half they treated in a similar way minus the heart and liver and then put them out to freeze until required  when frozen they were frequently used in their tents as seats until the gradual diminution of the larder demanded that they should be appropriated to their proper use  the tribe of esquimaux who resided near fort chimo at this time were possessed of an enormous stone kettle in which they boiled an entire deer at one time and while the good people luxuriated on the flesh of the animal in their tents the dogs assembled round the boiler to await the cooling of the soupthus verifying the assertion formerly made by massan on that head  the dogs resembled those of the newfoundland breed in some respects but were scarcely so large or goodlooking and had erect instead of pendent ears  there were about a dozen of them and it was wonderful to observe the patience with which they sat in a circle round the kettle gazing earnestly at the soup licking their chaps the while in anticipation of the feast  the successful hunt was regarded as worthy of being specially celebrated by the distribution of a glass of grog to the men and also to the esquimaux for at the time we write of the hudsons bay company had not yet instituted the wise and humane regulation which has since become a standing order throughout all parts of the country except where there is oppositionnamely that ardent spirits shall not be given to the natives  however stanleys natural disposition led him to be very circumspect in giving spirits to the men and natives and the supply now issued was very small  in the men it produced a desire for the violin and created a tendency to sing and tell stories  in the esquimaux it produced at first dislike and afterwards wild excitement which in the case of chacooto ended in a desire to fight  but his comrades assisted by his wives overpowered him tied him in a sack made of sealskin and left him to roar and kick till he fell asleep  the honesty of these natives was exhibited very strikingly in all their dealings with the furtraders  although iron tools of every description were scattered about the fort while the men were engaged in erecting the several buildings not one was missed and even the useless nails and scraps of metal that were thrown away when they were found by chance by the esquimaux were always brought to the house and the question asked were they of any use before being appropriated  they were great beggars however which was not surprising considering the value of the articles possessed by the traders and their own limited means of purchasing them  their chief wealth at this time lay in boots and deerskins which the women were constantly employed in preparing but stanley urged them to go into the interior and hunt as although deerskins and boots were useful furs were infinitely more valuable but the esquimaux had much too lively a dread of the indians to venture away from the coast and seemed inclined to hang about the place in comparative idleness much longer than was desirable    chapter twenty three  more arrivalshonestyindians come upon the scenethe tribes reconcileddisease and death change the aspect of thingsphilosophic discourse  a day or two after the successful deerhunt above related several bands of esquimaux arrived at fort chimo and encamped beside their comrades this unusual influx of visitors soon exhausted the venison that had been procured but hunting parties were constantly on the alert and as game of all kinds was plentiful they lived in the midst of abundance  to all of these stanley made small presents of beads and tobacco and recommended them strongly to go and hunt for furs  but they seemed to like their quarters and refused to move  the new arrivals along with those who had first come formed a band of about three hundred and were found almost without exception to be a quiet inoffensive and honest people  as a proof of this latter quality we may mention a circumstance that occurred a few days after the arrival of the last band  being desirous of taking some additional soundings stanley launched his boat by the help of the esquimaux for his own men were all absent hunting and fishing  the boat referred to had been sent to the fort in the ship and was a most useful and acceptable gift from the governor of the fur company to the gentleman in charge of ungava  stanley hoisted his sails and prepared to run down the river but ere he had advanced a hundred yards he was startled by a burst of loud cries from the shore and looking back he observed the whole band of natives pouring like a torrent into the fort  his heart leaped within him as he thought of his unprotected wife and child  turning the boat towards the shore he ran it on the beach and leaving it with all the sails standing he rushed into the square of the fort forcing his way through the crush of natives whose vociferous talking rendered what they said for a time unintelligible  at length moses forced his way through the crowd followed by one of the natives who led a large dog by a line fastened round its neck  whats the matter moses whats wrong cried stanley  oh noting at all replied moses casting a look of pity at his countrymen  dem are great gooses  die man here wid de dog him say dat de childn was play in de square of dis fort an one o dem trow stone and broke a window  it was de son ob dis man what do it an him say he most awful sorryan all de people sorry so dey bring de dog to pay for de broken window  im glad its nothing worse cried stanley much relieved  tell them im happy to find they are sorry and i hope they will keep the children out of the square in future but i dont want the dog  it was an accident and not worth making such a noise about  the esquimaux however would not agree to look upon this accident as a light matter  they said truly that glass was not to be got so easily as the iceblocks with which they formed windows to their own winter houses so they insisted on the dog being accepted and at length stanley gave in but took care that the native who gave it should not be a loser in consequence of his honesty  moreover stanley begged of them to send up several of their best dogs saying that he would purchase them as he was in want of a team for hauling the winter firewood  next day while stanley was engaged in the trading store with a party of esquimaux he was surprised by hearing a volley of musketry fired at the back of the fort  snatching up a loaded gun as he ran hastily out he found that the shots had been fired by a band of indians as a salute to the fort on their arrival  this was the first time that indians had made their appearance since the arrival of the furtraders and their advent at the present time was most fortunate as it afforded stanley an opportunity of commencing his negotiations as peacemaker in the presence of a considerable band of both parties  the indians fifteen in number were all clothed with the exception of their chief in deerskin hunting shirts ornamented moccasins of the same material and cloth leggings  they wore no headdress but their long straight black hair was decorated with feathers and small metallic ornaments among which were several silver thimbles  their powderhorns and shotpouches were gaily ornamented with bead and quill work and they were all armed with long guns on which they leaned as they stood silently in a picturesque group on the flat rocky platform above the spring which has been more than once alluded to  this platform overlooked the fort and was a favourite promenade of the traders  at present it formed a sort of neutral ground on which the indians took their stand  the red men were overawed by the very superior number of the esquimaux and felt that they were safe only so long as they stood on the flat rock which was the only path leading to the ravine through which if need be they could easily escape into the mountains  the chief of the indians unlike his fellows was dressed in a costume of the most grotesque and brilliant character and certainly one which however much it might raise the admiration of his savage companions did not add to his dignity in the eyes of the traders  he wore a long bright scarlet coat richly embroidered with gold lace with large cuffs and gilt buttons a pair of blue cloth trousers and a vest of the same material a broad worsted sash and a hat in the form of the ordinary beaver or silk hat of europe  the material however was very coarse but this was made up for by the silver and gilt cords and tassels with which it was profusely decorated  he evidently felt his own importance and stood with a calm dignified gaze waiting to be addressed  hailing maistequan who leaned on the axe with which he had been cutting firewood when the volley of the indians arrested him stanley bade him invite them to enter the fort  we cannot come down replied the chief after maistequan had given the invitation  the eskimos are in numbers like the stars we are few if the palefaces are our friends let them come up here and take us by the hand and bring us down  very reasonable said stanley to frank who stood beside him we must take care that the esquimaux do not take advantage of their numbers to avenge their ancient wrongs  then turning to the natives who had now crowded in large numbers into the fort stanley addressed them in a serious tone told them that the time had now come when he hoped to reconcile the innuit and the allat esquimau name for indians together and that he expected they would show their gratitude for his many kindnesses to them by treating the indians who were his friends with hospitality  the esquimaux promised obedience after which stanley ascended to the promenade and taking the indian chief by the hand led him towards the fort followed by the whole band in single file  it is not necessary to detail the speeches that followed on both sides on this occasion and the eloquence that was expended that evening in the cause of peace  suffice it to say that the indians and esquimaux shook hands and exchanged gifts in the presence of the assembled garrison of fort chimo  but although the traders had reason to congratulate themselves on having so far succeeded in the establishment of peace they could not conceal from themselves the fact that while on the one hand the esquimaux appeared to be perfectly sincere and cordial in their professions on the other hand the indians evinced a good deal of taciturnity at first and even after their reserve was overcome seemed to act as men do who are constrained to the performance of a distasteful action  in general character the indians of labrador do not contrast well with the esquimauxat least this may with truth be said of those who afterwards became attached to the district of ungava  the indian is reserved and taciturn while the esquimau is candid frank and communicative  of course there are exceptions on both sides  on the evening of the same day stanley had much difficulty in overcoming the reserve of the indians so as to procure information regarding the interior and it was not until their hearts were opened by the influence of tobacco that they condescended to give the required information  this was to the effect that there were not many furbearing animals in the immediate vicinity of ungava but that there were a good many in the wooded country lying to the southward and eastward  here however the indians do not care to hunt preferring rather to keep to the heights of land and near the coast where the deer are numerous  in fact stanley afterwards found that the facility with which the indians procured deer in this part of the country was a serious drawback to the fur trade as they contented themselves with trapping just enough of otters foxes etcetera to enable them to procure a supply of ammunition with which to hunt the deer  the indians had brought a few beaver and other furs to trade and after receiving a good meal and a few presents they took up their quarters on a plot of ground close to the fort  here they lived a short time in perfect friendship with the esquimaux visiting them and hunting in company but more than once they exhibited their natural disposition by stealing the goods of their neighbours  on one occasion two esquimau children were missed from the camp and in the course of the day they returned to their parents clothed in indian costume  this was a very polite piece of attention on the part of the indians but the effect of it was much marred the same day by the abstraction of a knife from an esquimau tent  stanley insisted on the article being restored and severely reprimanded the offender  but although the general harmony of the camp was sometimes broken by such events the friendship between the two parties seemed to be gradually increasing and stanley saw with satisfaction that the allat and the innuit bade fair to become fast friends for the future  but an event occurred at this time which put an end to their intercourse and very much altered the aspect of affairs  for some time past the men at the fort had been subject to rather severe attacks of cold or a species of influenza  this they unfortunately communicated to the esquimaux who seemed to be peculiarly susceptible of the disease  being very fat and fullblooded it had the most dreadful effect on the poor creatures and at a certain stage almost choked them at last one night it was reported that ten of their number had died from absolute suffocation  all of these had been strong and robust and they died after two days illness  one of those who were attacked was ediths little friend arnalooa and just before the ten esquimaux died edith had gone down to the camp with a present of beads to console her  she found her much better and after talking to her for some time she took her leave promising to pay her another visit next day  true to her promise edith sallied forth after breakfast with a little native basket on her arm  about half an hour afterwards while stanley was sitting in the hall with his wife and frank they were startled by the sudden appearance of edith out of breath from the speed with which she had run home and her face overspread with a deadly paleness  what is the matter my darling cried her mother starting up in alarm  oh the esquimaux are lying dead on the sand gasped edith as she laid her head on her mothers breast and the rest are all gone  without waiting to hear more frank and stanley took down their guns and hastened to the camp  here a scene of the most horrible kind presented itself  the whole camp exhibited evidences of a hasty flight and eight of the people who had died during the night were lying exposed on the rocks with their white faces and ghastly eyeballs turned towards the sky  the other two had been buried on the rocks under a heap of stones which did not conceal them entirely from view  no wonder poor edith was alarmed said stanley sadly as he leaned on his fowlingpiece and surveyed the scene of desolation and death  i have been told remarked frank that the esquimaux have a superstitious dread of this river  oolibuck mentioned to me this morning that he has had a good deal of conversation with the natives about this disease and they told him that it invariably attacks them when they enter this river and carries them off by dozens so that they never come into it except when they require wood and always stay as short a time as possible  ah thats bad said stanley i fear that it will go much against the success of the establishment  but we must hope better things and truly with this exception all has gone well hitherto  said they anything more frank  yes they hinted it seems their intention of flying away from this fatal spot and taking up their abode for the winter at the mouth of false river where they can obtain a livelihood by sealfishing but oolibuck thought they did not mean to put the threat in execution and did not imagine that they were in such alarm that they would go off without burying their dead  we must do that for them frank said stanley turning to retrace his steps to the fort send down as many of the men as you can spare today and get it done at once  by the way said frank as they walked along the beach it seems that many years ago the moravian missionaries came to the mouth of this river and talked of setting up a tradingfort here but from some cause unknown they gave up their design and went away  maximus has been telling me all he knows about the matter but his reports are vague and the event must have occurred if it occurred at all when he was a child  very possibly frank  you know the moravians have settlements along the coasts of labrador to the eastward of this  they may have made an attempt long ago to push as far as this  i have always had a high opinion of the energy and perseverance of these missionaries but i cannot get over the incongruity of their strange way of mingling trade with religion  it seems to me an unnatural sort of thing for missionaries to be furtraders  i do not mean by this to object to their system however i daresay it works well but ive had no means of judging  it is strange replied frank yet it seems a good plan  the missionaries trade there in order that they may live and preach twould be a good thing for the indian country if the same principles and practice actuated the traders with this difference that instead of missionaries becoming furtraders the furtraders would become missionaries  it does seem a species of infatuation continued frank energetically as he warmed with the subject that men calling themselves christians should live for years and years among the poor indians of america and never once name to them the great and saving name of christ  of course i do not wonder at those who make little or no profession of christianity but there are men in the furtrade who seem to be deeply impressed with the truths of gods wordwho are alive to the fact that there is no name under heaven given among men whereby we can be saved except the name of christwho know and feel that the indians around them are living without god and therefore without hope in the worldwho feel that christ is all in all and that the christian religion however perfect and beautiful as a code of morals is utterly worthless as to salvation unless there be in the heart the special love of jesus christmen who admit and profess to believe all this yet never speak of christ to the nativesnever mention the name that can alone save them from eternal destruction  be not hasty frank replied stanley  i agree with you that it is strange indeed we do not see and hear more of this missionary spirit among the traders and i for one take your words as a deserved rebuke to myself but if there are as you say many among us who are deeply impressed with the truths of gods word how know you that we never mention our saviours name to the indians  although furtraders do not mount the pulpit they may in private make mention of that name and do an amount of good that will only be fully known when the trader the trapper and the indian shall stand side by side before the judgmentseat of christ  observe i do not say that this is actually the case i only suggest that it is possiblemay i not add probable  it may be so returned frank it may be so and god forgive me if i have judged the men of the furtrade unjustly but i certainly know one who has made somewhat of a profession of christianity in his day and yet has done next to nothing and that one is frank morton  ill not gainsay that frank said stanley with a quiet smile and i think we are not likely to err much when we apply censure to ourselves it is curious that you and i should have been thinking of the very same subject  a few days ago while my wife and i were conversing together about the esquimaux we agreed to devote a good deal of our leisure time next winter to reading and explaining the bible to our esquimau interpreters in the hope that they may afterwards be the means of much good among their poor countrymen  whether or not the good resolutions made at this time were ever put in practice we cannot say  let us hope that they were  not long after the sudden flight of the esquimaux the indians struck their tents and took their departure for the interior with the intention as they said of hunting for furs but more probably as maistequan suggested to hunt the deer  during all the time of their residence at the fort maximus had kept out of their way as much as possible  he seldom met them without a frown of hatred for he regarded them as the representatives of a race which had robbed him of his bride and there were times when the giants spirit chafed so fearfully at the sight of the red men that nothing but the remembrance of his promise to stanley to offer them no injury prevented him from stirring up his tribe to overwhelm and destroy them  it was therefore with a feeling of relief that maximus beheld them march single file over the rocky platform and disappear in the ravine that led into the mountains  the traders of ungava were once more left in solitude and from this time forward until the winter set in they devoted all their energies to laying up a stock of provisions sufficient to last till spring  dick prince and massan were sent after the deer in company  augustus and bryan were dispatched to a small lake to establish a fishery in which they were very successful and soon caught a large supply of excellent whitefish trout and carp which they gutted and hung up by their tails to dry and freeze  frank and moses went to another small lake about ten miles down the river and built a hut of willows in which they dwelt while engaged at the fishery  as there was still much to be done in the way of completing the fort and making furniture stanley retained la roche oolibuck and the two indians to assist him in this as well as in the performance of the miscellaneous minor duties about the station such as cutting up firewood covering the roofs of the stores with tarpaulin shooting such birds and animals as came near the fort constructing rude chairs and tables cooking etcetera etcetera while francois and gaspard were sent up the river to fell trees for the purposes both of building and firewood  edith and her mother found ample occupationthe latter in the use of her needle and the cares of the household the former in learning her lessons visiting her berryravine dressing her doll for she had a doll as a matter of course and in holding long and frequent converse with chimo  thus they spent their time too busily occupied to take much note of its rapid flight and scarce noticing the lengthening nights and shortening days until needles of ice began with slow and silent progress to shoot across and solidify the waters of the bay    chapter twenty four  effect of snow on the feelings not to mention the landscapea wonderful dome of ice  there are times and seasons in this peculiar world of ours when the heart of man rejoices  the rejoicing to which we refer is not of the ordinary kind  it is peculiar and whether its duration be long or short its effect powerful or slight it is quite distinct and emphatic we do not intend to enter into a detail of the occasions that call forth this feeling of exultation  far be it from us to venture into such perilous depths of philosophy  our sole reason for making these preliminary observations is that we may with proper emphasis introduce the statement that one of these occasions of rejoicing is when man arises from his couch on a brilliant sunny sparkling morning gazes forth from his window and beholds the landscapewhich yesterday was green and red and brown and blueclad in a soft mantle of whitest snow  what you dont agree with us  you shudder at the preposterous idea of such a sight being fitted to rejoice the heart of man in any degree whatever  well well do not sneer at our weakness  if we cannot sympathise with each other on this subject perchance there are other things in which we can  but whatever be our opinion in regard to this the point that we have to deal with at present is the opinion of edith stanley who on rising hastily one morning and looking forth from her little window evinced the rejoicing of her heart most emphatically by her loud exclamation of delight and the sparkling of her bright blue eyes  independently of the cheerful lightness and the virgin purity of the mantle which in itself tended to awaken emotions of gladness in ediths heart there was something in its sudden appearance that carried her back violently and vividly to bygone days  the winter garb had no associations yet with ungava but it had with moose fort and the dear companions she used to play with there  it recalled the time when she and her little friends sallied forth each with her small wooden sledge drawn after her by a line to slide thereon down the banks of the frozen river with headlong speed and upset at the bottom amid shouts of laughter  it recalled the time when she made the first attempt to walk in snowshoes upon which occasion she tripped and fell into the snow as a matter of course and was advised to wait till she was older  it recalled the memory of her fathers team of dogs and the delightful drives she used to have over the frozen river which drives often resulted in an upset perhaps several and always resulted in fun  it recalled the house in the old fort that used to be her home the row of houses belonging to the men to which she often went and was always welcomed as a great favourite the waterhole on the river from which the old canadian drew his daily supply and the snowhouse in the yard which she built in company with frank morton and which stood the whole winter through but gave way at last before the blazing sun of spring and fellas ill luck would have itwhen she and chimo were sitting there so that she and the dog together had a hard struggle ere they got free  all these and many more thickcoming memories of other days were aroused by the vision of snow that met ediths gaze that morning and caused her heart with peculiar fervour to rejoice  winter had now descended with iron grasp upon ungava  for some weeks the frost had been so intense that every lake and pool was frozen many inches thick and the salt bay itself was fringed with a thick and everaccumulating mass of ice  the snow which now fell was but the ceremonial coronation of a king whose reign had commenced in reality long before  but the sunshine did not last long  the rolling fogs and vapours of the open and iceladen sea beyond ascended over the wild mountains obscured the bright sky and revealed the winter of the north in all its stern cold reality  every cliff and crag and jagged peak had its crown of snow and every corrie glen and gorge its drifted shroud  in places where the precipices were perpendicular the grey rocks of the mountains formed dark blotches in the picture but dark although they were they did not equal in blackness the river on which floated hundreds of masses of ice and several ponderous icebergs which had been carried up from the sea by the floodtide  over this inky expanse the frostsmoke hung like a leaden pallan evil spirit as it were which never left the spot till protracted and intense frost closed the waters of the river altogether and banished it farther out to sea  but this entire closing of the river very seldom happened and never lasted long  fort chimo itself at least as much of it as remained unburied was a mere speck on the edge of the white plain at the mountains foot scarce distinguishable at a short distance from the straggling black pines and willow bushes that seemed thrust out into the waste from the ravines above and below the fort  but on a nearer approach the fort assumed an air of greater importance the influences too of the cold cheerless scene we have described were broken and dissipated by the sights of comfort and sounds of cheerfulness within  the shout of the waterdrawer as he roused the dogs and went forth with his empty cask hauled on a little sledge to draw from the bubbling spring behind the fort the sounds of the hammer the chisel and the axe in the carpenters shop the merry clank of bryans hammer and the bright flame that gleamed from the window of the forgeall bore evidence of the fact that however powerful the influence of winter might be without it had little power within the wooden walls of fort chimo and could not check the life or heart or industry of man  the only other human being visible in the open air besides the waterdrawer was la roche who with a fur cap covering his head and ears and leathern mittens on his hands hewed and hacked the billets with which he purposed to replenish the fire for cooking the midday meal  pausing in his labour and dusting off the hoarfrost that covered his eyebrows and whiskers he looked at the edge of his hatchet for a few seconds with an expression of contempt  then throwing the implement on his shoulder he crossed the yard and entered the blacksmiths shop  bryan said he seating himself on the edge of the forge and filling his pipe while vulcans votary scattered a shower of gems from a whitehot bar of iron at every blow of his hammerbryan you no fit for noting  dat axe is blont encore  oui cest vrai  now dat is tres mal  how you not can temper him edge better  timper it better is it answered bryan putting the iron bar in the fire and regarding his companion earnestly while he blew the bellows faix tis mysilf id need to timper better in order to put up wi the likes o you ye wretched crature  how can ye expict it to kape its idge when ye lave it for iver lyin among yer pots and kittles  dat is not it replied la roche applying a glowing coal to his pipe tis de mauvais steel  but i not com for to fight wid you  your tongue trop long pour dat  i com for ax you to give me turn ov de grindstone sil vous plait  ye dont desarve it losh but wait till ive finished this job and ill lind ye a hand  bethebye resumed bryan when the metal was cooled has francois finished that sled for miss edith  oui replied la roche seating himself at the grindstone ah pas si vite a leet more slow bryan  oui him make it all ready only want de ringbolts  thin it wont want thim long  ye can take thim over to the shop when ye go across  there they are on the binch  bryan continued to turn the handle of the stone for some time in silence  dye know losh he resumed whin mister frank is goin to the fishery  he go demain i blieve and mademoiselle edith go too  none o the min goin inquired the blacksmith  non  monsieur frank just go for to try if dere be any fish to be cotch by de hook and i tink he go more for to give edith one drive dan dat  very likely losh  the poor purty little crature  shes very fond o sledgin and walkin in snowshoes  tis well for her bekase theres a want o companions for her here intirely  ah mercy dat is superb magnifique said the frenchman feeling the edge of the axe with his thumb  it sharp nuff to shave de hair off your ogly face bryan  thin be off wid ye an dont kape me longer from my work  an shut the door quick behind ye theres cowld enough in the place already  so saying bryan resumed his hammer and la roche following the snowtrack across the yard recommenced his labour of chopping firewood  next day frank and edith made preparations for the excursion alluded to in the foregoing conversation  the object for which this excursion was undertaken was twofoldfirst to ascertain if there were any fish in a large lake about ten miles distant from the fort and secondly to give little edith a drive for the good of her health  not that her health was bad but several weeks of bad weather had confined her much to the house and her mother thought the change would be beneficial and agreeable and tenderly did that mothers heart yearn over her little child for she felt that although she was all to edith that a mother could be nature had implanted in her daughters mind a longing desire for the companionship of little ones of her own age which could not be satisfied by any substitutenot even that of a tender mother who sought by all the means in her power to become a child again for ediths sake  immediately after breakfast that day frank took edith by the hand and led her round by the back of the fort towards the kennel where the dogs were kept intending to release chimo who was to have the honour of hauling the sledge of his young mistress  in passing the spring edith paused as she had often done before during the winter to gaze with wonder on the transformation that had taken place in the appearance of the once green and fertile spot  not only was it covered with deep snow but over the spring there was formed a singular dome of ice  this dome was a subject of continual astonishment to every one at ungava  it had commenced to rise soon after the first hard frosts had sealed up the little fountain from the open air  as time passed by the covering became thick ice and was bulged gradually up above the surrounding waste until it reached an elevation of not much less than twelve or thirteen feet  inside of this the spring bubbled up as of yore  what think you edith said frank as a sudden thought occurred to him shall i cut a doorway into that crystal house and see if the spirit of the spring dwells there  edith clapped her hands with delight at the idea and urged her companion to begin at once  then checking him as he was about to commence the work with his hatchet she said earnestly  do spirits really dwell in the springs frank  why eda we must send to england for a lot of fairy tales to teach you what i mean  i do but jest when i speak of spirits living there  but many books have been written about pretended spirits and fairies which tell us of their wonderful adventures and what they said and did long ago  i shall tell you some of these stories one of these days  but i daresay there are no spirits in this spring  faix an it would be a rale misfortune if there was sir remarked bryan who came up at this moment and touched his cap for it would be only sperits and wather which wouldnt kape in this cowld climate ive finished the ringbolts for the sled sir an came to see when ye would have them fixed  put them in your pocket bryan for a few minutes and lend a hand here to cut a hole through this dome  as frank spoke he drew a small axe from his belt and began to lay about him so vigorously that the icy splinters flew in all directions like a shower of broken crystal  bryan seconded his efforts and in less than half an hour a block of solid ice about four feet high and two broad was cut out and detached from the side of the dome  thatll do bryan said frank when their work was nearly completed ill finish it myself now  go to the carpenters house and francois will show you what to do with the sled  as bryan walked away frank dealt the mass of ice a blow that split it into several pieces which he quickly removed revealing to the astonished and eager gaze of his young companion a cavern of a most beautiful light blue colour  taking edith by the hand he led her into this icy cave  its walls were quite luminous and delicately blue except in places where the green moss and earth around the spring had been torn from the ground and lifted up along with the dome  icicles hung in various places from the roof and the floor was hard and dry except in the centre where the spring bubbled up through it and cut a channel across towards one side of the icy wall where it disappeared under the snow  oh what a beautiful palace cried edith with delight after she had gazed around her for a few minutes in silent wonder and admiration  i shall come and live here frank  oh do come and let us get chairs and a small table and make it our sittingroom  we can come every day when the sun shines and read or you can tell me the tales about spirits and fairies you spoke of  a good idea eda but i fear we would need a stove to keep us warm  it strikes me it will make a capital icehouse in spring to keep our fresh meat in  it will last long after the snow is melted  then we shall make a palace of it in winter and a meatstore in spring cried edith laughing as she walked round this newlydiscovered house examining its blue walls and peeping into the cold black spring  meanwhile frank examined it with a view to the utilitarian purpose and after both of them had gone round it several times they continued on their way towards the dogkennel  the sledge which francois had constructed for edith was made after the model of those used by the esquimaux  there were two stout runners or skates made of wood for sliding over the snow  these were slightly turned up or rather rounded up in front and attached to each other by means of cross bars and thin planks of wood all of which were fastened not by nails for ironwork snaps like glass in such a cold climate as that of ungava but by thongs of undressed sealskin which although they held the fabric very loosely together in appearance were nevertheless remarkably strong and served their purpose very well two short upright bars behind served as a back to lean against  but the most curious part of the machine was the substance with which the runners were shod in order to preserve them  this was a preparation of mud and water which was plastered smoothly on in a soft condition and then allowed to freeze  this it did in a few minutes after being exposed to the open air and thus became a smooth hard sheathing which was much more durable and less liable to break than iron or indeed any other sheathing that could be devised  this substance is of course easily repaired and is always used by the esquimaux in winter  esquimau sledges being heavy and meant for carrying a number of people require large teams of dogs  but ediths sledgeor sled as the men called itwas little  moreover edith herself was little and light therefore chimo was deemed sufficiently powerful to draw it  so thoroughly correct were they in this supposition that when edith was seated in her sledge for a trial trip and chimo harnessed he ran away with her and gave frank a chase of half a mile over the river ere he condescended to stop in his wild career  but the intended excursion was suddenly interrupted and postponed by an event which we shall relate in the next chapter    chapter twenty five  buried alivebut not killedthe giant in the snowstorm  the event which prevented the excursion referred to in the last chapter was neither more nor less than a snowstorm  was that all say you reader  nay that was not all  independently of the fact that it was a snowstorm the like of which you have never seen unless you have travelled in northern climes it was a snowstorm that produced results of these more hereafter  the storm began with a sigha mysterious sigh that swept over the mountains of ungava with a soft mournful wail and died slowly away in the distant glen of the caniapuscaw as if the spirit of the north wind grieved to think of the withering desolation it was about to launch upon the land  the gathering clouds that preceded and accompanied this sigh induced frank morton to countermand his orders for the intended journey  in order to console edith for the disappointment he went with her into the hall and drawing a low stool towards the blazing stove placed a draughtboard upon it  then he placed another and a lower stool beside the first on which he seated edith  spreading a deerskin robe upon the ground he stretched himself thereon at full length and began to arrange the men  the hall which was formerly such a comfortless apartment was now invested with that degree of comfort which always gathers more or less round a place that is continually occupied  the ceiling was composed of a carpet of deerskin stretched tightly upon the beams  the walls were hung all round with the thick heavy coats and robes of leather and fur belonging to the inmates and without which they never ventured abroad the iron stove in the centre of the apartment with its pipe to conduct away the smoke and its radiant fire of logs emitted a cheerful glow in its immediate vicinity which glow however was not intense enough to melt the thick ice or rather hoarfrost an inch deep with which the two windows were encrusted to the almost total exclusion of the view and the serious diminution of the light  the door was padded all round its edges with fur which tended to check the bitter wind that often blew against it and tempered the slight draught that did force its way through  altogether the hall at fort chimo was curious and comfortablerather shaggy in its general appearance but sound and trustworthy at bottom  a small rough table the work of frank morton stood close to the stove and beside it was seated mrs stanley with a soft yellow deerskin before her which she was carefully transforming into a hunting coat for her husband  on another and a larger table was spread the tea equipage those who would understand this aright must for tea read supper among furtraders the two are combined  candlesdips made at the forthad been brought some time ago by la roche who entered the hall by a back door which communicated with a passage leading to the kitchen behind  what can have become of papa i wonder  mrs stanley designated her husband by this epithet in consequence of her desire to keep up the fiction of her being ediths little sister or playfellow  frank looked up from the board  i know not said he  i left him giving some orders to the men  we have been getting things made snug about the fort for we expect a pretty stiff breeze tonighttake care eda your crowns in danger  oh so it is cried edith snatching back her piece and looking with intense earnestness at the board  frank might have observed had he not been too deeply engaged with his game that the expected stiff breeze had already come and was whistling round the fort with considerable vigour  youll beat me eda if you play so boldly said frank with a smile there give me another crown  and me too said edith pushing up her piece  as she spoke the door burst open and stanley sprang into the room  whew what a night he cried shutting the door with a forcible bang in order to keep out the snowdrift that sought to enter along with him  two moves would have made frank the conqueror but the gust of wind upset the board and scattered the men upon the floor  stanley looked like a man of white marble but the removal of his cap coat and leggings produced a speedy and entire metamorphosis  ho  la roche  oui monsieur  here take my coat and shake the snow off it and lets have supper as speedily as may be  the draughts without frank are a little too powerful for the draughts within i fearwhat wife making another coat  one would think you had vowed to show your affection for me by the number of coats you made  how many have you perpetrated since we were married  never mind go and put on one now and come to supper while it is hot  im glad it is hot cried stanley from his bedroom  one needs unusual heat within to make up for the cold without  the thermometer is thirty below  while the party in the hall were enjoying their evening meal the men were similarly employed beside the stove in their own habitation  there was not much difference in the two apartments save that the confusion in that of the men was much greater in consequence of the miscellaneous mass of capotes caps belts discarded moccasins axes guns and sealspears with which they saw fit to garnish the walls  the fumes of tobacco were also more dense and the conversation more uproarious  tis a howlin night observed massan as a gust of more than usual violence shook the door on its hinges  me tink de snowdrift am as tick in de sky as on de ground said oolibuck drawing a live coal from the fire and lighting his pipe therewith  hould on boys cried bryan seizing his chair with both hands half in jest and half in earnest as another blast shook the building to its foundation  the two indians sat like statues of bronze smoking their calumets in silence while gaspard and prince rose and went to the window  but the frozen moisture on the panes effectually prevented their seeing out  it was indeed an awful nightsuch a night as had not until now visited the precincts of fort chimo  viewed from the rocky platform on the hill the raging of the storm was absolutely sublime  the wind came sometimes in short angry gusts sometimes in prolonged roars through the narrows sweeping up clouds of snow so dense that it seemed as though the entire mass had been uplifted from the earth hurling it upwards and downwards and in circling eddies past the ravines and round the fort and launching it with a fierce yell into the valley of the caniapuscaw  the sky was not altogether covered with clouds and the broken masses as they rolled along permitted a stray moonbeam to dart down upon the turmoil beneath and render darkness visible sometimes the wind lulled for a second or two as if to breathe then it burst forth again splitting through the mountain gorges with a shriek of intensity the columns of snow sprang in thousands from every hollow cliff and glen mingled in wild confusion swayed now hither now thither in mad uncertainty and then caught by the steady gale pelted on like the charging troops of iceland and swept across the frozen plain  could human beings face so wild a storm as this  ay they couldat least they could dare to try  there was one traveller out upon the hills on that tremendous night the giant was in the midst of it but weak as the bulrush were the mighty limbs of maximus before the rushing gale  several days previous to this the esquimau had been sent down to his brethren at false river to procure some sealmeat for the dogs and to ascertain the condition of the natives and their success in fishing  on arriving he found that they had been so far successful that starvation their too frequent guest had not yet visited their dwellings of snow  but maximus found the old woman who had formerly saved his life very ill and apparently about to die  having learned from experience the efficacy of stanleys medicines he resolved to procure some for the old woman whom he had tenderly watched over and hunted for ever since the eventful day of the attack  his dogs were exhausted and could not return  but the bold esquimau was in the prime of life and animated by the fire of vigorous youth  the storm was beginning to mutter in the distance  what then had he not faced the blasts of the frozen regions many a time before without saying a word he threw a junk of sealflesh into his wallet and striding back upon his track at the mountains base he disappeared in the driving snow  before reaching the fort however the full fury of the storm had burst upon him  it cast him headlong into the snow but he rose and staggered on  again it burst forth and again he fell before it like a stately pine  rising to his knees maximus draw the hood of his hairy garment close round his head and face and tried to peer through the driving snow but he could not see until a slight lull came then he observed a hummock of ice at a short distance and rising made towards it  the lulls were shortlived however  the storm threw him down again instantly he was drifted over with snow another blast came lifted the drift into the air and left the esquimau exposed to all its fury  but maximus was not conquered  he rose again panting it is true but sturdy as ever and ready to take advantage of the next lull  it came soon and he saw a rock or it might be the base of a cliff close at hand  with a quick run he reached it and going down on his knees began with his gloved hands to scrape a hollow in the snow  having made a hole big enough to contain his body he lay down in it and pulling the superincumbent snow down upon him was almost buried in the ruin scarcely had he drawn the hood of his coat well over his face when another burst of the storm dashed a column of curling drift upon the rock and the place where he lay was covered up not a wrinkle in the drift remained to mark the spot where he was buried  all that night the storm roared among mountains with bitter fury but next day the wind was subdued and the sun shone brightly on the grey rocks and on the white wreaths of snow  it shone in all the lustre of an unclouded winter sky  not only did the sun smile upon the scene but two mock suns or parhelia almost as bright as himself shone on either side of him  yet no ray of light illuminated the dwellings of the furtraders  all was darkness there until stanley rose from his couch and lighted a candle for the purpose of examining his watch  hallo  frank frank he cried entering the hall while he hastily threw on his garments turn out man theres something wrong here tis past noon and dark as midnight  bring your watch perhaps im wrong  frank yawned vociferously and sprang from his bed  in two seconds more he made his appearance in his trousers and shirt  past twelve no doubt ofyeaoow  that accounts for my waking three times and going off again but  hey what have we here cried stanley as he opened the front door and disclosed to view a solid wall of snow  snowed up dear me eh thats odd said frank beginning to comprehend the state of matters  snowed up they were undoubtedly so thoroughly snowed up that there was not a ray of daylight within their dwelling  had frank been above the snow instead of below it he would have seen that the whole fort was so completely buried that nothing was visible above the surface except the chimneys and the flagstaff  after the first few moments of surprise had passed it occurred to stanley that they might ascend to the regions above by the chimney which was wide enough he thought to admit a man but on looking up he found that it also was full of drifted snow this however could have been easily removed but there was a bar of iron stretching across and built into the clay walls which rendered escape by that passage impossible  theres nothing for it frank but to dig ourselves out so the sooner we begin the better  by this time they were joined by edith and her mother who although much surprised were not at all alarmed for rough travelling in a wild land had taught them to regard nothing as being dangerous until it was proved to be so  besides stanley had assured them that they had nothing to fear as the only evil he anticipated would be the trouble they were sure to have in getting rid of the superabundant snow  while they were talking the back door was opened violently and la roche in a state of dishabille burst into the room  o messieurs cest fini  oui le world him shut up tout togedder  oh misere  fat shall ye to do  hold your tongue la roche said frank and bring the kitchen shovel  the cook instantly turned to obey and as he rushed towards the kitchen his voice was heard exclaiming in the passage  ah cest terrible  mais i ver moshe fear de shovel be out in de neige  ah non here it is  cest bien  returning in haste to the hall he handed a much dilapidated iron shovel to frank who threw off his coat and set to work with vigour  the tables and chairs and all the furniture were removed into the inner apartments in order to afford room for the snow which frank dug from the open doorway and shovelled into the centre of the room  as only one at a time could work in the narrow doorway the three men wrought with the shovel by turns and while one was digging the tunnel the other two piled the debris in a compact mound beside the stove  as no fire had yet been kindled the snow of course did not melt but remained crisp and dry upon the floor  meanwhile edith looked on with deep interest and occasionally assisted in piling the snow while her mother seeing that her presence was unnecessary retired to her own room  there cried frank pausing and surveying an immense cavern which he had dug into the drift thats a good spell  take a turn now la roche and dig upwards we should see daylight soon  ah vraiment it be time for it am von oclock replied la roche as he plied the shovel  the tunnel was cut in such a way as that while it ran outwards it also sloped upwards and from the angle at which it lay stanley calculated that thirty feet or thereabouts would bring them to the surface  in this he was correct for when la roche had worked for half an hour the snow above became slightly luminous  but the labour of conveying it from the end of the tunnel into the hall became of course greater as the work advanced  at length the light penetrated so clearly that la roche was induced to thrust his shovel upwards in the expectation of penetrating the mass  the effect of this action was striking and unexpected  instantly the roof fell in and a flood of sunshine poured into the tunnel revealing the luckless frenchman struggling amid the ruins  oh pull me hout he spluttered as frank and stanley stood laughing heartily at his misfortune  one of his legs happened to protrude from the mass as he made this earnest request so frank seized it and dragged the poor man by main force from his uncomfortable position immediately afterwards they all three scrambled through the aperture and stood in open day  the sight that met their eyes was a curious though not a satisfactory one  all that remained visible of fort chimo were as we have said the chimneys and the flagstaff  in regard to the general aspect of the neighbourhood however there was little alteration for the change of position in the drifts among the mountain gorges and the addition to their bulk made no striking alteration in the rugged landscape  in some places the gale had cleared the sides of the mountains and left their cliffs exposed to view in other spots the gorges and ravines were choked up and the pine tops nearly covered and the open water in the lake was more encumbered than usual with icebergs  now la roche said stanley after they had surveyed the desolate scene for a few minutes in silence go fetch the shovel and well dig out the men  i daresay poor fellows theyre beginning to wonder at the length of the night by this time  la roche prepared to descend into the tunnel when their attention was arrested by a strange sound beneath the snow  in a few minutes the crust began to crack at a spot not more than two yards from where they stood then there was a sudden rupture accompanied by a growl and followed by the appearance of the dishevelled head and arms of a man  musha boys but im out  bryan coughed the snow from around his mouth and winked it from his eyes as he spoke  the first sight that met his bewildered gaze was three pair of expanded eyeballs and three double rows of grinning teeth a few feet from his face  uttering a cry of terror he fell back into the hole the snow closed over him and he was gone  it need scarcely be added that frank and stanley commenced to dig into this hole with as much vigour as their frequent explosions of laughter would allow  in a few minutes it was reopened and the men issued one by one from durance vile  och sirs ye gave me a mortial start exclaimed bryan as he rose to view the second time  i thought for sartin ye were all polar bears faix weve had a job ot down there  ill be bound to say theres twinty ton o snowbad luck to itin the middle o the floor  theres work for us here thatll last two weeks i guess said massan as he and several of the others stooped down and gazed into the tunnel leading to the hall at the end of which ediths laughing face met their view  when did you awake and begin to suspect that something was wrong inquired stanley of dick prince  awake cried bryan answering the question we awoke at laste a dozen times  i suppose it must have bin the time for brikfust for ye see although we could ha slept on long enough our intariors couldnt be no manes forgit their needcessities  we shall have to work a bit yet ere these necessities are attended to i fear said stanley  go francois and one or two of you and open up the dogkennel  the rest of you get all the shovels you can lay hands on and clear out the houses as fast as you can  clear out de chimbleys fust mes garcons cried la roche looking up from the tunnel  den ve vill git dejeuner ready toute suite  that will we lad said bryan shouldering a spade and proceeding towards the chimney of the hall while the rest of the party breaking up into several groups set to work with spades shovels and such implements as were suitable to cut passages through the square of the fort towards the doors of the several buildings  as massan had said it proved to be no light work  the northwest gale had launched the snow upon the exposed buildings of fort chimo until the drift was fifteen or sixteen feet deep so that the mere cutting of passages was a matter of considerable time and severe labour  meanwhile maximus awoke and sought to raise himself from his lair at the foot of the rock  but his first effort failed  the drift above him was too heavy  abandoning therefore the idea of freeing himself by main force he turned round on his side and began to scrape away the snow that was directly above his head  the masses that accumulated in the course of this process he forced down past his chest and as his motions tended to compress and crush the drift around him in all directions he soon made room enough to work with ease  in ten minutes he approached so near to the surface as to be able with a powerful effort to burst it upwards and step out of his strange dormitory into the sunshine  this method of spending the night has been resorted to more than once by arctic travellers who had lost their way and it is sad to think that many who have perished might have saved their lives had they known that burrowing could be practised with safety  the esquimaux frequently spend the night in this manner but they prefer building a snowhouse to burrowing if circumstances will permit  cutting a slice of sealmeat and eating as he went maximus resumed his journey and soon afterwards arrived at the fort where he found the men busied in excavating their buried dwellings  here he stated the case of the old woman and received such medicines as stanley in his amateur medical wisdom saw fit to bestow  with these he started immediately to retrace his steps having been directed to proceed after administering them to the lake where frank meant to try the fishing under the ice  a family of esquimaux had been established on another lake not so far distant from the fort and having been taught by the furtraders how to set nets under the ice they succeeded in procuring more than enough for their subsistence  it was hoped therefore that the larger lake would afford a good supply and the weather having become decidedly fine frank prepared to set out on the following day    chapter twenty six  an excursionigloo building and fishing under the icea snowtable and a good feastedith spends the night under a snowroof for the first but not the last time  now then edith cried frank looking in at the door of the hall your carriage waits and chimo is very restive  coming coming exclaimed a treble voice within im getting new lines put to my snowshoes and will be ready in two minutes  two minutes translated into female language means ten sometimes twenty  frank knew this and proceeded to readjust the sash that secured his leathern capote as he walked towards the little sledge in front of the fort  he then tied down the earpieces of his fur cap more carefully for it was very cold though clear and sunny  the frost had set fast the lake opposite the fort and by thus removing the frostcloud that overhung the open water farther out to sea relieved the fort from the mists in which it was usually enveloped  by this time fifteen out of the two minutes having elapsed he reexamined the lock of his gun and adjusted the warm deerskin robe on ediths little sledge patted chimo on the head looked up at the clouds and began to whistle  now frank here i am cried edith running towards him with her snowshoes in her hand followed by her father and mother  quiet chimodown sir said frank restraining the dog as it sought to bound towards its mistress  being harnessed to the sledge this was a very improper proceeding and was rebuked accordingly so chimo was fain to crouch on the snow and look back at edith as frank placed her in the sledge and arranged the deerskin robes round her  edith wore a long fur cloak and cloth leggings  her feet were protected from the cold by two pair of blanket socks besides very thick moccasins of deerskin  the usual headdress of civilised females in these regions is a round fur cap but edith had a peculiar affection for the cree indian headdress and upon the present occasion wore one which was lined with fur and accommodated with earpieces to defy the winter cold  the childs general appearance was somewhat rotund  painters would probably have said there was a little too much breadth perhaps in the picture  her pointed cap however with the little bow of ribbon on the top gave her a piquant air and did away with the heavy appearance of her costume to some extent in fact edith looked like a fat little witch  but if she looked fat before being wrapped up in the sledge furs she looked infinitely fatter when thus placed and nothing of her visible except her two twinkling eyes  so grotesque was she that the whole party burst into a loud laugh as they surveyed her  the laugh made chimo start off at full gallop which caused frank to grasp the line of the sledge that trailed behind and hurry over the snow at a most undignified pace  take care of her cried mr stanley  ay ay shouted franksoftly chimosoftly you rascal  in ten minutes the travellers were round the point and fairly out of sight but the shouts of frank and an occasional howl from chimo floated back on the breeze as stanley and his wife returned leisurely to the hall  the road or rather the ground over which frank morton drove edith that day was exceedingly rough and ruggedso rough that we will not try the endurance of the reader by dragging him over it  we will merely indicate its general features  first of all they drove about three miles along the level snow at the foot of the mountains  so far the road was good and chimo went along merrily to the music of the little thimblelike brass bells with which his harness was garnished  then they came to a ravine and edith had to get out put on her snowshoes and clamber up holding by franks hand while chimo followed dragging the sledge as he best could  having gained one of the terraces edith slipped her feet out of the snowshoe lines jumped into the sledge and was swept along to the next ravine where she got out again resumed her snowshoes and ascended as before  thus they went up the ravines and along the terraces until the summit of the first mountain range was reached  having rested here a few minutes edith once more got into the sledge and chimo set off  but as there was now a long piece of level ground over which for some miles they could travel in the direction of the coast frank took the sledline in his hand and held the dog at a quick walking pace  afterwards they turned a little farther inland and came into a more broken country where they had sometimes to mount and sometimes to descend the hills  there were many gorges and narrow fissures in the ground here some of which were covered over and so concealed with snow that the travellers ran some risk of falling into them  indeed at one place so narrow was their escape that chimo fell through the crust of snow and disappeared into a fissure which descended a hundred feet sheer down and the sledge would certainly have followed had not frank held it back by the line and chimo was not hauled up again without great difficulty  after this frank went in front with a pole and sounded the snow in dangerouslooking places as he went along  towards the afternoon they arrived at the lake where they intended to encamp and to their great delight found maximus there already  he had only arrived a few minutes before them and was just going to commence the erection of a snowhouse  glad to see you maximus cried frank as he drove up  hows the old woman eh  she small better replied maximus assisting edith to alight  dis goot for fish  maximus was a remarkably intelligent man and although his residence at the fort had been of short duration as yet he had picked up a few words of english  a good lake i have no doubt replied frank looking round  but we need not search for camping ground  there seems to be very little wood so you may as well build our hut on the ice  we shall need all our time as the sun has not long to run  the lake on the edge of which they stood was about a mile in circumferenee and lay in a sort of natural basin formed by savagelooking hills in which the ravines were little more than narrow fissures entirely devoid of trees  snow encompassed and buried everything so that nothing was to be seen except here and there crags and cliffs of gray rock which were too precipitous for the snow to rest on  now eda i will take a look among these rocks for a ptarmigan for supper so you can amuse yourself watching maximus build our house till i return  very well frank said edith but dont be long  come back before dark chimo and i will weary for you  in a few minutes frank disappeared among the rocks upon the shore and maximus taking edith by the hand and dragging her sledge after him led her a couple of hundred yards out on to the ice or more properly speaking the hard beaten snow with which the ice was covered  chimo had been turned loose and being rather tired after his journey had coiled himself up on a mound of snow and fallen fast asleep  dis place for house said maximus pausing near a smooth level part of the lake  you stop look to me he added turning to the little girl who gazed up in his large face with an expression half of wonder and half of fun  when you cold run when you hot sit in sled and look at me  in compliance with this request edith sat down in her sledge and from this comfortable point of view watched the esquimau while he built a snowhut before her  first of all he drew out a long iron knife which had been constructed specially far him by bryan who looked upon the giant with special favour  with the point of this he drew a circle of about seven feet in diameter and so well accustomed was he to this operation that his circle we believe could not have been mended even by a pair of compasses  two feet to one side of this circle he drew a smaller one of about four feet in diameter  next he cut out of the snow a number of hard blocks which were so tough that they could not be broken without a severe blow but were as easily cut as you might have sliced a soft cheese with a sharp knife  these blocks he arranged round the large circle and built them above each other fashioning them as he proceeded in such a manner that they gradually rose into the form of a dome  the chinks between them he filled compactly with soft snow and the last block introduced into the top of the structure was formed exactly on the principle of the keystone of an arch  when the large dome was finished he commenced the smaller and in the course of two hours both the housesor as the esquimaux call them iglooswere completed  long before this however frank had returned from an unsuccessful hunt to assist him and edith had wondered and wearied grown cold and taken to running with chimo and grown warm and returned to her sledge several times  two holes were left in the igloos to serve as doors and after they were finished the esquimau cut a square hole in the top of each not far from the keystones and above the entrances  into these he fitted slabs of clear ice which formed windows as beautiful and useful as if they had been made of glass  there were two doorways in the large igloo one of which faced the doorway of the smaller between these he built an arched passage so that the two were thus connected and the small hut formed a sort of inner chamber to the larger  now dem done said maximus surveying his work with a satisfied smile  and very well done they are said frank  see here eda our snowfort is finished  the big one is to be the grand hall and banquetingroom and yonder little hut is your private boudoir  mine exclaimed edith running away from chimo with whom she had been playing and approaching the new houses that had been so speedily put up  oh how nice what fun only thinka snow bedroom  but wont it be cold frank  and is the bed to be of snow too  the black moustache of the giant curled with a smile at the energy with which this was said  we will make the bedsteads of snow eda replied frank but i think we shall manage to find blankets of a warmer materialnow maximus get the things put inside and the lamp lighted for were all tired and very hungry  the lamp to which frank referred was one which maximus had brought along with a few other articles from the esquimau camp  it was made of soft stone somewhat in the form of a half moon about eight inches long and three broad and hollowed out in the inside  esquimaux burn sealfat in it and in winter have no other means of warming their houses or cooking their food  but for both purposes it is quite sufficient  the heat created by these lamps combined with the natural warmth of the inhabitants is frequently so great in the igloos of the esquimaux that they are fain to throw off a great portion of their upper garments and sit in a state of partial nudity yet the snowwalls do not melt owing to the counteracting influence of the intense cold without  maximus had brought some sealfat or blubber along with him  a portion of this he now put into the lamp and placing the latter on a snowshelf prepared expressly for it he set it on fire  the flame although not very steady was bright enough to illuminate the large igloo and to throw a strong gleam into the smaller one  over this lamp frank placed a small tin kettle filled with snow which was speedily converted into water and while this was being boiled he assisted edith in spreading out the bedding  as we have already said the floor of this snowhouse was of the same material as the walls  but onehalf of it was raised about a foot above the other half according to esquimau rules of architecture  this elevated half was intended for the bed which consisted of a large deerskin robe spread entirely over it with the soft hair upwards  another large robe was placed above this for a blanket and a smaller one either for a pillow or an additional covering if required but both of these were tossed down in a heap at the present time to form a luxuriant seat for frank and edith  as their legs hung over the edge of the elevated couch they were thus seated as it were on an ottoman  a mat of interlaced willows covered the floor and on this sat maximus towering in his hairy garments like a huge bear while his black shadow was cast on the pure white wall behind him  in the midst stood a small table extemporised by frank out of a block of snow and covered with the ample skirt of his leathern topcoat which the increasing temperature of the air inside the igloo rendered too warm  beside edith on the most comfortable portion of the ottoman sat chimo with an air of majestic solemnity looking as privileged dogs always do look under like circumstances as if the chief seat belonged to him as a matter not of favour but of right  on the table was spread a solid lump of excellent pemmicanexcellent because made by the fair hands of mrs stanley  it stood visavis to a tin plate whereon lay three large steaming cuts of boiled fresh salmonfresh because although caught some months before it had been frozen solid ever since  there was a large tin kettle of hot tea in the centre of the boardif under the circumstances we may use the termand three tin cups out of which to drink it besides a plate containing broken pieces of shipbiscuit and a small quantity of sugar wrapped up in a morsel of paper  also a little salt in a tin box  all these things and tempting delicacies had up till now been contained within the compass of a small compact insignificantlooking parcel which during the journey had occupied a retiring position in the hinder part of ediths sledgeso true is it that the really great and the useful court concealment until duty calls them forth and reveals their worth and their importance to an admiring world  the admiring world on the present occasion however consisted only of frank edith maximus and chimo unless indeed we may include the moon who at that moment poured her bright beams through the icewindow of the hut and flooded the centre of the snowtable with light  arent we snug eda cried frank as he filled her tin with tea what a charming house and so cheap too  theres sugar beside you take care you dont use salt by mistakemaximus hold out your pannikin  thats the true beverage to warm your heart if you take it hot enough  tankee sur said the giant extending his cup with one hand while with the other he forced into his capacious mouth as much pemmican as it could hold  frank said edith we must build an igloo at the fort when we return  so we will now that i know how to do it  hand me the salt please and poke chimos nose away from the salmon  yes and well invite papa and mamma to come and take supper at our housemaximus is this the exact way your friends build their winter houses  yis sur answered the esquimau looking up from the cut of salmon which he lifted with his fingers in preference to a fork or knife  dey always buil um so  but not dis ting he added touching the snowtable  no i suppose not said frank  i flatter myself that that is a recent improvement  we do great many igloo sometime continued maximus vid two tree fourplenty passges goin into von adoder  what does he mean by that inquired edith laughing  i suppose he means that they connect a number of their igloos together by means of passagesand do they keep them as clean and snug as this maximus  the esquimau replied by a loud chuckle and a full display of his magnificent teeth which frank understood to signify a decided negative  when supper was ended chimo was permitted to devour the scraps while frank assisted edith to arrange her little dormitory  it was much the same in its arrangements as the larger apartment and was really as comfortable and warm as one could desire  returning to the large apartment frank spread out the couch on which he and maximus were to repose and then sitting down beside the stone lamp he drew forth his bible as was his wont and began to read  soon after lying down edith heard the deep voices of her companions engaged in earnest conversation but these sounds gradually died away and she fell asleep to dream of her berryravine at fort chimo  as the night wore on the deep breathing of the men told that they too had sought and found repose  the lamp burned slowly down and went out and when the moon threw her parting rays over the scene there was nothing to tell of the presence of human beings in that cold wild spot save two little white mounds on the frozen lake below    chapter twenty seven  frank morton gets into difficulties  chimos loud bark and the angry snarl of a large wolf as it darted away to seek the shelter of the kills were the sounds that awoke our travellers in the grey dawn of the following morning  frank started up seized his gun and darted through the doorway of the igloo in doing which he dashed the door of snow to atoms  he had only the satisfaction however of seeing the wolfs tail flourish in the air as the animal bounded over a snowdrift and disappeared in a ravine  ha how cold it is he exclaimed reentering the igloo hastily far having issued forth without his coat or cap the two minutes during which he stood exposed to the open air cooled him down nearly to the freezing point  hallo maximus jump up light the lamp while i fill the kettle  heyday it solidifies the very marrow in ones bones  ho edith up with you lazy thing there has been a wolf to bid you goodmorrow  while frank rattled on thus he belted his leathern coat round him put on his fur cap and prepared breakfast while edith rose and resumed the cap and cloak which she had put off on lying down to rest  maximus said frank after the first duties of the day were concluded we must now go and set the hooks but as cutting holes in the ice will occupy you some time ill take a short walk along the margin of the lake with my gun  be careful of edith till i return  so saying frank went off taking chimo along with him while maximus seized the axe and icechisel and began the laborious process of digging through to the water  the ice on the lake was five feet thick but by dint of great perseverance the esquimau succeeded in making several holes through it ere frank returned  each hole was large enough to contain the body of a man but a little wider above than below  in these holes were set stout codlines with hooks of about half an inch or more in diameter  they were made of white metal and clumsy enough to look at but fish in the lakes of ungava are not particular  these hooks were baited with lumps of sealfat and ere half an hour elapsed the success of the anglers was very decided and satisfactory  frank hauled up a whitefish of about six pounds weight at the first dip and scarcely had he thrown it on the ice when maximus gave a galvanic start hauled up his line a few yards with laughable eagerness then stopped suddenly under the impression apparently that it was a false alarm but another tug set him again in motion and in three seconds he pulled a fine laketrout of about ten pounds weight out of the hole  edith also who had a line under her care began to show symptoms of expectation  capital cried frank beating his hands violently against his shoulders for handling wet line with the thermometer at twenty below zero is decidedly cold workcapital we must set up a regular fishery here i think the fish are swarming  theres anothereh nohes off  oh oh oh shrieked edith in mingled fear and excitement as at each successive oh she received a jerk that wellnigh pulled her into the icehole  hold hard cried frank now then haul away  edith pulled and so did the fish but as it was not more than five pounds weight or so she overcame it after a severe struggle and landed a whitefish on the ice  the next shout that edith gave was of so very decided and thrilling a character that frank and maximus darted to her side in alarm and the latter caught the line as it was torn violently from her grasp  for a few minutes the esquimau had to allow the line to run out being unable to hold the fishat least without the risk of breaking his tackle but in a few seconds the motion of the line became less rapid and maximus held on while his huge body was jerked violently notwithstanding his weight and strength  soon the line relaxed a little and maximus ran away from the hole as fast as he could drawing the line after him when the fish reached the hole it offered decided resistance to such treatment and being influenced apparently by the wellknown proverb time abouts fair play it darted away in its turn causing the esquimau to give it line again very rapidly  he must be an enormously big fellow said frank as he and edith stood close to the hole watching the struggle with intense interest  the esquimau gave a broad grin  yis he most very biggesthie  the cause of this exclamation of surprise was the slacking of the line so suddenly that maximus was induced to believe the fish had escaped  him go beoff  ho yis  but he was wrong  another violent tug convinced him that the fish was still captivethough an unwilling oneand the struggle was renewed in about a quarter of an hour maximus dragged this refractory fish slowly into the hole and its snout appeared above water  oh what a fish exclaimed edith  put in de spear cried the esquimau  frank caught up a native spear which maximus had provided and just as the fish was about to recommence the struggle for its life he transfixed it through the gills and pinned it to the side of the icehole  the battle was over a few seconds sufficed to drag the fish from its native element and lay it at full length on the ice  and few anglers have ever had the pleasure of beholding such a prize it was a trout of fully sixty pounds weight and although such fish are seldom if ever found in other parts of the world they are by no means uncommon in the lakes of north america  having secured this noble fish maximus cut it open and cleaned it after which it was left to freeze  the other fish were then similarly treated and while the esquimau was thus engaged frank and edith continued their sport  but daylight in these far northern regions is very shortlived in winter and they were soon compelled unwillingly to leave off  now maximus said frank as they rolled up their lines i dont intend to keep you longer with us  edith and i can manage the fishing very well so you may return to your friends at false river and take the sealflesh for the dogs up to the fort  get the loan of some of their dogs and a sled to haul it and come round this way in passing so as to pick up any fish we may have ready for you  the moon will be up in a little so be off as fast as you can  in obedience to these orders maximus packed up a small quantity of provisions and bidding goodbye to his two friends set off to make the best of his way to the coast  that night frank and his little charge sat down to sup together in the igloo at the head of their snowtable and chimo acted the part of croupier in the room of the esquimau  and a pleasant evening they spent chatting and laughing and telling stories by the light of the stone lamp the mellow flame of which shed a warm influence over the sparkling dome of snow  before retiring to rest frank said that they must be up with the first light for he meant to have a hard days fishing but man little knows what a day may bring forth  neither frank nor edith dreamed that night of the events that were to happen on the morrow  on awaking in the morning they were again roused by the voice of the wolf which had visited them the day before  in order to catch this wolf maximus had just before starting constructed a trap peculiar to the esquimaux  it was simply a hole dug down through the ice at the edge of the lake not far from the igloo  this hole was just wide enough to admit the body of a wolf and the depth sufficient to render it absolutely impossible for the animal to thrust his snout to the bottom however long his neck might be  at the bottom a tempting piece of blubber in very high condition was placed  the result of this ingenious arrangement was most successful and we may add inevitable attracted by the smell of the meat our friend the wolf came trotting down to the lake just about daybreak and sneaked suspiciously up to the trap  he peeped in and licked his lips with satisfaction at the charming breakfast below  one would have thought as he showed his formidable white teeth that he was laughing with delight  then spreading out his fore legs so as to place his breast on the ice he thrust his head down into the hole and snapped at the coveted blubber but he had mistaken the depth and blaming himself no doubt for his stupidity he slid a little further forward and pushed his head deeper down  what not at it yet  oh this is preposterous  under this impression he rose shook himself and advancing his shoulders as far as prudence would allow again thrust down his head and stretched his neck until the very sinews cracked  then it was but not till then that the conviction was forced on him that that precious morsel was totally and absolutely beyond his reach altogether  drawing himself back he sat down on his haunches and uttered a snarling bark of dissatisfaction but the odour that ascended from that hole was too much for the powers of wolfish nature to resist  showing his teeth with an expression of mingled disappointment and ferocity he plunged his head into the hole once more  deeper and deeper still it went but the blubber was yet three inches from his eager nose  another shoveno dislocation alone could accomplish the object  his shoulders slid very imperceptibly into the hole  his nose was within an inch of the prize and he could actually touch it with his tongue  away with cowardly prudence what recked he of the consequences  up went his hind legs down went his head and the tempting bait was gained at last  alas for wolfish misfortunes  his fore legs were jammed immovably against his ribs  a touch of his hind foot on the ice would remedy this mishap but he was too far in for that  vigorously he struggled but in vain  the blood rushed to his head and the keen frost quickly put an end to his pains  in a few minutes he was dead and in half an hour he was frozen solid as a block of wood with his hind legs and tail pointing to the sky  it was at the consummation of this event that another wolf likewise attracted by the blubber trotted down the wild ravine and uttered a howl of delighted surprise as it rushed forward to devour its dead companionfor such is the custom among wolves  and this was the howl that called frank forth in time to balk its purpose  frank happened to be completely dressed at the time and as he saw the wolf bound away up the mountain gorge he seized his gun and snowshoes and hastily slung on his powderhorn and shotbelt  edith he cried as he was about to start i must give chase to that wolf  i wont be gone long  light the lamp and prepare breakfast dearat least as much of it as you can ill be back to complete it hallo chimo here chimo he shouted whistling to the dog which bounded forth from the door of the hut and followed his master up the ravine  edith was so well accustomed to solitary wanderings among the rugged glens in the neighbourhood of fort chimo that she felt no alarm on finding herself left alone in this wild spot  she knew that frank was not far off and expected him back in a few minutes  she knew also that wild animals are not usually so daring as to show themselves in open ground after the break of day particularly after the shouts of human beings have scared them to their dens so instead of giving a thought to any possible dangers that might threaten her she applied herself cheerfully and busily to the preparation of their morning meal first she lighted the lamp which instantly removed the gloom of the interior of the igloo whose little icewindow as yet admitted only the faint light of the grey dawn  then she melted a little snow and cleaned out the kettle in which she placed two cuts of fresh trout and having advanced thus far in her work thought it time to throw on her hood and peep out to see if frank was coming  but there was no sign of frank so she reentered the igloo and began to set things to rights she folded up the deerskins on which she had reposed and piled them at the head of the willow matting that formed her somewhat rough and unyielding mattress after which she arranged the ottoman and laid out the breakfast things on the snowtable  having accomplished all this to her entire satisfaction edith now discovered that the cuts of salmon were sufficiently well boiled and began to hope that frank would be quick lest the breakfast should be spoiled  under the influence of this feeling she threw on her hood a second time and going out upon the lake surveyed the shore with a scrutinising gaze  the sun was now so far above the natural horizon that the daylight was pretty clear but the high mountains prevented any of his direct rays from penetrating the gloom of the valley of the lake  still there was light enough to enable the solitary child to distinguish the objects on shore but franks tall form was not visible anywhere  heaving a slight sigh edith returned to the hut soliloquising thus as she wentdear me it is very strange that frank should stay away so long  i fear that the trout will be quite spoiled  perhaps it would be very good cold  no doubt of it  we shall have it cold and then i can get the tea ready  in pursuance of this plan the anxious little housekeeper removed the trout from the kettle which she cleaned out and refilled with snow when this was melted and boiled she put in the tea  in due time this also was ready and she sallied forth once more with a feeling approaching to anxiety to look for frank  still her companion did not make his appearance and for the first time a feeling of dread touched her heart  she strove to avert it however by considering that frank might have been obliged to follow the wolf farther than he expected or intended  then a thrill of fear passed through her breast as the thought occurred what if the wolf has attacked and killed him  as time wore on and no sound of voice or gun or bark of dog broke the dreary stillness of that gloomy place a feeling of intense horror took possession of the childs mind and she pictured to herself all kinds of possible evils that might have befallen her companion while at the same time she could not but feel how awful was her unprotected and helpless condition  one thought however comforted her and this was that maximus would certainly come to the hut on his return to the fort  this relieved her mind in regard to herself but the very relief on that point enabled her all the more to realise the dangers to which frank might be exposed without any one to render him assistance  the morning passed away the sun rose above the hills and the shortlived day drew towards its close still frank did not return and the poor child who watched so anxiously for him after many short and timid wanderings towards the margin of the lake returned to the igloo with a heart fluttering from mingled anxiety and terror  throwing herself on the deerskin couch she burst into a flood of tears  as she lay there sobbing bitterly she was startled by a noise outside the hut and ere she could spring from her recumbent position chimo darted through the open doorway with a cry between a whine and a bark and laid his head on ediths lap  oh what is it my dog  dear chimo where is frank cried the child passionately while she embraced her favourite with feelings of mingled delight and apprehension  is he coming chimo she said addressing the dumb animal as if she believed he understood her  then rising hastily she darted out once more to cast a longing expectant gaze towards the place where she had seen her companion disappear in the morning  but she was again doomed to disappointment  meanwhile chimos conduct struck her as being very strange  instead of receiving with his usual quiet satisfaction the caresses she heaped upon him he kept up a continual whine and ran about hither and thither without any apparent object in view  once or twice he darted off with a long melancholy howl towards the hills then stopping short suddenly stood still and looked round towards his young mistress  at first edith thought that the dog must have lost his master and had come back to the hut expecting to find him there  then she called him to her and examined his mouth expecting and dreading to find blood upon it  but there were no signs of his having been engaged in fighting with wolves so edith felt sure that frank must be safe from them at least as she knew that chimo was too brave to have left his master to perish alone  the dog submitted with much impatience to this examination and at last broke away from edith and ran yelping towards the hills again stopping as before and looking back  the resolute manner with which chimo did this and the frequency of its recurrence at length induced edith to believe that the animal wished her to follow him  instantly it occurred that he might conduct her to frank so without bestowing a thought on the danger of her forsaking the igloo she ran in for her snowshoes and putting on her hood and thick mittens followed the dog to the margin of the lake  chimes impatience seemed to subside immediately and he trotted rapidly towards the ravine into which frank had entered in pursuit of the wolf that morning  the dog paused ever and anon as they proceeded in order to give the child time to come up with him and so eager was edith in her adventure and so hopeful was she that it would terminate in her finding frank that she pressed forward at a rate which would have been utterly impossible under less exciting circumstances  at the foot of the ravine she found the remains of the wolf which had been caught in the snowtrap that morning  frank had merely pulled it out and cast it on the snow in passing and the torn fragments and scattered bones of the animal showed that its comrades had breakfasted off its carcass after frank had passed  here edith paused to put on her snowshoes for the snow in the ravine was soft being less exposed to the hardening action of the wind and the dog sat down to wait patiently until she was ready  now chimo go forward my good dog  i will follow you without fear she said when the lines were properly fastened to her feet  chimo waited no second command but threaded his way rapidly up the ravine among the stunted willow bushes  in doing so he had frequent occasion to wait for his young mistress whose strength was rapidly failing under the unwonted exertion she forced herself to make  at times she had to pause for breath and as she cast her eyes upwards and around at the dreary desolation of the rugged precipices which everywhere met her view she could with difficulty refrain from shedding tears  but ediths heart was warm and brave  the thought of frank being in some mysterious unknown danger infused new energy into her soul and strengthened her slight frame  having now recovered somewhat from the nervous haste which urged her to travel at a rate much beyond her capacity she advanced into the ravines of the mountains with more of that steady regular tramp which practice in the use of her snowshoes had taught her to assume so that being of a robust constitution naturally she became stronger and more able for her undertaking as she advanced  for nearly two hours chimo led edith into the midst of the mountains the scenery became if possible more savage as they proceeded and at length grew so rugged and full of precipices and dark gorges or rather splits in the hills that edith had much difficulty in avoiding the danger of falling over many of the latter which were partially concealed by and in some places entirely covered over with a crust of snow  fortunately as daylight waned a brilliant galaxy of stars shone forth enabling her to pick her steps  hitherto they had followed franks snowshoe track undeviatingly but near the top of a cliff chimo suddenly diverged to the left and led his mistress by a steep and tortuous natural path to the bottom  here he ran quickly forward uttering a low whine or whimper and disappeared round the corner of the precipice  hastening after the dog with a beating heart edith speedily gained the projection of the cliff on turning which she was startled and terrified by hearing a loud snarling bark mingled with a fierce growl  in another moment she beheld chimo bounding towards a gaunt savagelooking wolf which stood close beside the body of a man extended at full length upon the snow  at first the wolf did not seem inclined to retreat but the shriek which edith uttered on suddenly beholding the scene before her induced him to turn tail and fly  in another moment the terrified child sank exhausted on the snow beside the insensible form of frank morton    chapter twenty eight  edith becomes a heroine indeed  the shock which edith received on beholding the bloodstained countenance of her companion completely paralysed her at first but only for a few minutes  the feeling of certainty that frank would perish if assistance were not rendered tended to restore her scattered faculties and nerve her heart for the duties now required of her and she rose with a feeling of determination to save her companion or die beside him  pour child she little knew the extent of her own feebleness at that moment but she breathed an inward prayer to him who can and often does achieve the mightiest results by the feeblest means  raising franks head from the snow she placed it in her lap and with her handkerchief removed the blood from his forehead  in doing this she observed to her inexpressible relief that he breathed freely and seemed rather to be in a state of stupor than insensibility  the place where he lay was a dark rent or split in the mountain the precipices of which rose on either side to a height of between thirty and forty feet the top of this chasm was entirely covered over with a crust of snow through which there was a large gap immediately above the spot where frank lay revealing at once the cause of his present sad condition  he had evidently been crossing the ravine by means of the deceptive platform of snow unaware of the danger of his position and had been suddenly precipitated to the bottom  in descending his head had struck the side of the cliff which cut it severely but the softness of the snow into which he fell saved him from further injury except the stunning effect of the fall  how long he had lain in this state edith had no means of knowing but it must have been a considerable time as chimo could not have left him until after his fall  fortunately the wolf had not touched him and the wound in his head did not appear to be very deep  observing that parts of his face were slightly frostbitten edith commenced to rub them vigorously at the same time calling upon him in the most earnest tones to speak to her  the effect of this roused him a little  in a few minutes he opened his eyes and gazed languidly into the childs face  where am i eda he said faintly while a gentle smile played about his lips  you are in the mountains frank  dear frank do open your eyes again im so glad to hear your voice  are you better now  the sound of his voice attracted chimo who had long ago abandoned the pursuit of the wolf and was seated beside his master  rising he placed his cold nose on franks cheek  the action seemed to rouse him to the recollection of recent events  starting up on his knees with an angry shout frank seized the gun that lay beside him and raised it as if to strike the dog but he instantly let the weapon fall and exclaiming ah chimo is it you good dog he fell back again into the arms of his companion  edith wept bitterly for a few minutes while she tried in vain to awaken her companion from his state of lethargy  at length she dried her tears hastily and rising placed franks head on her warm cloak which she wrapped round his face and shoulders  then she felt his hands which though covered with thick leather mittens were very cold  making chimo couch at his feet so as to imbue them with some of his own warmth she proceeded to rub his hands and to squeeze and as it were shampoo his body all over as vigorously as her strength enabled her  in a few minutes the effect of this was apparent  frank raised himself on his elbow and gazed wildly round him  surely i must have fallen  where am i edith  gradually his faculties returned  edith edith he exclaimed in a low anxious voice i must get back to the igloo  i shall freeze here  fasten the lines of my snowshoes dear and i will rise  edith did as she was desired and immediately frank made a violent effort and stood upright but he swayed to and fro like a drunken man  let me lean on your shoulder dear eda he said in a faint voice  my head is terribly confused  lead me i cannot see well  the child placed his hand on her shoulder and they went forward a few paces togetheredith bending beneath the heavy weight of her companion  do i lean heavily said frank drawing his hand across his forehead poor child  as he spoke he removed his hand from her shoulder but the instant he did so he staggered and fell with a deep groan  o frank dear frank why did you do that said edith anxiously  you do not hurt me  i dont mind it  do try to rise again  frank tried and succeeded in walking in a sort of halfsleeping halfwaking condition for about a milestumbling as he went and often unwittingly crushing his little guide to the ground  after this he fell once more and could not again recover his upright position  poor edith now began to lose heart  the utter hopelessness of getting the wounded man to advance more than a few yards at a time and her own gradually increasing weakness induced the tears once more to start to her eyes she observed too that frank was sinking into that state of lethargy which is so dangerous in cold climates and she had much difficulty in preventing him from falling into that sleep which if indulged in is indeed the sleep of death  by persevering however she succeeded in rousing him so far as to creep a short distance now and then on his hands and kneessometimes to stagger a few paces forward and at length long after the cold moon had arisen on the scene they reached the margin of the lake  here frank became utterly powerless and no exertion on the part of his companion could avail to rouse him  in this dilemma edith once more wrapped him in her warm cloak and causing chimo to lie at his feet hastened over the ice towards the igloo  on arriving she lighted the lamp and heated the tea which she had made in the morning  this took at least a quarter of an hour to do and during the interval she endeavoured to allay her impatience by packing up a few mouthfuls of pemmican and biscuit  then she spread the deerskins out on the couch and when this was done the tea was thoroughly heated  the snow on the river being quite hard she needed not to encumber herself with snowshoes but she fastened the traces of her own little sledge over her shoulders and with the kettle in her hand ran as fast as her feet could carry her to the place where she had left frank and chimo and found them lying exactly as they lay when she left them  frank  frank here is some hot tea for you  do try to take some  but frank did not move so she had recourse to rubbing him again and had soon the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes  the instant he did so she repeated her earnest entreaties that he would take some tea in a few minutes he revived sufficiently to sit up and sip a little of the warm beverage  the effect was almost magical  the blood began to course more rapidly through his benumbed limbs and in five minutes more he was able to sit up and talk to his companion  now frank said edith with an amount of decision that in other circumstances would have seemed quite laughable try to get on to my sled and ill help you  the igloo is near at hand now  frank obeyed almost mechanically and creeping upon the sled with difficulty he fell instantly into a profound sleep  ediths chief anxiety was past now  harnessing chimo to the sled as well as she could she ran on before and a very few minutes brought them to the snowhut  here the work of rousing frank had again to be accomplished but the vigour which the warm tea had infused into his frame rendered it less difficult than heretofore and soon afterwards edith had the satisfaction of seeing her companion extended on his deerskin couch under the sheltering roof of the igloo  replenishing the lamp and closing the doorway with a slab of snow she sat down to watch by his side  chimo coiled himself quietly up at his feet while frank under the influence of the grateful warmth fell again into a deep slumber as the night wore on ediths eyes became heavy and she too resting her head on the deerskins slept till the lamp on the snowshelf expired and left the hut and its inmates in total darkness  contrary to ediths expectations frank was very little better when he awoke next day but he was able to talk to her in a faint voice and to relate how he had fallen over the cliff and how afterwards he had to exert his failing powers in order to defend himself from a wolf  in all these conversations his mind seemed to wander a little and it was evident that he had not recovered from the effects of the blow received on his head in the fall  for two days the child tended him with the affectionate tenderness of a sister but as he seemed to grow worse instead of better she became very uneasy and pondered much in her mind what she should do  at last she formed a strange resolution  supposing that maximus must still be at the esquimau village at the mouth of false river and concluding hastily that this village could not be very far away she determined to set out in search of it believing that if she found it the esquimau would convey her back to the igloo on the lake and take frank up to fort chimo where he could be properly tended and receive medicine  freaks and fancies are peculiar to children but the carrying of their freaks and fancies into effect is peculiar only to those who are precocious and daring in character  such was edith and no sooner had she conceived the idea of attempting to find the esquimau camp than she proceeded to put it in execution  frank was in so depressed a condition that she thought it better not to disturb or annoy him by arousing him so as to get him to comprehend what she was about to do so she was obliged to commune with herself sometimes even in an audible tone in default of any better counsellor  it is due to her to say that in remembrance of her mothers advice she sought the guidance of her heavenly father  long and earnest was the thought bestowed by this little child on the subject ere she ventured to leave her companion alone in the snowhut frank was able to sit up and to assist himself to the articles of food and drink which his little nurse placed within his reach so that she had no fear of his being in want of anything during the dayor two at mostthat she expected to be absent for in her childlike simplicity she concluded that if maximus could travel thither in a few hours she could not take much longer especially with such a good servant as chimo to lead the way  besides this she had observed the way in which the esquimau had set out and frank had often pointed out to her the direction in which the camp lay  she knew also that there was no danger from wild animals but determined nevertheless to build up the door of the igloo very firmly lest they should venture to draw near  she also put franks loaded gun in the spot where he was wont to place it so as to be ready to his hand  having made all her arrangements edith glided noiselessly from the hut harnessed her dog closed the door of the snowhut and jumping into the furs of her sledge was soon far away from the mountain lake  at first the dog followed what she thought must be the track that maximus had taken and her spirits rose when after an hours drive she emerged upon a boundless plain which she imagined must be the shores of the frozen sea where the esquimaux lived  encouraging chimo with her voice she flew over the level surface of the hard frozen snow and looked round eagerly in all directions for the expected signs of natives  but no such signs appeared and she began to fear that the distance was greater than she had anticipated  towards the afternoon it began to snow heavily  there was no wind and the snow fell in large flakes alighting softly and without any sound  this prevented her seeing any great distance and what was worse rendered the ground heavy for travelling  at length she came to a ridge of rocks and supposing that she might see to a greater distance from its summit she got out of the sledge and clambered up for the ground was too rough for the sledge to pass  here the view was dreary enoughnothing but plains and hummocks of ice and snow met her view except in one direction where she saw or fancied that she saw a clump of willows and what appeared to be a hut in the midst of them  running down the rugged declivity she crossed the plain and reached the spot but although the willows were there she found no hut  overcome with fatigue fear and disappointment she sat down on a wreath of snow and wept  but she felt that her situation was much too serious to permit of her wasting time in vain regrets so she started up and endeavoured to retrace her steps  this however was now a matter of difficulty  the snow fell so thickly that her footsteps were almost obliterated and she could not see ten yards before her  after wandering about for a few minutes in uncertainty she called aloud to chimo hoping to hear his bark in reply  but all was silent  chimo was not indeed unfaithful  he heard the cry and responded to it in the usual way by bounding in the direction whence it came  his progress however was suddenly arrested by the sledge which caught upon and was jammed amongst the rocks  fiercely did chimo strain and bound but the harness was tough and the sledge immovable  meanwhile the wind arose and although it blew gently it was sufficient to prevent edith overhearing the whining cries of her dog  for a time the child lost all selfcommand and rushed about she knew not whither in the anxious desire to find her sledge then she stopped and restrained the pantings of her breath while with both hands pressed tightly over her heart as if she would fain stop the rapid throbbing there she listened long and intently  but no sound fell upon her ear except the sighing of the cold breeze as it swept by and no sight met her anxious gaze save the thickly falling snowflakes  sinking on her knees edith buried her face in her hands and gave full vent to the pentup emotions of her soul as the conviction was at length forced upon her mind that she was a lost wanderer in the midst of that cold and dreary waste of snow    chapter twenty nine  a dark cloud of sorrow envelops fort chimo  three days after the events narrated in the last chapter the fort of the furtraders became a place of weeping for on the morning of that day maximus arrived with the prostrate form of frank morton whom he had discovered alone in the igloo on the lake and with the dreadful news that little edith stanley was nowhere to be found  it may be more easily imagined than described the state of mind into which the parents of the child were thrown but after the first burst of emotion was past stanley felt that a thorough and immediate search was the only hope that remained to him of finding his little one alive still when he considered the intensity of the cold to which she must have been exposed and the length of time which had already elapsed since she was missed his heart sank and he could scarcely frame words of comfort to his prostrated partner  maximus had examined the immediate neighbourhood of the lake in the hope of finding the tracks of the lost one but a heavy fall of snow had totally obliterated these and he wisely judged that it would be better to convey the sick man to the fort as quickly as possible and give the alarm so that parties might be sent out to scour the country in all directions  frank was immediately put to bed on his arrival and everything done in order to restore him  in this attempt they succeeded so far as to obtain all the information he could give concerning his fall but he remembered nothing further than that edith had been the means of bringing him to the snowhut where he lay in a deep torpid slumber until the voice and hand of maximus awakened him  when frank was told that edith was lost he sprang from his bed as if he had received an electric shock  the confusion of his faculties seemed swept away and he began to put on his garments with as much vigour as if he were well and strong but ere he belted on his leather coat his cheek grew pale his hand trembled and he fell in a swoon upon the bed  this convinced him of the impossibility of doing anything in the search and he was prevailed on after two or three similar failures to leave the work to others  meanwhile the mountains and valleys of ungava were traversed far and near by the agonised father and his men  the neighbourhood of the lake was the first place searched and they had not sought long ere they discovered the little sledge sticking fast among the rocks of the seacoast and chimo lying in the traces almost dead with cold and hunger  the dog had kept himself alive by gnawing the deerskin of which the traces were made  around this spot the search was concentrated and the esquimaux of the neighbouring camp were employed in traversing the country in all directions but although scarce a foot of ground escaped the eager scrutiny of one or other of the party not a vestige of edith was to be seennot so much as a footprint in the snow  days and nights flew by and still the search was continued  frank quickly recovered under the affectionate care of the almost heartbroken mother who found some relief from her crushing sorrow in ministering to his wants  but the instant he could walk without support and long before it was prudent to do so frank joined in the search  at first he could do little but as day after day passed by his strength returned so rapidly that the only symptoms that remained to tell of his late accident were his pale cheek and the haggard expression of his countenance  but the mysterious disappearance of edith had more to do with the latter than illness  weeks passed away but still the dark cloud of sorrow hung over fort chimo for the merry young voice that was wont to awake the surrounding echoes was gone  the systematic search had now been given up for every nook every glen and gorge and corrie within fifteen miles of the spot where they had found the little sledge had been searched again and again without success  but hope clung with singular tenacity to the parents hearts long after it had fled from those of the men of the fort and of the esquimaux  every alternate day stanley and frank sallied forth with heavy steps and furrowed brows to explore more carefully those places where the child was most likely to have strayed expecting yet fearing to find her dead body  but they always returned to the bereaved mother with silent lips and downcast looks  they frequently conversed together about her and always in a hopeful tone each endeavouring to conceal from the other the real state of his own mind  indeed except when necessity required it they seldom spoke on any other subject  one day stanley and frank were seated by the blazing stove in the hall conversing as usual about the plan of the search for that day  mrs stanley was busied in preparing breakfast  tis going to blow hard from the north frank said stanley rising and looking out of the window i see the icebergs coming into the river with the tide  you will have a cold march i fear  frank made no reply but rose and approached the window  the view from it was a strange one  during the night a more than usually severe frost had congealed the water of the lake in the centre and the icebergs that sailed towards the caniapuscaw river in stately grandeur went crashing through this young ice as if it had been paper their slow but steady progress receiving no perceptible check from its opposition  some of these bergs were of great size and in proceeding onwards they passed so close to the fort that the inhabitants feared more than once that a falling pinnacle might descend on the stores which were built near to the waters edge and crush them  as the tide gradually rose it rushed with violence into the cavities beneath the solid ice on the opposite shore and finding no escape save through a few rents and fissures sent up columns or spouts of white spray in all directions which roared and shrieked as they flew upwards as if the great ocean were maddened with anger at finding a power strong enough to restrain and curb its might at intervals the main ice rent with a crash like the firing of artillery and as if nature had designed to carry on and deepen this simile the shore was lined with heaps of little blocks of ice which the constantly recurring action of the tide had moulded into the shape and size of cannon balls  but such sights were common to the inhabitants of fort chimo and had long ago ceased to call forth more than a passing remark  may it not be possible murmured stanley while he leant his brow on his hand that she may have gone up false river  i think not said frank  i know not how it is but i have a strange conviction that she is yet alive  if she had perished in the snow we should certainly have found her long ago  i cannot explain my feelings or give a reason for them but i feel convinced that darling eda is alive  oh god grant it whispered stanley in a deep voice while his wife hastened from the room to conceal the tears which she could not restrain  while frank continued to gaze in silence on the bleak scene without a faint sound of sleighbells broke upon his ear  hark he cried starting and opening the door  the regular and familiar sound of the bells came floating sweetly on the breeze  they grew louder and louder and in a few seconds a team of dogs galloped into the fort dragging a small sled behind them  they were followed by two stalwart indians whose costume and manner told that they were in the habit of associating more with the furtraders than with their own kindred  the dogs ran the sled briskly into the centre of the fort and lay down panting on the snow while the two men approached the hall  tis a packet cried stanley forgetting for the moment his sorrow in the excitement of this unexpected arrival  in a moment all the men at the fort were assembled in the square  a packet  where come you from  from moose fort replied the elder indian while his comrade unfastened from the sled a little bundle containing letters  any news  are all well chorused the men  ay all well  it is many day since we left  the way is very rough and we did not find much deer  we saw one camp of indian but they fraid to come  i not know why  but i see with them one fair flower which grow in the fields of the esquimaux  i suppose the indian pluck her and dare not come back here  stanley started and his cheek grew pale  a fair flower say you  speak literally man was it a little white girl that you saw  no replied the indian it was no white girl we saw  it was one young esquimau woman  stanley heaved a deep sigh and turned away muttering ah  i might have known that she could not have fallen into the hands of indians so far to the south  well lads take care of these fellows he cried crushing down the feelings that had been for a brief moment awakened in his heart by the indians words and give them plenty to eat and smoke  so saying he went off with the packet followed by frank  niver fear ye come along honey said bryan grasping the elder indian by the arm while the younger was carried off by massan and the dogs taken care of by maistequan and gaspard  on perusing the letters stanley found that it would be absolutely necessary to send a packet of dispatches to headquarters  the difficulties of his position required to be more thoroughly explained and erroneous notions corrected  what shall i do frank said he with a perplexed look  these indians cannot return to moose having received orders i find to journey in a different direction  our own men know the way but i cannot spare the good ones among them and the secondrate cannot be depended on without a leader  frank did not give an immediate reply  he seemed to be pondering the subject in his mind  at length he said could not dick prince be spared  no he is too useful here  the fact is frank i think i must send you  it will do you good my dear boy and tend to distract your mind from a subject which is now hopeless  frank at first objected strongly to this plan on the ground that it would prevent him from assisting in the forlorn search for edith but stanley pointed out that he and the men could continue it and that on the other hand his franks personal presence at headquarters would be of great importance to the interests of the company  at length frank was constrained to obey  the route by which he purposed to travel was overland to richmond gulf on snowshoes and as the way was rough he determined to take only a few days provisions and depend for subsistence on the hook and gun maximus oolibuck and maistequan were chosen to accompany him and three better men he could not have had for they were stalwart and brave and accustomed from infancy to live by the chase and traverse trackless wastes guided solely by that power of observation or instinct with which savages are usually gifted  with these men a weeks provisions a large supply of ammunition a small sledge and three dogs of whom chimo was the leader frank one morning ascended the rocky platform behind the fort and bidding adieu to ungava commenced his long journey over the interior of east main    chapter thirty  an old friend amid new friends and noveltiesa desperate battle and a glorious victory  the scene of our story is now changed and we request our patient reader to fly away with us deeper into the north beyond the regions of ungava and far out upon the frozen sea  here is an island which for many long years has formed a refuge to the roedeer during the winter at which season these animals having forsaken the mainland in autumn dwell upon the islands of the sea  at the time of which we write the island in question was occupied by a tribe of esquimaux who had built themselves as curious a village as one could wish to see  the island had little or no wood on it and the few willow bushes that showed their heads above the deep snow were stunted and thin  such as they were however they along with a ledge of rock over which the snow had drifted in a huge mound formed a sort of protection to the village of the esquimaux and sheltered it from the cold blasts that swept over the frozen sea from the regions of the far north  there were about twenty igloos in the village all of which were built in the form of a dome exactly similar to the hut constructed by maximus on the lake  they were of various sizes and while some stood apart with only a small igloo attached others were congregated in groups and connected by low tunnels or passages  the doorways leading into most of them were so low that the natives were obliged to creep out and in on their hands and knees but the huts themselves were high enough to permit the tallest man of the tribe to stand erect and some of them so capacious that a family of six or eight persons could dwell in them easily  we may remark however that esquimau ideas of roominess and comfort in their dwellings differ very considerably from ours  their chief aim is to create heat and for this end they cheerfully submit to what we would consider the discomfort of crowding and close air  the village at a little distance bore a curious resemblance to a cluster of white beehives and the round soft hairy natives creeping out and in continually and moving about amongst them were not unlike with the aid of a little imagination to a swarm of monstrous black beesan idea which was further strengthened by the continuous hum that floated on the air over the busy settlement  kayaks and oomiaks lay about in several places supported on blocks of ice and sealspears paddles dans lances coils of walrusline and other implements were intermingled in rare confusion with sledges sealskins junks of raw meat and bones on which latter the numerous dogs of the tribe were earnestly engaged  in the midst of this village stood a hut which differed considerably from those around  it was built of clear ice instead of snow  there were one or two other igloos made of the same material but none so large clean or elegant as this one  the walls which were perpendicular were composed of about thirty large square blocks cemented together with snow and arranged in the form of an octagon the roof was a dome of snow  a small porch or passage also of ice stood in front of the low doorway which had been made high enough to permit the owner of the mansion to enter by stooping slightly  in front and all around this hut the snow was carefully scraped and all offensive objectssuch as seal and whale blubberremoved giving to it an appearance of cleanliness and comfort which the neighbouring igloos did not possess  inside of this icy residence on a couch of deerskin was seated edith stanley  on that terrible night when the child lost her way in the dreary plain she had wandered she knew not whither until she was suddenly arrested by coming to the edge of the solid ice on the shores of ungava bay here the high winds had broken up the ice and the black waters of the sea now rolled at her feet and checked her progress  terrified at this unexpected sight edith endeavoured to retrace her steps but she found to her horror that the ice on which she stood was floating and that the wind having shifted a point to the eastward was driving it across to the west side of the bay  here in the course of the next day it grounded and the poor child benumbed with cold and faint with hunger crept as far as she could on to the firm land and then lay down as she thought to die  but it was otherwise ordained  in less than half an hour afterwards she was found by a party of esquimaux  these wild creatures had come from the eastward in their dogsledges and having passed well out to the seaward in order to avoid the open water off the mouth of false river had missed seeing their countrymen there and therefore knew nothing of the establishment of fort chimo  in bending towards the land again after passing the bay they came upon ediths tracks and after a short search they found her lying on the snow  words cannot convey an adequate impression of the unutterable amazement of these poor creatures as they beheld the fair child so unlike anything they had ever seen or imagined but whatever may have been their thoughts regarding her they had sense enough to see that she was composed of flesh and blood and would infallibly freeze if allowed to lie there much longer  they therefore lifted her gently upon one of the large sleighs and placed her on a pile of furs in the midst of a group of women and children who covered her up and chafed her limbs vigorously  meanwhile the drivers of the sledges of which there were six with twenty dogs attached to each plied their long whips energetically the dogs yelled in consternation and darting away with the sledges as if they had been feathers the whole tribe went hooting yelling and howling away over the frozen sea  the surprise of the savages when they found edith was scarcely if at all superior to that of edith when she opened her eyes and began to comprehend somewhat confusedly her peculiar position  the savages watched her movements openmouthed with intense curiosity and seemed overjoyed beyond expression when she at length recovered sufficiently to exclaim feeblywhere am i where are you taking me to  we need scarcely add that she received no reply to her questions for the natives did not understand a word of her language and with the exception of the names of one or two familiar objects she did not understand a word of theirs  of how far or how long they travelled edith could form no idea as she slept profoundly during the journey and did not thoroughly recover her strength and faculties until after her arrival at the camp  for many days after reaching the esquimau village poor edith did nothing but weep for besides the miserable circumstances in which she was now placed she was much too considerate and unselfish in her nature to forget that her parents would experience all the misery of supposing her dead and added to this was the terrible supposition that the natives into whose hands she had fallen might never hear of fort chimo  the distracted child did her utmost by means of signs to make them understand that such a place existed but her efforts were of no avail either she was not eloquent in the language of signs or the natives were obtuse  as time abated the first violence of her grief she began to entertain a hope that ere long some wandering natives might convey intelligence of her to the furtraders  as this hope strengthened she became more cheerful and resolved to make a number of little ornaments with her name inscribed on them which she meant to hang round the necks of the chief men of the tribe so that should any of them ever chance to meet with the furtraders these ornaments might form a clue to her strange residence  a small medal of whalebone seemed to her the most appropriate and tractable material but it cost her many long and weary hours to cut a circular piece of this tough material with the help of an esquimau knife  when she had done it however several active boys who had watched the operation with much curiosity and interest no sooner understood what she wished to make than they set to work and cut several round pieces of ivory or walrustusk which they presented to their little guest who scratched the name edith on them and hung them round the necks of the chief men of the tribe  the esquimaux smiled and patted the childs fair head kindly as they received this piece of attention which they flattered themselves no doubt was entirely disinterested and complimentary  winter wore gradually away and the ice upon the sea began to show symptoms of decay opposite to the camp of the esquimaux  during the high winds of spring the drift had buried the village so completely that the beehives were scarcely visible and the big black bees walked about on the top of their igloos and had to cut deep down in order to get into them  for some time past the natives had been unsuccessful in their sealhunting and as seals and walruses constituted their chief means of support they were reduced to short allowance  ediths portion however had never yet been curtailed  it was cooked for her over the stone lamp belonging to an exceedingly fat young woman whose igloo was next to that of the little stranger and whose heart had been touched by the childs sorrow afterwards it was more deeply touched by her gratitude and affection  this womans name was kaga and she with the rest of her tribe having been instructed carefully by edith in the pronunciation of her own name ended in calling their little guest eeduck  kaga had a stout burly husband named annatock who was the best hunter in the tribe she also had a nephew about twelve or fourteen years old named peetoot who was very fond of edith and extremely attentive to her  kaga had also a babya mere bag of fatto which edith became so attached that she almost constituted herself its regular nurse and when the weather was bad so as to confine her to the house she used to take it from its mother carry it off to her own igloo and play with it the whole day much in the same way as little girls play with dollswith this difference however that she considerately restrained herself from banging its nose against the floor or punching out its eyes  it was a bright clear warm day  four mock suns encircled and emulated in brilliancy their great original  the balmy air was beginning to melt the surface of the snow and the igloos that had stood firm for full half a year were gradually becoming dangerous to walk over and unsafe to sit under  considerable bustle prevailed in the camp for a general sealhunting expedition was on foot and the men of the tribe were preparing their dogsledges and their spears  edith was in her igloo of ice seated on the soft pile of deerskins which formed her bed at night and her sofa by day and worrying kagas baby which laughed vociferously  the inside of this house or apartment betokened the taste and neatness of its occupant  the snow roof having begun to melt had been removed and was replaced by slabs of ice which with the transparent walls admitted the suns rays in a soft bluish light which cast a fairylike charm over the interior  on a shelf of ice which had been neatly fitted into the wall by her friend peetoot lay a rude knife a few pieces of whalebone and ivory the remains of the material of which her medals had been made and an ivory cup  the floor was covered with willow matting and on the raised half of it were spread several deerskins with the hair on  a canopy of willow boughs was erected over this  on another shelf of ice near the head of the bed stood a small stone lamp which had been allowed to go out the weather being warm  the only other articles of furniture in this simple apartment were a square table and a square stool both made of ice blocks and covered with sealskins  while edith and her living doll were in the height of their uproarious intercourse they were interrupted by peetoot who burst into the room more like a hairy wildmanothewood than a human being  he carried a short spear in one hand and with the other pointed in the direction of the shore at the same time uttering a volley of unintelligible sounds which terminated with an emphatic eeduck  ediths love for conversation whether she made herself understood or not had increased rather than abated in her peculiar circumstances  what is it peetoot  why do you look so excited  oh dear i wish i understood youindeed i do  but its of no use your speaking so fastbe quiet baby darlingi see you want me to do or say something what can it be i wonder  edith looked into the boys face with an air of perplexity  again peetoot commenced to vociferate and gesticulate violently but seeing as he had often seen before that his young friend did not appear to be much enlightened he seized her by the arm and as a more summary and practical way of explaining himself dragged her towards the door of the hut  oh the baby screamed edith breaking from him and placing her charge in the farthest and safest part of the couch  now ill go with you though i dont understand what you want  well i suppose i shall find out in time as usual  having led edith towards the beach peetoot pointed to his uncles sledge to which the dogs were already harnessed and made signs that edith should go with them  oh i understand you now  well it is a charming day i think i will do you think annatock will let me  oh you dont understand  never mind wait till i put on my hood and return the baby to its mother  in two minutes edith reappeared in her fur cloak and indian hood with the fat baby sprawling and laughing on her shoulder  that baby never cried  it seemed as though it had resolved to substitute laughing in its stead  once only had edith seen tears in its little black eyes and that was when she had given it a spoonful of soup so hot that its mouth was scalded by it  several of the sledges had already left the island and were flying at full speed over the frozen sea deviating ever and anon from the straight line in order to avoid a hummock of ice or a gap of open water caused by the separation of masses at the falling of the tide while the men shouted and the dogs yelled as they observed the flourish of the cruelly long and heavy lash  shall i get in said edith to annatock with an inquiring look as she approached the place where the sledge was standing  the esquimau nodded his shaggy head and showed a row of remarkably white teeth environed by a thick black beard and moustache by way of reply to the look of the child  with a laughing nod to kaga who stood watching them edith stepped in and seated herself on a deerskin robe annatock and peetoot sat down beside her the enormous whip gave a crack like a pistolshot and the team of fifteen dogs uttering a loud cry bounded away over the sea  the sledge on which edith was seated was formed very much in the same manner as the little sled which had been made for her at fort chimo  it was very much larger how ever and could have easily held eight or ten persons  the runners which were shod with frozen mud a substance that was now becoming nearly unfit for use owing to the warm weather were a perfect wonder of ingenuityas indeed was the whole machinebeing pieced and lashed together with lines of raw hide in the most complicated manner and very neatly  the dogs were each fastened by a separate line to the sledge the best dog being placed in the centre and having the longest line while the others were attached by lines proportionably shorter according to the distance of each from the leading dog and the outsiders being close to the runners of the sledge all the lines were attached to the front bar of the machine  there were many advantages attending this mode of harnessing among which were the readiness with which any dog could be attached or detached without affecting the others and the ease with which annatock when so inclined could lay hold of the line of a refractory dog haul him back without stopping the others and give him a cuffing  this however was seldom done as the driver could touch any member of the team with the point of his whip  the handle of this terrible instrument was not much more than eighteen or twenty inches long but the lash was upwards of six yards  near the handle it was about three inches broad being thick cords of walrushide platted it gradually tapered towards the point where it terminated in a fine line of the same material  while driving the long lash of this whip trails on the snow behind the sledge and by a peculiar sleight of hand its serpentine coils can be brought up for instant use  no backwoodsman of kentucky was ever more perfect in the use of his pearifle or more certain of his aim than was annatock with his murderous whip  he was a dead shot so to speak  he could spread intense alarm among the dogs by causing the heavy coil to whiz over them within a hairsbreadth of their heads or he could gently touch the extreme tip of the ear of a skulker to remind him of his duty to his master and his comrades or in the event of the warning being neglected he could bring the point down on his flank with a crack like a pistolshot that would cause skin and hair to fly and spread yelping dismay among the entire pack  and how they did run  the sledge seemed a mere feather behind the powerful team  they sprang forth at full gallop now bumping over a small hummock or diverging to avoid a large one anon springing across a narrow gap in the ice or sweeping like the snowdrift over the white plain while the sledge sprang and swung and bounded madly on behind them and annatock shouted as he flourished his great whip in the excitement of their rapid flight and peetoot laughed with wild delight and edith sat clasping her hands tightly over her kneesher hood thrown back her fair hair blown straight out by the breeze her cheeks flushed her lips parted and her eyes sparkling with emotion as they whirled along in their mad and swift career  in half an hour the low village was out of sight and in half an hour more they arrived at the place where a number of the esquimaux were scattered in twos and threes over the ice searching for sealholes and preparing to catch them  what is that man doing cried edith pointing to an esquimau who having found a hole had built a semicircular wall of snow round it to protect him from the light breeze that was blowing and was sitting when edith observed him in the attitude of one who listened intently the hood of his sealskin coat was over his head so that his features were concealed  at his feet lay a stout barbed sealspear the handle of which was made of wood and the barb and lower part of ivory  a tough line was attached to this and the other end of it was fastened round the mans waist for when an esquimau spears a seal he prepares to conquer or to die  if he does not haul the animal out of the hole there is every probability that it will haul him into it  but the esquimau has laid it down as an axiom that a man is more than a match for a seal therefore he ties the line round his waistwhich is very much like nailing the colours to the mast  there seems to be no allowance made for the chance of an obstreperously large seal allowing himself to be harpooned by a preposterously small esquimau but we suppose that this is the exception to the rule  as edith gazed the esquimau put out his hand with the stealthy motion of a cat and lifted his spear  the next instant the young ice that covered the hole was smashed and in an instant after the ivory barb was deep in the shoulder of an enraged seal which had thus fallen a sacrifice to his desire for fresh air  the esquimau immediately lay back almost at full length with his heels firmly imbedded in two notches cut in the ice at the edge of the hole the seal dived and the mans waist seemed to be nearly cut in two  but the rope was tough and the man was stout and although the seal was both it was conquered in the course of a quarter of an hour hauled out and thrown exultingly upon the ice  this man had only watched at the sealhole a couple of hours but the natives frequently sit behind their snow walls for the greater part of a day almost without moving hand or foot  having witnessed this capture annatock drove on until the most of his countrymen were left behind  suddenly he called to the dogs to halt and spoke in a deep earnest tone to his nephew while both of them gazed intently towards a particular quarter of the sea  edith looked in the same direction and soon saw the object that attracted their attention but the only thing it seemed like to her was an enormous cask or barrel  what is it said she to peetoot as annatock selected his largest spear and hastened towards the object  of course edith received no reply save a broad grin but the little fellow followed up this remark if we may so call it by drawing his fingers through his lips and licking them in a most significant manner meanwhile annatock advanced rapidly towards the object of interest keeping carefully behind hummocks of ice as he went and soon drew near enough to make certain that it was a walrus apparently sound asleep with its blunt snout close to its hole ready to plunge in should an enemy appear  annatock now advanced more cautiously and when within a hundred yards of the huge monster lay down at full length on his breast and began to work his way towards it after the manner of a seal  he was so like a seal in his hairy garments that he might easily have been mistaken for one by a more intellectual animal than a walrus  but the walrus did not awake and he approached to within ten yards  then rising suddenly to his feet annatock poised the heavy weapon and threw it with full force against the animals side  it struck and as if it had fallen on an adamantine rock it bounded off and fell upon the ice with its hard point shattered and its handle broken in two  for one instant annatocks face blazed with surprise the next it relapsed into fifty dimples as he roared and tossed up his arms with delight at the discovery that the walrus had been frozen to death beside its hole  this catastrophe is not of unfrequent occurrence to these elephants of the northern seas  they are in the habit of coming up occasionally through their holes in the ice to breathe and sometimes they crawl out in order to sleep on the ice secure in the protection of their superabundant fat from being frozenat least easily  when they have had enough of sleep or when the prickling sensation on their skin warns them that nothing is proof against the cold of the polar seas and that they will infallibly freeze if they do not make a precipitate retreat to the comparatively warm waters below they scramble to their holes crush down the new ice with their tusks and thick heads and plunge in  but sometimes the ice which forms on the holes when they are asleep is too strong to be thus broken in which case the hapless monster lays him down and dies  such was the fate of the walrus which annatock was now cutting up with his axe into portable blocks of beef  for several days previous to the thaw which had now set in the weather had been intensely cold and the walrus had perished in consequence of its ambitious desire to repose in the regions above  not far from the spot where this fortunate discovery had been made there was a large sheet of recentlyformed black ice where the main ice had been broken away and the open water left  the sheet although much melted by the thaw was still about three inches thick and quite capable of supporting a man  while annatock was working with his back to this ice he heard a tremendous crash take place behind him  turning hastily round he observed that the noise was caused by another enormous walrus the glance of whose large round eyes and whose loud snort showed clearly enough that he was not frozen like his unfortunate companion by this time the little boy had come up with edith and the sledge  so annatock ordered him to take the dogs behind a hummock to keep them out of sight while he selected several strong harpoons and a lance from the sledge  giving another lance to peetoot he signed to edith to sit on the hummock while he attacked the grisly monster of the deep  while these preparations were being made the walrus dived and while it was under water the man and the boy ran quickly forward a short distance and then lay down behind a lump of ice  scarcely had they done so when the walrus came up again with a loud snort splashing the water with its broad heavy flipperswhich seemed a sort of compromise between legs and finsand dashing waves over the ice as it rolled about its large unwieldy carcass  it was truly a savagelooking monster as large as a small elephant and having two tusks of a foot and a half long  the face bore a horrible resemblance to that of a man  its crown was round and bulging its face broad and massive and a thick bristling moustacherough as the spines of a porcupinecovered its upper lip and depended in a shaggy dripping mass over its mouth  after spluttering about a short time it dived again  now was annatocks time  seizing a harpoon and a coil of line he muttered a few words to the boy sprang up and running out upon the smooth ice stood by the edge of the open water  he had not waited here more than a few seconds when the black waters were cleft by the blacker head of the monster as it once more ascended to renew its elephantine gambols in the pool  as it rose the esquimau threw up his arm and poised the harpoon  for one instant the surprised animal raised itself breasthigh out of the water and directed a stare of intense astonishment at the man  that moment was fatal  annatock buried the harpoon deep under its left flipper  with a fierce bellow the brute dashed itself against the ice endeavouring in its fury to reach its assailant but the ice gave way under its enormous weight while annatock ran back as far as the line attached to the harpoon would permit him  the walrus seeing that it could not reach its enemy in this way seemed now to be actually endued with reason  it took a long gaze at annatock and then dived  but the esquimau was prepared for this  he changed his position hastily and played his line the meanwhile fixing the point of his lance into the ice in order to give him a more effective hold scarcely had he done so than the spot he had just left was smashed up and the head of the walrus appeared grinning and bellowing as if in disappointment  at this moment peetoot handed his uncle a harpoon and ere the animal dived the weapon was fixed in his side  once more annatock changed his position and once again the spot on which he had been standing was burst upwards  it was a terrible sight to see that unearthlylooking monster smashing the ice around it and lashing the bloodstained sea into foam while it waged such mortal war with the selfpossessed and wary man  how mighty and strong the one how comparatively weak and seemingly helpless the other  it was the triumph of mind over matterof reason over blind brute force  but annatock fought a hard battle that day ere he came off conqueror  harpoon after harpoon was driven into the walrus again and again the lance pierced deep into its side and drank its lifeblood but three hours had passed away before the dead carcass was dragged from the deep by the united force of dogs and man  during this terrible combat edith had looked on with such intense interest that she could scarcely believe her eyes when she found from the position of the sun that the day was far advanced it was too late now to think of cutting up the carcasses without assistance so annatock determined to return home and tell his countrymen of his good fortune  it is a custom among the esquimaux to consider every animal that is killed as the common property of allthe successful hunter being entitled to all the titbits besides his portion of the equal dividend so that annatock knew he had only to give the signal and every ablebodied man in the village and not a few of the women and children would descend like vultures on the spoil  jumping into his sledge he stretched out his exhausted frame at full length beside edith and committed the whip to peetoot  im so glad cried edith with a beaming face that we have killed this beast  the poor people will have plenty to eat now  ha ha ha roared peetoot giving increased emphasis to each successive shout and prolonging the last into a yell of delight as he cracked the ponderous whip from side to side like a volley of pistolry  o peetoot exclaimed edith in a remonstrative tone as the sledge swayed to and fro with the rate at which they were sweeping over the plain dont drive so fast you will kill the poor dogs  ho ho hooo  eeduck roared the boy aiming a shot at the leaders left ear and bringing the thick end of the whip down on the flanks of the six hindmost dogs  thus amid a volley of roars remonstrances yells yelps and pistolry edith and her friends scoured over the frozen sea and swept into the esquimau camp like a whirlwind    chapter thirty one  another desperate battle and a decided victorythe esquimaux suffer a severe loss  the night that followed the day of which we have given an account in the last chapter was a night of rest to edith but not to the esquimaux  scarcely allowing themselves time to harness their dogs after the news reached them they set off for the scene of action in a body  every sledge was engaged every ablebodied male and female started  none were left in camp except the sick of whom there were few and the aged of whom there were fewer  while engaged in the hurried preparations for departure the women sang with delight for they had been living on very short allowance for some weeks past and starvation had been threatening them so that the present success diffused among these poor creatures a universal feeling of joy  but their preparations were not numerous  a short scene of excited bustle followed annatocks arrival a few yells from the dogs at starting and the deserted camp was so silent and desolate that it seemed as if human beings had not been there for centuries  it did not continue long however in this state  two or three hours later and the first of the return parties arrived groaning under the burdens they carried and dragged behind them  the walrusflesh was packed on the dogsledges but as for the few seals that had been caught they were sledges to themselvescords being tied to their tails to which a dozen natives attached themselves and dragged the carcasses over the snow  peetoot whose spirit that night seemed to be intoxicated with success and who felt that he was the lion of the night after annatock seated himself astride of one of the dead seals and was dragged into camp on this novel sledge shouting a volley of unintelligible jargon at the top of his voice in the midst of which eeduck frequently resounded  at length the last lingerer arrived and then began a feast of the most extraordinary kind  the walrusflesh was first conveyed to the igloo of annatock where it was cut up and distributed among the natives  the women seemed quite frantic with joy and went about from hut to hut embracing one another by way of congratulation  soon the lamps of the village were swimming with oil the steaks stewing and roasting the children provided with pieces of raw blubber to keep them quiet while the larger portions were being cooked and the entire community gormandising and rejoicing as savages are wont to do when suddenly visited with plenty in the midst of starvation  during all this scene edith went about from hut to hut enjoying herself  nay reader be not horrified thou knowest not the pliable and accommodating nature of humanity  edith did not enjoy the filth by which she was surroundedfar from it neither did she enjoy the sight of raw blubber being sucked by little babies especially by her own favourite but she did enjoy the sight of so much plenty where but a few hours ago starvation had begun to threaten a visit and she did enjoy and heartily sympathise with the undoubted and great happiness of her hospitable friends  a very savoury dish with a due proportion of lean to the fat cut specially to suit her taste smoked on eeducks table that night and peetoot and the baby helped her to eat it  really it would be a matter of nice calculation to ascertain whether peetoot or the baby laughed most on this jovial occasion  undoubtedly the former had the best of it in regard to mere noise nevertheless the pipe of the latter was uncommonly shrill and at times remarkably racy and obstreperous  but as the hours flew by the children throughout the camp generally fell asleep while their seniors sat quietly and contentedly round their kettles and lamps eating and slumbering by turns  the amount of food consumed was enormous and quite beyond the belief of men accustomed to the appetites of temperate zones but we beg them to remember that arctic frosts require to be met with arctic stimulants and of these an immense quantity of unctuous food is the best  next morning the esquimaux were up and away by daybreak with their dogs and sledges to bring home the remainder of the walrusmeat for these poor people are not naturally improvident and do not idle their time in luxurious indolence until necessity urges them forth again in search of food  in this respect they are superior to indians who are notoriously improvident and regardless of the morrow  this day was signalised by another piece of success on the part of annatock and his nephew who went to the scene of yesterdays battle on foot  edith remained behind having resolved to devote herself entirely to the baby to make up for her neglect of the previous day  on reaching the place where the walrus had been slain annatock cut off and bound up a portion with which he intended to return to the camp  while he was thus employed along with a dozen or more of his countrymen peetoot came running towards him saying that he thought he saw a seal lying on the ice far ahead  having a harpoon and two spears with them annatock left his work and followed his nephew to the spot where it was supposed to be lying  but on reaching the place they found that it was gone and a few bells floating at the surface of the hole showed where it had made its descent to the element below  with the characteristic indifference of a man accustomed to the vicissitudes and the disappointments of a hunters life the elder esquimau uttered a grunt and turned away  but he had not proceeded more than a few paces when his eye became riveted on the track of some animal on the ice which appeared to his practised eye to be quite fresh  upon examination this proved to be the case and annatock spoke earnestly for a few minutes with his nephew  the boy appeared from his gestures to be making some determined remarks and seemed not a little hurt at the doubting way in which his uncle shook his head  at length peetoot seized a spear and turning away followed the track of the animal with a rapid and determined air while annatock grasping the other spear followed in the boys track  a brisk walk of half an hour over the ice and hummocks of the sea carried them out of sight of their companions but did not bring them up with the animal of which they were in chase  at length peetoot halted and stooped to scrutinise the track more attentively  as he did so an enormous white bear stalked out from behind a neighbouring hummock of ice and after gazing at him for a second or two turned round and walked slowly away  the elder esquimau cast a doubtful glance at his nephew while he lowered the point of his spear and seemed to hesitate but the boy did not wait  levelling his spear he uttered a wild shout and ran towards the animal which instantly turned towards the approaching enemy with a look of defiance  if annatock had entertained any doubts of his nephews courage before he had none now so casting aside all further thought on the subject he ran forward along with him to attack the bear  this was a matter attended with much danger however and there was some reason in the man feeling a little uncertainty as to the courage of a youth who he was aware now faced a bear for the first time in his life  at first the two hunters advanced side by side towards the fiercelooking monster but as they drew near they separated and approached one on the right the other on the left of the bear  as it was determined that annatock should give the deathwound he went towards the left side and hung back a moment while peetoot advanced to the right  when about three yards distant the bear rose  the action had a powerful and visible effect upon the boy for as polar bears are comparatively longbodied and shortlegged their true proportions are not fully displayed until they rear on their hind legs  it seemed as if the animal actually grew taller and more enormous in the act of rising and the boys cheek blanched while he shrank backwards for a moment  it was only for a moment however  a quick word of encouragement from annatock recalled him  he stepped boldly forward as the bear was glancing savagely from side to side uncertain which enemy to attack first and thrusting his lance forward pricked it sharply on the side this decided the point  with a ferocious growl the animal turned to fall upon its insignificant enemy  in doing so its left shoulder was fully exposed to annatock who with a dart like lightning plunged his spear deep into its heart  a powerful shudder shook the monsters frame as it fell dead upon the ice  annatock stood for a few minutes leaning on his spear and regarding the bear with a grim look of satisfaction while peetoot laughed and shouted and danced around it like a maniac  how long he would have continued these wild demonstrations it is difficult to sayprobably until he was exhaustedbut his uncle brought them to a speedy termination by bringing the buttend of his spear into smart contact with peetoots flank  with a howl in which consternation mingled with his glee the boy darted away over the ice like a reindeer to convey the glad news to his friends and to fetch a sledge for the bears carcass  on returning to the village there was immediately instituted another royal feast which continued from day to day gradually decreasing in joyous intensity as the provender decreased in bulk until the walruses the bear and the seals were entirely consumed  soon after this the weather became decidedly mild and the power of the suns rays was so great that the snow on the island and the ice on the sea began to be resolved into water  during this period several important changes took place in the manners and customs of the esquimaux  the women who had worn deerskin shoes during the winter put on their enormous waterproof summer boots  the men when out on the ice in search of seals used a pair of wooden spectacles with two narrow slits to peep through in order to protect their eyes from the snowblindness caused by the glare of the sun on the ice and snowa complaint which is apt to attack all arctic travellers in spring if not guarded against by some such appliance as the clumsy wooden spectacles of the esquimaux  active preparations were also made for the erection of skin summer tents and the launching of kayaks and oomiaks moreover little boys were forbidden to walk as they had been wont to do on the tops of the snowhouses lest they should damage the rapidlydecaying roofs but little boys in the far north inherit that tendency to disobedience which is natural to the children of adam the world over and on more than one occasion having ventured to run over the igloos were caught in the act by the thrusting of a leg now and then through the roofs thereof to the indignation of the inmates below  a catastrophe of this sort happened to poor peetoot not long after the slaying of the polar bear and brought the winter camp to an abrupt termination  edith had been amusing herself in her house of ice all the morning with her adopted baby and was in the act of feeding it with a choice morsel of sealfat partially cooked to avoid doing violence to her own prejudices and very much underdone in order to suit the esquimau babys tastewhen peetoot rushed violently into the hut shouted eeduck with a boisterous smile seized the baby in his arms and carried it off to its mother  edith was accustomed to have it thus torn from her by the boy who was usually sent as a messenger when kaga happened to desire the loan of her offspring  the igloo in which kaga and her relations dwelt was the largest in the village  it was fully thirty feet in diameter  the passage leading to it was a hundred yards long by five feet wide and six feet high and from this passage branched several others of various lengths leading to different storehouses and to other dwellings  the whiteness of the snow of which this princely mansion and its offices were composed was not much altered on the exterior but in the interior a long winter of cooking and stewing and general filthiness had turned the walls and roofs quite black  being somewhat lazy peetoot preferred the old plan of walking over this palace to going round by the entrance which faced the south  accordingly he hoisted the fat and smiling infant on his shoulder and bounded over the domeshaped roof of kagas igloo  alas for the result of disobedience  no sooner had his foot touched the keystone of the arch than down it went  dinner was being cooked and consumed by twenty people below at the time  the keystone buried a joint of walrusbeef and instantly peetoot and the baby lay sprawling on the top of it  but this was not all  the roof unable to support its own weight cracked and fell in with a dire crash  the men women and children struggled to disentomb themselves and in doing so mixed up the oil of the lamps the soup of their kettles the black soot of the walls and roof the dogs that had sneaked in the junks of cooked halfcooked and raw blubber and their own hairycoated persons into a conglomerate so atrocious to behold or even think upon that we are constrained to draw a curtain over the scene and spare the readers feelings  this event caused the esquimaux to forsake the igloos and pitch their skin tents on a spot a little to the southward of their wintering ground which being more exposed to the suns rays was now free from snow  they had not been encamped here more than three days when an event occurred which threw the camp into deep grief for a time  this was the loss of their great hunter annatock the husband of kaga  one of those tremendous northwest gales which now and then visit the arctic seas and lands with such devastating fury had set in while annatock was out on the icefloe in search of seals  many of his comrades had started with him that day but being a bold man he had pushed beyond them all when the gale came on the esquimau hunters prepared to return home as fast as possible fearing that the decaying ice might break up and drift away with them out to sea  before starting they were alarmed to find that the seaward ice was actually in motion  it was on this ice that annatock was employed and his countrymen would fain have gone to warn him of his danger but a gap of thirty feet already separated the floe from the main ice and although they could perceive their friend in the far distance busily employed on the ice they could not make their voices heard  as the gale increased the floe drifted faster out to sea and annatock was observed running anxiously towards the land but before he reached the edge of the iceraft on which he stood the increasing distance and the drifting clouds of snow hid him from view  then his companions fearful for their own safety hastened back to the camp with the sad news  at first kaga seemed quite inconsolable and edith exerted herself as a comforter without success but as time wore on the poor womans grief abated and hope began to revive within her bosom  she recollected that the event which had befallen her husband had befallen some of her friends before in exactly similar circumstances and that although on many occasions the result had been fatal there were not a few instances in which the lost ones had been driven on their iceraft to distant parts of the shore and after months sometimes years of hardship and suffering had returned to their families and homes  still this hope was at best a poor one  for the few instances there were of return from such dangers there were dozens in which the poor esquimaux were never heard of more and the heart of the woman sank within her as she thought of the terrible night on which her husband was lost and the great stormy iceladen sea over whose surging bosom he was drifted  but the complex machinery of this world is set in motion and guided by one whose power and wisdom infinitely transcend those of the most exalted of his creatures and it is a truth well worthy of being reiterated and reimpressed upon our memories that in his hands those events that seem most adverse to man often turn out to be for his good    chapter thirty two  edith waxes melancholy but her sadness is suddenly turned into joy and the esquimaux receive a surprise and find a friend and lose one  the sea  how many stout hearts thrill and manly bosoms swell at the sound of that little word or rather at the thought of all that it conveys  how many there are that reverence and love thy power and beauty thy freedom and majesty o sea  wherein consists the potent charm that draws mankind towards thee with such irresistible affection is it in the calm tranquillity of thy waters when thou liest like a sheet of crystal with a bright refulgent sky reflected in thy soft bosom and the white ships resting there as if in empty space and the glad seamews rippling thy surface for a brief moment and then sailing from the blue below to the deeper blue above and the soft song of thy wavelets as they slide upon the shingly shore or lip among the caves and hollows of the rocks  or is it in the loud roar of thy billows as they dash and fume and lash in fury on the coasts that dare to curb thy mightthat might which commencing mayhap in the torrid zone of the south has rolled and leaped in majesty across the waste of waters tossed leviathans as playthings in its strength rushed impetuously over half the globe and burst at last in helplessness upon a bed of sand or does the charm lie in the yet fiercer strife of the tempest and the hurricane when the elements let loose sweep round the shrinking world in fury or in the everchanging aspect of thy countenance now bright and fair now ruffled with the rising breeze or darkened by the thundercloud that bodes the coming storm  ah yes methinks not one but all of these combined do constitute the charm which draws mankind to thee bright ocean and fills his soul with sympathy and love  for in the changeful aspects of thy visage there are talismans which touch the varied chords that vibrate in the hearts of men  perchance in the bold whistle of thy winds and the mad rolling of thy waves an emblem of freedom is recognised by crushed and chafing spirits longing to be free  they cannot wall thee round  they cannot map thee into acres and hedge thee in and leave us naught but narrow roads between  no ploughshare cleaves thee save the passing keel no prince or monarch owns thy haughty waves  in thy hidden caverns are treasures surpassing those of earth and those who dwell on thee in ships behold the wonders of the mighty deep  we bow in adoration to thy great creator and we bow to thee in love and reverence and sympathy o sea  edith sat on the seashore  the glassy waves were no longer encumbered with ice but shone like burnished gold in the light of the summer sun here and there however a large iceberg floated on the deepa souvenir of winter past a guarantee of winter yet to come  at the base of these blue islands the sea calm though it was broke in a continual roar of surf and round their pinnacles the circling seabirds sailed  the yellow sands on which the child sat the green willows that fringed the background of brown rocks and the warm sun contrasted powerfully with the vestiges of winter on the sea while a bright parhelia in the sky enriched and strengthened these characteristics of an arctic summer  there was busy life and commotion in the esquimau camp from which edith had retired to some distance to indulge in solitude the sad reveries of home which weighed more heavily on her mind as the time flew by and the hope of speedy delivery began to fade  o my own dear mother sighed the child aloud while a tear trickled down each cheek shall i never see you more  my heart is heavy with wishing always wishing  but no one comes  i never see a boat or a ship on that wide wide sea  oh when when will it come  she paused and as she had often done before laid her face on her hands and wept  but edith soon recovered  these bursts of grief never lasted long for the child was strong in hope  she never doubted that deliverance would come at last and she never failed to supplicate at the throne of mercy to which her mother had early taught her to fly in every time of trouble and distress  soon her attention was attracted from the sea over whose wide expanse she had been gazing wistfully by the loud voices of the esquimaux as a number of them prepared to embark in their kayaks  several small whales had been descried and the natives ever on the alert were about to attack them  presently edith observed peetoot running along the beach towards her with a sealspear or harpoon in his hand  this youth was a remarkably intelligent fellow and had picked up a few words and sentences of english of which he made the most  eeduck  eeduck he cried pointing to one of the oomiaks which the women were launching you go kill whalefunny yes eeduck  i dont think it will be very funny said edith laughing but ill go to please you peetoot  goot eeduck you is goot shouted the boy while he flourished his harpoon and seizing his companion by the hand dragged her in the direction of the kayaks  in a few minutes edith was ensconced in the centre of the oomiak amid a pack of noisy esquimau women whose tongues were loosed and spirits raised by the hope of a successful hunt  they went merely for the purpose of witnessing the sport which was to be prosecuted by twelve or thirteen men each in his arrowlike kayak  the women sat round their clumsy boat with their faces to the bow each wielding a short broad paddle with which they propelled their craft at good speed over the glassy wave but a few alternate dips of the long doublebladed paddles of the kayaks quickly sent the men far ahead of them  in the stern of the oomiak sat an old greyheaded man who filled the office of steersman a duty which usually devolves upon old men after they become unfit to manage the kayak  indeed it requires much vigour as well as practice to paddle the kayak for it is so easily upset that a man could not sit in it for a minute without the long paddle in the clever use of which lies the security of the esquimau  when the flotilla had paddled out a short distance a whale rose and lay as if basking on the surface of the water  instantly the men in the kayaks shot towards it while the oomiak followed as fast as possible on drawing near the first esquimau prepared his harpoon  to the barb of this weapon a stout line from eight to twelve fathoms long was attached having a dan or float made of a sealskin at the other end of it  the dan was large enough to hold fifteen gallons or more  having paddled close to the whale the esquimau fixed the harpoon deep in its side and threw the dan overboard  the whale dived in an agony carrying the dan down along with it and the esquimau picking up the liberated handle of the harpoon as he passed paddled in the direction he supposed the whale must have taken  in a short time the dan reappeared at no great distance  the kayaks as if shot from a bow darted towards the spot and before the huge fish could dive a second time it received two more harpoons and several deep stabs from the lances of the esquimaux  again it dived carrying two additional dans down with it  but the dragging tendency of these three large floats combined with the deep wounds it had received brought the fish sooner than before to the surface where it was instantly met and assailed by its relentless pursuers who in the course of little more than an hour killed it and dragged it in triumph to the shore  the natives were still occupied in towing the captured fish when one of the men uttered a wild shout and pointed eagerly out to sea  at first edith imagined that they must have seen another whale in the distance but this opinion was quickly altered when she observed the eager haste with which they paddled towards the land and the looks of surprise with which ever and anon they regarded the object on the horizon  this object seemed a mere speck to ediths unaccustomed eyes but as she gazed long and earnestly at it a thought flashed across her mind  she sprang up her sparkling eyes seemed as though they would burst from their sockets in her eager desire to make out this object of so great interest  at this moment the oomiak touched the land  with a bound like a gazelle edith sprang on shore and ran panting with excitement to the top of a rocky eminence  here she again directed her earnest gaze out to sea while her colour went and came as she pressed her hands upon her breast in an agony of hope  slowly but surely the speck came on the wind shifted a point which caused a gleam of sunlight to fall upon a sail  it was a boat there could be no doubt of itand making directly for the island  unable to contain herself edith uttering a piercing cry sank upon the ground and burst into a passionate flood of tears  it was the irresistible impulse of hope long deferred at length realised for the child did not entertain a doubt that this was at length the answer to her prayers  meanwhile the esquimaux ran about in a state of extraordinary excitement  these people had very probably heard of the ships which once a year pass through hudsons straits on their way to the depots on the shores of hudsons bay but they had never met with them or seen a kublunat white face before that great day in their annals of discovery when they found little edith fainting in the snow  their sharp eyes had at once detected that the approaching boat was utterly different from their own kayaks or oomiaks  and truly it was for as she drew near with her white sails bending before the evening breeze that had recently sprung up and the union jack flying from her peak and the foam curling before her sharp prow she seemed a very model of grace and symmetry  there were only three figures in the boat one of whom by the violent gesticulations that he made as they approached bespoke himself an esquimau the other two stood erect and motionless the one by the tiller the other by the sheet  let go said a deep soft voice when the boat was within a stonescast of the shore  the sheet flapped in the wind as the peak fell and in another instant the keel grated on the sand  for one moment a feeling of intense disappointment filled ediths heart as she sought in vain for the face of her father or frank then with a cry of joy she sprang forward and flung herself into the arms of her old enemy gaspard  thank god said dick prince with a tremulous voice as he leaped lightly from the boat and clasped the child in his arms thank god we have found you miss edith  this will put new life into your poor mothers heart  oh how is she  why did she not come with you sobbed edith while dick prince seating himself on a rock drew her on his knee and stroked her fair head as she wept upon his shoulder  meanwhile annatock was being nearly devoured by his wife and child and countrymen as they crowded round him to obtain information and to heap upon him congratulations and gaspard in order to restrain and at the same time relieve his feelings essayed to drag the boat out of the water in which attempt giant though he was being singlehanded he utterly failed  after the first eager questions were answered on both sides the natives were informed by their comrade of the nature and objects of the establishment at ungava and they exhibited the most extravagant signs of joy on hearing the news  when their excitement was calmed down a little they conducted the party to their principal tent and set before them the choicest viands they possessed talking vehemently all the while and indulging in a few antics occasionally expressive of uncontrollable delight  ye see miss edith began prince when he and gaspard were seated before a round of walrusbeef the way we came to know your whereabouts was this gaspard and me was sent down to the coast to hunt seals for we were getting short o blubber and did not like to be obleeged to give deersmeat to the dogs  your father gave us the boat for says he prince itll take ye down faster than the canoe with this wind and if ye see any o the natives be sure ye dont forget to ask about her prince  ye see miss edith ever since ye was lost we never liked to mention your name although we often spoke of you for we felt that we might be speakin o the dead  howsever away we went for the shores o the bay and coasted along to the westward a bit  then we landed at a place where there was a good lot o fieldice floatin with seals lyin on it and we began to catch them  one day when we was goin down to the ice as usual we saw a black object sittin on a floe that had drifted in the night before with a stiff breeze  thats a queerlookin seal says gaspard  so tis said i  if there was ever black bears up hereabouts i would say it was one o them  put a ball in yer gun says gaspard for ye see as we had been blazin at small birds the day before there was nothing but shot in it so i put in a ball and took aim at the beast intendin to give it a long shot  but i was mercifully prevented from firin  jist as i squinted along the barrel the beast rose straight up and held up both its fore paws  stop roars gaspard in an awful fright and sure enough i lowered my gun and the beast hailed us in the voice of a man and began to walk to the shore  he seemed quite worn out when he landed and i could understand enough of his jargon to make out that he had been blown out to sea on the floe and that his name was annatock  while we were talkin to the esquimau gaspard cries out i say prince look here  theres a sort o medal on this chaps neck with somethin written on it  youre a larned fellow prince see if ye can make it out  so i looked at it and rubbed my eyes once or twice i can tell you for sure enough there was edith as plain as the nose on my face  oh exclaimed edith smiling through her tears that was the medal i hung round his neck long long ago  i hoped that it might be seen some day by people who knew me  i thought so miss returned princei thought as much for i knew that the esquimau could never have invented and writ that out of his own head ye see  but gaspard and me had most awful trouble to get him to explain how he came by it and where he came from  howsoever we made out at last that he came from an island in this direction so we just made up our minds to take the boat and come straight away for the island which we did takin annatock to pilot us  then does my father not know where you are or anything about your having heard of me inquired edith in surprise  why no miss edith replied prince  you see it would have lost us two or three days to have gone back to fort chimo and after all we thought it might turn out a false scent and only raise your poor mothers hopes for nothin  besides we were sent away for a week or two so we knew they wouldnt wonder at our absence so we thought upon the whole it would be best to come at once specially since it was sich a short distance  a short distance repeated edith starting up  i thought we must be miles and miles oh ever so far away  is the distance really short  ay that it is little one said prince patting the child on the head  it is not more than three days rowing from this island and a stiff breeze on the quarter would carry us there in less than two  and frank where is frank said edithwith a look of eager inquiry  ah miss replied prince he has been away almost as long as yourself  soon after you were lost a packet came from the south and he was obleeged to give up the sarch after youthough he was loath to do itand set out with three o the men for moose  from that day to this weve heerd nothin of him  but the journey he had to make was a long onehavin to go round all the way to york fortso we didnt expect to hear o him afore now  but ill tell ye more about all your old friends when we gitthings ready for a start tomorrow  the remainder of that day was spent in making preparation for setting sail on the following morning  the first intimation of the existence of the new tradingfort had thrown the childlike natives into rapturous delight but when prince told them he intended to go off the next day with the child who had been as a bright spirit in their camp so long they fell into the depths of grief  indeed there was manifested a slight desire to offer forcible opposition to this but when edith told them through the medium of peetoot who acted as her interpreter that the distance to her fathers fort was not great and that she would expect them to come often there and stay long they became reconciled to her departure and when she sought to turn their minds a work of no great difficulty at any time away from that subject by describing to them the treasures of the tradingstore they danced and laughed and sang like very children  even kagas baby crowed with a racy richness of feeling and smiled with an oily brilliancy of expression compared with which all its former exhibitions were mere childs play  but when the hour of departure really came and edith bade farewell to her kind friends whose rude but warm hospitality she had enjoyed so long they were again plunged into the deepest distress and when the little boat finally put to sea there was not a tearless eye among the tribe while edith was swiftly borne from their island shore before a strong and favouring breeze    chapter thirty three  the clouds are broken the sun bursts through and once more irradiate port chimohopes and fears for maximus  the wings of time moved slowly and heavily along at fort chimo  hope long deferred expectation frequently reviving and as often disappointed crushed the spirits of the little party  the song and jest and laugh seldom sounded from the houses of the men who went through their daily avocations almost in silence  not only had the loss of ediththe bright spirit of the place the tender rosebud in that savage wildernesscast an overwhelming gloom upon the fort but the failure of the trade to a great extent had added to the general depression and now fresh anxiety was beginning to be felt at the nonappearance of frank morton  jessie said stanley one day as he rose from the desk at which he had been writing and put on his cap with the intention of taking a stroll along the beach will you come with me today  i know not how it is but every time i go out now i expect to hear the ships gun as it comes through the narrows  mrs stanley rose and throwing on a shawl and hood accompanied her husband in silence  perhaps she said at length you expect to hear the gun because the vessel ought to be here by this time  as she spoke la roche came up and touched his cap  please madame vat you vill have pour dinner  whatever you please la roche  repeat yesterdays answered mrs stanley with the air of one who did not wish to be troubled further on the subject  but la roche was not to be so easily put down  ah madame pardonnez moi  dat is impossible  ve have fresh fish yesterday dere be no fresh fish today  more de pity  cest dommage dat gaspard him gone away  la roche was interrupted by a sudden exclamation from his master who pointed while he gazed earnestly towards the narrows of the river  it seemed as if the scene of last year were repeated in a vision  against the dark rock appeared the white triangular sail of a vessel  slowly like a phantom it came into view for the wind was very light while the three spectators on the beach gazed with beating hearts scarcely daring to credit their eyes  in a few seconds another sail appeareda schooner floated into view a white cloud burst from her bows and once again the long silent echoes of ungava were awakened by the roaring of artillery  the men of the fort left their several employments and rushed to the beach to welcome the vessel with a cheer but although it was heartfelt and vigorous it was neither so prolonged nor so enthusiastic as it was on the first occasion of the ships arrival  as the vessel dropped anchor opposite the fort frank morton leaped on her bow and along with the crew returned the cheer with a degree of energy that awakened memories of other days  theres frank cried stanley turning on his wife a glance of joy bless the boy  it warms my heart to see him  he must have picked up some indian woman by the way  i see the flutter of a petticoat  as he spoke the boat pushed off from the vessels side and a few rapid strokes sent it bounding towards the shore  eh whats this exclaimed stanley as his wife broke from him and with a wild shriek rushed into the lake  the figure of a child stood on the boats bow with her arms extended to the shore  hurrah lads give way shouted franks deep voice  mother mother cried the child  in another moment frank bounded over the boats side and placed edith in her mothers arms    reader there are incidents in the histories of men which cannot be minutely described without being marred  such an one was the meeting between the father and mother and their longlost child  we refrain from attempting to draw aside the curtain further than to say that the joy and gratitude in more than one heart at ungava found vent that night in thanksgiving to him who can bring light out of darkness and turn sorrow into joy  the greater part of the day was spent at the fort in that feverish excitement which cannot calm down to steady conversation but vents itself in eager rambling questions and abrupt replies  meanwhile the necessity of discharging the cargo of the vessel and preparing the furs for shipment served to distract the attention and occupy the hands of the whole party  as evening advanced la roche true to his duty placed supper on the table and stanley and his wife along with edith and frank while they partook of the meal continued their inquiries  whereabouts was it frank that you fell in with the boat said stanley  not more than five miles from the mouth of the river at about six this morning  we observed the boat beset by a pretty solid pack of ice and you may be sure we were not a little surprised when we saw the union jack run up to her peak so i ordered our boat to be lowered intending to go to her assistance  while the men were doing this i examined her with the glass and then it was that i found to my amazement and inexpressible joy that the boat contained prince gaspard and edith  ah  frank said mrs stanley was it not a strange providence that you who were so sad at being compelled to give up the search should be the one appointed to find our beloved child and bring her back to us  nay replied frank it was not i who found her  let me not rob dick prince and gaspard of the honour and gratitude which they have nobly won  and what do you think of the nonarrival of maximus said stanley whose feelings were still too much perturbed to allow him to dwell for more than a few minutes at a time on any subject  frank shook his head  i know not what to think said he  as i have told you already we left him at moose fort with his recovered bride and we got the missionary to marry them there in due form  next day they started in a small canoe on their return voyage to ungava and the day following i left for lake superior  i fully expected to find them here on my return  stanley looked grave  i fear much said he that some mischance has befallen the goodhearted esquimau  he was well armed you say and amply supplied with provisions  ay most certainly  he took two guns with him saying that his wife was as good a shot as himself  the men wish to know where the heavy goods are to be put said massan as he opened the door and stood cap in hand awaiting orders  stanley rose to leave the room  ill be with you in a minute massanthen frank well expect an account of your journey tonight  eda is very anxious that we should be told all about your wonderful adventures in the mountains  meanwhile i shall be off to look after the men  when the sun had set that night and the song of the sailors had ceased and most of the wearied inhabitants of fort chimo were enjoying a fragrant pipe after the labours of the day frank and stanley seated themselves one on either side of the fireplace with mrs stanley and edith in front of the hearth between them  an extra pineknot was thrown on the fire which in a few minutes rendered the candle on the table unnecessary  stanley lit his pipe and after drawing one or two whiffs to make sure that it would keep alight saidnow frank my boy were ready for you fire away  frank fired away literally for he applied a piece of glowing charcoal to his pipe and fired off half a dozen rapid puffs in reply as it were to his friend opposite  then he began    chapter thirty four  rough and tumblea polar bear made usefulfishing and floundering and narrow escapesan unexpected discovery productive of mingled perplexity and joy  you remember i daresay that the day on which i left ungava last spring was an unusually fine onejust such a day eda as those on which you and i and chimo were wont to clamber up the berryglen  but the clambering that we went through there was nothing to the work we went through on our third day from the fort  maximus and oolibuck were firstrate climbers and we would have got over the ground much faster than we did but for the dogs which could not travel easily over the rough ground with their loaded sled  chimo indeed hauled like a hero and if the other dogs had been equal to him we would have been here before today  well as i said our third day was one of considerable toil  leaving the river we struck into the mountains but after nearly breaking our sled to pieces and endangering our necks more than once we found it necessary to return to the river and follow its windings into the interior  after many days of as rough travelling as i ever experienced we came to the lake district on the height of land and travelled for some time more rapidly and with much greater ease  there were plenty of ptarmigan here so that we saved our provisionsa matter of importance as you know in a country where we might have found nothing fit for food  one evening towards sunset as we were crossing a large lake it came on to snow heavily and ere long we could not see the land  what shall we do maximus said i it seems to me that if we go on we may wander out of our course and lose much time ere we find it again shall we turn back  better go on replied maximus  oolibuck seemed to be of the same opinion so i gave my whip a flourish to urge on the dogs which were beginning to flag owing to the difficulty of drawing the sled through the deepening snow  but the two rear dogs could hardly be prevailed on to move  even chimo was knocked up  in this dilemma maximus came to my aid  he hung one of the ptarmigan at his belt and letting the dogs smell it walked on before the hungry animals brightened up instantly and went forward for a considerable distance with alacrity  but after trudging on for two or three miles the snow fell so thickly that we thought proper to call a halt and hold another council of war  now said i it is my opinion that we should encamp on the ice there is no use in wearying the dogs and ourselves in uncertainty what think you lads  me tink so too said oolibuck  maximus nodded his head by way of assent so we immediately set to work to make our encampment  you recollect the hut we built on the lake when i was so badly hurt and when you were lost eda  well we made a snowhouse just like that one and as we worked very hard we had it up and were all snug under its shelter in little more than two hours meanwhile the dogs were fed and a small piece of wood that we fortunately brought with us on the sled was cut up and a fire kindled but this only served long enough to boil the kettle and then it went out leaving us to eat our supper in the dark for by this time the sun had set  however we did not mind that much and when we had finished and were stretched out side by side on the snow smoking our pipes while the dogs lay at our feet and kept us warm i thought that a palace could not have been more comfortable than our snowhouse  as we had no wood wherewith to make another fire and so could not procure water except by the tedious process of digging through the ice i resolved to try an experiment which i had once heard had been attempted with success  this was to fill a bottle with snow and take it to bed with me  during the night the heat of my body melted the snow and in the morning we had sufficient water to give us each a draught at breakfast  when morning came we found that it was blowing and drifting so hard that we could not venture to move so we made up our minds to remain where we were until the weather should moderate  maximus said i after our breakfast of cold boiled ptarmigan was over set to work outside and dig a hole through the ice  i have no doubt we shall find fish in this lake  if we do they will form an excellent addition to our fare  i will prepare the lines and hooks  maximus whose huge body was stretched out at full length while he enjoyed his pipe rose to obey but as he was about to leave the hut oolibuck said a few words to him  please sir said oolibuck with his usual oily smile my countrymen fish in igloo when blow hard  praps ve make hole here if you like  very good said i make the hole where you please and look sharp about it else i shall have my lines prepared before you reach the water  the two esquimaux immediately set to work and in less than an hour a hole about six feet deep was yawning in the middle of our floor through this we set two lines and our usual luck attended us immediately  we caught five or six excellent whitefish and one or two trout in the first halfhour so that we were enabled to give the dogs a capital feed  moreover we froze as many as we could carry along with us for future use but we had not the satisfaction of having a good dinner of them that day as we had no wood wherewith to make fire  you would have been greatly amused had you peeped in at the icewindow of our igloo that day as we sat round the hole in the floor with eager excited looks  i confess however that i left the work principally to the two men who seemed to relish it amazingly  maximus was earnest and energetic as he always is but the expression of oolibucks face underwent the most extraordinary transformationsnow beaming with intense hope as he felt or thought he felt a tug anon blazing with excitement while his body jerked as if a galvanic shock had assailed it under the influence of a decided pull  then his visage was elongated as the fish escaped and was again convulsed by another pull or shone in triumph as he hauled the wriggling captive into the light of day  towards evening the wind fell and we resumed our journey  we were not again interrupted by weather for more than a week after this but were much perplexed by the chains of small lakes into which we came  at last we reached clearwater lake and had a long consultation as to the best course to pursue because it was now a question whether we should follow the chain of lakes by which we came up to ungava in our canoes or make a straight cut for the coast and take our chance of finding it  while we were yet uncertain what to do our course was decided by a polar bear  a polar bear cried edith in surprise  ay a polar bear and her cub settled the question for us as you shall hear presently replied frank  but first hand me papas tobaccopouch please as my pipe is exhausted  there now continued frank relighting his pipe and throwing a fresh log on the fire thats comfortable  well as i said we were somewhat perplexed as to what we should do when in wandering about the lake endeavouring to find the outlet i came upon the track of a polar bear and by the side of it were little footprints which showed me that it was a shebear with her cub  i observed that the tracks were quite fresh  now then maximus said i pointing to the tracks which went to the westward there is a sure guide who will conduct us by the quickest route to the coast  i could tell this eda because i knew that the bear had found food rather scarce in those high regions and would descend clearwater river in order to fish in the open water at the falls which are very numerous in that river  on reaching the coast it would find plenty seals in the sea  in the meantime i had nothing to do but follow its track to be conducted by the shortest route to clearwater river the commencement of which was difficult to find owing to the flatness of the margin of the lake at this end  away we went then and as i had expected were soon led to the river down the banks of which we scrambled over rocks and crags through bushes and snow until we came to the coast at richmond gulf  but it took us many weeks to accomplish the journey which i have briefly sketched thus far and when we reached the coast worn with hard travel and our clothing uncomfortably ragged the spring was well advancedrivers were breaking up ducks and geese were passing to the north and there were thousands of deer so that we found ourselves suddenly in the midst of abundance  just before reaching the gulf i witnessed the breaking up of a river which was one of the grandest sights i ever saw  the river was not a very large one  on reaching it we were much struck with a curious barrier of ice that was jammed across it  on examination i saw that the ice had given way some time before we arrived there and an enormous cake of many yards surface and fully six feet thick had while being hurled along by the swelling water caught upon the rugged rocks and been tilted upon end  thus it formed a temporary barrier against which other masses were forced until the outlet was completely checked and the water began to rise with great rapidity  as we stood on the high cliff looking down on the wild ravine in which this was going on i heard a loud crack  in another instant the obstructing barrier burst like a thunderclap and the pentup waters leaped with one mighty roar into their accustomed channel  the devastation created was inconceivably grand  rocks of many tons weight were torn up cast like playthings on the rushing ice and hurled on the cliffs below while trees and ice and water swept down the gorge in a mad whirl that made my brain reel as i gazed at it  in an hour the worst of this awful scene was over but the unutterable desolation that was left will remain for centuries i believe to tell of the mighty rush that happened there  our first experience of richmond gulf was not by any means pleasant when we arrived it was covered with ice but we did not know that although it appeared to be solid enough it was in reality little better than frozen sludge or foam  oolibuck happened to be walking first with the line of his little sled over his shoulder  for a short distance we plodded on intending to cross the gulf but i was suddenly aroused from a reverie by a shout from maximus  looking hastily up i beheld nothing of oolibuck except his head above the ice while maximus was trying to pull him out by hauling at the tailline of the sled  luckily oolibuck had kept fast hold of the line which was over his shoulder and after much trouble we succeeded in dragging him out of the water  a sharp frost happened to have set in and before we got back to the shore the poor fellows garments were frozen so stiff that he could not run  this is a bad job maximus said i we must carry him  do you lift his head and ill take the feet  oh be queek  i is frizzen up cried oolibuck casting a rueful look through his tangled locks which were a mere mass of icicles  maximus gave a loud chuckle and before i could assist him he seized his comrade in his powerful arms heaved him over his shoulder like a sack and ran towards the shore as lightly as if his burden were a child instead of a big overfed esquimau  arrived at the woods we wrapped oolibuck in our blankets then we kindled a fire and in two hours after his clothes were dried and himself ready to proceed  this might have turned out a more serious accident however and we felt very thankful when we had our damp companion steaming beside a good fire  the lesson was not thrown away for we coasted round richmond gulf instead of attempting to cross it  and now continued frank stirring the fire and relighting his pipe which invariably went out at the interesting parts of his narrativenow i come to that part of my story which bears on the fate of maximus  as i have said we had arrived at the coast and began to look forward to moose fort as the first restingplace on our journey  by far the greater part of the journey lay before us eda for according to my calculation i have travelled since last spring a distance of three thousand miles nearly a thousand of which have been performed on foot upwards of a thousand in boats and canoes and a thousand by sea and in the whole distance i did not see a civilised spot of ground or a single roadnot so much as a bridlepath  as bryans favourite song has it  over mountains and rivers i was pelted to shivers  but im happy to say i have not as the same song continues met on this land with a wathery grave  i was very near it once however as you shall hear  well away we went along the coast of jamess bay much relieved to think that the mountains were now past and that our road henceforth whatever else it might be was level  one evening as we were plodding wearily along after a hard days march over soft snow alternated with sandy beachfor the spring was fast advancingwe came suddenly on a camp of indians  at first i thought they must be some of the moose indians but on inquiry i found that they were a party of muskigons who had wandered all over east main and seemed to be of a roving unsettled disposition  however we determined to encamp along with them for that night and get all the information we could out of them in regard to their huntinggrounds  we spent a great part of the night in the leathern wigwam of the principal chief who was a sinisterlooking old rascal though i must say he received us hospitably enough and entertained us with a good deal of smalltalk after time and the pipe had worn away his reserve but i determined to spend part of the night in the tent of a solitary old woman who had recently been at moose fort and from whom i hoped to hear some news of our friends there  you know i have had always a partiality for miserable old wives eda which accounts perhaps for my liking for you  this dame had been named old moggy by the people at moose and she was the most shrivelled driedup wrinkled old body you ever saw  she was testy too but this was owing to the neglect she experienced at the hands of her tribe  she was goodtempered by nature however a fact which became apparent the longer i conversed with her  well old moggy said i on entering her tent what cheer what cheer  theres no cheer here she replied peevishly in the indian tongue  nay then said i dont be angry mother heres a bit o baccy to warm your old heart  but who is this you have got beside you  i asked on observing a goodlooking young girl with a melancholy cast of countenance seated in a dark corner of the wigwam as if she sought concealment  i observed that she was whiter than indians usually are and supposed at first that she was a halfbreed girl but a second glance convinced me that she had little if any of the indian blood in her veins  she is my only friend said old moggy her dark eye brightening as she glanced towards the girl  she was to have been my sons wife but the great spirit took my son away  she is all that is left to me now  the old womans voice trembled as she spoke the last few words and she spread her skinny hands over the small fire that smouldered in the centre of the floor  i was proceeding to make further inquiries into this girls history when the curtaindoor of the tent was raised and oolibuck thrust in his shaggy head  please sir de ole chief him wants baccy  i have smoke all mine vill you give some  here you are said i throwing a lump to the esquimau  send maximus to me i want to speak with him  i is here said maximus outside the tent  ah thats rightnow old moggy ill be back in a few minutes so dont go to sleep till i return  as i was about to issue from the tent the young girl passed me hastily and drawing the hood over her head and face darted through the opening  i found maximus gazing after her in surprise  hallo maximus whats wrong  do you think the girls a witch  no but i tink she be funny  she look close into my face and fly way when you come hout o tent  thats odd  did you ever see her before  i not see her yet  she keep face covered up  well come along it doesnt signify  i want you to go with me to the chiefs wigwam to ask where we are to put the dogs for the night and to see about our own quarters  old moggys wigwam stood at the distance of several hundred yards from the other tents of the village from which it was separated by a belt of stunted trees and willows  through this copsewood maximus and i took our way following one of the many beaten tracks made by the indians the night was clear and we found no difficulty in picking our steps among the low shrubs  when we were about halfway through this wood i observed a female form gliding among the bushes  she ran towards maximus who walked in advance and concealed me with his bulky form but a slight bend in the road revealed my figure and the woman paused as if uncertain what to do  surely that is your unknown friend again said i as we both halted then i beckoned her to approach  at first she appeared unwilling to do so but suddenly she seemed to change her mind and walking boldly up to maximus she threw back her hood and stood before him  i observed that she was moggys young friend but a wondrous change had come over her the pale cheeks were now covered with a bright blush and the sad eyes were sparkling with animation as she gazed intently into the face of the esquimau  for a few seconds maximus looked like one thunderstruck aneetka he exclaimed vehemently and striding forward with a suppressed cry clasped the girl in his arms  you may easily conceive my surprise at this scene  immediately the recollection of the attack by the indians on the esquimau camp and of maximuss young bride having been carried off flashed upon me and i had no doubt that the esquimau girl now stood before me  indeed the fact of the broken exclamations uttered by the pair being in the esquimau tongue put this beyond a doubt  a feeling of great delight filled my heart as i looked upon the couple thus unexpectedly reunited while they quite oblivious of my presence poured out a flood of question and reply in the midst of which they ever and anon embraced to make sure no doubt of their physical identity  then it suddenly occurred to me that i was behaving very ill so i wheeled about and sauntered away to a little distance in the direction of the shore in order to take some astronomical observations of the sky and gaze inquiringly up at the moon which at that moment broke through a bank of clouds tipping the icebergs on the sea and the branches of the overhanging trees with silver light  in quarter of an hour maximus came to me and presented his longlost bride aneetka whose pretty face beamed with joy while her lovers frame appeared to expand with felicity until he looked like an exaggerated hercules  but we had no time to waste in talking of the past  the present required our instant and earnest attention so we sat down on the stem of a fallen tree to consult as to how we were to get aneetka out of the hands of her indian captors  her brief history after she was captured at ungava was as follows  the indian who had intended to make her his bride found her resolved rather to die than to marry him but hoping that time would overcome her objection he placed her under the care of his widowed mother old moggy on returning to his village in the interior  soon afterwards this indian was killed by a brown bear and the poor mother became a sort of outcast from the tribe having no relations to look after her she was occasionally assisted however by two youths who came to sue for the hand of the esquimau girl  but aneetka true to her first love would not listen to their proposals  one of these lovers was absent on a hunting expedition at the time we discovered aneetka the other a surly fellow and disliked by the most of his comrades was in the camp from the day of her sons death a feeling of sympathy had sprung up between old moggy and the esquimau girl and this had gradually strengthened into affection  thus matters stood when we fell in with her  after much deliberation it was resolved that i should go to the old chief and tell him that old moggy and her adopted child wished to quit the tribe and go to moose with us to live there while aneetka should go and acquaint her old protectress with our plans and her own altered circumstances  adieu then aneetka said i as the girl pushed her lover away and bounded into the woodsnow maximus nothing will do for it but stout hearts and strong arms  come along lad  i found to my surprise that the old chief had no objection to the arrangement i proposed  a few of the others did not seem inclined to part with their captive but i explained to them the advantage it would be to them to have friends at court as it were and said that the furtraders would be glad to support moggy in her old agewhich was true enough for you all know as well as i do that there is not a post in the country where there are not one or more old or otherwise helpless indians supported gratuitously by the hudsons bay company  the only man who resolutely opposed the proposal was meestagoosh the rejected lover but i silenced him in a novel manner  he was a tall powerful fellow of about my own size  come said i to his assembled comrades in the indian language for i found they understood my bad mixture of cree and sauteaux very wellcome friends let us deal fairly in this matter  my man there has taken a fancy to the girllet meestagoosh and maximus wrestle for her  a loud laugh greeted this proposal as the indians surveyed the huge proportions of my esquimau  well then i continued if meestagoosh is afraid of the esquimau i have no objections to try him myself  the indian looked at me with an angry glance and seemed i thought half inclined to accept the challenge so to cut the matter short i took him by the throat and hurled him to the grounda feat which was evidently enjoyed by his countrymen  meestagoosh rose and retired with a savage scowl on his face and i saw no more of him  indeed i believe he left the camp immediately  after this no opposition was offered and i made the matter sure by distributing a large quantity of powder shot and tobacco to the chiefs  old moggy made no objection to our plan so we set out the next day with an additional dog purchased from the indians in order to make our team strong enough to haul the old woman when she got knocked up with walking  six days brought us to moose fort just as the ice on the river was breaking up  here as i have already told you maximus and aneetka were married in due form by the wesleyan missionary after they had received some instruction and expressed their desire to become christians  then they were supplied with a canoe and all necessary provisions and sent off to go round the coast to ungava accompanied by our good dog chimo for whom we had now no further use and by old moggy who would not consent to be separated from her friend aneetka they started along the coast on a fine spring day and the back of his sealskin coat shining in the suns rays like velvet as the canoe swept out to sea and disappeared behind a low point was the last that i saw of maximus  i will not weary you just now continued frank with the details of my subsequent journeying as although full of incidents nothing of a very thrilling character occurred except once  at moose i remained till the rivers were clear of ice and then set off into the interior of the country with a small canoe and five men oolibuck being bowsman  for many days we voyaged by rivers and lakes until we arrived at the michipicoten river which is a very rough one and full of tremendous falls and rapids  one day while we were descending a rapid that rushed through a dark gorge of frowning rocks and terminated in a fall our canoe was broken in two and the most of us thrown into the water  we all swam ashore in safety with the exception of one man who clung to the canoe poor fellow and was carried along with it over the fall  we never saw him more although we searched long and carefully for his body  we now found ourselves in a very forlorn condition  we were dripping wet without the means of making a fire and without provisions or blankets in the midst of a wild uninhabited country  however we did not lose heart but set off on foot to follow the river to its mouth where we knew we should find relief at michipicoten fort  the few days that followed were the most miserable i ever passed  we allayed the cravings of hunger by scraping off the inner bark of the trees and by a few of last years berries which had been frozen and so preserved  once or twice we crossed the river on rafts of driftwood and at night lay down close to each other under the shelter of a tree or cliff  at length we arrived at the fort on lake superior quite worn out with fatigue and starvation  here we waited until the canoes from canada passed and after a somewhat similar voyage through woods rivers and lakes arrived at length about the beginning of autumn at york fort on hudsons bay  here i spent some weeks in recalling to memory and recording on paper the contents of my dispatches which had been lost along with our canoe and baggage in michipicoten river and when these were finished and delivered i embarked along with our outfit of goods in the beaver and sailed for ungava  i need scarcely add that the voyage was a prosperous one and that the brightest day in it all was that on which we found the boat with our dear little edith beset among the ice near the entrance to ungava bay  while frank was thus occupied in narrating the events of his long journey in the hall of fort chimo oolibuck was similarly employed in entertaining the men  after the days toil of unloading the ship was over he was placed in the middle of the circle directly in front of the blazing fire by dick prince and massan while moses oostesimow gaspard and maistequan sat on his right and bryan la roche francois and augustus supported him on the leftall having pipes in their mouths which were more or less blackened by constant use  a pipe was then handed to oolibuck and the order given generally by bryan to blaze away  this the oilyvisaged esquimau did with right goodwill and the shouts of laughter which issued from the house occasionally as he proceeded with his interminable narration proved that the spirit and humour of the stout voyageur had not been crushed by the trials and dangers of his long eventful journey    chapter thirty five  a stirring period in the life of maximus  intermingled joy and sorrow is the lot of man  thus it has ever been thus no doubt it shall continue to be until the present economy shall have reached its termination  shall not the judge of all the earth do right is a sufficient reply to those who would fain have it otherwise but independently of this view of the subject may we not with the painters eye regard joy as the light sorrow as the shade in the picture of life  and who would have a painting all light or all shadow  maximus found it so in his experience  the shadows in the picture of his life had of late been broad and dark but a flash of vivid brilliancy had crossed it when he found his bride  afterwards the light and shade were chequered as we shall see  on leaving moose maximus proceeded a days journey along the coast and at night as the weather was fine he encamped with his wife and old moggy and chimo on the open seashore  here he held a consultation as to their future proceedings  as long as they were on the shore of jamess bay they were in danger of being found by indians but once beyond richmond gulf they would be comparatively safe and in the land of the esquimaux  after mature deliberation it was resolved that they should travel during the night and rest and cook their food during the daytime when a fire would not be so likely to attract attention if kindled in sequestered places  this plan answered very well and they passed stealthily along the coast when the indians if there were any there were buried in repose  on approaching the camp of the tribe however from whom aneetka had been taken maximus deemed it advisable to paddle far out to seathe weather being fortunately calmand to rest for a day and a night as well as they could in their frail bark  maximus sat in the stern of the canoe and steered his wife sat in the bow and paddled day after day as vigorously as if she had been a man  as for poor old moggy she sat in the middle and paddled a little when she felt cold but she slept during the greater part of the journey  chimo conceived it to be his duty to enjoy himself and did so accordingly at all times and in every possible way  during that livelong day and night and all the following day the giants arm never flagged aneetka too rested only once or twice at the earnest request of her husband but the little bark never once slackened its speed until the second night  then old moggy was awakened  mother said aneetka who acted as interpreter between her husband and the old woman we want to sleep for an hour or two  you seem to have rested well  will you wake and watch  the old woman yawned rubbed her eyes and assented after the question had been twice repeated  then laying their heads on opposite sides of the canoe without otherwise changing their positions the husband and wife sank into repose  two hours afterwards the old indian woman who had remained motionless as a dark statue all the time uttered a slight sound  instantly the sleepers awoke for those who are in the midst of danger sleep lightly  it is time to go on said the old woman as she lay back again in her lair rolled herself up into a bundle and went to sleep  maximus and his wife resumed their paddles and the light craft glided swiftly on its way to the far north  as the sun rose they neared the land and soon after they were seated not far from a high cliff eating their breakfast beside a small fire which sent so thin a column of smoke into the air that it was almost dissipated ere it reached the treetops  it was hoped that the indians had been now so far overshot that there was no danger of even a straggler being near them  but they took the precaution to load their two guns with ball and lean them against a tree within reach of their hands  when the meal was over maximus retired from the fire a few paces and throwing himself at full length on the green moss beneath a tree he fell into a sound sleep  he had not lain thus more than quarter of an hour when he was startled by the report of a gun which was followed by a wild scream and a chorus of unearthly yells  at the same instant and ere he could attempt to rise his legs and arms were pinioned to the ground by four powerful indians  for an instant maximus was paralysed  then the terrible reality of his position the scream of aneetka and the sight of the thong with which his captors were about to bind him caused his spirit to rebound with a degree of violence that lent him for the moment the strength of a giant  with a shout in which even a tone of contempt seemed to mingle the esquimau hurled his captors right and left and sprang to his feet  the indians fled but one who was a moment later in rising than the others received a blow that felled him instantly maximus glanced quickly round in search of his wife and observed her being hurried away by two indians  as the arrow leaps from the bow the esquimau sprang forward in pursuit  the indians saw him coming  in bitter anger they prepared to let her go and fly for having dropped their guns in the scuffle they were unable to fire upon their approaching foe  but there were other indians in the bush whose weapons were levelled at the breast of maximus and the next moment would have been his last but for a stone thrown from the cliffs above which struck him on the forehead and stretched him bleeding and insensible upon the ground  when maximus recovered from the effects of the blow he found himself lying on the cold earth in total darkness and firmly bound hand and foot  it is impossible to describe the agony of that bold spirit as he lay writhing on the ground in the vain effort to burst the cords that bound him  he thought of aneetka and his own utter helplessness while she was no doubt in urgent need of his strong arm to deliver her  the thought maddened him and again he strove in vain to burst his fetters and yelled aloud in despair  the echoing rocks gave back his cry and then all was silence  the dreadful thought now flashed across him that the indians had buried him alive in some dark cavern and brave though he was he trembled in every limb with agony  thus maximus lay until the grey dawn shone in upon him and showed that he was in a cave  scarcely had he noted this fact when the figure of a man darkened the caves mouth and approached him  as the indian bent over his helpless foe he revealed the savage features of meestagoosh for an instant he cast a look of mingled hatred and triumph on his enemy then drawing a scalpingknife from his girdle he stooped and cut the thong that bound his feet at the same time signing to him to rise for he knew that maximus did not understand indian  the esquimau obeyed and was led by the indian through the woods towards the cliff where the struggle of the previous night had taken place  here they came suddenly into view of the indian camp  there were no tents several green blankets that lay on the moss under the trees indicated where the party had lain during the night and at a considerable distance apart from these sat old moggy with her face buried in her skinny hands  beside her stood aneetka with a calm but slightly anxious expression on her pale countenance  chimo was held in a leash by an indian  from the fact of the indians being without tents or women and having their faces daubed with red paint besides being armed with knives guns and tomahawks maximus concluded that they composed a war party  on seeing her husband aneetka uttered a suppressed cry and bounded towards him but ere she had proceeded two paces an indian laid his hand on her arm and led her back to where the old woman sat  meestagoosh led maximus to the same spot and having confronted him with his wife he said to the latternow shebear of the north translate between us  if i think you tell lies the dogs shall have your bones to pick  aneetka replied meekly you cannot hurt one hair of our heads unless the great spirit permit you  we shall see retorted the indian with a scornful laugh  tell the polar bear continued meestagoosh in a contemptuous tone that i did not expect to catch him so soon  i have been fortunate  it was kind of him to come in my way and to bring his shebear with him  tell him that i and my braves are going to pay a visit to his nation to take a few scalps  i let him know this piece of good news because he will never know it from his friends as he shall be food for dog very soon  on this being translated the face of maximus assumed an expression of deep gravity mingled with sadness  his mind flew to the far north and he thought of the midnight assault and the deathcry of women and children  the nature of the esquimau was too noble and generous to be easily ruffled by the contemptuous tone of such a man as meestagoosh but his heart sank within him when he thought of the power as well as the will that the indian had to put his threat into execution  tell him said maximus quietly that i have no wish to talk with him but remind him that indians are not gods they are men  yes he says truly retorted meestagoosh the indians are men but esquimaux are dogs  while this conversation was going on and the indians were intent upon the scene old moggy who was not deemed worthy of being noticed contrived unobserved to possess herself of a knife and springing suddenly towards maximus with an agility of which she seemed utterly incapable she endeavoured to cut the thongs that bound his arms  her hand was caught however by meestagoosh in time to frustrate her intention  without deigning a word of remark the indian struck her a heavy blow on the cheek with the back of his open hand which nearly stunned her  staggering backward she fell upon the ground with a low wail  the bosom of maximus felt as if it would burst with rage  before any one could prevent him he raised his foot and struck meestagoosh so violently on the chest that he fell as if he had been shot  in a moment he recovered drew his knife and springing like an infuriated tiger at his enemy drove it with deadly force at his throat  fortunately the arms of maximus were tied in front of him so that by raising them he was enabled to guard his chest and receive the stab on his wrist  the knife passed quite through the fleshy part of his left arm but in doing so it severed one of the cords that bound him  thought is not quicker than the mighty wrench with which the esquimau burst the remaining cord and dashed his opponent to the ground  before the astonished indians could level their guns maximus had seized aneetka in his arms and was bounding madly towards the cliff which was not more than fifty yards distant  every gun poured forth its deadly contents before he gained it but his very nearness to the indians seemed to contribute to his safety and the suddenness of his flight rendered their hasty aim uncertain  in another moment he was round the point and behind the sheltering cliff while the indians uttered a terrific yell and darted forward in pursuit  just about thirty paces beyond the point of the cliff that hid him for a few moments from view was the cave in which maximus had spent the night  quick as thought he sprang up the steep short ascent that led to its narrow entrance and darted in  scarcely had he placed aneetka behind a projection that formed an ample shelter at the mouth of the cave when chimo who had broken from his captors also darted in and crouched at his masters feet  meanwhile the indians came sweeping round the point and seeing by the entrance of the dog where the fugitives had taken shelter they bounded up the ascent  the first who reached the caves mouth rashly passed the entrance  ere he could fire his piece he received a blow from the fist of the esquimau that fractured his skull hurled him down the steep ascent and dashed him against his comrades in the rear  this sudden repulse effectually checked the indians who are notoriously bad at storming  indeed they would never have ventured to enter the cave in this manner had they not known that maximus was totally unarmed  withdrawing to a distance of about forty yards the indians now formed in a line and loading their guns fired volley after volley into the caves mouth  but maximus and his wife crouched with the dog behind the ledge of rock at the entrance and remained there in perfect safety  in a few minutes the indians ceased firing and one of their number cautiously approached the cave supposing no doubt that the fusillade must have wounded if it had not killed those within but the instant he passed the entrance knife in hand he was caught in the powerful arms of maximus and hurled down the slope  a yell of indignation from the indians followed this feat and another volley was fired into the cave but without effect and the savages seeing that it was impossible in this way to dislodge their foe assembled in a group to consult  meanwhile old moggy had made good use of the opportunity thus afforded her to effect her escape  she darted into the bushes and made for the rocky ground in the rear of the camp  in doing so she happened to pass the tree against which leaned the two guns belonging to her friends they had escaped notice during the melee of the previous day and with the shotbelts and powderhorns remained where they had been placed when she and her companions landed  the old woman eagerly seized these and clambered with them over the rocks at a rate that would have done credit to more youthful limbs  on reaching a ridge of rock that overlooked the cave where maximus was sheltered old moggy became aware of how matters stood  she could also see from her elevated position that a track or the bed of a driedup watercourse led through the bushes towards the cave  without a moments delay she descended it but on drawing near to the cave she found that there was a barren spot of about thirty yards in extent between the place of refuge and the edge of the bushes  this open space was completely exposed to the view of the natives who at that time were firing across it into the cavern for after their consultation they had changed their position and renewed the fusillade  moggy was now in despair  she knew that it would be impossible to pass the open ground without being shot and she also felt certain that when the indians found their present attempts were fruitless they would resort to others in prosecuting which they would in all probability discover her  while she meditated thus she looked earnestly towards the cave and observed the astonished gaze of maximus fixed upon her for from his position behind the ledge of rock he could see the old woman without exposing himself to the indians while they gazed at each other a thought occurred to old moggy  she made a series of complicated signs which after frequent repetition were understood by maximus to mean that he was to expose himself to the view of the indians  instantly comprehending her meaning the esquimau stepped boldly from his place of concealment and shook his fist contemptuously in the face of his enemies  a shower of bullets and a yell of rage followed the act  this was just what old moggy had expected and desired  not a gun remained undischarged and before they could reload she passed quickly over the open ground and bounded into the cave where she turned and shook aloft the two guns with a hoarse laugh of triumph ere she sought the shelter of the ledge of rock  the indians were so filled with fury at being thus outwitted by an old woman that they forgot for a moment their usual caution and rushed in a body up the slope but ere they had accomplished half the distance two of their number fell to rise no more  this was sufficient to check their career  howling with baffled rage and without waiting to pick up their fallen comrades they darted right and left to seek the shelter of the bushes for they could no longer remain in the open ground now that their enemies were armed  for nearly an hour after this all was silence  maximus and his companions could only form conjectures as to the movements of the indians for none of them were to be seen  however as they had no resource but to remain in their retreat until nightfall they endeavoured to make the place as comfortable as possible and busied themselves in cleaning their arms  it happened that from the caves mouth they could see their canoe which still lay on the beach where they had originally left it and while they were looking at it they perceived one of the indians stealing down towards it  fortunately maximus had a gun in his hand ready loaded and the instant the indian appeared he fired and shot him  no second indian dared to venture towards the little craft although it lay only a few yards distant from the edge of the forest for they knew that the watchful eye of the esquimau was upon them and that instant death would be the fate of him who should make the attempt  the little canoe now became an object of intense interest to both parties  the indians knew that if their foe should succeed in reaching it he could easily escape this of course he could not hope to do as long as daylight lasted nor even when night should arrive unless it were a very dark one  but on the other hand they knew that they did not dare to venture near it so long as there was sufficient light to enable maximus to take aim at them with his deadly gun  both parties therefore remained silent and apparently inactive during the remainder of the day  but the busy brains both of indians and esquimaux were during this weary interval employed in planning how to circumvent each other  as the shades of night deepened each became more watchful  once only did maximus move from his post in order to go to the farther end of the cave where the large powderhorn had been placed for safety  as he did so chimo who was tied to a rock tried to follow him and on finding that he was restrained uttered a loud mournful howl  this cry sent a thrill to the heart of maximus for it immediately occurred to him that any attempt to leave the cave stealthily would instantly be intimated to the watchful foe by the dog and to take chimo with them was impossible  the dog must die said old moggy who divined at once what was passing in the mans mind  maximus shook his head sadly  i cannot kill chimo he said to aneetka he is ediths dog  aneetka made no reply for she felt the power of her husbands objection to injure the dog of his little favourite yet she could not but perceive that the crywhich was invariably repeated when any of the party moved away from the animalwould betray them in the moment of danger  nothing further was said for some time but old moggy who had no tender reminiscences or feelings in regard to the dog proceeded quietly and significantly to construct a runningnoose on the stout thong of leather that encircled her waist and served as a sash  while she was thus engaged the suns last rays faded away and the night began to deepen around them  to the satisfaction of both parties the sky was draped with heavy clouds which gave promise of a night of intense darkness  this was absolutely essential not only to the indians but to maximus who had at length formed a plan by which he hoped to turn the dreaded cry of the dog to good account although he had little hope of saving it from the indians should he succeed in escaping with the women  as the night grew darker he began to put this plan in execution  taking his station at the entrance of the cave he took a long and steady aim at the bow of the canoe which could now be only seen dimly having adjusted the gun to his satisfaction he marked its position exactly on the rock so that when the canoe should be entirely hid from sight he could make certain of hitting any object directly in front of it  then he ordered moggy and his wife to keep moving about the cave so that the howling of chimo should be kept up continually and thus not appear unusual when they should really forsake the cave and attempt their escape  in order to show that he was still on the alert he shortly after aimed at the canoe which was now quite invisible and fired  the effect was more startling than had been expected  a deathcry rent the air and mingled with the reverberations of the shot proving that it had taken deadly effect on one of the indians who under cover of the darkness had ventured to approach the coveted canoe a volley was instantly fired in the direction of the cave from various parts of the bushes but without effect  maximus now kept up a continued fire sometimes discharging a succession of rapid shots at other times firing at irregular intervals of from three to ten minutes  this he did purposely with a view to his future plans  in the meantime the dog was made to keep up a continuous howling  now aneetka said maximus as the ring of his last shot died away go and may the great spirit guide thee  without a word of reply the two women glided noiselessly like shadows into the thick darkness  about two minutes after they had disappeared maximus again fired several shots taking care however to point considerably to the right of the canoe  then he ceased for three minutes and again fired several shots irregularly  at the last shot he passed from the cave so silently and quickly that even chimo was deceived and snuffed the air for a moment ere it renewed its sad wailing  in less than two minutes the esquimau had glided with the noiseless tread of a panther to the spot where the canoe lay  here he found his wife and the old woman crouching beside it  the waters edge was about ten yards distant  a few seconds would suffice to lift the light bark in his powerful arms and launch it  aneetka and the old woman who had already received minute instructions what to do had glided quietly into the sea the instant maximus touched them for as we have said it was intensely dark and they could not see a yard before them  the women now stood up to the knees in water with their paddles in their hands ready to embark  stooping down the esquimau seized the canoe but just as he was about to lift it he observed a tall dark object close to his side  wah whispered the indian you are before me  quick the esquimau dog will fire again  the words of the indian were cut short by the iron gripe of maximus on his throat and the next instant he was felled by a blow that would have stunned an ox  so decided and quick was the action that it was not accompanied by more noise than might have been caused by the indian endeavouring to lift the canoe so that his comrades were not alarmed next moment the canoe was in the water  but the long silence which had now been unbroken for eight or ten minutes except by the howling of chimo in the cave began to arouse the suspicion of the red men and no sooner was this the case than they glided from the bushes in all directions with noiseless tread  in a second or two the body of their fallen comrade was discovered and a yell of fury rent the air for concealment was now unnecessary while they dashed into the water in pursuit  the darkness favoured the fugitives for a few seconds and enabled the women to embark but just as maximus was about to step into his place meestagoosh seized him by the throat  maximus was possessed of that ready presence of mind and prompt energy of character which are so necessary to a warrior especially to him who wars with the prowling and stealthy savage  almost in the same instant he gave the canoe a shove that sent it bounding out to sea and raised his hand to catch the invisible arm which he knew must be descending with the deadly knife towards his heart  he succeeded so far that although he did not arrest it he turned the blow aside receiving only a slight wound on the shoulder  ere it could be repeated he dealt his adversary a blow on the forehead and hurled him back insensible into the water  the esquimau immediately glided out into deep water and now for the first time in his life he felt keenly the disadvantage of not being able to swim  this is an art which the inhabitants of the icy seas have never acquired owing probably to the shortness of the season of open water and the intense cold of the iceladen seas even in summer  the indians on the contrary who live beside the warm lakes and rivers of the interior are many of them pretty expert swimmers  thus it happened that maximus was obliged to stand up to his neck in the water not daring to move or utter a sound while his friends and foes alike sought in vain for him in the darkness  while he stood thus uncertain how to act he heard the water rippling near to him and distinguished the hard breathing of a swimmer  soon he observed a dark head making straight towards him  a sarcastic smile played for a moment on the face of the gigantic esquimau as he thought of the ease with which he should crush his approaching foe and his hand was already raised to strike when it was arrested by a low whine and the next moment chimo was endeavouring to clamber upon his shoulder  it instantly occurred to maximus that he might turn the dogs swimming powers to good account  seizing chimo by the flanks with both hands he turned its head out to sea and keeping it in that position was dragged into deep water  when he had been thus conveyed what appeared to be about fifty yards he uttered a low cry  he was heard by the indians as well as by those in the canoe but the latter happened to be nearer to the spot and a few strokes of the paddles sent them alongside of their comrade who quickly caught the stern of the bark  the women plied their paddles the esquimau gave a shout of triumph and half immersed in the water was dragged away from shore  a yell of anger and soon after a desultory discharge of firearms told that the indians had given up the chase  but it was now a question how maximus was to be got into the canoe  the frail bark was so crank that a much lighter weight than that of the burly esquimau would have upset it easily and as the stern was sharp there was no possibility of climbing over it  this was a matter of considerable anxiety for the water was excessively cold being laden with ice out at sea  while in this dilemma the canoe grated on a rock and it was discovered that in the dark they had wellnigh run against a low cape that jutted far out from the land at this part of the coast here maximus and the dog landed and while the one shook its wet sides the other wrung the moisture from his garments after which necessary operation he leaped with his canine friend into the canoe and they pushed well out to sea  when daylight returned they were far beyond the reach of their indian enemies    chapter thirty six  happy meetings and joyous feastingslove marriage desertion desolation and conclusion  after the escape narrated in the last chapter the stout esquimau and his companions travelled in safety for they had passed the country of the indians and were now near the lands of their own people  but if maximus had not now to fight with men he was not exempted from doing fierce battle with the elements of these inhospitable climes  for hundreds of miles he travelled along the east coast of hudsons bay and the southern shores of the straits now driven ashore by the storm anon interrupted by driftice and obliged to carry his canoe for miles and miles on his shoulders while the faithful aneetka trudged by his side happy as the day was long for although her load was necessarily a heavy one her love for maximus made it rest lighter than the eiderdown that floated from her fingers when she plucked the wild birds for their evening meal  moggy too waddled along after her own fashion with a resolution and energy that said much for her strength and constitution she only carried the light paddles and a few trifling articles that did not incommode her much  during the spring and summer and autumn they pursued their arduous journey living from hand to mouth on the produce of their guns nets sealspears and fishinglines which generally supplied them with enough for their daily wants sometimes with abundance but not unfrequently with just sufficient to keep them alive  three or four times they met with esquimaux and rendered essential service to them and to the furtraders by telling them of the new fort at ungava recounting the wonders of the store there and assuring them that the chief desire of the traders after getting their furs was to do them good and bring about friendly intercourse between them and the indians  late in the autumn the three voyageurs drew near to ungava bay and in passing along the coast opposite to the island on which edith had spent the winter they overtook annatock and his whole tribe with a flotilla of oomiaks and kayaks on their way to the same place  at the mouth of the bay they were joined by the esquimaux of false river who were carrying supplies of sealblubber to the fort for the use of the dogs in winter and a few deerskins to trade  it was a bright and beautiful autumn afternoon a rare blessing in that dreary clime when they passed the narrows of the river and came in sight of fort chimo  on that day an unusually successful deerhunt had taken place and the fiddle had as bryan expressed it been sarved out to the men for the purpose of rejoicing their hearts with sweet sounds  on that day a small band of indians had arrived with a rich and unusually large stock of furs among which there were one or two silver foxes and a choice lot of superb martens  this tended to gladden the heart of stanley and truly he needed such encouragement  at one of the companys inland tradingposts such a bundle of furs would have been received as a matter of common occurrence but it was otherwise with the povertystricken ungava from which so much had been expected before its dreary barren character was known  on that day too a picturesque iceberg had grounded near the fort at high water and frank took edith in the small canoe to paddle her among its peaked and fantastic fragments  you will be steersman and sit in the stern eda said frank as they embarked  i will stand in the bow and keep you clear of icetongues  how beautiful exclaimed the delighted child as their light craft glided in and out among the icy pinnacles which overhung them in some places as they passed  dont you hear a strange noise frank  truly frank did hear a strange noise and beheld a strange sight for at that moment the esquimau flotilla passed the narrows and swept round the bay while the natives excited by their unusual numbers and the unexpected return of maximus yelled and screamed and threw about their arms in a manner that defies description  there must be strangers among them said frank as he paddled towards the shore they are too numerous for our friends of false river  that seems to be an indian canoe coming on ahead remarked stanley who along with his wife and most of the men had hurried to the beach on hearing the shouts of the approaching multitude  can it be possible exclaimed frank as the canoe drew near does it not look like maximuseh  oh ooooh theres chimo screamed edith her eyes dancing with mingled amazement and delight  the dog in his anxiety to reach the shore had leaped into the water but he had miscalculated his powers of swimming for the canoe instantly darted ahead  however he was close on the heels of maximus  give him a chare bays cried bryan as he ran down to the beach waving a large hammer round his head  now thin hooray  the appeal was responded to with heartfelt energy by the whole party as their old comrade sprang from the canoe and leaving his wife to look after herself ran toward stanley and frank and grasped them warmly by the hands while his huge face beamed with emotion  i hope thats your wife youve brought with you maximus said stanley  i can answer for that said frank i know her pretty face well  ah le poor chien cried la roche it vill eat miss edith i ver much blieve voila  this seemed not unlikely for the joy manifested by poor chimo at the sight of his young mistress was of a most outrageous character insomuch that the child was nearly overturned by the dogs caresses  musha what have ye got there maximus said bryan who had been gazing for some time past in solemn wonder at the figure of old moggy who regardless of the noise and excitement around her was quietly carrying the goods and chattels from the canoe to the beach  shure yeve found yer ould grandmother  shes the mortial parsonification of my own mother  faix if it wasnt that her proboscis is a taste longer id swear it was herself  at this point massan stepped forward and took maximus by the arm  come along lad theres too much row here for a comfortable palaver bring your wife wi you  yeve run out o baccy now  of coorse ye have  come then to the house ill fill yer pipe and pouch too boysee after his canoe la roche and bring the old ooman bryan  mind yer own consarns an let yer shupariors proceed ye said bryan as he shoved past and tucking old moggys arm within his own marched off in triumph to the fort  meanwhile the main body of esquimaux had landed and the noise and confusion on the shore were so great that scarcely an intelligible sound could be heard  in the midst of all this and while yet engaged in caressing chimo edith felt some one pluck her by the sleeve and on looking round she beheld the smiling faces of her old friends arnalooa and okatook  scarcely had she bestowed a hearty welcome on them when she was startled by an ecstatic yell of treble laughter close to her ear and turning quickly round she beheld the oily visage of kaga with the babythe babyin her hood stark naked and revelling in mirth as if that emotion of the mind were its native elementas indeed it was if taken in connection with sealfat  scarcely had she recovered from her delight at this meeting when she was again startled by a terrific shout and immediately after peetoot performed a violent dance around her expressive of unutterable joy and finished off by suddenly seizing her in his arms after which he fled horrified at his own presumption  to escape from this scene of confusion the traders returned to the fort having directed the esquimaux to pitch their camp on the point below after which they were to assemble in the yard for the double purpose of palavering and receiving a present of tobacco  that night was spent by the inhabitants of fort chimo in rejoicing  in her own little room edith entertained a select teaparty composed of arnalooa okatook peetoot chimo and the baby and really it would be difficult to say which of them made most noise or which behaved most obstreperously  upon mature consideration we think that chimo behaved best but that all things considered is not saying much for him  we rather think the baby behaved worst  its oily visage shone again like a lustrous blob of fat and its dimples glided about the surface in an endless game of hideandseek  as for peetoot he laughed and yelled until the tears ran over his cheeks and more than once in the excess of his glee he rubbed noses with chimoa piece of familiarity which that sagacious animal was at length induced to resent and put a stop to by a gentle and partial display of two tremendous rows of white ivory  in the hall stanley held a levee that lasted the greater part of the evening and in the mens house a ball was got up in honour of the giants return with his longlost aneetka  ah reader although the countenances of the men assembled there were sunburnt and rough and their garments weatherworn and coarse and their language and tones unpolished think not that their hearts were less tender or sympathetic than the hearts of those who are nurtured in softer scenes than the wilds of ungava  their laugh was loud and uproarious it is true but there was genuine heartfelt reality in it their sympathy was boisterously expressed mayhap if expressed at all but it was truly and deeply felt and many an unbidden tear glanced from the bronzed cheeks of these stalwart men of the north as they shook their gigantic comrade by the hand and wished him joy and kissed his blooming bride  aneetka had long since laid aside her native garb and wore the more graceful and womanly costume of the indian women and maximus wore the capote and leggings of the voyageur  but there were not wanting gentlemen from the camp at the point whose hairy garments and hoods long hair and beards did honour to the race of the esquimaux and there were present ladies from the same place each of whom could a tail unfold that would have been the admiration and envy of tadpoles had any such creatures been there to see them  they wore boots too to which in width at least those worn by fishermen are nothing  some of them carried babies in their hoodslittle naked imps whose bodies and heads were dumplings suet dumplings we may add for the information of the curious and whose arms and legs were sausages  bryan was great that nighthe was majestic  the fiddle all but spoke and produced a sensation of dancing in the toes of even those who happened to be seated  bryan was great as a linguist too and exhibited his powers in this respect with singular felicity in the vocal entertainment that followed the dancing  the esquimau language seemed a mere trifle to him and he conversed while playing the violin with several purty craytures in their native tongue with an amount of volubility quite surprising  certainly it cannot be said that those whom he addressed expressed much intelligence but esquimaux are not usually found to be quick in their perceptions  perchance bryan was metaphysical  mirth hearty real mirth reigned at the fort not only that day but for many a day afterwards for the dangers and troubles and anxieties of the first year were past  hope in the future was strong despite the partial failures that had been experienced and through the goodness of god all those who composed the original band of the forlorn hope were reunited after many weary months of travel danger and anxiety during part of which a dark and dreary cloud now happily dispelled had settled down on fort chimo    years have rolled away since the song and shout of the furtrader first awakened the echoes of ungava  its general aspect is still the same for there is no change in the everlasting hills  in summer the deer still wander down the dark ravines and lave their flanks in the rivers swelling tide and in winter the frostsmoke still darkens the air and broods above the open water of the sea but fort chimo the joy and wonder of the esquimaux and the hope of the furtrader is gone and a green patch of herbage near the flat rock beside the spring alone remains to mark the spot where once it stood  in the course of time the changes that took place in the arrangements of the fur company required the presence of stanley at another station and he left ungava with his wife and child  the gentleman who succeeded him was a bold enterprising scottish highlander whose experience in the fur trade and energy of character were a sufficient guarantee that the best and the utmost would be done for the interests of the company in that quarter  but however resolute a man may be he cannot make furs of hard rocks nor convert a scene of desolation into a source of wealth vigorously he wrought and long he suffered but at length he was compelled to advise the abandonment of the station  the governor of the companya man of extraordinary energy and success in developing the resources of the sterile domains over which he ruledwas fain to admit at last that the trade of ungava would not pay  the order to retreat was as prompt and decisive as the command to advance  a vessel was sent out to remove the goods and in a brief space of time fort chimo was dismantled and deserted  the esquimaux and indians soon tore down and appropriated to their own use the frames of the buildings and such of the materials of the fort as had been left standing and the few remnants that were deemed worthless were finally swept away and every trace of them obliterated by the howling storms that rage almost continually around these desolate mountains  and now reader it remains for me to dismiss the characters who have played their part in this brief tale  of most of them however i have but little to say for they are still alive scattered far and wide throughout the vast wilderness of ruperts land each acting his busy part in a new scene for it is frequently the fate of those who enter this wild and stirring service to be associated for a brief season under one roof and then broken up and scattered over the land never again to be reunited  george stanley after a long sojourn in the backwoods retired from the service and with his family proceeded to canada where he purchased a small farm  here edith waxed strong and beautiful and committed appalling havoc among the hearts of the young men for thirty miles around her fathers farm  but she favoured no one and at the age of seventeen acquired the name of being the coldest as well as the most beautiful and modest girl in the far west  there was a thin young man with weak limbs and a tendency to fall into a desponding state of mind who lived about three miles from mr stanleys farm  this young mans feelings had been so often lacerated by hopes and fears in reference to the fair edith that he mounted his pony one evening in desperation and galloped away in hot haste to declare his passion and realise or blast his hopes for ever  as he approached the villa however he experienced a sensation of emptiness about the region of the stomach and regretted that he had not taken more food at dinner  having passed the garden gate he dismounted fastened his pony to a tree and struck across the shrubbery towards the house with trembling steps  as he proceeded he received a terrific shock by observing the flutter of a scarf which he knew intuitively belonged to edith  the scarf disappeared within a bower which stood not more than twenty yards distant from him close beside the avenue that led to the house  by taking two steps forward he could have seen edith as she sat in the bower gazing with a pensive look at the distant prospect of hill and dale river and lake in the midst of which she dwelt but the young man could as easily have leaped over stanleys villa farm and all as have taken these two steps  he essayed to do so but he was rooted to the ground as firmly as the noble trees under which he stood  at length by a great effort he managed to crawlif we may so express itto within a few yards of the bower from which he was now concealed only by a few bushes but just as he had screwed up his soul to the sticking point and had shut his eyes preparatory to making a rush and flinging himself on his knees at ediths feet he was struck powerless by the sound of a deep sigh and a moment after was all but annihilated by a cough  suddenly the sound of horsehoofs was heard clattering up the avenue on came the rider as if in urgent haste  in a few seconds a curve in the avenue brought him into view  he was a man of handsome and massive proportions and bestrode a black charger that might have carried a heavy dragoon like a feather  a wheelbarrow had been left across the track over which the steed went with an easy yet heavy bound betokening wellbalanced strength and weight and a bright smile lighted up the riders bronzed face for an instant as his strawhat blew off in the leap and permitted his curling hair to stream out in the wind  as he passed the bower at a swinging gallop an exclamation of surprise from edith attracted his attention  the chargers hoofs spurned the gravel while he was reined up so violently that he was thrown on his haunches and almost before the thin young man could wink in order to clear his vision this slashing cavalier sprang to the ground and entered the bower  there was a faint scream which was instantly followed by a sound so peculiar that it sent a thrill of dismay to the cavity in which the heart of the weak young man had once lodged  stretching out his hand he turned aside the branches and was brought to the climax of consternation by beholding edith in the arms of the tall stranger bewildered in the intellect and effectually crippled about the knees and ankles he could only gaze and listen  so you have comeat last whispered edith while a brilliant blush overspread her fair cheek  o edith murmured the stalwart cavalier in a deep musical voice how my heart has yearned for this day  how i have longed to hear your sweet and wellremembered voice  in the desolate solitudes of the far north i have thought of you  amid the silent glades of the forest when alone and asleep on my mossy couch or upon my bed of snow i have dreamed of youdreamed of you as you were a fair sweet happy child when we wandered together among the mountains of ungavaand dreamed of you as i fancied you must have become and as i now find you to be  yes beloved girl my heart has owned but one image since we parted years ago on the banks of the caniapuscaw river  your letters have been my bosom friends in all my long long wanderings through the wilderness and the hope of seeing you has gladdened my heart and nerved my arm  i have heard your sighs in every gentle air that stirred the trees and your merry laugh in the rippling waters  even in the tempests roar and the thundering cataract i have fancied that i heard you calling for assistance and many a time and oft i have leaped from my couch to find that i did but dream  but they were pleasant and very precious dreams to me  o edith  i have remembered you and thought of you and loved you through months and years of banishment  and now  again was heard the peculiar sound that had thrilled with dismay the bosom of the weak young man  halo whence came this charger shouted a hale hearty voice as stanley walked towards the bower  eh what have we here he exclaimed rushing forward and seizing the stranger in his armsfrankfrank morton  this was too much  the weak young man suddenly became strong as hercules  he turned and fled down the avenue like a deer  the pony having managed to unfasten its bridle stood in the centre of the way gazing down the avenue with its back towards its master  unwonted fire nerved the youths limbs with one bound he vaulted leap frog over the animals back into the saddle dashed his spurs into its sides and fled like a whirlwind from the scene of his despair  frank morton and george stanley being both men of promptitude and decision resolved that one month was long enough to make preparations for the marriage and edith being the most dutiful daughter that ever lived did what she was bid  that beautiful cottage which stands in the midst of most exquisite scenery about two miles from stanleys villa is inhabited by frank morton and his family  that crow which you have just heard proceed from the nursery was uttered by the youngest of five and yonder little boy with broad shoulders who thrusts his hands into his pockets in a decided manner and whistles vociferously as he swaggers down the avenue is master george f morton on his way to school  la roche and bryan were so fortunate as to be appointed to the same establishment after leaving ungavasomewhere near the mouth of the mackenzie river and within the region of all but perpetual frost and snow  they are sometimes visited by esquimaux which is fortunate for as bryan says it guves him an opportunity o studyin the peecoolier dialects o their lingo  dick prince was the only one who lost his life in the forlornhope he was drowned while out shooting in the bay alone in his canoe  a sudden storm upset his frail bark and left him struggling in the water prince was a strong swimmer and he battled long for his life but the iceladen sea benumbed his hardy limbs and he sank at last without a cry to rise no more  he was a noble specimen of his classa brave modest unobtrusive son of the forest beloved and respected by his companions and when his warm heart ceased to beat it was felt by all that a bright star of the wilderness had been quenched for ever  his body was found next day on the beach and was interred by his mourning comrades in a little spot of ground behind the fort  it was many a long day after this melancholy event ere massan could smile and when the fort was finally deserted he put in practice his longmeditated intention of becoming a hunter and taking to the rocky mountains where he wanders now if he has escaped the claws of the dreaded grizzly bear and the scalpingknife of the red indian  moses finding the life of a furtrader not quite to his taste rejoined his countrymen and reverted to killing seals and eating raw blubber the two indians also returned to a purely savage life which indeed they had only forsaken for a time  augustus and oolibuck died and the latter left a son who has already rendered good service as interpreter to the arctic expeditions as his worthy father did before him francois and gaspard are still together at one of the posts of the interior  they are now fast friends and have many a talk over the days when they quarrelled and messed together at fort chimo  as for the poor esquimaux they were for a time quite inconsolable at the departure of the furtraders and with a species of childlike simplicity hung about the bay in the hope that they might after all return  then they went off in a body to the westward and the region of ungava to which they had never been partial was left in its original dreary solitude  it may be that some good had been done to the souls of these poor natives during their brief intercourse with the traders  we cannot tell and we refrain from guessing or speculating on a subject so serious  but of this we are assuredif one grain of the good seed has been sown it may long lie dormant but it cannot die  maximus accompanied his countrymen along with aneetka and old moggy who soon assumed the native costume and completely identified herself with the esquimaux  maximus was now a great man among his people who regarded with deep respect the man who had travelled through the lands of the indians had fought with the red men singlehanded and had visited the furtraders of the south  but the travelled esquimaux was in reality a greater man than his fellows supposed him to be  he fully appreciated the advantages to be derived from a tradingpost near their icegirt lands and resolved when opportunity should offer to do all in his power to strengthen the friendship now subsisting between the indians and the esquimaux of ungava and to induce his countrymen if possible to travel south towards the establishment on jamess bay  he still retains however a lingering affection for the spot where he had spent so many happy days and at least once a year he undertakes a solitary journey to the rugged mountains that encircled fort chimo  as in days of yore with wallet on shoulder and sealspear in hand the giant strides from rock to rock along the now silent banks of the caniapuscaw river  once again he seats himself on the flat rock beside the spring and gazes round in sadness on those wild majestic hills or bends his eye upon the bright green spot that indicates the ancient site of the tradingpost not a vestige of which is now visible save the little wooden cross that marks the lonely grave of dick prince and the broad chest of the giant heaves with emotion as he views these records of the past and calls to mind the merry shouts and joyous songs that used to gladden that dreary spot the warm hearth at which he was wont to find a hearty welcome and the kind comrades who are now gone for ever  ungava spreads in all its dark sterility around him as it did in the days before the traders landed there and that bright interval of busy life in which he had acted so prominent a part seems now but the fleeting fancy of a bright and pleasant dream  the end
