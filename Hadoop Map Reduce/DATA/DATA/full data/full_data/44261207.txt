rover boys series for young americans  as i have mentioned in other volumes this line was started a number of years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle these stories were so well received that there was an immediate cry for more and so year by year they were followed by the publication of the rover boys out west on the great lakes in the mountains in camp on land and sea on the river on the plains in southern waters on the farm on treasure isle at college down east in the air in new york in alaska and finally in business where we last left our heroes  the rover boys have of course gradually been growing older dick and tom are both married and doing what they can to carry on their fathers business in new york city sam the youngest of the boys is still at brill college the particulars are given of some winter sports around that institution of learning and then of a great baseball game in which the youngest rover distinguishes himself then sam graduates from college and all the boys with some others go on a long automobile tour during which a number of exciting adventures occur the party is caught in a storm on the mountains and later on are caught in a great flood what the rover boys did under such trying circumstances i leave for the pages which follow to disclose  once more i wish to thank all my young friends for the many gratifying things they have said about my books i trust that the present volume will fulfil all their expectations and that the reading of the same will do them good  affectionately and sincerely

chapter i  the snowball fight   now then boys are you ready  i am  been ready for the last five minutes  sure youve got all the snowballs you can carry  i couldnt carry any more if i tried came from sam rover with a grin just see how i am loaded up and he glanced down at both hands which were filled with snowballs and at the snowballs held under either arm  ive got some dandy hard ones put in spud jackson  oh you cant use soakers spud cried stanley browne who was the leader of the snowballing contingent thats against the rules  they are not soakers stanley was the reply they are only good and hard thats all  hi you fellows when are you going to start things came a cry from behind a snow wall up the slope of a hill we cant waste the whole afternoon waiting for you  were coming dont fear answered stanley browne  and when we arrive you wont know whats struck you announced sam rover gaily  its all vell enough to brag but youd chust better start dot fight came in germanamerican accents from behind the snow wall and a merry face appeared in sight for an instant and a fist was shaken playfully at those beyond  sound that bugle paul yelled the leader of the attacking party and an instant later the mellow notes of a bugle floated out on the crisp wintry air  it was the signal for the attack and with merry shouts the students at the foot of the hill charged upward through the snow toward the wall above  the occasion was the annual snowball fight at brill college snow fights there were of course without number but each year there was one big contest in which the freshmen and sophomores attempted to hold a snow fort located on the hill back of the institution against the attacks of the juniors and seniors according to the rules three charges were allowable all of which must be made inside of two hours and if all of these failed to take the fort then the victory went to the defenders and they were permitted to crow over their success until the following winter  a little over an hour and a half had been spent in the sport and two attacks had been made and repulsed much to the chagrin of stanley browne the senior in charge of the attacking army juniors and seniors had fought nobly but the freshmen and sophomores outnumbered them and being strongly intrenched behind the snow wall of the socalled fort had succeeded in forcing a first and then a second retreat  say fellows weve got to do it this time sure cried sam rover as side by side with stanley he led the attack if we dont oust them theyll never get done talking about it  right you are sam answered bob grimes who also had hands and arms full of wellmade snowballs  remember what i told you came from stanley as he turned slightly to address his followers dont throw any snowballs yet do as the soldiers did in revolutionary dayswait until you can see the whites of their eyes  and then make those whites blacks burst out spud jackson gaily come ahead and no turning back  up the snowy hillside sped the crowd of students while a number of professors and visitors watched the advance from a distance  get ready for em dont let them come too near came in a rallying cry from behind the snow wall and then as the attacking party came closer a volley of white spheres came flying through the air into the faces of the juniors and seniors  it was a sharp and heavy volley and for the instant the air seemed to be filled with flying snowballs many of them of course went wild but others landed on the heads and bodies of the attacking party and for the moment the advance was checked  wow came from one of the juniors who had been hit in the ear why cant we do some throwing ourselves  thats the talk give it to em came from another student who had had his cap knocked off by a snowball  no no answered stanley save your snowballs until we get closer  come on well soon be up there put in sam rover only a hundred feet more fellows  there was a yell of assent and forward the charging party went again in the face of another volley of snowballs by bending low the juniors and seniors protected themselves as much as possible from the onslaught but many were hit two so stingingly that they had to retire to the rear  hurrah weve got em on the run came from the leader of the fort contingent who had mounted a tree stump located behind the wall give it to em fellows give it too em hot  now then boys all together yelled stanley at the top of his voice and then the eager juniors and seniors launched their snowballs with all the swiftness and accuracy of aim at their command  the two previous attacks which had been repulsed had taught the advancing students a lesson and now in this third attack scarcely a snowball was wasted those in the front ran directly up to the wall of the fort while those farther back spread out as directed by their leader to the right and to the left sending in cross fires at points where the fort was supposed to be weakest  it was a thrilling and spirited fight but although the students were greatly excited there was little more actual roughness than there would have been at a football or other athletic contest  over the wall boys over the wall burst out sam rover and the next instant he was up on the wall of the fort quickly followed by stanley bob spud and several others  back there you rebels back came in a yell from the interior of the fort and then a wild fusillade of snowballs struck sam and his chums in various parts of their bodies  jumping hambones spluttered spud as a snowball took him directly in the chin what do you think im built of iron  get back or youll get worse was the cry from the fort and then another snowball took spud in the ear  in the meantime sam rover had dodged a ball which was coming directly for his face and now he returned the fire with a hard one that took the sophomore below him in the ear then sam jumped down into the fort quickly followed by eight or ten others  clear them out dont let them stay here was the wild cry  everybody around the flagpole was the command of the fort leader  the flagpole was a small one located in the center of the enclosure and from it fluttered the banners of the freshmen and the sophomore classes those making the attack would have to haul those banners down before they could claim a victory  snowballs were now flying in all directions and it was quite probable that in the excitement many of the students let fly at their friends instead of at the enemy but it was all good clean sport and everybody enjoyed it greatly  now then fellows for a center rush came from stanley when he and sam and about twenty others had forced their way to within ten yards of the flagpole  avalanche them boys avalanche them came suddenly from one of the sophomores and then without warning huge chunks of loose snow were sent flying through the air on the heads of those who were battling to get to the flagpole  great cæsars ghost spluttered bob as some of the snow went down inside his collar what is this a snowslide  oh you mustnt mind a little thing like that answered sam rover come ahead everybody push  there was a wild scramble with many yells and shouts student after student went down in the mêlée a few to be trampled upon but fortunately nobody was seriously hurt there was such a congestion that to make or throw more snowballs was out of the question and the most a fighter could do was to snatch up a handful of loose snow and thrust it down the neck of the student opposing him sam and stanley with four others close by them had now managed to get within a few feet of the flagpole here however the freshmen and sophomores had planted themselves in a solid mass and it looked for the moment as if nothing could budge them  only six minutes more boys only six minutes more came from one of the sophomores who had been detailed as a timekeeper save those banners for six minutes and well win  hit em fellows hit em roared stanley weve got to get those banners this year  and were going to do it added sam he turned to bob and spud boost me up fellows and ill walk right over their heads to the pole  all right if you want to take the chance answered spud and in a twinkling sam was shoved up into the air onto the shoulders of the boy in front of him  this student let out a cry of alarm but before he could do anything sam made a leap forward landing on the shoulders of two students close to the pole  fire him back dont let him reach the pole came in a yell from several throats  hold him by the ankles dont let him jump cried out the leader of the fort defenders  several students turned to clutch at the ankles of sam rover but he was too nimble for them and with another leap he reached the flagpole and clutched it tightly  hurrah rover has reached the pole  get those banners sam there is no time to spare  hold him pull him down maul him cried the fort defenders dont let him climb up the pole  several turned to clutch at sams legs and feet but he thrashed out wildly and all but one fell back fearing injury the undaunted student caught sam by a heel and held on very much as might a bulldog  let go there came from spud and the next instant he raised a chunk of snow and shoved it directly into the open mouth of the boy who had the grip this was too much for the student and he fell back among his fellows  only two minutes more yelled the timekeeper two minutes more  we wont need more than fifteen seconds came triumphantly from sam and as he spoke he commenced to climb the pole  a sophomore followed clutching again at one of his feet but now the rover boy had his hand on the first of the banners and down it came in a twinkling and the second quickly followed  here you are boys catch them sam cried and wadding the banners into something of a ball he hurled them out into the midst of a group of seniors  hurrah weve got em was the triumphant cry weve got em  times up yelled the timekeeper  a cheer arose from the juniors and seniors who quickly held the captured banners aloft the freshmen and sophomores were of course keenly disappointed and a number of them showed it  lets drive them out of the fort anyway was the sudden cry give it to em send em flying  wait wait this contest is at an end said a professor who was one of the umpires  never mind lets have some fun anyway this cry was taken up on every side and while some of the seniors retired with the two captured banners the other students continued the contest those who had held the fort doing all they possibly could to overcome and expel their enemies  as soon as he had thrown the banners sam slid down the pole and was now trying his best to make his way out of the crowd of freshmen and sophomores these students were very bitter against the rover boy and several did all they could to trip him up and cover him with snow  say sam that was great cried spud best i ever saw  out with em out with em was the yell dont let em stay in the fort even if they did get the banners  come on cried sam quickly now we have the banners let us drive them clean down the other side of the hill  this suggestion received instant approval and in spite of all that some of the professors could do to stop it the fight went on as furiously as ever some of the students who had retreated to a safe distance came back with a fresh supply of snowballs and the air was once more filled with the flying missiles  come on let us teach them a lesson cried bob grimes they should have stopped fighting as soon as the banners were captured let us give the sophomores and freshmen all they want  this cry was taken up on all sides and around and around the enclosure which had been designated the fort went the various crowds of students the blood of the juniors and seniors was now up and slowly but surely they forced the younger students to retreat then came a break and something of a panic and a few minutes later the fort defenders were retreating down the other side of the hill which led through some brushwood to a road that ran to ashton  after em after em dont let em get away cried sam and was one of the first to go down the hill after the retreating students on the way he paused only long enough to make several snowballs  having reached the road which led to the town the freshmen and sophomores divided some going behind a barn and others taking to the woods beyond not knowing exactly what to do next sam and several with him halted to consider the matter  there they go was the cry a moment later and a number of students were seen speeding around a corner of the road  thats bissel the fellow who hit me in the ear cried sam im going after him  and yes there is dutz who filled my mouth with snow cried spud come on  sam was already on the run and coming to the turn in the road he let fly several snowballs  here here what do you mean by such actions came suddenly from behind some brushwood which lined the roadway and then as the students advanced still further they were surprised to find themselves confronted by a tall man wearing a heavy furlined overcoat he had likewise been wearing a beaver hat but the tile now lay in the snow  belright fogg exclaimed sam in dismay that lawyer who tried to get the best of us and i thought he was one of the students  ha so it is you snarled the man in the fur overcoat harshly what do you mean rover by attacking me in this fashion     chapter ii  something about the rover boys   say that isnt one of the students  not much why thats the lawyer who used to do business for the railroad companythe man the rovers had so much trouble with  who knocked his hat off  i dont knowsam rover i guess  such were some of the remarks made as a number of the juniors and seniors began to congregate around sam and mr belright fogg all of the students could readily see that the lawyer was very much put out over what had occurred  i say rover what do you mean by attacking me in this fashion repeated belright fogg with a savage look at the youth before him  if i knocked your hat off mr fogg i am sorry for it answered sam as soon as he could recover from his surprise  knocked my hat off roared the lawyer you hit me a hard one on the head that is what you did  let me see if you are hurt put in stanley stepping forward where did the snowball hit you  you keep your hands off me returned belright fogg ive a good mind to have the law on such loafers as you  we are not loafers mr fogg answered sam the color coming quickly to his face we were having our annual snowballing contest and we did not know that any outsider was on this back road if i hit you and hurt you i am very sorry for it  humph i think you will be sorry for it if i bring a suit for damages muttered the lawyer i dont know why dr wallington permits such rowdyism  this isnt rowdyism nor are we loafers put in stanley somewhat sharply you seem to forget mr fogg that this road runs through the property belonging to brill college and we have a perfect right to hold our snowballing contest here if you want to report the matter to dr wall  bah i know you students and i wouldnt expect any sympathy from your teacher hes too afraid of losing any of his students belright fogg snatched his beaver hat from the hands of spud who had picked it up ill settle with you for this later rover he added and then turned on his heel and hurried down the road  i wonder what brought him on this back road on foot observed bob  he isnt on foot he has his horse and cutter beside the barn answered another student there he is now picking up a robe out of the snow it must have fallen out of the cutter and he walked back to get it which surmise was correct  this looks like more trouble for me said sam soberly im mighty sorry it was mr belright fogg i hit with that snowball  you can wager hell make out a case against you if he possibly can remarked spud lawyers of his calibre always do  well this settles the snowball fight for us put in stanley as he looked up and down the road the freshies and sophs are clear out of sight let us go back to the campus and celebrate our victory and then as belright fogg drove away in his cutter the students walked over the hill in the direction of brill  to my old readers the youths already mentioned in these pages will need no special introduction for the benefit of others however let me state that sam rover was the youngest of three brothers dick being the eldest and funloving tom coming next they were the sons of one anderson rover a rich widower and had for years made their home with their uncle randolph and their aunt martha at a beautiful farm called valley brook  from the farm and while their father was in africa the three rover boys had been sent by their uncle to school as related in the first volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school this place was called putnam hall military academy and there the lads made many friends and likewise several enemies and had the time of their lives as tom rover often expressed it       for particulars regarding how putnam hall military academy     was organized and what fine times the cadets there enjoyed     even before the rover boys came on the scene read the putnam     hall series six volumes starting with the putnam hall     cadetspublishers  the first term at school was followed by an exciting trip on the ocean and then another trip into the jungles of africa where the boys went looking for their parent then came a trip to the west followed by some grand times on the great lakes and in the mountains then the boys returned to putnam hall to go into an encampment with their fellowcadets  this term at putnam hall was followed by a nevertobeforgotten journey on land and sea to a faraway island in the pacific then they returned to this country sailing down the ohio and mississippi rivers after leaving the father of waters they took an outing on the plains and then went down into southern waters where they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht  after so many exciting adventures the three brothers had been glad to journey to the home farm for a rest after which they returned to putnam hall settled down to their studies and graduated with considerable honor  now for college dick rover had said but before setting out for brill a fine institution of learning located in the middle west the boys had become involved in a search for a fortune left on treasure isle  during their days at putnam hall the rover boys had become well acquainted with dora stanhope who lived near the school with her widowed mother and also with nellie and grace laning doras two cousins who resided a short distance farther away it had not been long before dick and dora showed a great liking for each other and at the same time tom often paired off with nellie and sam was frequently seen in the company of grace  a few miles away from brill college was located hope seminary an institution for girls and when the rover boys went to brill dora nellie and grace went to hope so that the young folks met almost as often as before  a term at brill college was followed by an unexpected trip down east where the rovers brought to terms a rascally exschoolteacher named josiah crabtree who had given them much trouble while at putnam hall  in those days the art of flying was attracting considerable attention and through the indulgence of their father the rover boys became the possessors of a biplane and took several thrilling trips through the air their experiences in that line coming to an abrupt finish when the flying machine was one day wrecked on the railroad tracks this had brought on a sharp contest between the rover boys and the railroad lawyer mr belright fogg the rovers had claimed all that was coming to them and the railroad had been made to pay up much to belright foggs disgust later the lawyer had been discharged by the railroad from its services  about this time mr anderson rover who was not in the best of health was having much trouble with brokers in new york city who were trying to swindle him out of some property the brokers were pelter jackson  company and it was not long before the rover boys discovered that pelter was in league with josiah crabtree in a struggle poor tom rover was hit on the head by a wooden footstool thrown by pelter and knocked unconscious this had so affected his mind that he wandered off to alaska and sam and dick had many adventures trying to locate him when he was found he was brought home and placed under the care of a specialist and soon was as well as ever  dick rover was now growing older and with his father in such poor health it was decided that the youth should leave brill become married to dora and settle down in charge of the office in wall street new york this plan was carried out as related in detail in the volume preceding this entitled the rover boys in business at that time sam and tom still remained at brill but an urgent message from dick brought them quickly to the metropolis a large number of unregistered bonds belonging to the rovers had mysteriously disappeared and all the boys went on a hunt to recover the securities in the end it was learned that their old enemy jesse pelter was the guilty party and he was brought to justice then it was felt that dick needed assistance in the office and it was decided much to toms satisfaction that he might get married to nellie laning and move to the city  that will leave me all alone at brill said sam rover at that time  well you shouldnt mind that so much tom rover had replied remember grace will still be at hope at which words the youngest rover had blushed deeply  when the rovers had gone to brill college they had been accompanied by their oldtime school chum john powell always called songbird on account of his propensity for writing doggerel which he insisted on calling poetry at the same time there came to brill from putnam hall one william philander tubbs a very dudish student with whom the boys often had great fun  it did not take the three rover boys long to make a number of friends at brill these included stanley browne a tall gentlemanly youth bob grimes who was greatly interested in baseball will jackson always called spud because of his unusual fondness for potatoes and max spangler a germanamerican youth who was still struggling with the language and who had failed to advance in his studies so that at the present time he was only in the sophomore class they had also made several enemies but these had for the time being left brill  youll be the hero of this occasion sam remarked stanley as the students tramped in the direction of the college campus  hero of the occasion i suppose for hitting mr fogg in the head returned sam with a slight grin  oh forget that burst out spud i dont think hell do a thing remember the affair occurred on the college grounds just as stanley said  say where is songbird today asked paul orben he ought to have been in this fight  he wanted to come very much answered sam but he had a special errand to do for mr sanderson who is laid up with a broken ankle  was he doing the errand for mr sanderson or for minnie questioned stanley and then a short laugh went up for it was well known among the young collegians that songbird powell and the daughter of mr sanderson a prosperous farmer of that vicinity were much attached to each other  as sam rover and his friends reached the college campus a great cheer arose  there he is  here the conquering hero comes  let us put him up on our shoulders fellows and a rush was made towards the youngest rover boy  not much not today returned sam and slid back behind some of his friends  aw come on sam cried one of the students you are the hero of the occasion and you know it  forget it snips answered sam what did the fellows do with those banners  lentwell has them he is keeping them for you i suppose youll nail them up in your den  surest thing you know  maybe the freshies and sophs will want them back put in another youth in the crowd  not much they can have them back after i graduate next june answered sam they have got to understand stop it fellows stop it i dont want to well if youve got to i suppose ill have to submit and an instant later sam found himself hoisted up on the shoulders of several stalwart seniors who tramped around and around the college campus with him while all the other seniors and also the juniors cheered wildly and waved their caps  doesnt that make you feel proud sam asked spud during a lull in the proceedings  it sure does spud was the quick reply ive only got one regretthat dick and tom arent here to share this victory with us  yes its a shame and just to think of it after next june when we graduate well all be scattered here there and everywhere and the good old times at brill will be a thing of the past  dont mention such things put in stanley it makes me sick clean to the heels every time i think of it but i suppose college days cant last forever weve got to go out into the world just as our fathers did before us  yes and ive got to get into business answered sam i want to help father as well as dick and tom all i can  hi fellows was the unexpected cry from the lower end of the campus here come the freshies and the sophs back line up and be ready to receive them  thats it line up line up everybody ordered stanley give them our old song of victory     chapter iii  what happened to songbird   it was fully half an hour later before sam rover could break away from his college chums and run up to room number 25 which he had formerly occupied with his brother tom and which he now shared with songbird powell  nearly a week before the youngest rover had made a date with grace laning inviting her if the snow remained on the ground to a sleighride that afternoon and evening at that time sam had forgotten completely that this day was the date set for the annual snowballing contest  i think ill go anyway he had remarked to songbird the day before but then had come word to his roommate that mr sanderson wanted him on a matter of importance and stanley as the leader of the seniors had insisted upon it that he could not spare both of his chums  all right then sam had answered finally you can go songbird and do what mr sanderson wants you to and ill put off my sleighride with grace until after the contest and so it had been settled  there were no public turnouts at the college but sam had arranged with abner filbury who worked around the place with his father to obtain for him a firstclass horse and cutter from the ashton livery stable  that horse is some goer believe me remarked abner when he came to the door of sams room to tell him that the turnout was in readiness youll have to keep your eye on him mr rover  all right ab trust me to take care of him returned sam lightly dont forget that i was brought up on a farm and my uncle randolph had some pretty spirited animals  have a good time sam cried spud who was present to see his chum depart wish i was going to see such a nice girl  oh your time will come some day answered sam  are you going directly to hope  yes  alone  i expect to unless you want to ride along that far  say id like that firstrate returned spud eagerly i know some of the girls up there and id like to call on them i wouldnt mind walking back later on  then come on if you are ready i havent any time to wait  oh im always ready came from spud and he lost no time in bestowing himself beside sam  the latter gathered up the reins gave a slight chirp to the horse and away they sped out of the college grounds and on to the highway leading past hope seminary which was about two miles distant  the air was cool and bracing and the snow on the highway well packed down so that the cutter slid over it with ease as abner filbury had said the steed was a mettlesome one and soon sam found he had all he could do to hold the horse in  some goer that remarked spud as he pulled his cap down tighter to keep it from flying off puts me in mind of a race horse  yes i shouldnt wonder but what he could make a mile in almost record time responded sam as they flew along past the trees bushes and occasional farm buildings which lined the roadway near brill  you want to watch yourself with a horse that goes as fast as that returned spud with a chuckle if you dont youll get a mile or two past hope before you know it and at this little joke sam grinned  early in the ride they passed one or two cutters and several farm wagons then they reached a turn in the road and to their surprise saw ahead of them a sign resting on a large wooden horse  road closed  hello what does this mean queried sam as he brought his horse to a standstill i didnt know this road was shut off  oh yes i heard something about this come to think of it returned spud they are going to move that old jackson barn from one side of the road to the other and they must have closed the road for that purpose youll have to take the old road on the left sam  i suppose so grumbled the other too bad too for this road was just about perfect for sleighing but never mind i suppose i can get through on the other road well enough  they turned back a distance of less than two hundred feet and then took to the side road which spud had mentioned this was more hilly than the other and ran through a long patch of timberland on which no houses were located  hark dont i hear another sleigh coming questioned spud a minute later  something is coming thats sure answered sam gracious me look at that  coming to another bend of the woodland road the youngest rover had barely time to pull his steed well toward the right hand and almost into some bushes when another cutter hove into sight coming along at a furious rate the horse was on a gallop and the man driving him a fellow wrapped up in a heavy overcoat and with a fur cap pulled far down over his forehead was using his whip freely  wow that fellow must be in some hurry observed spud as the other turnout flashed past he isnt sparing his horse any  its a lucky thing for me that i pulled in here as i did returned sam and his tone of voice showed his anger if i hadnt done it he would have run into us sure pop  youre right sam that fellow had no right to come along in that fashion he ought to be arrested for reckless driving but maybe he wants to catch a train at ashton or something like that  no train he could catch for an hour and a half spud and he could walk to the station in that time and thus speaking sam chirruped to the horse and they resumed their ride  a little farther on the woodland road made another turn and here the way was uphill the numerous rains of the summer previous had washed the rocks bare of dirt and often the cutter bumped and scraped so badly that sam was compelled to bring his steed down to a walk  well one satisfaction well be back to the main road before long observed spud as they finally reached the top of the hill and could get a view of the surroundings there is the other road just below us  hello whats that ahead cried sam pointing with his left hand looks to me like somebody lying in the snow  it is somebody exclaimed his chum say do you suppose that other horse was running away and this fellow fell out  not much with that other fellow using the whip as he was returned sam this fellow ahead probably had nothing to do with that other cutter excepting he may have been knocked down by the horse he added suddenly  thats what the trouble is that rascal knocked this fellow down and then hurried on sam poor fellow i wonder if he is much hurt  by this time the cutter had reached a point opposite to where the person in the snow rested all the boys could see was some person wrapped in an overcoat lying face downward a cap that looked strangely familiar to sam lay close at hand stopping the horse sam leaped from the cutter and spud did the same  say sam burst out the latter it looks like  songbird burst out the rover boy its songbird spud and hes badly hurt  it was indeed poor songbird powell who rested there in the snow by the roadside he had on his overcoat and his furlined gloves but his head was bare and from a cut on his left temple the blood was flowing the boys turned their college chum over and at this songbird uttered a low moan  he has either had an accident or been attacked was spuds comment i wonder how badly hes hurt  im afraid its pretty bad answered sam soberly thats a nasty cut and say his chin is all swelled up as if he had been hit there with a club  the two boys knelt beside their unconscious chum and did what they could to revive him but songbird did not open his eyes nor did he make any other sound than a low moan  well have to get him somewhere out of this biting cold air observed sam there is a farmhouse just below here on the main road let us put him in the cutter and carry him there  when they picked songbird up he uttered another moan and for an instant his eyes opened but then he collapsed as before they deposited him on the seat of the turnout and sam picked up his cap and several books that lay scattered around with sober faces the boys led the mettlesome horse down the slope to the main road both kept their eyes on their chum but he still remained insensible  maybe he wont get over it suggested spud  oh dont say that cried sam in horror it cant be as bad as that and then he added spud did you notice the looks of that horse when he dashed past us  i didnt have time to notice much was the reply  did he wear white stockings  what oh i know what you meanwhite feet yes he had white feet i know that much  and did he have any white under his neck  yes i think he did do you think you know the horse sam  i know mr sanderson has a horse with white feet and a white chesta dark horse just like that one was  then it must have been mr sandersons horse and cutter cried spud if it was do you think that man was running away with the outfit  i dont know what to think spud to my mind its a mighty serious piece of business but our first duty is to do all we can for poor songbird  arriving at the nearest farmhouse spud ran ahead and knocked on the door a woman answered the summons and as she happened to know the youth she readily consented to have songbird brought in and laid on a couch in the diningroom hardly had this been done when the sufferer slowly opened his eyes  dondont hit mmme again he murmured pleplease dont  its all right songbird dont you know me said sam quietly  the injured collegian opened his eyes again and stared at the youth before him  sam whwhere did you cocome from  spud and i found you on the road face down in the snow answered sam what happened did you fall out of the cutter or were you attacked  ii oh how my head spins muttered songbird he closed his eyes again and was silent for a moment then he looked once more at sam  i was attacked he mumbled the manhe hit mewith a cluband hauled me out of the cutter  it must have been the fellow we saw on the road exclaimed spud songbird why did he do it  iidodont know mumbled the sufferer but maybe i do he suddenly shouted in a strangely unnatural voice then with a sudden strength born of fear he raised his left hand and dived down into the inner pocket of his coat the package its gone  the package what package queried sam  the package belonging to mr sanderson gasped poor songbird the package with the four thousand dollars in it its gone and with another groan songbird lapsed once more into unconsciousness     chapter iv  the chase   it must be confessed that sam and spud as well as the woman of the house were very much surprised over the statement made by songbird  attacked and robbed murmured sam what an awful thing to do  he said he had been robbed of four thousand dollars broke in spud where in the world would he get that much money he must be dreaming sam  i hardly think so spud i know he was to go on a very important errand for mr sanderson who is laid up at home with a sprained ankle  well if songbird was robbed its more than likely the fellow we saw in the cutter did it  exactly and the chances are he will get away just as fast as he possibly can added sam bitterly  what do you think we ought to do  i think we ought to notify the authorities spud  hadnt we better wait until we get some particulars from songbird  not much the quicker we get after that fellow the better remember he is running away not only with the money but also with mr sandersons horse and cutter many people living in this vicinity know mr sandersons animal and that may help us to locate that rascal sam turned to the woman of the house have you a telephone  no we havent any but the folks in the next house up the road have one  then ill go there and telephone said sam you do what you can for songbird spud ill try to get a doctor too while im at it  in a few seconds more sam was on the way using his horse and cutter for that purpose arriving at the next farmhouse he readily received permission to use the telephone and at once got into communication with the authorities in ashton and asked the official in charge to send word around to the various towns and villages within the next ten or fifteen miles and he also sent word to a physician at ashton then he managed to get grace on the wire  im afraid ill be late he told the girl and maybe i wont be able to get there at all he added songbird has been knocked down on the road and robbed and he is in pretty bad shape  oh sam isnt that too bad was graces reply do you mean that he is seriously injured  we cant tell yet grace i have just telephoned for the doctor and now i am going back to the bray farmhouse where songbird is to wait for him and after that sam gave the girl as many details of the affair as he deemed necessary  oh i hope he gets over it sam said grace and to think he was robbed of all that money if they cant get it back what ever will songbird and the sandersons do  i dont know he returned it certainly is a bad piece of business but now ive got to go back so ill say goodbye  goodbye sam and you stay with songbird just as long as you please we can have our sleighride some other time  when sam returned to the bray farmhouse he found that spud and the lady of the house had washed songbirds wound and bound it up the lady had also brought forth some simple home remedies and these had been so efficacious that songbird was sitting on the couch propped up by numerous pillows  did you catch him asked the sufferer eagerly as sam entered  ive sent word to the police songbird and sent word for a doctor too now you had better take it easy until the doctor comes  but how can i take it easy with that four thousand dollars missing groaned the youth on the couch why i cant make that amount up and mr sanderson cant afford to lose it  how does your head feel  it feels sore all over and sometimes spins like a top but i wouldnt care about that if only i could get that money back cant you and spud go after that rascal  im willing if you want us to songbird but youll have to promise to stay here until the doctor comes we dont want you to attempt to do anything while you are in your present condition  oh ill stay here dont fear answered songbird grimly i just tried to stand up and i went in a heap and spud and the lady had to put me back on this couch  lets take that horse of yours and go after that fellow sam burst out spud eagerly that horse is a goer as we know and we ought to be able to catch that man sooner or later  providing we can follow his trail spud answered sam you must remember there are a good many side roads around here and he can take to any one he pleases  but we might be able to find the footprints of the horse in the snow  possibly although i doubt it with so many other horses using the highway however come on well do the best we can sam turned again to the sufferer now songbird you keep quiet until the doctor comes and then you do exactly as he orders  maybe mrs bray will see to that ventured spud  i will if you want me to responded the woman of the house that cut on his head is a nasty one and if he doesnt take care of himself it may make him real sick  in a moment more sam and spud were out of the house and into the cutter which was then headed up the side road where they had found songbird here they stopped for an instant to take another look around and picked up two more books which had escaped their notice before  books of poetry both of em remarked spud songbird thinks more of a poem than he does of a square meal and he smiled a bit grimly  it did not take long to reach the spot where the other cutter had passed them they went straight on soon reaching the point where the woodland road joined the main highway  now you see here is where we are going to get mixed up announced sam as they moved in the direction of brill did the fellow go straight to ashton or did he turn off to one of the other places  the folks traveling along the road must have seen him returned spud let us make some inquiries as we go along  this was a good suggestion and was carried out they found a farmer who had seen the strange man in the cutter drive toward ashton and a little later they met two ladies in a sleigh who declared that the fellow had turned into a side road leading to a hamlet known as lesters corners  if he went there we ought to have a chance to catch him cried spud this road i know doesnt go beyond the corners  yes but he could take a road from there to dentonville answered sam and you know that is quite a railroad station  but if he went to dentonville and to the railroad station couldnt you telephone to the operator there to have him held  maybe spud providing there is any telephone at the corners  onward they went once more through some heavy woodland and then over several small hills finally coming in sight of the corners where were located a general store a blacksmiths shop a chapel and about a dozen houses  did i see a feller in a cutter goin as fast as he could repeated the storekeeper when questioned by sam you just bet i did gee whiz but he was goin to beat the band  and which way did he head questioned the rover boy eagerly  headed right straight for dentonville  and how long ago was this put in spud  oh about quarter of an hour i should say say he nearly skeered old mrs rasley to deth she was acrossin the road comin to my store when he swung aroun that corner yonder and he come within a foot of runnin over her she wanted to git joe mason the constable to arrest him but gee whiz there wasnt no arrestin to ithe was out o sight before you could say jack robinson  have you any telephone connection with dentonville questioned sam  aint got no telephone here at all the telephone fellers promised to put a line through here three years ago but somehow they haint got around to doin it you see squire buzby owns some of their stock and he dont think that we ought to  thats all right captain broke in sam hastily then if we want to catch that fellow all we can do is to go after him eh  thets about the size on it returned the storekeeper now you see if we had thet telephone here we might be able to  thats so we might but as the telephone is missing well go after him in our cutter broke in sam and a few seconds later he and spud were once more on their way  the road to dentonville was not much traveled and for a mile and a half they met no one then just as they reached a crossing they came in sight of an old farmer driving a boxsled filled with milk cans  did you meet a man driving a horse and cutter very rapidly questioned sam after he drew up a dark horse with a white breast and white feet  i jest guess i did replied the farmer he come pretty close to runnin into me  which way was he headed  headed straight for dentonville  can you tell me when the next train stops there  the train is due there in about fifteen minutes and she wont stop moren long enough to put my milk cans on board i jest left em there and got these empty ones explained the farmer pointing to the cans behind him  fifteen minutes cried spud and how far is it from here  nigh on to three miles  is it a good road queried sam  pretty fair its some washed out on the hills but the snow has covered the wost of the holes want to ketch that feller  we certainly do that horse and cutter belongs to mr sanderson  by gum you dont say did he steal the turnout  he certainly did answered spud and nearly killed a young fellow in the bargain  then i hope you ketch im answered the farmer and stood up in his sled to watch sam and spud as they sped once more along the highway leading to dentonville  the boys had a long hill ahead and before the top was gained the horse attached to the cutter was glad enough to settle down to a walk but once the ridge was passed he did not need much urging and flew along almost as rapidly as ever  this horse must have been in the stable for quite some time remarked spud he evidently enjoys the outing thoroughly  listen cried sam a little later isnt that the whistle of a locomotive  it sure is sam that must be the train coming into dentonville  they were passing through a small patch of timber and directly beyond were the cleared fields and the buildings of a tidy farm as the boys came out of the woods they looked over the fields in the direction of dentonville and saw a mixed train composed of several passenger coaches and a string of freights entering the station  there she is cried sam oh if only we can get there before she leaves  he spoke to the horse and did what he could to urge the steed forward at a greater rate of speed than ever much to the astonishment of several onlookers they dashed into the outskirts of dentonville and then along the main street leading down to the railroad station  hi stop roared a voice at them just as they were crossing one of the side streets directly in front of a sleigh and two wagons hi stop i tell you you aint got no right to drive that fast here in town and a bluecoated policeman one of the four of which the place boasted shook his club at the boys and ran out in front of their cutter  illustration a bluecoated policeman shook his club at the boys  say officer you are just the man we want cried sam hurriedly come on with us we want to have a man arrested down at the depot before he has a chance to get away on the train  whats that want a man arrested queried the bluecoat what has he done  a whole lot of things broke in spud jump in we havent any time to explain nowthat train may pull out at any moment  thats so so it might replied the officer and then as spud made room for him he sprang into the cutter sitting on the boys lap but you look out that you dont kill somebody he added to sam who was now using the whip lightly to urge the horse to greater efforts  they were still two blocks away from the railroad station when there came a whistle followed by the clanging of a bell and then they saw the train moving away  there she goes groaned spud but she isnt moving very fast  maybe we can catch her yet returned sam and then the race continued as before     chapter v  at the railroad station   see anybody sam  nobody that looks like that man spud but there is mr sandersons horse with the cutter  yes i spotted those right away look how the poor nag is heaving he must have been driven almost to death  that may be although we got here almost as quickly as he did but he may have been used quite some before this trip returned sam and this surmise was correct  the two boys with the policeman had done their best to catch the departing train and have it stop but without avail when they had reached the depot the last of the cars was well down the line and soon the train had disappeared around a curve of the roadbed  whats the matter ike what are you after queried the freight agent as he came up to the policeman  we are after the man who was driving that cutter yonder explained sam did you see hima big fellow with a heavy overcoat and with a fur cap pulled down over his forehead  why yes i saw that fellow get aboard answered the freight agent i was wondering what he was going to do with his horse he didnt even stop to put a blanket over the animal  that fellow was a thief explained sam i wonder if we cant have him captured in some way what is the next station the train will stop at  penton  how far is that from here  about six miles  and after that  shell stop at leadenfield which is about six miles farther  then ill send a telegram to penton and another to leadenfield to have the train searched and the man arrested if he can be spotted said sam and a few minutes later he was in the telegraph office writing out the messages he described the man as well as he could but realized that his efforts were rather hopeless  maybe songbird could give us a better description he said to his chum but as songbird isnt here and as we cant get him on the telephone well have to do the best we can  the policeman was of course anxious to know some of the details of what had occurred and when the boys told him that their college chum had been knocked senseless and robbed of four thousand dollars he was greatly surprised  its too bad you didnt get here before the train started he observed if you had we might have nabbed that rascal and maybe got a reward and he smiled grimly  we dont want any reward we simply want to get that four thousand dollars back returned sam and we would like to put that fellow in prison for the way he treated our college chum  what will you do with the horse and cutter  if there is a livery stable handy i think ill put the horse up there answered sam he is evidently in no condition to be driven farther at present ill notify mr sanderson about it and so it was arranged  a little while later after the two boys had walked around to the police station with the officer and given such particulars as they were able concerning the assault and robbery sam and spud started on the return to the bray farmhouse when they arrived there they found that dr havens and dr wallington had come in some time before by the directions of the head of brill the physician from ashton had given songbird a thorough examination and had treated him with some medicine from his case  the cut on his head is rather a deep one said the doctor to the boys but fortunately it is not serious nor will there be any bad effects from the blow on his chin he can thank his stars though that the crack on his head did not fracture his skull  we are going to take him back to brill in a large sleigh said dr wallington and then i think the best he can do will be to go to bed  oh i cant do that broke in songbird who was still on the couch propped up by pillows ive got to get to mr sandersons and explain how the thing happened  you had better let me do that songbird answered sam kindly i can drive over there and spud can go with me you just let us know exactly how it occurred this of course was after the boys had related the particulars of their failure to catch the fleeing criminal at dentonville  it happened so quickly that i hardly realized what was taking place answered the wouldbe poet of brill i was driving along from knoxbury where i had been to the bank for mr sanderson when i came to the spot where i suppose you found me just as i reached there a man in a heavy overcoat and with a thick fur cap pulled over his face so that i could hardly see him stepped in front of the cutter  say can you tell me where these people live he asked me and thrust a sheet of paper towards me ive lost my eyeglasses and i cant see to read without them  i took the paper he handed out and started to look at some writing on it which was very indistinct as i bent over the paper the man swung a club or something in the air and struck me on the head then as i tried to leap up and defend myself he hit me another blow on the chin that seemed to knock me clean out of the cutter and that is all i know about it  then you dont know where that fellow came from queried spud  no more than that he came from the bushes beside the road songbird seemed to meditate for a moment now i come to think of it though maybe thats the same fellow that watched me go into the bank at knoxbury and get the money for mr sanderson he cried suddenly  it was a very unwise move on mr sandersons part to have you get that money for him in cash observed dr wallington i do not understand why he could not have transacted his business with a check especially if it was certified  i dont know much about that part of it answered songbird excepting he told me that the old man with whom he was doing business was something of a crank and didnt believe in banks or checks and said he wanted nothing but solid cash its a pity now that mr sanderson didnt use a check and songbird heaved a deep sigh  but what did you just say about a man watching you when you went into the bank questioned sam  oh i noticed that fellow hanging around the building just as i went in returned songbird he was asking the janitor about the trains out of town and the reason i noticed him was because he had a peculiar stutter and whistle when he talked he went like this and songbird imitated a man who was stuttering badly ending in a faint whistle  great scott a fellow ought to know a man who talked like that anywhere was spuds comment should be able to pick him out in the dark and at this sally even dr wallington smiled faintly  of course im not sure that that man had anything to do with it went on songbird but he was the only fellow around who seemed to notice me when i got the money when the bills were passed over to me there were forty onehundreddollar bills i took them to a little side stand to place them in a wallet mr sanderson had lent me and then i wrapped the wallet in a piece of paper with a stout string around it as i did this i noticed the man who stuttered and whistled peering at me hungrily through a side window of the bank  and the fellow wore a heavy overcoat and a fur cap questioned sam  yes i am sure of that  then it is more than likely he was the guilty party remarked spud  but hold on a minute broke in sam you got the money at knoxbury and this attack took place on the road above here which is at least seven miles from that place now if the man who did the deed was at the bank when you drew the money how did he get here in time to hold you up  i dont know about that sam but i didnt leave knoxbury immediately after getting the money i had an errand to do for minnie she wanted me to pick out aera necktie for my birthday and iwell i looked around two or three stores trying to find something nice to take back to her i bought two books of poetry but i dont know where they are now  we found them on the road and they are out in the cutter answered sam spud you might bring them in and give them to songbird  the errands kept me in town for about half an hour after i was at the bank continued the youth who had been attacked  and where had you left mr sandersons cutter in the meantime  right in front of the bank building the horse tied to a post  that would give the man time to get another turnout in which to follow you said sam  but if he did that i dont see how he got ahead of you  well maybe he didnt and maybe it was some one else who did the deed returned sam  you had better not worry your head too much about this affair mr powell said dr havens that crack on the head might have been more serious but at the same time you ought to take care of yourself for a day or two at least  then you dont think i ought to go to mr sandersons queried the wouldbe poet of the college  not just yet if you feel stronger you might go there tomorrow or the day after  then will you go sam and try to explain matters questioned songbird eagerly  of course ill go songbird  and ill go with him added spud  a large sleigh had been brought to the farmhouse by dr wallington and songbird was placed in this and made as comfortable as possible among the robes and blankets which it contained mr bray the owner of the farm had been up in the timber bringing down some firewood and now when he approached the others saw that he had tied behind his sled an extra horse  hello where did that horse come from cried sam is it yours  no taint mine said timothy bray i found it up in the woods right near the road yonder and he pointed with his hand as he spoke  found that horse in the woods cried spud then that explains it  it sure does returned sam  explains what demanded timothy bray whats goin on down here anyway he continued looking at his wife and then at the others  oh timothy an awful thing has happened cried mrs bray and then she and the others gave the farmer a few of the particulars he listened with mouth wide open and then looked at the horse which he had found  i guess you are right he exclaimed that feller got this horse in knoxbury its one that belongs to hoover the livery stable man i know him on account of this brand on his left flank its a horse cy tamen used to own and swapped for a bay mare  then i think that explains it declared sam that rascal saw songbird get the money and he at once went to the livery stable and hired the horse and followed songbird to the spot where the attack was made more than likely he passed songbird on the road  thats just what he did cried the youth who had been struck down i remember now i was busy composing some poetry when i noticed a fellow on horseback go past me and disappear around a turn in the road and that was just a few minutes before that fellow came up with a sheet of paper and knocked me senseless  i believe you have made out a pretty clear case was dr wallingtons comment now if we can only reach that man who stuttered and whistled i think we shall have the culprit  we telephoned ahead from dentonville if they can only locate him on the train it will be all right answered sam but you must remember we didnt have very much of a description to go by  yes and that fellow may be fixed to change his appearance a good deal added spud a man isnt going to get his hands on four thousand dollars without doing all he possibly can to get away with it especially when he knows that if he is caught he will be sent to prison  what am i going to do with this horse questioned timothy bray  you had better keep that animal in your stable until the livery man from knoxbury calls for him answered dr wallington  hell have to pay me for doing it was mr brays reply every time i go to knoxbury hoover charges me an outrageous price for putting up at his stable and now i can get even with him and he chuckled over the thought     chapter vi  at the sanderson home   it was just about supper time when sam accompanied by spud drove into the lane beside the sanderson farmhouse which was lit up from end to end  evidently minnie sanderson the pretty daughter of the farmer had been on the watch for as they approached the house she came out on a side piazza to meet them  why songbird what kept you so long she cried and then added whos that with you  it isnt songbird minnie answered sam after he sprang out of the cutter followed by spud weve got some news for you  oh sam rover exclaimed the girl and will jackson whatever brought you here where is songbirddo you know anything about him  yes we do and that is what brought us here answered sam  oh sam you dont mean thatthat something has happened to john faltered the girl turning pale  yes something did happen minnie but dont be alarmedhe isnt hurt very much come into the house and well tell you and your father all about it  hurt oh are you sure it isnt serious now please dont hold anything back  ill give you my word minnie it isnt serious the doctor said he would be as well as ever in a few days but he is rather knocked out and the doctor said he had better not try to come here so then he asked spud and me to come  while sam was speaking he and spud had led the girl back into the house she was very much agitated and her manner showed it  but what was it sam do tell me did that horse run away with him i know john isnt much of a driver and when he gets to composing poetry he doesnt notice things and becomes so careless  no minnie it was not that where is your father well go to him and then well tell you the whole story  whats this i hear came from the diningroom where mr sanderson rested in a morris chair with his sprained ankle perched on a footstool where is john and what about that money he was to get for me  good evening mr sanderson said sam coming in and shaking hands followed by spud weve got some bad news for you but please dont blame songbirdi mean johnfor i am sure he was not to blame  thats right broke in spud what happened might have occurred to any of us i think we ought to be thankful that songbirdthats the name we all call john you knowwasnt killed  oh but do tell me what did happen pleaded minnie  and what about my moneyis that safe demanded mr sanderson  no mr sanderson i am sorry to say the fellow who attacked songbird got away with it  gone my four thousand dollars gone ejaculated the farmer dont tell me that i cant afford to lose any such amount why its the savings of years and his face showed his intense anxiety  oh so john was attacked who did it i suppose they must have half killed the poor boy in order to get the money away from him wailed minnie  we might as well tell you the whole story from beginning to end answered sam and then after he and spud had taken off their overcoats and gloves both plunged into all the details of the occurrence as they knew them  and he was hit on the head and on the chin oh how dreadful burst out minnie and are you positive sam it was not serious  that is what dr havens said and he made a close examination in the presence of dr wallington  he ought to have been more careful said mr sanderson bitterly  but pa how could he have been interposed the daughter  oh in lots of ways he might have placed that money inside of his shirt answered the father it dont do to carry four thousand dollars around just as if it wasaabook of poetry or something like that he added with a touch of sarcasm  pa i think its real mean of you to talk that way flared up minnie john told me that he didnt much like the idea of bringing that four thousand dollars in cash from the bank but he undertook the errand just to please you  humph well i was foolish to send him on the errand i should have got some man who knew how to take care of such an amount of cash  mr sanderson i dont think its fair for you to blame songbird broke in spud he did the best he could and of course he had no idea that he was going to be attacked  its all well enough for you to talk young man broke out the farmer angrily it wasnt your four thousand dollars that was stolen i wanted that money to pay off the mortgage on this farm its due tomorrow and the reason i wanted cash was because old grisley insisted on cash and nothing else he lost a lot of money in the bank years ago and that soured him so he wouldnt take a check nohow now what im going to do if i cant pay that mortgage i dont know and me down here with a sprained ankle too he added with increasing bitterness  youll have to tell mr grisley to wait for his money said sam when he learns the particulars of this affair he ought to be willing to wait  if i could only walk id get on the trail of that thief somehow muttered mr sanderson its a shame ive got to sit here and do nothin when four thousand dollars of mine is floatin away nobody knows where  we have notified the police and sent telegrams ahead just as i told you answered sam i dont see what more we can do at present songbird was attacked so suddenly that he isnt sure that the fellow who did it is the same fellow he saw around the knoxbury bank or not but if he is the same fellow we have a pretty fair description of him and sooner or later the authorities may be able to run him down  oh i know the police snorted the farmer they aint worth a hill of beans  well songbird told me to tell you that if the money is not recovered he will do all he can to make good the loss continued sam  make good the loss has he got four thousand dollars questioned the farmer curiously  oh no songbird isnt as wealthy as all that he has only his regular allowance but he said hed work and earn the money if he had to  humph how is he going to earn itwriting poetry they dont pay much for that kind of writing to my way of thinking  now pa please dont get so excited soothed the daughter let us be thankful that john wasnt killed if he had been i never would have forgiven you for having sent him on that errand  oh now dont you pitch into me minnie cried the father ive lost my four thousand dollars and thats bad enough if i cant pay that mortgage grisley may foreclose and then you and me will be out of a home  nothing like that will happen mr sanderson said sam  i dont know why  the mortgage is on this farm isnt it  yes  is it the only mortgage you have if i may ask  it is  and what do you consider the farm worth  well i was offered eight thousand dollars for it last year and i refused to sell  then i think it will be an easy matter to arrange to have the mortgage taken up by somebody else possibly my father or my uncle will do it  will they demanded mr sanderson eagerly well of course that would be some help but at the same time it wouldnt bring my four thousand dollars back he added glumly  after that minnie demanded to know more concerning songbirds condition and the two youths gave her every possible detail  if i had a telephone here i might send word to ashton to find out if they had tracked that rascal yet said mr sanderson but they asked so much money to put a telephone in over here i didnt have em do it  where is the nearest telephone questioned spud  nothin closer nor the railroad station at busbys crossing  thats only half a mile away put in sam we might drive over there now and see if there is anything new  you wait until you have had your supper interposed minnie its all ready i was expecting john you know and she blushed slightly  but if your father is anxious to get word began the rover boy  oh i suppose you might as well wait and have somethin to eat first said the farmer that will give the authorities time to do somethin if they are goin to  in the expectation of having songbird to supper minnie with the aid of a young hired girl had provided quite an elaborate meal to which it is perhaps needless to state the young collegians did full justice then the youths lost no time in driving off in the cutter to busbys crossing where they were lucky enough to find the station agent still in charge although on the point of locking up for no more trains would stop at the crossing that night  the boys first telephoned to the college and to ashton and then to dentonville and the railroad stations up the line to get the various connections took considerable time and to get information that was no information at all as spud expressed it took much longer still the sum total of it was that no one had been able to trace the man in the heavy overcoat and with the heavy fur cap and no one had the slightest idea about what had become of that muchwanted individual  its going to be like looking for the proverbial pin in the haystack remarked spud  its too bad returned sam gloomily i did think wed have some sort of encouraging word to take back to mr sanderson  say hes pretty bitter over the loss of that money isnt he sam  you cant blame him for that id be bitter too  it looks to me as if he might make minnie break with songbird if that money wasnt recovered  possibly spud although he ought to know as well as we do that it was not songbirds fault  im glad to see minnie sticks up for our chum arent you  oh minnies all right and always has been she thinks just as much of songbird as he does of her once in a while she pokes a little fun at his socalled poetry but songbird doesnt mind so it doesnt matter  when the boys returned to the farmhouse minnie ran out to meet them and from their manner saw at once that they had no news worth mentioning they could see that the girl had been crying and now it was all she could do to keep from bursting into tears again  oh minnie you ought not to take it so hard said sam kindly of course to lose four thousand dollars is a terrible blow but maybe theyll get the money back some way or at least a part of it  it isnt the money sam cried the girl with something like a catch in her voice its the way papa acts he seems to think it was all johns fault oh i cant bear it i know i cant she suddenly sobbed and then ran away and up the stairs to her bedroom closing the door behind her     chapter vii  sam and grace   this whole affair is certainly a tough proposition remarked sam when about half an hour later he and spud were on their way back to brill  the time had been spent in telling mr sanderson how they had failed to obtain any satisfaction over the telephone and in listening to the farmers tirade against poor songbird  old sanderson certainly pitched into songbird returned spud i declare if anybody called me down that way i think id be apt to get into a regular fight with him  he is very much excited spud i think when he cools down he will see matters in a different light just at present the loss of the four thousand dollars has completely upset him  i suppose he pitched into minnie even more than he pitched into us  maybe he did i must say i am mighty sorry for that poor girl  what are you going to tell songbird  i suppose well have to tell him the truth spud although well have to smooth over mr sandersons manner as much as we can theres no use in hurting songbirds feelings especially now when hes broken up physically as well as mentally  when they reached the college they found that songbird had insisted upon it that he be taken to the room he occupied with sam instead of to the sick ward he was in bed but wide awake and anxious to hear all they might have to say  of course i knew mr sanderson would blame me he said after asking a great number of questions four thousand dollars is a heap of money he knitted his brows for a moment and then cast an anxious glance at sam how did minnie really seem to take it he continued  she sided with you songbird when her father talked against you answered sam  she did did she good for her and songbirds face lit up for an instant shes true blue that girl is  now the best thing i think you can do is to try to go to sleep and get a good nights rest went on sam this worrying about what cant be helped wont do you any good  yes but sam what am i going to do if that money isnt gotten back the sandersons cant afford to lose it and even if i went to work right away it would take me a long long time to earn four thousand dollars  i have been thinking that over songbird and as the money was to be used in paying off a mortgage i think i can arrange the matter providing the holder of the present mortgage wont extend the time for it i think i can get my father or my uncle to take the mortgage  very good sam so far as it goes but that wouldnt be getting the money back if it isnt recovered ill feel that i am under a moral obligation to earn it somehow and give it to mr sanderson  well talk about it later now youve got to go to sleep were sams concluding words and after that he refused to say any more he undressed and threw himself on his bed and was soon asleep but poor songbird turned and twisted and it is doubtful if his eyes closed until well along in the early morning hours  on the following day sam had several classes to attend as well as to work on a theme but as soon as these tasks were over he obtained permission to leave the college to find out if possible if anything had been done in the matter of the robbery he visited ashton and had an interview with the police and then used the telephone in several directions but it was all of no avail nothing whatever had been seen or heard of the rascal who had made the attack upon songbird  im afraid it will be one of those mysteries which will never be explained mused the youngest rover boy as he jumped into the cutter which he was using and drove away from ashton its too bad oh how id like to get my hands on that rascal whoever he may be  it was not until two days later when songbird was once more able to be about and had insisted on being driven over to the sanderson place that sam had a chance to go on the sleighride with grace laning he drove over to hope seminary about four oclock in the afternoon having sent word ahead that he was coming grace was waiting for him and the pair speedily drove away wistfully watched by a number of the girl students  its so nice of you to think of me sam when youve got so much to think about on poor songbirds account said grace as they were speeding out of the seminary grounds how is he  oh hes doing better than we expected grace he insisted on being driven over to the sandersons this afternoon stanley took him over because none of us thought songbird was strong enough to drive himself  i want you to give me all the particulars of the attack said the girl and this the youth did readily  it must have been the man who stuttered and whistledthe fellow songbird saw at the knoxbury bank declared the girl positively wouldnt it pay to get a detective on his track  perhaps so grace i think songbird is going to mention that to mr sanderson  sam did not want the girl to worry too much over what had occurred and so soon changed the subject they talked about college and seminary matters and then about affairs at home and about matters in new york city  i just got another letter from nellie today said grace she says that the apartment she and tom have rented is perfectly lovelyevery bit as nice as the one occupied by dick and dora  im glad they like it grace but believe me it will be some job for tom to settle down and be a staid married man he was always so full of fun  why the idea sam rover dont you think a man can be married and still keep full of fun  well maybe if he got such a nice girl as nellie just the same ill wager tom sometimes wishes he was back in good old brill  indeed and do you think youll wish you were back at brill if ever you get married she asked slyly  oh i didnt say anything about that grace ii  well its just about the same thing and grace tossed her pretty face a trifle  oh now look here grace you havent any call to talk that way i suppose when i get married ill be just as happy as dick or tom that is providing i get the right girl and he gazed at the face beside him very ardently  sam rover you had better watch where you are driving unless you want to run us into the rocks and bushes cried the girl suddenly for forgetting the steed for a moment sam had allowed the horse to turn to one side of the somewhat rough highway  ill attend to the horse never fear he answered i never yet saw the horse that i couldnt manage but speaking of letters grace i had one from dick day before yesterday and he made a suggestion that pleased me very much  what was that  he suggested that if i graduate from brill this coming june as i expect to do that we make up a party to occupy two or three automobiles and go off on a regular tour this summer taking in the middle west and maybe some other points  oh sam how grand of course he was going to take dora along  yes his idea was that if matters could be arranged at the offices in new york that he and dora as well as tom and nellie would go along and that we would go too along with some otherssay enough to make at least two automobile loads  oh id love an auto tour like that couldnt we have just the best times ever and graces pretty eyes sparkled in anticipation  when i got the letter i thought the same and i also thought we might ask songbird and minniedora and nellie could chaperon her you know but now i dont know what well do about them most likely songbird wouldnt feel like going if that money wasnt recovered and more than likely mr sanderson wouldnt let minnie go  oh dear i suppose the loss of that money will hang over songbird like a big cloud forever pouted the girl its too bad i dont see why mr sanderson couldnt have paid that mortgage with a check  just exactly what we all say now grace but that doesnt do any good  are you sure you are going to graduate sam  i certainly hope so i am going to try my best not only to graduate grace but to get as close to the top of the class as possible dick and tom had to leave before they had a chance to graduate so i want to make a good showing for the rover family  its the same with me sam nellie left to get married and so did cousin dora so ive got to do the best i can for our family next june  then you hope to get through too  of course  how are the teachers treating you these days have you had any more trouble with miss harrow or the others  not the least bit they are all perfectly lovely and miss harrow is so sorry that she ever thought nellie had taken that diamond ring  well she ought to feel sorry responded sam it certainly put nellie to a lot of trouble did that gardener who put the diamond ring in the inkwell ever come back to work at the seminary  andy royce yes he is working there i have seen him several times he is quite a changed man and i dont think he drinks at all  well thats one good job done grace that mans worst enemy was liquor  sam had arranged that they might remain out until nine oclock that evening and so drove grace over to knoxbury where they went to quite a fashionable restaurant for dinner here they met several young men and girls they knew and all had a most delightful time during the repast  when sam went outside to get his horse and cutter which had been placed in a livery stable near by he was surprised to encounter the very man he had mentioned but a short while before andy royce the gardener who had once been discharged from hope seminary for not attending properly to his duties and who through the intercession of the rovers and the lanings had been reinstated in his position  good evening mr rover said andy royce respectfully as he touched the cap he wore  hello royce what are you doing here asked the youth  oh i just drove over to knoxbury to get some things for the seminary replied royce and then stepping closer he added in a lower tone i saw you going into meekers restaurant a while ago and i stayed here to see you when you came out id like to talk to you a bit  all right what have you to say returned sam briskly i havent got much time to waste  i wanted to ask you about the young fellow who was knocked down and robbed the other afternoon went on andy royce as the two walked away out of the hearing of the others in the livery stable somebody told me that the fellow who was robbed said a man did it who stuttered and whistled  well we rather think that man did it but we are not certain answered sam he glanced sharply at the gardener do you know anything of that fellow  i think i do mr rover you see its this way several years ago i used to live out west in denver and colorado springs and i used to know a man out there who went by the name of blackie crowden he used to stutter fearfully and had a funny little whistle with it  out in denver you say thats a long way from here  i know it is sir but after i left i heard that this blackie crowden had come to center haven and thats only twenty miles from here and that aint all continued andy royce earnestly i was in this town about a week ago and i am almost certain i saw this same blackie crowden on the street i tried to reach him so as to speak to him but he got away from me in a crowd that had come up to see a runaway  this is interesting returned sam tell me how this blackie crowden looks he went on and then as andy royce described the individual he added slowly that seems to tally with the description songbird gave of the fellow who looked at him through the bank window when he was placing the money away more than likely that fellow was that same blackie crowden  well if it was blackie crowden why dont you have him locked up queried the gardener  perhaps i will providing he is still in center haven answered sam     chapter viii  something about blackie crowden   when sam returned to brill late that evening after having spent a most delightful time with grace he found that songbird had returned from the sandersons homestead some time before the wouldbe poet of the college was working hard over some of his lessons and it was plainly to be seen that he was in anything but a good humor  sanderson treated me like a doglike a regular dog he burst out in reply to sams question why to hear him talk you would almost think i was in league with the fellow who attacked me  its too bad songbird but you shouldnt take it so much to heart remember mr sanderson is a very hardworking man and one who has probably never allowed another fellow to get the best of him in any kind of a deal the amount that was lost represents probably the savings of a good many years and to lose it so suddenly and in such an underhanded way has completely upset him when he has had time to think it over calmly hell probably see that you were not to blame  i dont think sohes not that kind of man sam he was very bitter and he told minnie that she wasnt to see me any more minnie was dreadfully upset of course and she rushed off to her room so i didnt have any chance to say goodbye to her  as bad as that eh well you can write her a letter anyway  so i can but maybe her father will see to it that she never gets it responded the smitten youth gloomily  ive got a little news that may prove encouraging pursued sam after a slight pause and then he related the particulars of his meeting with andy royce and what the hope gardener had said regarding blackie crowden  say thats great burst out the wouldbe poet if i could see this crowden id know at once if he was the man who watched me when i was at the knoxbury bank and if it was it would certainly pay to put the authorities on his trail  i was thinking the same songbird i wonder if we couldnt get permission from dr wallington to drive over to center haven tomorrow and find out what we can about this blackie crowden  oh hell have to give us permissionat least hell have to let me go returned songbird i cant settle down to any lessons until something is done one way or another here i am trying to study and i hardly know a word of what im reading  let us go to the doctor at once if he is still up and ask him said sam  permission to leave the college was readily granted by dr wallington who however cautioned songbird about overexerting himself while he was still suffering from the attack that had been made upon him  ill depend upon you rover to look after him said the head of brill kindly and let me add i wish you every success in your search for the offender i certainly would like to see you get mr sandersons money back  the two young collegians had breakfast as early as possible and by eight oclock were on their way to center haven in the automobile belonging to the rovers and which had now been left in sams care heavy chains had been put on the wheels so that the automobile made its way over the snowy roads without much trouble of course in some spots where the frozen highway was uneven the boys got some pretty hard bumps but this they did not mind their one thought being to get to center haven as soon as possible and learn all they could concerning blackie crowden and his doings  center haven was a town about the size of knoxbury and among other things boasted of a large hotel which was generally well patronized during the summer months andy royce had said that crowden had been seen at this hotel and probably had some sort of position there when the boys arrived there they found that the main building of the hotel was completely closed the only portion that was open was a small wing with an equally small dining room used for the accommodations of the few transients who came to center haven during the winter months  we came here to find a man named blackie crowden said sam to the proprietor of the hotel who came forward to meet them when they entered can you tell me anything about him  you wont find him here returned the hotel man brusquely i discharged him two weeks ago  discharged him queried songbird and his tone showed his disappointment any trouble with him  oh yes lots of trouble are you friends of his  we certainly are not answered sam but wed like to find out something about him  im glad you are not friends of his continued the hotelkeeper i feel very sore over that man i took him in and gave him a good job and paid him a good deal more than he was worth but he wouldnt workin fact he was the laziest man i ever sawand so i had to discharge him i paid him all that was coming to him and when he got out he was mean enough to sneak off with some of my clothing and also a pair of my gloves and my rubbers if i could lay my hands on him id be strongly tempted to hand him over to the police  did he take an overcoat of yours and a fur cap demanded songbird quickly  he certainly did a heavy darkgray overcoat and one of these fur caps that you can pull down over your ears and over the back of the head  he must have been the same fellow remarked sam and the fact that he robbed this man here goes to prove what sort of rascal he really is  did he steal anything from you people asked the hotelkeeper curiously  i think he did answered songbird did you hear anything of the attack that took place a few days ago on the road near ashton in which a young fellow was robbed of four thousand dollars in cash  oh yes i heard about that from the police captain here  well i am the fellow who was robbed continued songbird and im strongly inclined to think now that it was this blackie crowden who was guiltyin fact i am almost certain of it when i was at the knoxbury bank getting the money and putting it away in my pocket i saw a man watching through a window of the bank he had on a darkgray overcoat and a fur cap pulled far down over his face then later on just after i was attacked my friend here with a chum of ours came driving along and saw this same man with the heavy overcoat and the fur cap drive off with the horse and cutter that i had hadand he was the same fellow who had knocked me senseless  is that so well i think youve hit the nail on the head and if you catch this blackie crowden youll have the right fellow anybody who would run off with my things as he did after he had been treated as well as i treated him wouldnt be above committing such a crime but the question is where did he go have you any idea  we know he got on the train at dentonville said sam thats as far as weve been able to trace him so far but now that we know that this criminal is blackie crowden maybe the authorities will be able to run him down sooner or later  this crowden was very friendly with one or two of the men around the stables went on the hotelkeeper maybe you can find out something about him from them  a good idea answered songbird well see what they have to say  the hotel man took the two youths to the stables and there they talked with several men present who had known crowden from these they learned that the man had been very much dissatisfied with the work assigned to him and had frequently spoken about the good times to be had in such large cities as new york chicago and denver  he said he thought he would go back to new york first said one of the stable men and then he thought he would go on to chicago and after that visit some of his old places and cronies in denver but of course where he really did go to i havent the least idea  what you say is something of a clue anyway returned sam now if we only had a photograph of this crowden it might help the police a great deal  weve got a picture of him said one of the men present it was taken by one of the visitors at the hotel this fall he came out here to take a picture of some of the horses and we helped him so all of us got into the picture crowden with the rest ill get it he added and disappeared in the direction of his sleeping quarters  the photograph was a fairly large one showing three men and as many horses the man in the center was blackie crowden and the stable man and the hotelkeeper declared that it was an excellent photograph of that individual  will you let us have this photograph asked songbird i would like to have that picture of crowden enlarged and then you can have it back  sure you can have it answered the stable man as that fellow is a thief you might as well tear that picture up afterward because i dont want to be in no photograph with a criminal and he grinned sheepishly  all right then i wont take the trouble to return it answered songbird suppose you accept this dollar for it and he passed over a banknote which the stable man took with thanks a little later the two youths started on the return to ashton  well thats one step nearer the solution of this mystery announced sam now i think we had better stop at knoxbury and find out about that horse which belonged to hoover the livery stable man  they reached the banking town about noon and went directly to the livery stable as they did so a man in a cutter drove in leading a horse behind him  there is the horse now cried sam he must have just gotten the animal back from mr bray  are you mr hoover questioned songbird of the man in the cutter as he came to a halt near them  thats my handle young man what can i do for you  i would like to know something about that horse and who hired him from you and then he introduced himself and sam  i dont know who got the animal answered mr hoover i was away at the time and a stable boy let him out he declares the fellow said he was a friend of mine and that it would be all right  and was the fellow dressed in a heavy gray overcoat and a heavy fur cap asked sam  yes that was the description the stable boy gave when he found i didnt know anything about the man he was scared to death because i told him that if the horse didnt come back id make him pay for the animal  then thats all we want to know mr hoover answered songbird im pretty sure now i know who it was that knocked me down and robbed me  he was a rascal all right answered the livery stable man i had to pay old bray four dollars to get my own horse back he added sulkily  as the long ride in the open air had made them hungry the two youths went to the restaurant in knoxbury for dinner then the automobile was turned once more in the direction of ashton  ill have that photograph enlarged by clinger said songbird referring to a photographer in the town who did a great deal of work for the brill and hope students then ill have copies sent to the various police stations even to new york chicago and denver along with a description of blackie crowden  thats the talk songbird oh i am sure well get on his trail sooner or later said sam but though he spoke lightheartedly for his chums benefit he knew that to trace the criminal would be by no means easy with the four thousand dollars in his possession blackie crowden would probably make every effort to keep from being discovered  as they sped along the road songbird could not help becoming poetical and despite his blueness he managed to concoct the following doggerel      the engine humsadvance the spark     turn on the throttlewhat a lark     away we go like a flash of light     over the hill and out of sight  not so bad songbird was sams comment thats rightkeep it up and maybe youll feel better but that was the only verse to be gotten out of the wouldbe poet for the present  arriving at ashton they went immediately to the photographers shop and told him what was wanted and he agreed to rephotograph the picture of crowden and then enlarge the same and make as many copies as songbird desired  ill do it this afternoon said mr clinger and you can have a dozen or more copies by tomorrow morning ill make the head of the fellow about as large as a half dollar and that ought to make a picture for any policeman or detective to go by and so it was arranged  while the youths were at the photographers an express train had come into ashton and now quite a few people were coming away from the railroad station as the boys walked towards the automobile songbird suddenly uttered a cry  look sam look whos here  why its tom my brother tom exclaimed sam as he rushed forward what in the world brought him here today     chapter ix  in which tom arrives   tom rover tall and broadshouldered looked the picture of health as he came toward his younger brother and songbird he smiled broadly as he shook hands with them  why tom what brings you here remarked sam you didnt write about coming on  oh i thought id just drop in and surprise you returned tom you know i cant quite get used to being away from brill he continued with a grin  want to get back to your studies i suppose was his brothers dry comment well come ahead you can help me on a theme i am writing on civilization in ancient central america  wow that sounds as interesting as a greek dictionary cried tom thank goodness i dont have to worry my head about themes any more but just the same sam dont make any mistake i am as busy these days as i ever was in my life trying to help dick and dad to put our new organization on its feet  and how is that getting along  fine we incorporated this week and have our papers and now i am the secretary of the rover company and tom strutted around with his thumbs under his arms some class to me eh  and what is dick questioned songbird curiously  oh dick is treasurer answered tom dad of course is president but he expects to hold that position only until sam comes in then dick is to become president myself treasurer and sam secretary  say thats all right responded the youngest rover his face showing his satisfaction  that is provided you want to come in sam dad doesnt want you to give up your idea of becoming a lawyer unless you want to  oh i might become a lawyer and remain secretary of the company too was the answer one thing is sure if you and dick are going to remain in that company youll have to take me in  well whats the news went on tom had any fun lately how is grace and he looked rather sharply at his brother  oh grace is all right answered sam he hesitated a moment i suppose you didnt get the letter i sent to you and dick yesterdaythe letter about songbird here  why no i left the office night before last  songbird is in trouble tom returned the brother are you going up to the college if you are you can go with us in the automobile and well tell you all about it on the way  yes ill go up and i might as well take my grip with me for maybe ill stay over until tomorrow if they have room for me and thus speaking tom turned back to the railroad station to get his dresssuit case the three youths were soon on their way to brill and as sam manipulated the car he and songbird gave the new arrival the details concerning the attack tom of course listened with deep interest  thats a rank shame songbird he cried at the conclusion of the narrative i know just how you feel if i could get my hands on that blackie crowden i think id put him in the hospital first and in prison afterward  i told songbird not to worry as far as the money was concerned went on sam if that old fellow who holds the mortgage wont wait for his money i told songbird that i thought we could get our folks to advance the cash  sure thing responded tom promptly you give me the details and ill see about the money when i go back  mr sanderson said he would know about it early next week answered songbird he expects a visit from old grisley and belright fogg  my gracious you didnt tell me anything about fogg being connected with this burst out sam  i forgot all about it answered songbird it seems that as soon as old grisley heard the money was stolen and that it wasnt likely the mortgage would be paid he hired belright fogg to take the matter up for him he is an old man and very excitable and he somehow got the notion that mr sanderson would try to swindle him in some way so he got belright fogg in the case though as a general thing he has no more use for lawyers than he has for banks  well hes very foolish to put his case in the hands of such a fellow as belright fogg tom i guess youll remember the trouble we had with that fellow  i sure do sam  and sam had more trouble with him cried songbird dont forget how you hit him in the head with a snowball  thats right in the excitement of the attack on you songbird i forgot all about that answered the youngest rover i suppose he is laying back to bring that up against me  they soon reached the grounds surrounding brill and tom looked at the college buildings with interest  looks almost like home to me he said somewhat wistfully my but i had some good times here i wish i had been on deck for that snowballing contest  sam was the hero of that occasion according to all accounts answered songbird he captured the banners of the freshies and sophs you know  as the automobile rolled into the grounds a number of students recognized tom and waved friendly greetings to him leaping out he was soon surrounded by a number of his old chums all of whom wanted to know where he had been keeping himself and how long he was going to stay with them  cant stay longer than tomorrow noon he announced you know im a business man now and he puffed up and grinned in a manner that made all of the others smile  you just came in time tom cried spud your old friend william philander tubbs who has been away on business to boston got back here this morning  what my old friend tubby here ill be glad to shake his flipper announced tom and grinned more than ever as he recalled the practical jokes that had been played at different times on the dudish student who had been mentioned  of course the students present wanted to know what had been learned by sam and songbird on the trip to center haven and many were the speculations regarding blackie crowden  the authorities ought to be able to catch that fellow now that you have his photograph and a good description of him remarked stanley it would be a good idea to send that description and photograph broadcast  the boys reported to dr wallington and tom went with them the head of brill was glad to see his former student and readily consented to allow tom to remain with the others that night an extra cot being put into room no 25 for that purpose  are those the banners you captured sam questioned tom when the boys entered the room and as he spoke he pointed to two banners which were nailed up on the wall  yes tom those are the ones we captured was the reply of the youngest rover with considerable pride the freshies and sophs wanted them back the worst way but i told them there was nothing doing that i intended to keep them at least until i graduated they sent a committee to me to get the banners and i can tell you that committee was pretty sore when they went away without getting them  you watch out that they dont take those banners on the sly sam  oh songbird and i are looking out for them didnt you notice we had the door locked we always lock up now and no one has a key but the janitor and we have cautioned him not to let any one in here without our permission  ill tell you what id like to do tonight said tom id like to smuggle something to eat into this room and give some of our crowd a spread just for the fun of it  all right im willing tom answered his brother of course youll have to keep rather quiet about it because i dont want to get into the bad graces of any of the monitors or of dr wallington i want to graduate next june with the highest possible honors  it was arranged that while songbird and sam studied some necessary lessons tom was to return to ashton in the automobile and bring back a number of things which would be needed for the proposed spread tom took spud and stanley with him out on the campus the three came face to face with william philander tubbs  hello tubblets old boy cried tom cordially as he caught william philander by the hand how are you making it these days  ierer how do you do rover stammered the dudish student why i ameram quite well thank you i thought you had left college  oh i couldnt leave it for good you know tubby my dear they wouldnt be able to get along without me  whyahwhyahsomebody told me you were going into business in new york  thats right tubbette  oh rover please dont call me by those horrid nicknames any longer pleaded william philander you promised me long ago you wouldnt do it  only a slip of my memory my dear philander williams i really  no no not philander williams my name is william philander  thats right so it is its always been philander williamno i mean willander philiamsno that isnt it either my gracious tubblets old boy what have you done with the front handles of your cognomen anyway you twist me all sideways trying to remember it  really how odd my name is william philander tubbs thats easy enough  if i had it engraved in script type on a visiting card and looked at it daily maybe i would be able to remember it answered tom mournfully you know my head was never very good for history or anything like that however now that i know that your name is philander tubblets williams dont you think youd like to ride down to ashton with us we are going to have a little spread tonight and i want you to help me pick out the spaghetti sauerkraut sweet potato pie limburger cheese and other delicacies  oh by jove do you really mean you are going to have those things for a spread gasped william philander  that is if they are just the things you like returned tom innocently of course stanley here suggested that we have some fried eel sandwiches and some worm pudding but i dont know about such rich living as that  eel sandwiches worm pudding groaned william philander aghast i never heard of such things why dont you geterersome cream puffs and chocolate éclares and eranderand mint kisses and things like that you know  not solid enough my dear willie boy the boys love substantials you know that as well as i do of course we might add a few little delicacies like turnips and onions just for side dishes you know  iireally think you had better excuse me rover exclaimed william philander backing away i am not feeling extra good and i dont think i want to go to any spread tonight and william philander bowed and backed still farther  oh all right philly willy responded tom dolefully of course if you dont want to participate you dont have to but youll break our hearts if you stay away now you just come to room twentyfive tonight and well give you the finest red herring and mush ice cream you ever chewed in your life and then he and his chums hurried away in the automobile leaving william philander tubbs gazing after him in deep perplexity     chapter x  the feast   when tom came back accompanied by stanley and spud all had their arms full of the things purchased in ashton  and this is only the half of it announced the funloving rover to his brother in answer to a query weve got to go back and get the rest out of the automobile  well bring that stuff up said stanley you stay here with your brother come on songbird i see you are doing nothing so you might as well give us a lift and off the three boys trooped to bring up the rest of the things purchased for the feast  im mighty glad you are going to give this tom on songbirds account announced sam when he and his brother were left to themselves songbird is about as blue as indigo you see it isnt only the moneyits minnie her father wont let him call on her any more  tough luck sure enough responded tom well let us do all we can tonight to make songbird forget his troubles tom took a walk up and down the room halting in front of a picture of grace which was in a silver frame on a chiffonier pretty good picture sam he observed  yes it is  did you say that you had been out with grace lately  oh yes we had a fine sleighride only the other day  shes made quite a friend of a miss ada waltham at the seminary a rich girl hasnt she  she has mentioned miss waltham to me i didnt know that they were particularly friendly answered sam you know this miss waltham is very rich  so i heard sam she is worth about a quarter of a million dollars so somebody said but she has a brother chester who is worth even more an uncle died and left nearly his entire estate to the brother  is that so lucky young fellow but i dont see how that interests me tom and sam looked at his brother inquiringly you act as if you had something on your mind  so i have sam and that is one of the reasons i came here today announced tom ill tell you about it in the morning he added hastily as a tramping was heard in the hallway and the next moment the door burst open and in came stanley songbird spud and one or two others all loaded down with bundles and packages  make way for the parcels post and the express company proclaimed spud as he dropped several packages on one of the cots say tom you must have bought out half of ashton  only threeeighths spud answered the funloving rover gaily you see i knew what an awful appetite you had and as i had an extra twentyfive cent piece in my jeans i thought id try to satisfy that appetite just once  twentyfive cents wow commented stanley ill wager this spread costs you a good many dollars  word had been passed around to a number of toms old friends and they were all requested to be on hand by ten oclock  tubbs says he begs to be excused announced paul orben when he came in he says he has got some studying he must do  nonsense hes afraid well treat him to some sauerkraut pie and some pickled pastry returned tom i dont want him to stay away and miss a good time what room is he in  number eighteen  then come along some of you and well bring him here announced the funloving rover and marched off followed by spud and bob in the meanwhile sam songbird and stanley brought the things from the closet and began to prepare for the feast  tom and his friends found william philander busy folding and putting away half a dozen gorgeous neckties he was rather startled at their sudden entrance and did his best to hide the articles  hello i thought you were boning away on trigonometry or mental science was toms comment say old boy thats a gorgeous necktie he added as he picked up a creation in lavender and yellow did you buy this to wear at the horse show or at a meeting of mothers helpers  oh my dear rover please dont muss that up pleaded william philander snatching the necktie from toms hands that is one that wasermadeeraa present to me  oh i see thats the one that blind young lady gave to you i admire her taste in picking it out  blind lady ierhave no blind lady friend returned william philander  oh yes i remember now tubby she was deafnot blind its a wonder she didnt pick out something a little louder  oh rover i really believe you are poking fun at that necktie returned the dudish student  we came to get you to come to the feast willie announced spud we dont want you to miss it  we wouldnt have you miss it for a peck of shelled popcorn put in bob  yes but really ive got some studying to do and  you can study after the feast is over my dear boy broke in tom as he caught william philander by the arm youll be surprised how much quicker you can learn on a full stomach than on one that is half vacant come on  yes but i  we havent any time to spare tubblets you are going to the feast so you might as well make the best of it come on fellows help him along hes so bashful he cant walk and thus urged spud took william philanders other arm while bob caught him by the collar and in the back and thus the three of them forced the dudish collegian out of his room and along the hallway to number 25  by this time something like fifteen students had gathered in the room and the advent of tom and his chums with the somewhat frightened william philander was greeted with a roar of approval the dudish student was marched in and made to take a seat on a board which had been placed on two chairs on the board sat several students and william philander was placed on one end  now then everybody make himself at home announced tom as soon as a look around had convinced him that his brother and the others had everything in readiness for the feast i believe youll find everything here except toothpicks and for those well have to chop up one of sams baseball bats later on  not much youre not going to touch any of my bats announced the younger brother firmly  sam wants to keep them to help bat another victory for brill this spring put in spud my but that was one great game we had last season  so it was put in another student and dont forget that tom helped to win that game as well as sam  while this chatter was going on various good things in the way of salads and sandwiches had been passed around and these were followed by cake and glasses of root beer ginger ale and grape juice  why this is perfectly lovely lisped william philander tubbs as he sat on the end of the boardseat his lap covered with a paper napkin on which rested a large plate of chicken salad and some sandwiches in one hand he held an extra large glass of grape juice  everybody ready announced stanley with a wink at several of the boys here is where we drink to the health of tom rover  tom rover was the exclamation and at a certain sign all the boys seated on the board except william philander leaped to their feet  the result was as might have been expected the dudish pupil had been resting on the end of the board which overlapped the chair and with the weight of the others removed the board suddenly tipped upward and down went william philander in a heap the chicken salad jouncing forward over his shirt front and the glass of grape juice in his hand being dashed full into his face  illustration the board suddenly tipped and down went william philander  hi hi whaterdideryou do that for he spluttered as he sat on the floor completely dazed say why didnt you tell me you were going to get up and then he started to wipe the grape juice from his eyes and nose  hello salads going down cried one student gaily  say tubbs there is no use of throwing such nice food as that away even if you dont want it chimed in another  dont you know enough to stand up when a toast is to be drunk queried a third  iididnt quite understand stammered william philander and then with an effort he extracted himself from the mess on his lap and slowly arose to his feet my gracious i believe i have utterly ruined this vest and trousers he added mournfully as he gazed down at the light gray suit he wore  oh a little gasoline will fix that up all right said spud dont let a little thing like that interfere with your pleasure tubbs come onheres another glass of grape juice no use of crying over spilt milki mean juice corrected the youth  tom rover everybody up came the call and then amid a subdued murmuring of good luck the boys stood around tom and drank his health  thank you fellows very much answered tom and there was just a suspicion of huskiness in his voice  speech speech give us a speech came from several  speech great guns i never made a speech in my life announced tom and now for the first time he looked a bit confused  oh youve got to say something tom cried stanley  what shall i talk aboutearthquakes in india or the spots on tubbs pants queried tom with a grin  never mind what you talk about so long as you say something came from bob  all right thenhere goes announced tom after a little pause catch this before its too late im glad to be here otherwise i wouldnt be here im glad you are here otherwise you wouldnt be here i think brill college is the best college any fellow could ever go to if that hadnt been so id never have gone to brill im sorry i couldnt stay here to graduate but ive left the honor to sam here and i trust hell get through and make a record for the whole family boys i thank you from the bottom of my heart and heres wishing you all success at graduation and success through life and thus concluding his little speech tom took a generous drink of ginger ale while the others applauded vigorously  very good cried sam but then added quickly for gracious sake dont make too much noise or youll have one of the monitors here and well get some black marks  thats right fellows announced stanley after this well have to be as noisy as a mouse in a cheese factory  now that i have been called on to make a speech announced tom after quietness had been restored i am going to call on songbird for one of his choice bits of poetry  oh now tom please dont do that pleaded the wouldbe poet of brill you know im in no humor for writing poetry now  all the more reason why you should write some announced sam come on now you must have something tucked away in your systemi mean something brand new  wellerive got something new but i hardly think it is appropriate for this occasion answered songbird slowly  never mind give it to us no matter what it is cried one of the students  let her flutter  poetry for mine  let her flow songbird  thats right turn on the poetry spigot songbird and thus urged the wouldbe poet of brill began      the world is black and i feel blue     i do not know what im to do     that fellow hit me in the head     and left me in the road for dead     i go around from hour to hour     and i am feeling mighty sour     i am consumed with helpless woe      because i lost that heardearned dough  completed tom rather suddenly and this abrupt ending caused a general laugh     chapter xi  tom frees his mind   the party in number 25 did not break up until some time after midnight and all present declared that they had had the time of their lives only one interruption had come made by a goodnatured monitor who had begged them to make less noise and this fellow well known to tom had been bought off with several sandwiches and a bottle of ginger ale  and how do you fellows feel this morning asked tom who was the first to get up after a sound sleep  oh im first rate announced his younger brother i thought id dream with so much chicken salad and sandwiches and cake in me but i slept like a log  i didnt sleep extra well came slowly from songbird but i dont think it was the feast kept me awake  tom walked over to where the wouldbe poet of brill sat on the edge of a cot and dropped down beside him  songbird you take the loss of that money too much to heart he said kindly of course we all know it was a great loss yet it wont do to grieve over it too much and besides there is hope that some day the authorities will catch that blackie crowden and get at least part of the money back  it isnt the money alone tom it is the way mr sanderson has treated me and besides that im worried over that mortgage id like to know just what old grisley and his lawyer are going to do  ill tell you what ill do songbird if you wish me to ill call on mr sanderson and tell him what we are willing to do so that he can rest easy about paying the mortgage off if he has to  i wish you would go tomand put in a good word for me too cried songbird eagerly  oh ill do that never fear ill go this morning before i start back to new york and thus it was arranged  you said that you had something to tell me tom remarked sam as the three were going downstairs to breakfast what was it  oh it may not amount to much sam ill tell you about it as soon as we can get by ourselves answered tom  the morning meal was quickly disposed of and then tom and sam returned to number 25 the former to repack his dresssuit case before leaving for the sandersons place and for new york  i dont exactly know how to get at this sam began his brother slowly when the pair were in the bedroom and the door had been closed it is about grace and the walthams  about grace and sam showed his increased interest what about her  well as i mentioned last night this ada waltham is very rich and she has a brother chester who is older than she is and much richer in fact ive heard it said that he is a young millionaire  well queried sam as his brother paused  oh i really dont know how to get at this sam burst out tom and his face showed his worry maybe there is nothing in it at all but just the same i thought i had better bring it to you at once i knew you would rather have it come from me than from some outsider  but what in the world are you talking about tom  im talking about the attentions this chester waltham is bestowing upon grace it seems that his sister ada introduced him to grace a couple of months ago and since that time ive heard that he has been up to hope several times ostensibly to call on his sister but really to see grace i understand he has taken both of them out riding several times  taken grace out riding cried sam and his face flushed suddenly are you sure of this grace never mentioned it to me  i think its the truth sam you see ever since nellie left hope she has kept corresponding with several of the girls there and one of these girls knows ada waltham quite well and she mentioned the fact of the sister and grace going out with chester she said that she quite envied grace being invited to ride out with a young millionaire then nellie spoke to dora about it and dora said she had heard practically the same thing from another one of the seminary students now i dont like to butt in sam but at the same time i thought you ought to know just how things were going  i dont understand it at all returned the younger brother and for the moment he looked rather helpless if grace received an invitation to go out with this chester waltham i am quite sure she would mention it to me  perhaps she merely went as a companion of adas suggested tom and she might have thought it wasnt necessary to mention it  have you heard anything more than that tom  not much except that in one of the letters this girl said that she would envy grace all the nice flowers and boxes of candy she might expect from such a wealthy young man as waltham now as i said before sam its none of my business but i just couldnt help coming out here to put a flea in your ear wenellie and iknow just how you feel about grace and both of us would like nothing better than to have you double up with her after you graduate  thank you tom its fine for you to talk that way and its fine to have nellie on my side but i dont understand this at all if grace has been going out with this chester waltham why hasnt she said something to me about it she has spoken to me about ada a number of times but i never heard this chester mentioned once  well i cant tell you any more than i have told you returned tom if i were you id see grace and find out just what this fellow has been doing you know a fellow who is worth a million dollars is some catch for any girl  yes i know its a good deal more than ill be able to offer grace  true but money isnt everything in this life sam i didnt look for money when i married nellie and i dont think she cared a rap how much i was worth  thats the way it ought to be done  i always supposed that you and grace had some sort of an understanding between you went on tom after rather an awkward pause of course sam you havent got to say a word about it if you dont want to he added hastily  we did have some sort of an understanding tom but you know how it was with you and nelliemrs laning wouldnt think of your becoming publicly engaged until after you had left college she has told grace that she will have to wait so she is free to do as she chooses  there was but little more that could be said on the subject and so tom turned to pack his suit case while sam got ready to attend one of his classes the youngest rover heaved a heavy sigh which showed that he was more disturbed than he cared to admit  a little while later tom had said goodbye to his brother and to his numerous friends at brill and was on his way in a hired turnout to the sanderson homestead which he had promised to visit before leaving on the train at ashton for new york city tom went on his errand alone none of the others being able to get away from the college that morning  the sandersons had heard nothing about his arrival at brill and consequently were much surprised when he drove up minnie greeted him with a warm smile and even mr sanderson considering his great loss was quite cordial  aint comin back to complete your eddication are you mr rover questioned the farmer with a slight show of humor  no mr sanderson im through with brill so far as studying goes answered the youth i just took a runout to see how sam and the others were getting along they told me all about your loss and im mighty sorry that the thing happened poor songbird is all broke up over it  humph i reckon he aint half as much broke up as i am retorted the farmer this has placed me in a fine pickle  now pa please dont get excited again pleaded minnie whose face showed that she had suffered as much or more as had her parent  aint no use to get excited now the money is gone and i suppose that is the last of it what im worryin about is how im goin to settle about that mortgage grisley at first said he would put it off but yesterday he sent word that he was comin here today with his lawyer to settle things  and here they come now interrupted minnie as she glanced out of a window the others looked and saw two men drive up the lane in a cutter they were old henry grisley the man who held the mortgage on the farm and belright fogg the girl went to the door to let the visitors in old henry grisley paid scant attention to tom when the two were introduced to each other the lawyer looked at the visitor in some astonishment  huh i didnt expect to see you here mr rover said belright fogg coolly are you mixed up in this unfortunate affair  i may be before we get through answered tom  you werent the young man who lost the money  no  ive got an account to settle with your brother went on belright fogg rather maliciously he took great pleasure the other day in hitting me in the head with a snowball almost knocking me senseless ive had to have my head treated by a doctor and more than likely ill sue him for damages  i reckon youll do what you can to make it hot for him returned tom its your way mr fogg but just let me give you a word of adviceyou take care that you dont get your fingers burnt  ha is that a threat  oh no it is only a word of advice please to remember that we know all about you and we wont stand any nonsense from you if my brother really hurt you hell be willing to do the fair thing but if you think you can gouge him in any way youve got another guess coming  looky came in a shrill voice from old henry grisley i thought we come here fer my money on that er mortgage and from under a pair of heavy gray eyebrows he looked searchingly into the faces of mr sanderson and the lawyer  yes mr grisley thats what we came for returned belright fogg and the sooner we come to business perhaps the better  as ive told you before the money is gonestolen said mr sanderson i cant payat least not now and id like an extension of time  mr grisley isnt inclined to grant any extension said belright fogg somewhat pompously the mortgage is too big for this place anyway and he feels that he ought to have his money  and if mr sanderson cant pay what then questioned tom before the farmer could speak  why well have to foreclose and sell the place answered the lawyer quickly  thats it thats it came shrilly from old henry grisley i want my moneyevery cent of it if i dont git it im goin to take the farm he added in tones which were almost triumphant  but see here began mr sanderson  oh pa dont let them sell the farm burst out minnie and as she spoke the tears started to her eyes  you wont sell the farm mr grisley said tom coolly  why not if the money isnt paid cried the old man  the money will be paidevery cent of it answered tom     chapter xii  old grisley comes to terms   all in the room looked at tom in some surprise because of the plain way in which he had spoken  mr rover you are sure of what you are saying questioned mr sanderson quickly in a low voice  yes mr sanderson well take care of this mortgage dont you worry a bit about it  did you say you would pay off this mortgage demanded belright fogg glaring at tom  i didnt say id pay it off personally but my folks will take care of it  the money is due nowhas been due for several days  yes sir thats right came shrilly from henry grisley and i want you to know that i want the full amount with interest up to the day when it is paid i aint goin to lose nothinnot a cent  mr grisley i have an offer to make to you went on tom addressing himself directly to the old man and utterly ignoring belright fogg you dont know me but let me say that my father and my uncle are worth a good deal of money i am in business in new york with my father and our concern has a great deal of money to invest now if you will agree to hold this mortgage for thirty days i will guarantee to have it paid in full at that time with every cent of interest and in addition to that i will pay you twentyfive dollars for your trouble and for your lawyers fees  ha what do you think i am what do you think i work for demanded belright fogg with a scowl my fee will be more than twentyfive dollars in this case  what what shrilled henry grisley turning his beadlike eyes on the lawyer twentyfive dollars not much ill give ye ten dollars and not a cent more  thats the way to talk mr grisley you give him ten dollars and you keep the fifteen dollars for your own trouble cried tom so far as i can see he hasnt done anything for you excepting to come here to see mr sanderson and certainly such a trip as this isnt worth more than ten dollars  my services are worth a good deal more exclaimed belright fogg and thereupon ensued a war of words between him and henry grisley which lasted the best part of a quarter of an hour the lawyer saw the case slipping away from him and at last in deep disgust he said he would have no more to do with the affair  dont want ye to dont want ye to piped out henry grisley lawyers are a useless expense anyway ill settle this case myself and for what youve done i wont pay moren ten dollars jest remember it and he shook a long bony finger in belright foggs face  i wont be insulted in this manner cried the lawyer and then in a dudgeon he stormed from the house leaped into the cutter and drove away  a good riddance to him murmured mr sanderson but then he added hastily was that your horse grisley  no it wasnt was the answer and how im to git home now i dont know added the old man helplessly  where do you live questioned tom  the other side of ashton on the millbury road  all right then ill take you there when i go down to the depot answered tom that is if you want to ride with me  i want to know jest how we stand on this mortgage question first announced henry grisley i want your offer down in black and white  you shall have it and the others can be witnesses to it answered tom and in the course of the next quarter of an hour a paper was drawn up and duly signed by which tom agreed that the mortgage should be taken over by the rovers within the next thirty days with all back interest paid and that henry grisley should be paid a bonus of twentyfive dollars for his trouble and for his lawyers fees to bind the bargain tom handed the old man a tendollar bill on account which henry grisley stowed away in a leather wallet with great satisfaction  oh tom its just splendid of you to help us out in this manner said minnie after the transaction had been concluded and while old grisley and mr sanderson were talking together  im glad to be of service to you answered the youth i only hope for your sake and for the sake of songbird that the money that was stolen is recovered songbird is going to get on the trail of that rascal if it is possible to do so  i hope they do locate that fellow tom if they dont im afraid pa will never forgive poor john  oh dont say that minnie never is such a long word it should not have been put in the dictionary and tom smiled grimly  now that he felt fairly certain that he was to get his money henry grisley was in much better humor  i suppose i might as well have left that mortgage as it was he mumbled it was payin pretty good interest  well that was for you to decide grisley returned mr sanderson personally i dont see how you are going to make any better investment in these times  well ive got thirty days in which to make up my mind aint i queried the old man if i dont want to close out the mortgage i aint got to have i  certainly youve got to sell out now that you have bargained to do so put in tom you cant expect us to pull our money out of another investment to put it into this one and then not get it  hum i didnt think o that mused old grisley he thought hard for a moment pursing up his lips and twisting his beadlike eyes first one way and then another supposin i was to say right now that id keep the mortgage what would you do about it  do you really mean it grisley asked mr sanderson anxiously  depends on what this young man says sanderson one thing is sure i aint goin to give up that ten dollars he give meand fogg is got to be paid somehow  look here if you want to keep the mortgage just say so declared tom its a good mortgage and pays good interest you cant invest your money around here to any better advantage  all right then ill keep the mortgage announced henry grisley but understand young man im to keep that ten dollars you give me too he added shrewdly  well i dont see began tom when mr sanderson interrupted him  all right grisley you keep the ten dollars and you settle with fogg announced the farmer and its understood that you are to make out the mortgage for at least one year longer  cant ye give me moren the ten dollars asked henry grisley mebbe i might have to pay fogg moren that  dont you pay him a cent more said tom his services arent worth it  i wont pay him nothin if i can git out of it responded the old man shrewdly if i keep the mortgage then what has he done for me nothin mebbe ill give him half of the ten dollars ive had jest as much trouble as he has  following this discussion the paper formerly drawn up was destroyed and a note written out and signed by henry grisley in which the old man agreed to renew the mortgage for one year from the date on which it had been due  to tell ye the truth i wouldnt have bothered about this explained old grisley in a burst of confidence but you see fogg knew the mortgage was due and he come to me and asked me what i was goin to do about it and then when word come that your money had been stolen he told me that id better foreclose or otherwise i might git next to nothin  the underhanded rascal was mr sandersons comment  thats just what he is answered tom you know we had a lot of trouble with him last yearand evidently we are not done with him yet he added as he thought of what belright fogg had said concerning the snowball thrown by sam  tom wanted to say a good word for songbird and the opportunity came when a few minutes later and before their departure minnie invited them to partake of some cake and hot coffee while grisley sat down in the diningroom the youth talked to the farmer  now mr sanderson i have done what i could for you he said coming at once to the point and now i want to say a word or two about poor songbird he feels awfully bad over this matter and he thinks that you are doing him an injustice and let me say i think so too and tom looked the farmer squarely in the eyes as he spoke  yes i know rover but  now mr sanderson supposing you had been in songbirds place and had been knocked down and nearly killed what would you say if you were treated as you are treating him wouldnt you be apt to think that it was a pretty mean piece of business  at these plain words the farmer flushed and for the instant some angry words came to his lips but then he checked himself and turned his eyes away  maybe you are right and maybe i was a bit hasty with the lad he said hesitatingly but you see i was all worked up it took me a good many years to save that four thousand dollars and now that i am getting old it wont be no easy matter for me to save that amount over again  you wont have to save it over again mr sanderson songbird insists upon it that just as soon as he gets to work hes going to pay you back dollar for dollar  did he tell you that  he did and he told the others the same thing hell make that loss up to you if it takes him ten years to do it ive known him for a good many years now we went to putnam hall military academy together before we came to brilland i know he is a fellow who always keeps his word hes one of the best friends we rover boys have hes a little bit off on the subject of poetry but otherwise hes just as smart and sensible and trueblue as they make em went on tom enthusiastically and not only that he comes from a very nice family they are not rich but neither are they poor and they are good people to know and be connected with and tom looked at the farmer knowingly  i see rover mr sanderson drew a deep breath and then looked through the doorway to where minnie was pouring out the coffee if i was too hasty iiam sorry  and you will let songbird come here and call on your daughter  ii suppose so if minnie wants him to come  thank you mr sanderson i am sure you wont regret your kindness said tom and insisted upon grasping the farmers hand and shaking it warmly then he went in to have some cake and coffee before taking his departure with old grisley  so you are going back to new york are you tom said the girl while he was being served  yes i am going to take the train this afternoon he answered and then continued ive got a loose button here on my coat minnie will you fasten it before i go  sure i will she returned and a few minutes later led the way to a corner of the sittingroom where was located a sewing basket  i wasnt worrying much about losing the button minnie he whispered i wanted to tell you about songbird i have just spoken to your father about him and he says he can come to see you the same as he used to  oh tom did he really say that and minnies eyes brightened greatly  yes he did and as soon as i get to ashton i am going to send songbird a telephone message to that effect returned tom  oh tom will you and she looked at him pleadingly  surest thing you know minnie and believe me songbird when he gets that news will be the happiest fellow in brill  i dont think hell be any happier than ill be answered the girl and then of a sudden blushed deeply and finished sewing on the button without another word  ten minutes later tom bade the sandersons goodbye and accompanied by henry grisley drove away in the direction of ashton old grisley was left at his home and then tom took himself to the depot where from a telephone booth he sent a message to songbird telling the wouldbe poet of brill how it had come about that grisley had agreed to renew the mortgage for one year and how mr sanderson had said that songbird could renew his calls upon minnie if he so desired  tom youre a wonder said songbird over the telephone youre a wonder thats all i can say  never mind what i am returned the funloving rover kindly you just see if you can get on the trail of that fellow who stole the four thousand dollars and at the same time you get busy and make up for lost time with minnie goodbye and then he hung up the receiver and a few minutes later was on board the train bound for the metropolis     chapter xiii  sam on the road   the next few days were very busy ones for sam because he had a number of important classes to attend and he was hard at work finishing his theme on civilization in ancient central america it was impossible to call on grace and so he did nothing to find out the truth about chester waltham because he did not wish to ask the girl about this over the telephone nor did he see his way clear to expressing his thoughts on paper  sunday came and went and monday morning brought a letter to the youngest rover which he read with much interest it was from belright fogg a longwinded and formal communication in which the lawyer stated that he had been under medical treatment because of being hit in the head by a snowball thrown by sam and he demanded fifty dollars damages if the same was not paid immediately he stated that he would begin suit  anything wrong sam questioned songbird who was present while sam was reading the letter you look pretty serious  read it for yourself songbird was the reply and sam passed the communication over  well of all the gall burst out the wouldbe poet of brill fifty dollars of course you wont pay any such bill as this  not so you can notice it returned sam sharply if he had sent me a bill for five dollars or less i might have let him have the money just to shut him up but fifty dollars why its preposterous  what do you propose to do  i wont do anything just yet i want time to think it over and to talk it over with some of the others and maybe with dr wallington  when they heard of this demand for money from the rascally lawyer stanley and spud were as angry as the others  i dont believe hes entitled to a cent came from stanley we were having that snowballing contest on the college grounds and while the highway runs through that end of the grounds i believe fogg passed through there at his own peril as a lawyer might put it if i were you sam id put the whole case up to dr wallington and id remind the doctor of your former trouble with fogg and let him know just what sort of an underhanded rascal he is  all right stanley ill do it answered sam ill go to the doctor immediately after classes this afternoon will you go along  of course if you want me to  four oclock found them at the door of the doctors study he looked at them rather curiously as they entered  well young men what can i do for you he questioned pleasantly  ive got into some trouble over that snowballing contest answered sam and sitting down he gave the head of brill the particulars of the occurrence and then produced the letter received from belright fogg  hum mused the worthy doctor as he knitted his eyebrows he must have been pretty badly hurt  i dont think he was hurt at all doctor interrupted stanley i was present and so were a number of the other students mr fogg had his hat knocked off and that was about all he wasnt stunned or anything like that he talked to sam just as rationally as i am talking to you and all those standing around heard him of course he was very angry not only because he had been hit but because the fellow who had thrown the snowball was sam rover he of course remembered how the rovers foiled his plot to do them out of what was coming to them when their flying machine was wrecked on the railroad and also how they got the best of fogg and a company of brokers in new york city  yes yes i remember about the wrecked flying machine returned dr wallington i know nothing about this affair in new york  well it was a very serious matter and fogg came pretty close to going to prison answered sam and gave a few details as already related in the volume entitled the rover boys in new york  very interesting rover very interesting indeed murmured the head of brill but even that did not excuse your hitting this man in the head with a snowball and hurting him  there is another point i would like to mention said stanley we were having the contest on the college grounds and mr fogg was struck on the roadway where it runs through our grounds  ah i see that might make a difference the highway is more or less of a public one it is true but it has never been turned over to the county authorities so it really forms a part of our grounds still but of one thing i wish to be sure roverdid you aim at mr fogg or was the snowballing unintentional  i didnt see him at all answered sam some of the fellows rushed behind the bushes and i simply let drive along with a number of others then fogg appeared and claimed that i had hit him in the head i rather think he tells the truth although i am not positive  in that case he would have to prove that you were guilty besides that if it came to a matter of law he would have to prove actual damages and i do not see how he could claim fifty dollars if he was not hurt more than you say if you wish you can leave the whole matter in my hands and i will have it investigated  thank you very much doctor wallington returned sam warmly this lifts a load off my mind of course i will pay whatever you settle on and so the matter was allowed to rest  a thaw had set in and the snow began to disappear rapidly from the roads and fields around brill there was a good deal of slush which rendered some of the highways almost impassable so that it was not until a week later that sam had an opportunity to visit hope in the meantime however he had sent a nice little note to grace in which no mention was made of the walthams he had looked for an answer but none had come  where bound sam questioned songbird when he saw his roommate getting ready to use his automobile  im going for a run to hope do you want to come along and sams eye had a twinkle in it  you might run me around to the sanderson place it wont take long in the auto returned the wouldbe poet if i can get there i wont mind walking back this evening ive been wanting to go for a long while but the roads have been so poor i couldnt make it  all right songbird come ahead was sams answer and a little later found the pair on the road  it did not take long to reach the sanderson farm and as they entered the lane sam tooted his horn loudly  ive brought you a visitor minnie cried the rover boy as he brought the machine to a standstill here is somebody i know you wont want to see but im going to leave him here nevertheless and he grinned broadly  oh john burst out the farmers daughter and blushed deeply she came forward and shook hands with both youths i am more than glad to see you  i am on my way to hope so i wont come in went on sam how is everything minnie  oh about as usual answered the girl and then went on of course you know all about what tom did for us it was splendid  you havent heard anything more regarding the money  not a thing sam i thought maybe you had something to tell and the girl turned from sam to songbird  we have sent out the photographs and the description of blackie crowden answered the latter they are going to the police in all the large cities so if crowden turns up at all hell be arrested sooner or later  after a few more words sam left the sanderson place and headed directly for hope  although he would not admit it even to himself the youngest rover was a good deal worried what tom had told him concerning grace and the walthams had been continually in his mind and time and again he had wondered how he should broach the subject to grace and what the answer of the girl would be  of course shes got a right to go out with whom she pleases he told himself but still i thoughtwell i thought it was all fixed between us thats all  sam was so occupied with his thoughts that he paid scant attention to the running of the automobile as a consequence he went over a number of sharp stones and a minute later there came a loud report from the rear of the machine  a blowout confound the luck he exclaimed as he brought the automobile to a standstill and just when i was in a hurry to get to hope  there was nothing else to do so stripping himself of his overcoat and donning a jumper sam got out taking with him some of the tools from under the automobile seat it was a tire on one of the rear wheels which had blown out and this wheel he now jacked up for the purpose of putting on a new shoe and inner tube as luck would have it the tire that had been cut fit very tightly so that it was all the rover boy could do to get it off the rim he tugged and twisted perspiring freely but it was some time before he could even get the injured shoe started  if i cant get it off what ever am i to do he mused i must be at least half a mile from even a telephone and the nearest garage is at ashton at this rate ill never get to hope  he continued to work over the tire at last doing his best to pound it off with a bit of iron and a hammer then he gave a final wrench which brought the tire off so suddenly that sam was sent flat on his back in the dirt and slush of the road it was an occurrence to try anybodys patience and sam arose in anything but a happy frame of mind his back was covered with mud and a good deal of the slushy water had penetrated to his skin  ugh of all the rank luck he muttered as he shook himself if i ever get this wheel mended ill be a fine sight to present myself at a fashionable ladies seminary why in the world didnt i look where i was driving instead of rushing right over such a prime collection of rough stones  but finding fault with himself did not mend matters and so casting the cut tire aside sam unstrapped one of the extra shoes he carried and got out another inner tube  as if everything was to go wrong that afternoon the new shoe proved to be as small as that which had been taken off and as a consequence sam had to work like a trojan for the best part of half an hour before he finally got it into place  and now ive got to pump it up by hand he observed to himself grimly as he remembered that the power pump which had been installed on the engine was out of order and could not be used then he brought out the hand pump and set to work to fill the new tire with air  sam had the tire about threequarters pumped up and was working away as vigorously as his somewhat exhausted condition would permit when he heard a honking of an automobile horn and the next moment a machine came in sight around a turn of the highway the car was a large and powerful one of foreign make and was driven by a young man stylishly dressed in a full suit of furs and wearing automobile goggles behind him were two young ladies also wearing furs and with veils covering their faces  tough luck sang out the young man at the wheel of the passing car and he waved one hand pleasantly towards sam  the youth had been bending over the hand pump but now as the other automobile swept by he straightened up suddenly and stared with open eyes after the vanishing turnout he had not recognized the young man who was running the machine but he had recognized the two young ladies in the tonneau of the car  ada waltham and that was grace with her he murmured and if thats so it must have been chester waltham who was running the car     chapter xiv  days of waiting   as sam gazed after the vanishing automobile a pang of bitterness swept through his heart he remembered all that his brother had told him concerning chester waltham and he also remembered that grace had never mentioned the young millionaire  and she knew i was coming over to hope just as soon as the roads made it safe and pleasant for automobiling he murmured to himself  neither of the young ladies in the tonneau of the car had looked back so it was more than likely they had not recognized him as he was bending over the hand pump inflating the new tire  but maybe she saw me after all and did not want to let on he thought dismally maybe she thought i wouldnt recognize her  what to do next was a problem for the young collegian if grace was not at the seminary he had no desire to call there he continued to work over the tire and soon it was properly inflated and he put away the tools he had used his face was a study for he was doing some hard thinking  well ill go to hope anyway and if she isnt there ill leave my card so shell know i called then ill see what she has to say about matters he told himself and setting his teeth somewhat grimly he started up the automobile and continued his trip  at the door of the seminary he was met by a maid who brought him the information that miss laning was out then several girls who knew sam came up and one of them explained that grace had gone automobiling  she went with ada waltham and her brother chester explained the girl student you see chester has a brand new foreign cara beautyand he was very anxious to give his sister and grace a ride we thought he might have asked some of us to go along but he didnt and the girl pouted slightly  you dont suppose they were going to stop at brill questioned sam struck by a sudden thought  i dont think so mr rover ada said something about riding to columbia and having dinner there this evening that you know is quite a distance and the road doesnt run past your college  then i suppose they wont be back till late  they had permission to stay out until ten oclock put in another of the girls who were present  oh i see as the girls were looking at him rather sharply sam felt his face begin to burn well i hope they have a good time he added somewhat hastily goodevening and then turned and walked quickly towards his automobile and in a minute more was on his way back to brill  ill wager grace laning has got herself into hot water was the comment of one of the girls as they watched sams departure i dont believe he likes it one bit that she went off with the walthams  humph you cant expect a girl to hang back when she is asked to take a ride in a brand new automobile and with such millionaires as chester waltham and his sister broke in another girl i just wish i had the chance she added rather enviously  in the meantime sam was driving along the country road in rather a reckless fashion his mind was in a turmoil and to think clearly just then seemed to be out of the question  of course she has a right to go out and dine with the walthams if she wants to he told himself but at the same time and then there came up in his mind a hundred reasons why grace should have refused the invitation and waited for him to call upon her  hello you are back early remarked spud when sam appeared at brill i thought you were going to make an evening of it  i had some bad luck on the road replied sam rather sheepishly i had a blowout and in trying to get the tire off i slipped and went flat on my back in the mud and slush he continued  is that so well thats too bad sam so you came home to get cleaned up eh i thought your girl thought so much of you that she wouldnt care if you called even when you were mussed up and at this little joke spud passed on much to the rover boys relief  the only occupant of number 25 who seemed to be happy that night was songbird who came in whistling gaily  had a fine time with minnie he declaredbest time i ever had in my life i tell you sam shes a wonderful girl  so she is songbird  of course you dont think shes half as wonderful as grace went on the wouldbe poet of brill but then thats to be expected  how did mr sanderson treat you broke in sam hastily to shift the subject  oh he treated me better than he did before songbirds face sobered for a minute to be sure he feels dreadfully sore over the loss of that four thousand dollars but i assured him that i and the authorities were doing all in our power to get the money back and i also assured him that if it wasnt recovered i expected to pay it back just as soon as i could earn it of course he thinks i am talking through my hat about earning such a big amount but just the same i am going to do it just as soon as i graduate from brill id go to work tomorrow instead of staying here if it wasnt that i had promised my folks that i would graduate from brill and as near the top of my class as i could get if i left now my mother would be heartbroken  of course your folks know about the loss songbird  yes i wrote them the whole particulars just as soon as i could and ive let them know what we are doing now  do they blame you for the loss  my father thinks i might have been a little more careful but my mother says she thinks it is mr sandersons fault that he let me get such an amount of money in cash and carry it on such a lonely road but dad is all right and in his last letter he said he could let mr sanderson have a thousand dollars if that would help matters out  had mr sanderson heard any more from old grisley or belright fogg  yes he saw grisley and the old man said the lawyer was boiling mad because he had agreed to let the mortgage run for another year fogg wouldnt accept the five dollars that old grisley offered him for his trouble so then grisley would give him nothing and there the matter stands  hell get something out of grisley if he possibly can my opinion is since fogg lost his job with the railroad company and made such a fizzle of his doings in new york city he is in bad shape financially and eager to get his hands on some money in any old way possible  have you settled the snowball affair with him yet  no im going to see dr wallington about it tomorrow answered sam  the rover boy had rather expected some sort of a communication from grace the next day and he was keenly disappointed when no letter came and when she failed to call him up on the telephone several times he felt on the point of calling her up but each time set his teeth hard and put it off  its up to her to say somethingnot me he told himself she must know how i feel over the affair  when sam called upon dr wallington the head of brill met him with rather an amused smile  i suppose you want to see me in regard to that claim of mr foggs he said  yes sir  well i have had one of the professors call on the lawyer and bind him down to just exactly what happened and how badly he was hurt it seems that he did not go to any doctor at all although he did see a friend of his a doctor slamper on the street  doctor slamper cried sam oh i remember him hes the fellow who came here with mr fogg at the time we put in our claim for damages on account of the wrecked biplane  ah indeed i remember and dr wallington nodded knowingly  and what does mr fogg want us to do questioned sam  at first as you know he wanted fifty dollars then he came down to twentyfive and at last to fifteen then we brought to his attention the fact that the snowballing contest had taken place on the college grounds and that it was his own fault that he had become mixed up in the affair this brought on quite an argument but in the end mr fogg agreed to accept six dollars which he said would pay for three consultations with dr slamper at two dollars per consultation and the good doctor smiled rather grimly  and did you pay the six dollars doctor  not yet rover i expected however to send him a check for that amount tomorrow provided you are satisfied  i think ill have to be dr wallington i suppose its rather a cheap way out of the difficulty although as a matter of fact i dont believe he is entitled to a cent  you may be right rover but six dollars i take it is not so very large a price to pay for so much funi mean of course the fun of the snowballing contest in which so they tell me you were the one to capture the banners of the opposition  youre right sir and im satisfied and you can place the amount on my bill answered sam and then he bowed himself out of the doctors office  another day passed and still there came no word to sam from hope he was very much worried but did his best not to show it  call for all baseball candidates at the gym tomorrow afternoon announced bob during the lunch hour  i dont think i want to go in for baseball this spring returned sam  i heard something of that from some of the other fellows sam interrupted bob it wont do we need you and we are bound to have you  the roads were now drying up rapidly and that afternoon spud asked sam if he did not want to walk to ashton  ive got a few things i want to get at the stores said spud come along the hike on the road will do you good  all right spud ill go along for i am tired of writing themes and studying answered sam but it was not his theme and his lessons that worried the boy thinking about grace and waiting continually for some sort of word from her had given him not only a heart ache but a headache as well  when the boys arrived at ashton they separated for a short while spud to get fitted with a new pair of shoes while sam went to another place in quest of a new cap the rover boy had just made his purchase and was leaving the store to rejoin spud when he heard some one call his name and looking around saw andy royce approaching  i just thought id ask you if you had heard anything about that blackie crowden yet remarked the gardener from hope as he approached  not yet royce but they have sent out a good description of him along with copies of his photograph so the authorities think they will get him sooner or later  ive heard something that maybe you would like to know went on andy royce ive heard that crowden was over at leadenfield to a small roadhouse kept by a man named bissette a frenchman  when was this demanded sam with interest  either the day of the assault or the day after bissette didnt seem to know exactly i happened to be there buying some potatoes for the seminaryyou see bissette is a kind of agent for some farmers of that neighborhood i mentioned the robbery to him and spoke about the suspicion about crowden and he was very much surprised he said crowden was there for a couple of hours using the telephone and then he left the place when somebody drove up in a cutter  do you mean that crowden went off with the other person in the cutter  bissette thinks so although he aint sure because as soon as crowden went out bissette turned to do some work inside and forgot all about him  did bissette have any idea who the man in the cutter was  he wasnt sure about that either but he kind of thought it was a lawyer who used to work for the railroad companya man named fogg     chapter xv  baseball talk   fogg cried sam in astonishment do you mean belright fogg  thats the manthe fellow who used to do the legal work for the railroad here  was this bissette sure it was fogg  no he wasnt sure because he didnt pay very much attention but he said if it wasnt this fogg it was some one who looked very much like him answered andy royce  this was all he could tell sam of importance and the rover boy went off to rejoin his chum in a very thoughtful mood  thats rather a queer state of affairs was spuds comment when told of the matter if fogg met this blackie crowden what do you suppose it was for  i havent the least idea spud  do you think he was mixed up in this robbery  no i cant say that the assault was committed by one man and so far they havent been able to find any accomplices  when sam returned to brill he at once sought out songbird and told him of what he had heard the wouldbe poet of brill was even more surprised than spud had been  i wouldnt put it above belright fogg to be in with a rascal like blackie crowden was songbirds comment he did his best against you in that flying machine affair and in that affair in new york city  ive got an idea said sam after a slight pause i am to pay him six dollars damages for hitting him in the head with that snowball doctor wallington was going to send him a check ive got a good notion to ask the doctor to let me pay the bill and get foggs receipt for it that will give me a chance to pump him about this matter  do it sam and ill go along burst out his chum quickly if this belright fogg knows blackie crowden i want to know it  permission was readily granted by the head of brill to sam to pay the bill and that evening the rover boy and songbird took the formers automobile and rode over to where belright fogg boarded on the outskirts of ashton they found the lawyer just preparing to go out and he showed that he was very much surprised to see them  i suppose you are here to pay that bill you owe me he said stiffly to sam  i am mr fogg was the answer i believe you agreed to accept six dollars if you will make out a receipt for the amount i will give you doctor wallingtons check  humph isnt the check receipt enough demanded the lawyer  perhaps but i would prefer to have a receipt showing exactly what the money is being paid for answered sam as a lawyer you must know it is best to have these things straight  oh very well come in and ill write out your receipt for you announced belright fogg coldly and ushered the pair into a sittingroom  sam had asked songbird to say nothing about blackie crowden until the matter of the snowball injury was settled a receipt for the money was quickly penned by belright fogg  there i presume that will be satisfactory he said as he showed it to sam  thats all right mr fogg was the answer and here is your check sam paused for a moment while the lawyer looked the check over by the way mr fogg i understand you were in leadenfield a few days ago at the tavern kept by bissette  whats that shot out the lawyer somewhat startled  i said that i understood that you were in leadenfield a few days ago at the tavern kept by bissette  and that you met a man there named blackie crowden broke in songbird quickly  ii was in leadenfield some days ago on business answered belright fogg hesitatingly but i wasnt at the bissette place or anywhere near it  but you met a man named blackie crowden queried sam  the lawyer glared at the rover boy and also at songbird  blackie crowden i dont know such an individualat least not by name  he is a fellow who used to work in hoovers livery stable in center havena man who stutters greatly  dont know the fellow was the prompt response  you mean to say you didnt meet blackie crowden at bissettes cried songbird  look here young man what are you driving at stormed belright fogg in a sudden temper youve no right to question me in this manner what is it all about  we have it on good authority that you met this man blackie crowden outside of bissettes place answered sam stoutly  who is this man you mention  being a lawyer and interested in public affairs you ought to know that mr fogg answered songbird he is the man who we think knocked me down and robbed me of mr sandersons four thousand dollars  ah ii remember now and so you are trying to connect me up with that rascal are you what do you mean by that  never mind what we mean declared the wouldbe poet of brill stoutly i want to get at the facts in this matter if you say you didnt meet crowden all right well let it go at that but there are others who say you did meet him  its falseabsolutely false roared fogg but as he spoke his face paled greatly ii dont know this fellow crowdennever met him in my life this is all a putup job on your part to make trouble for me and he glared savagely at both songbird and sam  its no putup job mr fogg we intend to get at the bottom of this sooner or later answered sam as calmly as he could come on songbird  see here youre not going to leave this house until i know just what you are driving at roared the lawyer i wont have you besmirching my fair name  your fair name returned sam sarcastically there is no necessity for you to talk that way mr fogg i know you thoroughly if you want to rake up the past you can do it but i advise you not to do so  ii began the lawyer and then stopped not knowing how to proceed  we might as well go broke in songbird but perhaps mr fogg you havent heard the end of this added the wouldbe poet of brill and though the lawyer continued to storm and argue the two chums left the house and were soon on the return to brill  im afraid we didnt gain anything by that move was sams comment as they rode along hell be on his guard now and that will make it harder than ever to connect him with this affairprovided he really is mixed up in it  he acted pretty startled when we put it up to him returned songbird he heaved a deep sigh well maybe some day this matter will be cleared up but it doesnt look like it now  several days passed and sam stuck to his lessons as hard as ever once or twice he thought of calling up grace at hope or of writing her a note but each time he put it off why he could not exactly explain even to himself but then came a rift in the clouds and the sun shone as brightly as ever a note came from grace which he read with much satisfaction a part of the communication ran as follows       i was thinking all manner of mean things about you because you      did not answer my note of last week whenwhat do you think      the note came back to me brought in by one of the smaller      girls here jessie brown jessie was going to town that day      and i gave her the note to post and she put it in the pocket of      her coat along with several other letters so she says well      the pocket had a hole in it and as you might know my own      particular letter had to slip through that hole into the lining      of the coat the rest of the letters were mailed but my letter      remained in the lining until this morning when jessie came to      me with tears in her eyes to tell of what had happened i felt      pretty angry over it but glad to know that you were not guilty      of having received the note and then not answering it       in the note i told you how sorry i was to find that you had      called here while i was away you see ada walthams brother      chester came on in his new automobilea big foreign affair      very splendid he wanted to give ada a ride and invited me to      go along so i went and we had a very nice time chester is an      expert auto driver and the way we flew along over the roads      was certainly marvelous he insisted upon it that we dine with      him and oh sam such a spread as it was       you know he is a millionaire in his own right ada has a great      lot of money too we certainly had one grand time and i shall      never forget it he got a beautiful bouquet for the table and      also bouquets for ada and me to take home along with boxes of      the most beautiful chocolates i ever ate but just the same i      am awfully sorry i wasnt at the seminary when you called and      i dont understand why you havent been up since or why you      didnt telephone to me       one of the girls here says they are organizing the brill      baseball nine for the coming season and that they want you to      play as you did last year if you do join the nine i hope you      have the same success or more and you can rest assured that i      will be on the grandstand to offer you all the encouragement      possible i hope that dick and tom come on to see the game and      bring dora and nellie along and then we can have the nicest      kind of a jolly party ada waltham as you may know loves      baseball games too and she says that she is going to have      chester here at that time to take her over to brill unless      somebody else turns up to accompany her  all right as far as it goes mused sam on reading this note but i wish chester waltham would stay away of course i cant blame grace for liking a ride in a big foreign car and being invited out to such a firstclass spread as she mentions but just the same i wish she wouldnt go with him  however the communication brightened his thoughts considerably and it was only a little while later when he talked to the girl over the telephone and made an arrangement for a ride in the automobile on the following saturday afternoon songbird and minnie to accompany them  the four went off to center haven where sam spread himself on a dinner which was certainly all that could be desired grace was in one of her most winning moods and when the young couple parted the cloud that had hovered over them seemed to be completely dispelled  as winter waned and the grass on the campus took on a greener hue baseball matters came once more to the fore at brill bob grimes who played at shortstop was again the captain of the team and it was generally understood that spud jackson would again occupy the position of catcher  were going to miss tom rover a good deal this year said bob to some of the others during the year past tom had been the candidate for head twirler against both bill harney and dare phelps and had shown that he was the superior of both of the others  well you havent got tom rover so youve got to make the best of it answered stanley phelps has been doing pretty well i understand so you might as well give him a chance  yes i thought id do that answered the team captain harney isnt in it at all and doesnt want even to try ill give phelps a chance and also jack dudley dudley was a sophomore whose swift pitching had become the general talk of the college he however was rather erratic and liable to go to pieces in a crisis  as my old readers know sam had joined the team the year before only after considerable coaxing and then merely as a substitute during the middle of the great game he had been assigned to left field in place of a player who had twisted his foot in that position he had caught a fly in a thoroughly marvelous manner and he had also managed when at the bat to bring in a home run  weve simply got to have you on the team sam said the captain a little later when he caught the rover boy in one of the corridors your hanging back this year is rather hurting our chances of winning  but bob i want to pay attention to my lessons pleaded sam i cant afford to get behind  youll not get behind was the answer arent we all striving to graduate you ought to be willing to do as much as spud and myself  all right then bob if you are going to put it that way was the answer and thereupon sam allowed his name to go on the list of prospective players and at once began training  after that matters moved along swiftly the committee from brill met with the committee from roxley and arrangements were perfected for the coming game as the contest had taken place the year previous at roxley it was of course decided that the game this year should be played at brill then men were set at work to place the diamond in the best possible shape for the contest and the grandstand was repaired and a new set of bleachers put up to accommodate a larger crowd than ever  this is a baseball year announced bob grimes so we can expect a big rush of visitors the nine had already won three games of minor importance  they tell me roxley has got the best team it ever put in the field announced stanley one day after he had been over to the other institution theyve got three dandy pitchers and two outfielders who are crackerjacks at batting one of their men told me that they expected to walk all over us  well well see about that returned bob grimes weve got a good team of our own and i know every one of us will try to play his head off to win     chapter xvi  the opening of the ball game   the day for the great baseball game between brill and roxley dawned clear and bright sam had received word that both of his brothers with their wives would be on reaching ashton early in the morning he drove down to the depot in his automobile to meet the newcomers  when the train rolled into the station dick rover as tall and handsome as ever was the first to alight quickly followed by his wife dora then came tom and nellie  hello sam my boy exclaimed dick as he strode up and shook hands quickly followed by his wife how are you these days but it is needless to ask for you look the picture of health  oh im feeling fine answered sam smiling broadly  ready to play winning baseball i presume came from dora as she gave him a warm smile  surest thing you know dora he answered oh weve got to win from roxley today  yes but you havent got me to pitch for you today sam broke in tom as he came up and shook hands who is going to do the twirling for brill  they are going to try dare phelps first and if he cant make it they will try jack dudley one of the sophs  oh yes i remember dudley when he was a freshman answered tom pretty clever fellow too  how is it you didnt bring grace with you sam questioned nellie as she took his hand  im to take you two girls up to hope after i leave tom and dick at brill explained the youngest rover then we are to get all of you girls directly after lunch grace wanted it that way  my but this is a touch of old times remarked dick as he climbed into the automobile let me take the wheel sam  certainly if you want to was the quick reply and a few minutes later with the oldest rover running the machine the whole party set off for brill  how are matters going in new york dick questioned sam while they rode along  we are doing quite well sam of course we are having a little difficulty in certain directions but that is to be expected you must remember in wall street the rivalries are very keen i suppose some of our competitors would like to put us out of business  what about that tour tom mentioned  i think we can make it sam ill know more about it a little later there is no hurry you know because youve got to graduate first and dick smiled knowingly at his brother  songbird and some of the other collegians were waiting to welcome dick and tom and as soon as they had left the automobile sam continued on the way to hope  oh im so glad to see you cried grace as she rushed out and kissed her sister and her cousin come right in we are going to have a special lunch in your honor sam im sorry i cant invite you but you know what the rules are  never mind tom will be on hand at onethirty promptly answered the youth i hope youll all be ready for we cant delay you know  well be ready dont fear answered grace  when sam returned to brill he found a crowd of the seniors surrounding his brothers telling them of the many things that had happened in and around the college since they had left  its a jolly shame we cant have you in the box today tom said bob grimes im afraid well need you sorely he added rather anxiously  why dont you put william philander tubbs in suggested tom with a grin dont you remember what a famous ball player he was and then there was a general laugh at the recollection of a joke that had once been played on the dudish college student  the air was filled with talk of the coming game and but scant attention was paid to the lunch provided for the collegians and their guests as soon as the meal was over tom took the rovers automobile and started for hope to bring grace and the others when he arrived there he found his wife dora and grace talking to ada waltham and her brother chester to whom he was introduced  we are going over to the game announced chester waltham ada and i are going to take half a dozen of the young ladies  fine returned tom the more the merrier dont forget to tell the girls to whoop her up for brill  i think the most of them will do that said ada waltham although one or two of them are roxley sympathizers  well brill cant have everything its own way answered tom a few minutes later he was on the return with grace nellie and dora  when he arrived he found sam awaiting them and all walked down to the grandstand where seats had been provided for the party grace and the others had just been made comfortable when chester waltham arrived with his sister and a number of others the young millionaire came forward with a broad smile and was quickly introduced and he lost no time in seating his sister next to grace while he sat directly behind the pair with all the other girls he had brought close by this arrangement did not altogether suit sam and he hurried off to the dressingroom to get into his baseball uniform in rather a doubtful frame of mind  a little later there was a grand shouting at the entrance to the field and into sight came a large automobile truck containing a drum and fife corps and carrying a large roxley banner the truck was followed by a dozen or more automobiles containing the roxley team and their fellowstudents the students had tin horns and wooden rattles  zip hurrah roxley was the cry and then followed a great noise from the horns and rattles  brill brill brill was the counter cry and then the furious din was taken up by the other side  after that the grandstand filled up rapidly and so did the bleachers until there was not an available seat remaining in the meanwhile a parking place for automobiles and carriages at the far end of the field was also well patronized  some crowd and no mistake was stanleys comment as he looked at the masses of humanity waving flags and banners and tooting their horns and using various other devices for making noise this is by far the biggest crowd we have ever had  roxley has sent word all around that they are going to bury us this year returned another student standing by they claim they have a team that cant be beaten  down in the dressingroom bob was giving some final instructions to his men  i want you to play from the word go he said sometimes a game is lost or won in the first inning dont let them get any kind of a lead if you can possibly help it  it had been decided almost at the last minute that instead of covering left field sam should cover third base there was a big cheer for the roxley team when it made its appearance on the field and another cheer when the brill nine showed itself then came the tossup and it was decided that brill should go to the bat first  the first man to the bat was a tall fellow who played center field and as he came forward many of the brill sympathizers cheered him lustily  now show em what you can do  knock it over the back fence  the ball came in and the batter swung for it and missed it  strike one  thats the way to do it muggs  again the ball came in and this time there was a foul tip  foul strike two  following this second strike came two balls over which the brill contingent cheered then came a swift inshoot which the batter missed by the fraction of an inch  strike three batter out sang out the umpire  thats the way to do it muggs came the yell from the roxley cohorts and there followed a din of horns and rattles  the second man up for brill managed to get to first but the next one went out on a pop fly and then the man on first was caught trying to steal to second  thats the way to do it roxley keep it up and as a goose egg was put up for brill on the score board the opponents cheered as wildly as ever  but if roxley had hoped to score in that first inning her expectations were doomed to disappointment the first man up went out on a pop fly the second on a foul and although the third managed to reach second base on what should have really been a onebase hit the fourth man up knocked an easy one to first which ended their hopes  it was not until the second inning that sam came to the bat there were two men out when he grasped the ashen stick and took his stand beside the home plate he had a strike and two balls called on him and then sent a clean hit between first and second bases  run sam run yelled dick  leg it old man leg it added tom and the youngest rover certainly did speed for first arriving there just a second before the ball  oh if only he can get in cried grace clapping her hands  its a long way around to home plate put in chester waltham hes got to have help to do it  a moment later the next man to the bat knocked an easy fly to second and that ended the chances for sams scoring and another goose egg went up for brill on the score board  in the end of the second inning roxley was fortunate enough to open the play with a neat drive which brought the batter to second then came another onebase hit and amid a wild yelling the runner from second slid in over the home plate  hurrah hurrah a run for roxley  thats the way to do it keep it up snow brill under  bob grimes walked up to dare phelps who was occupying the pitchers box  take it easy dare he pleaded dont let em rattle you  they are not going to rattle me responded dare phelps and pitched the next batter out in onetwothree order in the meantime however the man on first managed to steal second a moment later he tried to reach third the pitcher threw the ball to sam who leaped up into the air and caught it coming down on the runner while he was still a foot from the bag  runner out cried the umpire and roxleys player arose rather crestfallen and limped off to the benches  thats the way to do it sam nab em every time cried tom  when the inning was ended roxley had only the one run to its credit  brill came to the bat for the third time with a sort of doordie look on the faces of the players it was plucky little spud who started a batting streak getting safely to first and followed by another player who managed to reach second landing spud on third then came two outs before the inning was ended however two runs were placed on the board to the credit of brill  two to one in favor of brill cried one of the students  just wait this inning isnt over yet cried one of the roxley sympathizers then roxley went to the bat and because of a bad fumble on the part of the brill second baseman they managed to secure another run  two to two was the cry as the figures went up on the big score board  anybodys game so far said dick rover soberly but i do hope brill wins  and so do i answered his brother tom     chapter xvii  how the game ended   in the fourth inning brill did its best to get in another run there were two onebase hits made but these were followed by a strikeout and two pop flies so the hits availed nothing  such playing as that isnt helping us any was dicks remark in a low tone to tom  well those first two men up managed to find the ball returned tom hopefully  but if brill had not fared well in that inning roxley did no better so far as bringing in runs were concerned but the roxley batters found phelps quite easily pounding out numerous fouls  the score is two to two remarked chester waltham when the brill team came up to the bat in the fifth inning in this with one man out sam managed to send a neat drive directly past the roxley shortstop he gained first with ease and then taking a desperate chance slid safely to second  good work rover keep it up came from one of his chums  that wont do him any good they cant bring it in called out a roxley sympathizer and he proved to be a true prophet for the inning came to an end with no additional runs sam getting no chance to advance beyond the second bag  now then phelps keep cool admonished bob when in the second half of the fifth inning the brill pitcher passed the first batter on balls  all right ill do my best answered dare phelps but i must confess my arm is beginning to hurt me he added  do you want to drop out questioned the captain quickly  oh no not until they hit me more than they have responded the brill pitcher grimly  there followed one out but after that came some free hitting which brought in two runs  hurrah hurrah shouted the roxley students  two to four in favor of roxley thats the way to do it snow em under  steady phelps steady warned the brill captain but it was of no avail and the only way brill could bring that inning to a finish was by the clever work of two of the fielders in capturing two flies which looked as if they might be home runs  when the board showed the score of 2 to 4 roxley went wild once more while the followers of brill looked correspondingly glum  maybe you had better give jack dudley a chance suggested bob to dare phelps when the two walked into the benches  oh let me try it just once more pleaded the pitcher anybody might have let in those two runs  all right phelps ill give you one more chance answered bob somewhat sharply you know we dont want this game to go to roxley if we can possibly help it  in the sixth inning brill scored another goose egg then roxley came once more to the bat and on the first ball pitched by phelps scored a home run amid a yelling and cheering that could be heard for a great distance  whoop thats the way to do it five to two in favor of roxley  keep it up boys snow em under snow em under and then the roxley crowd began a song the refrain of which was were here today to bury them  the cheering was still at its height when bob motioned to jack dudley who had been warming up in a corner of the field to come forward and take dare phelps place there was a cheer from brill for the new pitcher while phelps retired rather crestfallen  now then dudley put em out in onetwothree order was the cry  weve killed off one pitcher now kill off the next came the cry from the roxleyites  take it easy dudley warned bob give em your inshoot and that new fadeaway  ill give em all that is in me returned jack dudley with a determined look on his lean and somewhat angular face  the first man up got two balls and two strikes then came a foul tip followed by another strike  strike three batter out called the umpire  hurrah thats the way to do it dudley  the next man managed to get to first but then came two more outs and the sixth inning came to a close with the score still standing brill 2roxley 5  thats some lead remarked chester waltham brill has got to get busy pretty quickly if it expects to win this game  oh well get there dont you worry answered tom quickly and then he shouted go to it fellows go to it lambast the life out of that leather and at this cry there was a general laugh  the seventh inning proved a blank for both teams brill however managed to reach second while roxley was pitched out in onetwothree order by dudley  well dudley held them down that time remarked dick rover i hope he manages to keep the good work up  yes but a pitcher cant win a ball game alone answered chester waltham youve got to have some good batters  go to it brill go to it this is your lucky inning yelled tom enthusiastically get busy everybody  in the eighth inning the first man up for brill went out on a pop fly but then came a fine hit that took the next player safely to second then sam walked to the plate  thats the way to do it brill  now rover hit it for all you are worth  it must be confessed that sam felt a trifle nervous so anxious was he to make some sort of a showing he swung his ashen stick at the first ball pitched  strike one came from the umpire  take your time sam yelled tom make him give it to you where you want it  whether sam heard the cry or not it would be hard to say but he let the next ball go by and then repeated this action  ball two called the umpire  oh say that was all right grumbled the roxley catcher what do you want  too far out returned the umpire sharply and then added play ball  the next one was a straight drive and sam swung at it with all the strength and skill he possessed  crack the ashen stick hit the leather and the sphere went sailing far down into center field  go it rover go it  come on in orben  paul orben who had been the player to reach second was already streaking up to third and by the time sam reached first paul was legging it for the home plate  throw that ball up here throw that ball up yelled the second baseman to the center fielder who was still chasing after the bouncing leather  then amid a cloud of dust paul slid in over the home plate while sam having reached second was legging it rapidly for third up came the ball from the field to second and then to third but before it got there the youngest rover was safely clutching the bag  whoop hurrah thats the way to do it one run in and another on the way  keep it up brill youve struck your winning streak  oh dear i do hope sam can bring that run in came from grace  it might have been a home run if he had only run a little faster remarked chester waltham  faster retorted tom quickly why he legged it like greased lightning most players would have gotten only two bags out of that hit  following this batting came another out but then the next man up managed to reach first and amid a wild cheering on the part of the brillites and a loud tooting of horns sam rushed over the home plate  hurrah hurrah another run  that makes the score four to five  keep up the good work brill  but that was the end of the run getting for the time being then roxley came to the bat and amid the most intense feeling jack dudley managed to pitch out three men in succession and the score went up on the board brill 4roxley 5  now fellows this is our last chance said bob as the team came in for the ninth inning remember one run will tie the score and two runs may win the game now every man up on the job  the first batter for brill in the ninth inning was plainly nervous he let two good balls go by and thereby had two strikes called on him then he made a wild pass at the next ball knocking a short foul which the first baseman for roxley gathered in by a sensational running leap  one man gone one man gone chanted the roxley followers now then get the other two  take your time boys take your time cried bob make them give you just what you want  this advice was heeded and as a result the next man got to first and on another onebase hit managed to reach third then came a onebag drive that brought in a run and took the man on first to second  hurrah hurrah that ties the score  keep it up brill bring in all the runs you can  following the bringing in of the tying run there came some field play between the pitcher and the basemen and as a result the man who had reached first was called out trying to steal second in the mean time the other runner tried to steal home but had to stay on third  be careful boys be careful pleaded bob and then a few seconds later came another base hit which brought in another run  good good thats the way to do it brill  that makes the score six to five in favor of brill  bring in half a dozen more while you are at it  hold them down dont let them get another run pleaded the captain of roxleys nine to his men  were going to make a dozen more announced tom rover gaily but this was not to be and a few minutes later the inning came to an end with the score standing brill 6roxley 5  now then roxley one run to tie the score and two to win the game was the cry from the visitors  lam out a couple of homers  show em where the back fence is  in that ninth inning roxley came to the bat with a doordie look  now watch yourself dudley whispered bob to the pitcher dont let them rattle you  they are not going to rattle me answered dudley yet it was plainly to be seen that the sophomore was nervous and that the strain of the situation was beginning to tell upon him nevertheless amid a wild cheering on the part of brill he struck out the first man up  thats the way to do it brill  its all over but the shouting shrieked one brill sympathizer  not much here is where we make half a dozen runs yelled a roxleyite  the next batter up was a notoriously hard hitter dudley was afraid to give him something easy and as a consequence the pitcher had four balls called on him and the batter went to first then came a drive to center field which took the man on first to second while the batter reached first with ease  thats the way to do it roxley now youve got em going  with only one man out and two men on bases jack dudley was more nervous than ever yet bob did not have the heart to take him out of the box and besides he had no pitcher on hand who was any better  hold em down dudley hold em down pleaded the captain dont feed em any easy ones and the pitcher nodded grimly being too nervous to even answer  a ball was called and then a strike then dudley fed the batter a straight one crack the ashen stick met the sphere and sent it along just inside the third base line  run everybody run was the yell from the roxley contingent and while the batter dropped his stick and sped toward first the man on that bag legged it for second and the man on second rushed madly toward third  for one brief instant it looked as if one and possibly two runs would be scored but then sam playing a little off third made a wild leap into the air and pulled down the ball next like a flash he tagged the man sliding in toward the third bag  illustration sam made a wild leap into the air and pulled down the ball  batter out runner out announced the umpire  hurrah hurrah brill wins the game  say that was a dandy catch by rover wasnt it  yes and how neatly he put that runner out too  and then as the score brill 6roxley 5 was placed on the big board a wild yelling tooting of horns and sounding of rattles rent the air once more brill had vanquished its old opponent  and everybody said that sam rover was the hero of the occasion     chapter xviii  goodbye to brill   the celebration at brill that evening was one long to be remembered bonfires blazed along the river front and the students marched around them and around the campus and the college buildings singing songs and having a good time generally  the others had insisted that the rovers take part in these festivities and so the boys had taken the girls to hope where dora and nellie were to remain until the next day  i must say i am mighty glad i came said dick to his brothers as he surveyed the shouting and marching students this certainly takes me back to the days when i was here  im going in for some fun announced tom and was soon in the midst of the activities the students played jokes on william philander tubbs old filbury and on a number of others and the funloving rover helped them all he could an attempt was also made to get the captured banners of the freshmen and sophomores from sams room but this failed  the boys are rather noisy tonight said one of the professors to dr wallington  i agree with you sir returned the head of brill but then they have something to be noisy about their victory was certainly well earned and the doctor smiled indulgently  many had come forward to congratulate sam on his fine work in putting through a double play unassisted in the last inning  it saved the day for brill announced stanley and many agreed with him  the great game had taken place on saturday afternoon so as the next day was sunday sam could do as he pleased the rovers had an early breakfast and then lost no time in riding over to the seminary where they found the others waiting for them  oh sam your playing was simply wonderful declared grace as she beamed on him how you ever caught that fly in the last inning is beyond me  yes and what do you think put in graces sister mr waltham said he thought it was quite an ordinary playthat any good allaround player could have done what sam did  maybe he was a bit jealous of sam was doras comment and as she spoke she looked rather keenly at grace who of a sudden blushed deeply  i suppose waltham brought his sister and those girls back here last evening said sam  oh yes answered nellie and they insisted that we join them in a little treat mr waltham drove down to ashton for some ice cream fancy crackers and candy and we had quite a spread under the trees it certainly was very nice of him to do it  i suppose hes got so much money he doesnt know what to do with it was dicks comment  he was asking me about that tour that we propose taking this summer said dora he added that he and his sister and maybe others were going to take a tour in his new car but he hadnt decided on where they were going and he thought it might be rather jolly if he joined our touring party  humph i dont see began sam and then broke off suddenly  it would be lovely to have ada along said grace she is a splendid girl and weve become quite chummy since nellie and dora went away  well we havent any time to settle about that tour just now announced dick our train leaves in a couple of hours and you girls have got to pack up before we start for the ashton depot  the mention of chester waltham along with the fact that he might join them on their proposed automobile tour put rather a damper on sams feelings he acted very soberly and his remarks to grace were not half as cordial as they usually were evidently sams nose was out of joint although he was not willing to admit it even to himself  all drove down to the ashton depot and there sam and grace said goodbye to the others who were going on to the home farm at valley brook and then to new york city on the return to the seminary sam had hoped to have a long talk and an understanding with grace but unfortunately two girls turned up who wished to get back to hope and there was nothing for the rover boy to do but to invite them to ride along so that the confidential talk between them had to be abandoned  after the great ball game matters quieted down at brill all of the seniors were hard at work getting ready for the final examinations which would start on the week following  if you make as good a showing in the examinations as you made on the ball field you sure will prove a winner declared bob to sam one day  well im going to do my level best bob was the reply you see neither dick nor tom had a chance to graduate so ive got to make a showing for the entire family  during those days nothing further had been heard regarding blackie crowden or the missing money sam and songbird had met belright fogg once on the streets of ashton but the lawyer had marched past without deigning to speak to them  hes a foxy customer was the comment of the wouldbe poet of brill if he had anything to do with blackie crowden hell try his level best to keep it to himself  at last the examinations began they were to continue for the best part of two weeks and during that time sam cut out all sports and confined himself to his studies with greater diligence than ever he had several important papers to hand in and he worked over these early and late rewriting and polishing until there seemed to be absolutely nothing more that could be done songbird also was busy for in addition to his studies and themes he had been asked by the class to write a poem in honor of the coming occasion  i only wish i could write something that would bring in some cash remarked the wouldbe poet one afternoon  although he had not apprised sam of that fact songbird had copied off several of his best poems and sent them to various publishers hoping that they might prove acceptable and bring in some money which he might turn over to mr sanderson as an evidence of what he hoped to do in the future so far however he had not heard from any of the poems but one which had been promptly returned  at last came the day when the examinations ended all the themes written by the students had been handed in and sam found himself free to do as he pleased he at once sought grace by means of the telephone hoping to get her to take an automobile ride with him  i am sorry she answered over the wire but i have still another examination to take and a theme to finish so i dont dare to think of going out  how have you made out so far questioned the youth  i dont know sam sometimes i think i have done very well and then again i am afraid that i missed a great many things how did you make out  oh i think ill pass but how high up i dont know i am hoping for great things but i may be mistaken and there the conversation had to come to an abrupt end for a professor came in to use the brill telephone  it must be confessed that sam slept rather uneasily on the night before the morning on which the announcement concerning each students standing was to be made  im scared to death came from spud i missed a whole lot of questions  so did i put in paul and i boned hard too he added dismally  finally came the announcement out of a class of sixtyfive seniors sixtytwo had passed sams name was at the head of the list with a percentage of ninetyseven songbird came fourth with a percentage of ninetythree spud had ninetyone and stanley the same while paul william philander tubbs and a number of others were listed at from eighty to eightyeight per cent  sam allow me to congratulate you cried songbird as he came up to wring his friends hand you certainly made a splendid showing  you made a pretty good showing yourself answered sam his face beaming  your folks will be mighty glad to hear of this went on the wouldbe poet of brill why dont you telegraph to them  just what im going to do answered the rover boy and im going to telephone to hope too he added  thats the talk i wish i could telephone over to the sandersons  never mind songbird ill drive you over there when i drive to the seminary replied sam  the days to follow were delightful ones for sam true to his promise he took songbird over to the sanderson homestead and then visited grace the girl had passed third from the top of her class and was correspondingly delighted  we had such dreadfully hard questions i thought i should never get through she confessed to the youth when they were alone and you came out on top sam oh its wonderfulsimply wonderful and she caught both his hands  well im gladglad for myself and glad for you grace he answered and looked her full in the eyes she looked at him in return and blushed prettily  oh mr rover allow me to congratulate you came from somebody near by and ada waltham came tripping up grace told me all about your wonderful showing  ada made a splendid showing herself answered grace before sam could speak  i was one point behind grace answered the rich girl and that certainly was wonderful for me i never was very keen about studyingin fact i didnt want to go to college only i had to do it if i wanted to inherit the money that my uncle left me  oh sam and to think our days of studying are over at last burst out grace i can scarcely believe it  i cant believe it myself grace he answered it seems to me ive been going to school all my life just think of the years and years i put in at putnam hall military academy before i came to brill  yes and to think of the years i put in at the cedarville school before i came to hope returned grace now it is all over i feel quite old and she laughed merrily  as was the usual custom it had been decided that graduation exercises at hope should take place two days before those at brill which would give ample opportunity for those desiring to do so to attend both functions  my folks are all coming to the graduations announced grace a day or two after the conversation just recorded  yes and my folks will all be on hand answered sam even uncle randolph and aunt martha are coming dear old aunt martha he said she has been a regular mother to us boys ever since i can remember im awfully glad she will be present and ill be mighty glad to have uncle randolph too not to say anything about dear old dad  after that there seemed to be so much to do and so many things to think about that time sped with amazing swiftness the rovers and the lanings had engaged rooms at the leading hotel in ashton and arrived on the day previous to the graduation exercises at hope  tell you what education is a great thing remarked mr john laning when speaking of the matter to mr rover i didnt have much of a chance at it when i was a boyi had to go out and scrap for a livingbut im mighty glad that i had the means to give the girls the learning theyve got  youre rightit is a great thing answered mr anderson rover i am only sorry now that dick and tom didnt have the chance to graduate as well as sam but you know i was very sick and somebody had to look after our business affairs and what those boys have done for me is simply wonderful  the greatest boys that ever lived announced randolph rover they used to bother the life out of me with their fun and noise but now that they have settled down and made men of themselves i forgive them for all the annoyances  sams father had brought for him as a graduation present a very fine diamond scarf pin while his uncle and aunt presented him with a handsomely engraved cardcase and dick and the others brought him a ring set with a ruby graces folks and the others had also brought several gifts of value for the girl and to these sam added a bracelet and the finest bouquet of flowers he could obtain in ashton  the graduation exercises at hope were exceedingly pretty all the girls were dressed in white and they formed a beautiful picture as they stood in a long line to receive their diplomas the onlookers clapped vigorously but no one with more fervor than did sam when grace received her roll the exercises were followed by a reception that evening at which the fair girl graduates shone as they never had before  and now for the big event at brill said dick when on the way back to ashton that evening sam arent you a bit sorry to leave the old college  i certainly am dick at the same time now that you and tom have buckled down to business i feel that i ought to be doing likewise  yes but all of you young folks are going on that tour first announced the boys father i think you have earned it and i want you to have it ill supply all the funds necessary and ill see to it that everything goes right at the office while you are away  never had brill been so crowded as it was at those graduation exercises every seat in the college hall was occupied and every doorway and open window held its group of eager onlookers the rover family had seats almost in the center of the auditorium and all of the lanings were with them  oh its grand just grand murmured aunt martha as she saw sam and the rest of the senior class gathering oh how proud i am of that boy and the tears coursed freely down her cheeks  the valedictory address had been written by sam and was delivered by the class orator stanley this was followed by a class poem written by songbird and delivered by a student named wells sams valedictory was received with loud clapping of hands  a well written papervery well written indeed was dr wallingtons comment and a great number of visitors agreed with him songbird had worked hard over his class poem which contained many allusions to local matters and was received with many smiles and expressions of good humor  songbird is certainly becoming something of a poet was dicks comment if he keeps on some day hell become the simonpure article  at last it was over and sam with his sheepskin rolled up and tied with a ribbon joined his folks his father was the first to congratulate him and then came old aunt martha who wept freely as she embraced him  im proud of you sam proud of you she said in a voice trembling with emotion what a pity your own mother couldnt be here to see you but the good lord willed it otherwise so we must be content  sam youve certainly done the family proud this day announced his oldest brother to graduate at the top of the class is going some  well ive got to do something for the rover name said the happy youth modestly  there was another reception that night and again the bonfires blazed along the bank of the river the undergraduates cut loose as usual but those who were to leave brill forever were a trifle sober  its been a fine old college to go to was dicks comment  youre right there dick came from tom a fine place indeed  the best in the world answered sam he drew a deep breath no matter where i go in this old world of ours ill never forget my days at brill     chapter xix  getting ready for the tour   and now for the grand tour  thats the talk sam we ought to have the best time ever returned his brother tom  just to think of such an outing makes me feel five years younger came from dick rover i like work as well as any one but a fellow has got to break away once in a while  and to think we are going away out to colorado springs and pikes peak burst out dora  and all the way in our automobiles added nellie i hope we dont have any breakdowns  so its decided that we are to start monday morning is it asked dicks wife  yes dora provided it is clear answered sam of course there is no use of our starting our trip in a storm well probably get enough rain while we are on the way  look here sam dont be a wet blanket cried tom catching his younger brother by the shoulder and whirling him around this trip is going to be perfectly clear from end to end ive ordered nothing but sunshine and moonlight and at this remark there was a general laugh  the young folks were assembled on the lawn in front of the old rover homestead at valley brook about two weeks had passed since grace and sam had graduated and during that time the various arrangements for taking the tour to the west had been completed by the rover boys in the meantime fourth of july had been spent in cedarville at the laning homestead where all had had a glorious time  im awfully sorry that songbird and minnie cant go with us on this trip remarked dick but i know exactly how poor songbird feels  yes he told me he felt he had to go to work returned sam he wants to do his best to earn that four thousand dollars  thats some job for a fellow just out of college to undertake was toms comment what is he going to do for a living  he has had a place offered to him by his uncle he is to start at fifteen dollars a week and he says his uncle will advance him as soon as he learns something about the business  they havent heard any more about that blackie crowden or the missing money questioned nellie  not a word and it looks to me now as if they never would hear anything  more than likely that fellow has got out of the country was dicks comment especially if he has learned that the police are after him  oh you cant tell about that broke in tom he may be hiding within a mile or two of where the crime was committed  it had been decided that the touring party should take two automobilesthat belonging to the rovers and a new machine which was the property of mrs stanhope doras widowed mother the party was to consist of dick and tom and their wives sam and grace and mrs stanhope and mrs laning uncle randolph and aunt martha had also been invited to go along but both had declined stating that they preferred to remain on the farm  i have some important scientific data on farming to gather had been randolph rovers explanation and besides that i must oversee the building of that new addition to the house for since the marriage of dick and tom it had been decided to build a large wing on the old homestead so that the young folks might be accommodated there whenever they cared to make a visit  aleck pop the faithful old colored servant of the rovers was still at the farm as was jack ness the man of all work and both did all they could to aid the boys and girls to get ready for the tour  its most wonerful how you young genlemen has done growed up was aleck pops comment it dont seem no time at all sence you all was boys at putnam hall and he grinned broadly showing a mouthful of ivories  and to think two of em are married now and settled down added jack ness i cant hardly believe it first thing you know well have a lot of young rovers runnin around this farm  well if they is any young robers aroun yere is gwine to serve em jest like i served the others answered aleck pop and then went off nodding his head vigorously to himself  the only drawback to the proposed tour so far as sam was concerned was the fact that chester waltham and his sister ada were going to accompany them as far as colorado springs then the walthams proposed to continue to the pacific coast while the rovers were to return to the east  are those two people going in a big touring car all by themselves questioned sam when he heard of this arrangement  they are not going to take the touring car sam answered grace ada wrote me that her brother had purchased a new runabouta very speedy and comfortable carand they are going to use that instead  humph i dont see why they had to stick themselves in with our crowd grumbled the youngest rover why didnt they take the trip by themselves  well maybe i am to blame for that answered grace i told ada all about our proposed trip and said i was sorry that she couldnt go with us you must remember she treated me very nicely while we were at the seminary especially after dora and nellie left  oh i dont object to ada answered sam just the same i think it would be nicer if we could go off by ourselves chester waltham and his sister dont seem to fit in with us exactly  well i think chester waltham is a very nice young man and certainly he has given me some splendid rides answered grace and then walked off to join the others leaving sam to do some thinking which was not altogether agreeable  the start was to be made from the farm and the walthams had written that they would be on hand early stopping for the night at the hotel in cornville some miles away  on the friday before the monday set for the start all three of the rover boys went down to new york city to the offices of the newly formed rover company in wall street they found their father in charge and also several assistants and everything seemed to be in good running order dick and tom went over a number of business matters with their parent and mr rover declared that he could get along very well without the boys for at least a month or six weeks  after the visit to the offices dick and tom took sam up to their apartments on riverside drive where they packed a number of things wanted by themselves and dora and nellie  certainly a beautiful location remarked sam as he walked to one of the front windows to gaze out on the hudson river  it certainly is a fine place sam answered tom and nellie and i enjoy it just as much as dick and dora do tom looked at his younger brother questioningly i suppose now that you have graduated sam you and grace will be joining us here some day  i dont know about that tom sams face flushed painfully you see ii and then he broke off unable to proceed  you dont mean there is anything wrong between you and grace do you demanded the brother coming closer dick had gone to another room and so was out of hearing  i cant say that anything is wrong exactly tom returned sam hesitatingly you see ii  is it that chester waltham demanded the other quickly  sam nodded of course i cant blame him and i cant blame grace for the matter of that it isnt every girl who gets the chance to marry a young millionaire  what has he proposed to her cried tom  oh no i dont think that tom but he has been very friendly  well i wouldnt stand for it sam i think grace ought to marry you and i would tell her so and have it settled  thats all well enough to say tom but just the same i havent any right to stand in her light i havent got any such money to offer her as this millionaire  rot youve got enough money to make any girl comfortable and that is all that is necessary you go on in and win and tom clapped his younger brother on the shoulder encouragingly then dick entered along with a maid left to take care of the apartments and the talk came to an end  while the boys were doing this the girls had gone to cedarville and there assisted mrs stanhope and mrs laning in getting ready for the tour doras mother had a hired chauffeur to run her car and this man was to bring the party to valley brook in the stanhope machine  i am very glad you are going mother said dora to her parent i am sure this trip will do you a world of good for mrs stanhope was not in the best of health and sometimes grew quite nervous when left too long to herself  it will be a wonderful trip no doubt answered the mother and i am sure i shall enjoy it greatly especially with all you young folks along to brighten matters up  it will certainly be a wonderful tour for me declared mrs laning who had always been more or less of a home body gracious why i can remember when i used to think a trip of ten or twenty miles on the steam cars was wonderful now just to think of our going hundreds and hundreds of miles in an automobile  the most wonderful part of it to me is that we can afford to have you take such a trip as that mother chuckled john laning sakes alive when i was a young man the height of my ambition was to own about fifty acres free and clear along with a couple of horses and half a dozen cows and now look at ushere we own over three hundred acres got over fifty head of cattle over two thousand chickens and the finest orchards in this part of the state i tell you weve got a lot to be thankful for he added with great satisfaction  but ill miss you john while im away said his faithful wife  dont you worry about me mother id just as lief stay here and see all them big crops acomin in announced the farmer thats fun enough for me you go ahead with the young people and enjoy yourself youve been in harness long enough and you deserve it  mr laning had had his ears wide open during the visit of his daughters and dora and before his wife and the others left for valley brook he called mrs laning aside  whats this i hear about grace going out with a young millionaire named waltham he asked curiously  i cant tell you much more than what youve already heard john she answered  i thought grace had her eyes set on sam rover went on the husband looking sharply at his wife  that is what i thought myself but it seems this young millionaire has been calling on his sister at hope and hes been taking his sister and grace out in his automobile and acting very nicely about it grace seems to be quite taken with him  huh a young millionaire eh maybe hes only amusing himself with her you had better caution her about him  no john i dont think that would do any good in fact it might do a great deal of harm declared the wife grace is old enough to know what she is doing  yes but if she has made some promises to sam rover  i am not sure that she has made any promises sam has been very attentive to herbut just because tom married nellie is no reason why grace should marry sam  oh i know that but somehow i thought they had it all settled between em and i certainly like sam hes a nice cleancut boy  yes i like sam too mrs laning heaved a deep sigh but just the same we had better not interfere you know how it was when we got married and she looked fondly at her husband  you bet i do he returned and then put his arm over her shoulder and kissed her gently well let us hope it all comes out for the best he added and walked off to go to work     chapter xx  a moment of peril   this is the life  thats right tom this kind of touring suits me to death returned sam rover  tom how many miles an hour are you making broke in his wife remember what you promised methat you would keep within the limit of the law  and that is just what i am doing nellie he answered but its mighty hard to do it believe me when you are at the wheel of such a fine auto as this why i could send her ahead twice as fast if i wanted to  dont you dare burst out grace who sat in the tonneau beside her sister if you do ill make you let sam drive  hes got to let me drive anyway after dinner said the youngest rover boy thats the arrangement  it was the second day of the tour and valley brook farm and in fact the whole central portion of new york state had been left far behind the weather had turned out perfect and so far they had encountered very little in the way of bad roads once they had had to make a detour of two miles on account of a new bridge being built but otherwise they had forged straight ahead  tom and his wife with grace and sam occupied the first automobile the remaining space in the roomy tonneau being taken up by various suitcases and other baggage behind this car came the one driven by dick rover beside him was his wife with mrs stanhope and mrs laning behind them some distance to the rear was the third machine a brandnew runabout containing chester waltham and his sister ada waltham had at first wished to take the lead but had then dropped behind stating he did not wish to get the others to follow him on any wrong road  you go ahead he had said to the rovers then if you go wrong you will have only yourselves to blame  well we dont know any more about these roads than you do waltham dick had replied we are simply going by the guide book and the signs  i hate to use up my brains studying an automobile guide chester waltham had returned with a yawn when i am on an outing i like to take it just as easy as i possibly can  its a wonder you didnt bring a paid chauffeur along had been sams comment  i thought something of doing that but my sister objected she said if she was to go along i must run the car you see she wants me to risk my neck as well as her own and the young millionaire had smiled grimly  they had been running for several miles over a road that was comparatively straight on either side were tidy farms with occasional farmhouses and barns now however the road became winding and they soon passed into a patch of timber  four miles to the next town announced sam as they rolled past a signboard he looked at his watch quarter after eleven do you think we had better stop there for dinner tom  no we are going on to fernwood six miles farther was the reply they say the hotel there is much better and believe me when you get away from the big cities the best hotel you can find in a town is none too good  it had been rather warm on the open road and all those in the automobiles welcomed the shade of the woods  its a pity we didnt bring our lunch along said dora to dick as they moved along at a slower rate of speed we could have had a good time picnicking along here  yes well have to dine out in the woods sometimes on this trip put in mrs laning i like that sort of thing much better than taking all our meals in hotels or restaurants  the first automobile had reached a spring by the roadside and here tom came to a halt presently followed by the others collapsible cups were handy and all were ready for a drink of the pure cool water which the spring afforded  fine isnt it exclaimed dick after the ladies had been served and he had had a cupful himself  youre right answered tom a good deal better than that bottled water we have down in the new york offices  but it cant beat the water on the farm said sam i must say no matter where i go the water doesnt taste quite as good as that at valley brook  oh thats only sentiment sam cried grace now i think the water at cedarville is just lovely  i think you are taking a little chance in drinking from a spring like this was chester walthams comment it may be pure and then again it may be full of all sorts of germs  sure it may be full of tadpoles and bullfrogs too added tom gaily but youve got to take some chances in this life as the fly said when he flew down into the molasses jug and got stuck there and at this little joke there was a general smile  beyond the spring the road went uphill for a long distance and then took a turn to the southward past more farms and over a bridge spanning a tiny stream then they came to a small town looking dry dusty and almost deserted in the midday summer sun  i am glad we didnt arrange to stop here was nellies comment as she glanced around  the sleepy little town was soon left behind and once again they found themselves passing over a series of hills dotted here and there with farms and patches of woodland then they came to a place which was very uneven and filled with rocks  got to be careful here unless we want to get a puncture announced tom and at once reduced speed  they were running on another winding road which seemed to bear off to the northward here there was something of a cliff with great rocky boulders standing out in bold relief  suddenly as tom reached a bend he saw a man coming towards them he was an italian and carried a small red flag in one hand  back youa gita back cried the man waving his red flag at them blas blas you gita back  the grade was downward and the man had appeared so suddenly that before tom could bring the first automobile to a standstill he had gotten at least a hundred feet beyond the italian while the second car run by dick was by the mans side  whats the trouble here demanded dick  you gita back you gita back exclaimed the italian frantically blas go off you gita back  hi tom come back here yelled dick this fellow says there is a blast going off  tom was already trying to heed the warning he had stopped so suddenly however that he had stalled his engine and now he had to take time in which to use the electric starter in the meanwhile the italian workman ran still farther back to warn chester waltham and anybody else who might be coming along the road  oh tom can you turn around questioned his wife anxiously  maybe you had better run the car backward suggested sam he had noted the narrowness of the roadway and knew it would be no easy matter to turn around in such limited space besides that there was a deep gully on one side so that they would run the risk of overturning  yes ill back if dick will only give me room muttered tom as he pressed the lever of the selfstarter then after the power was once more generated he threw in the reverse gear and allowed the car to back up  thats the way to do it tom yelled dick come on ill get out of the way and he too began to back until he was close on to the waltham runabout  look out dont bump into me yelled chester waltham who for the moment seemed to be completely bewildered by what was taking place whats the matter anyway he demanded of the italian  oh chester there must be some danger shrieked his sister say they are both backing up maybe you had better back up too  all right if thats what they want answered the young millionaire and then in his hurry tried to reverse so quickly that he too stalled his engine  back up back up called out dick weve got to get out of here there is some sort of blasting going on ahead  oh dick be careful cried mrs stanhope and sprang up in the tonneau of the car in alarm quickly followed by mrs laning  you will run into mr waltham sure wailed the latter  dont smash into me dont smash into me yelled the young millionaire in sudden terror if you bump into me youll send me into the ditch  by this time dicks car was less than three feet away from the runabout while toms machine was still some distance farther up the road  boom there was a distant explosion not very loud and following this came a clatter as of stones falling on the rocks none of the stones however fell anywhere near the three machines  oh cried grace  is that all there is to it queried nellie anxiously  i dont know returned tom he had now brought his automobile once more to a standstill  all in the three machines waited for a moment then they gazed enquiringly at the italian who stood behind them  say is that all the blasting there is demanded chester waltham  dats heem responded the foreigner he go off all right boss you go and he waved the stick of his flag for them to proceed  some scareand all for nothing muttered tom the way he carried on you would think they were going to shake down half of yonder cliff  oh tom they dont dare to take chances returned nellie why if we had gone on we might have been showered with those stones we heard falling  you fellows want to be careful how you back up grumbled chester waltham you came pretty close to smashing into me  well you should have backed up yourself when you heard us yell retorted dick sharply we didnt know how bad that blast was going to be  tom had already started forward and in a moment more dick and chester waltham followed but hardly had they done this when the italian on the road suddenly let out another yell  boss boss youa stop he cried youa stop queek de twoa blas youa stop and he danced up and down in added alarm  those who had gone on paid no attention to him and an instant later passed around a corner of the cliff as they did this they saw a man on the open hillside waving his arm and shouting something they could not understand  tom something is wrong began sam when of a sudden his words were swallowed up in a fierce roar and rumble that seemed to shake the very ground beneath them they saw a flash of fire in an opening of the cliff and the next instant a burst of flames and smoke was followed by a rain of rocks all around them     chapter xxi  news of blackie crowden   it was a moment of extreme peril and what made it seem worse was the fact that the rovers and the others could do nothing to save themselves rocks small stones and dirt flew all around them striking with loud noises the hoods and other metal parts of the automobiles and even landing in the tonneaus of the larger cars  hold up the robes protect yourselves with the robes yelled dick but before the ladies could heed his words the rain of rocks small stones and dirt had come to an end  great cæsar thats a fine happening groaned tom who had been hit on the shoulder by a fairsized stone he looked quickly at those in the car with him any of you hurt  i got hit in the head with something returned sam but it didnt hurt very much how about you and he looked at grace and at toms wife  ii dont think i am hurt any faltered grace as she looked at some stones and dirt on the robe over her lap  im all right answered toms wife but oh dear somethingi think it must have been a big stoneflew directly past my face  i hope the others got off as well as we did remarked tom let us go and see and suiting the action to the word he left the machine followed by his brother  the second car had a dent in the hood made by a stone as big as toms fist all those in the automobile had been hit by some smaller stones and also covered with loose dirt but no one had been seriously injured although mrs laning declared that some of the dirt had entered her left ear and also her eye  let me look at that eye cried mrs stanhope as soon as she had recovered from the shock of the second blast and then she went to work on the optic and presently mrs laning declared that the eye was as well as ever  as chester waltham and his sister had been farther back on the road around the turn of the cliff they had not felt the effects of the second explosion excepting a slight shower of dirt which had covered the front of the runabout but the young millionaire and his sister were greatly excited and the former got out of his machine to run up to the italian with the red flag and shake his fist in the mans face  youyou rascal he spluttered what do you mean by sending us into such peril as this you ought to be put into prison  ia ia forget heem faltered the foreigner helplessly i tink only one blas i forget two blas and he looked very downhearted  but this time the man who had been up on the hillside came running to the scene of the mishap followed by several of the workmen  anybody hurt sang out the man who was an american in charge of the blasting gang  nothing very serious answered dick but it might have been he added sharply you fellows ought to be more careful  i told tony to keep everybody back for two blasts answered the man why didnt you stay back until you heard the second blast  he told us to go on answered tom  i make mistake cried the italian you forgive boss and he looked pleadingly at dick and the others  well you dont want to make any more mistakes like that returned dick if we had gotten a little closer somebody might have been killed  thats the second time you have failed to obey orders tony said the gang master sternly you go on up to the shanty and get your time and clear out i wont have such a careless man as you around  at these words the italian looked much crestfallen he began to jabber away in a mixture of english and his own tongue both to his boss and to our friends but the boss would not listen to him and ordered him away and then he departed looking decidedly sullen  i cant do anything with some of these fellows explained the man in charge of the blasting i tell them just what to do and sometimes they mind me and sometimes they dont im very sorry this thing happened but im thankful at the same time that you got through as well as you did and he smiled a little  youre not half as thankful as we are put in sam dryly  i hope there is no damage done to your cars but if there is im willing to pay for it went on the man  a few dents but i guess that is all answered dick after a look at both the car he was driving and the one run by his brother well let those go for we are on a tour and have no time to waste here  all right sir just as you say but here is my card i dont want to sneak out of anything for which im responsible continued the man if you find anything wrong later on you let me know and ill fix it up with you  we ought to sue this fellow for damages cried chester waltham wrathfully its an outrage to treat us like this  were you hurt in any way asked the man quietly  we got a lot of dirt and stones on the runabout growled waltham  oh chester dont quarrel over the matter entreated his sister in a low tone the man didnt want to do it  oh these follows are too fresh grumbled the young millionaire the authorities ought to take them in hand and then he reëntered his runabout looking in anything but a happy mood  do you think we can go ahead on this road now asked dick after a few more words had passed between the rovers and the man who had the blasting in charge  i think so was the reply just wait a few minutes and ill have my gang of men clear a way for you he was evidently a fair and square individual who wanted to do the right thing in every particular and the rovers could not help but like him  it was all that italians fault remarked sam to tom while they were waiting for the road to be cleared of the largest of the rocks if he had kept us back as he was ordered to do there would have been no trouble  he looked mighty mad when he went off was toms answer if that fellow in charge here doesnt look out that chap may put up some job on him  inside of ten minutes the man in charge of the blasting told them they could go ahead and so on they went as before with tom again in the lead as they passed by they saw numerous places along the face of the cliff where other blasting had taken place the man had explained that the work was being done by the contractors in order to widen the road in that vicinity  about a mile and a half beyond the cliff nestling in the midst of a number of pretty farms they came to the town of fernwood the place at which they were to stop for their midday meal they had the name of the leading hotel on their list and found the hostelry a fairly large and comfortable one  i think well want a good washing up after that experience remarked dick when the automobiles had been placed in the hotel garage my but that was a narrow escape and he shuddered at the recollection  you fellows were mighty easy with that man observed chester waltham he ought to have been made to suffer for his carelessness  well if you want to sue him waltham you go ahead and do it said dick somewhat sharply he was beginning to like the young millionaire less and less the more he came in contact with him  a table had been reserved for the entire party and soon the wellcooked meal put even chester waltham in better humor now that the danger from the blast was a thing of the past they could afford to smile over the somewhat thrilling experience  maybe after this it would be a good idea to ride with the tops up said tom only wed have to make them stone proof as well as rainproof and at this remark there was a general smile  remember tom im to be at the wheel this afternoon announced sam who thus far had not had much chance to do any steering on the trip  all right little boy you for the pilot act returned his funloving brother gaily but remember what the girls told youno speeding the law in this state is four and oneeighth miles an hour except on turning corners where it is two and onesixteenth miles and at this little joke there was a titter from the girls  as it was so warm during the middle of the day it had been decided that they should not proceed on their tour until about three oclock this gave the ladies a chance to rest themselves something which was particularly satisfying to mrs stanhope and mrs laning  i think ill take a look around the town said tom after the ladies had gone to one of the upper rooms will you go along and he looked enquiringly at his brothers and chester waltham  i am going to write a letter to dad answered dick  i think ill write a letter myself and enjoy a smoke came from the young millionaire  im with you tom returned his younger brother lets go out and see if we cant capture a nice box of chocolates for the girls  tom and sam were soon on the way the main street of fernwood contained less than four blocks of stores and there was a cross street with half a dozen other establishments but the place was a railroad center and consequently was of quite some importance  having walked up and down the main street and procured a box of chocolates and a few other things the two rovers wandered off in the direction of the railroad station a train had just come in and they watched the passengers alight and then others get aboard they were particularly interested in the discomfiture of a fat traveling salesman who came puffing up on the platform a suitcase in each hand just in time to see the train depart the fat man was very angry but this availed him nothing  its a shame a shame howled the traveling salesman as he threw his suitcases down in disgust i know that train left at least two minutes ahead of time he stormed to the station master  youre wrong there mister was the ready answer she was a minute late  nonsense nonsense stormed the disappointed individual i tell you she left ahead of time i ought to sue the railroad company for this and he shook his head savagely  gosh we are up against people who want to sue everybody was sams remark that fellow ought to join chester waltham and then they could hire one lawyer to do the whole business  i might have been here five minutes ago if i hadnt been a fool stormed the fat salesman as he looked for comfort at the two rovers that comes from trying to be accommodating i was headed for this place when down there at the ludding house i met a fellow who wanted to know how to get to stockbridge he stuttered so that it took me about five minutes to find out what he wanted  stuttered did he questioned tom curiously  he sure did he had an awful stutter with a funny little whistle in between i wish i hadnt waited to listen to him i might have had that train confound it went on the fat salesman pulling down his face  did you say that fellow stuttered and whistled broke in sam eagerly  he certainly did  will you tell me what kind of a looking man he was  sure answered the salesman and then started to give as good a description of the individual as his recollection would permit  it must have been blackie crowden cried the youngest rover before the man had finished  i dont know what his name was said the salesman  we want to catch that man the worst way went on sam have you any idea where we can find him  he asked me the way to stockbridge so i suppose he was going there was the reply  where is stockbridge  its down on the road past the ludding house its about five miles from here  do you suppose the man was going to walk it  i dont know about that you must remember i was in a hurry to catch the train hang the luck i wish i hadnt stopped to talk to that man went on the fat salesman  and im very glad that you did stop to talk to him returned sam he looked at his brother come on tom let us see if we can find blackie crowden     chapter xxii  on the trail   the ludding house was on the side street of the town about three blocks from the hotel at which our friends were stopping when the two rovers arrived there they found the diningroom had just closed and only two men and an elderly woman were in sight  we are looking for a man who was around herei think his name was blackie crowden said sam he is a man who stutters very badly  oh yes i remember that fellow returned one of the men who worked around the hotel he was here for lunch  can you tell me where he is now  no i cannot  that man who stuttered so terribly said something about going to stockbridge put in the woman perhaps he was going there  on foot  i dont think so most likely he took the stage that left about ten minutes ago  was the man alone asked tom  i think he was although i am not sure he came in during the lunch hour and after that i saw him talking to a salesman who had been staying herea man who just went off on the train  you mean a man who went off to catch the train grinned tom he didnt get it and hes as mad as a hornet on that account  the two rovers asked several more questions and found out that the stage which left fernwood twice a day passed through stockbridge on its way to riverview six miles farther on  they used to use horses explained the hotel man but last year jerry lagger got himself an auto so he makes the run pretty quick these days  come on sam lets get one of our autos and follow that stage cried tom and set off on a run for the other hotel quickly followed by his brother they burst in on dick just as the latter was posting the letter which he had written to their father  say that would be great if it was blackie crowden and we could capture him cried dick on hearing what they had to say you get the auto ready while i tell the others where we are going  its a pity stockbridge and riverview are not on our regular tour was sams comment  oh its just as well answered tom we may have lots of trouble with this fellow crowden and it will be just as well if the girls and the ladies are not in it  one of the touring cars was quickly run to the front of the hotel and a moment later dick who had rushed upstairs to explain matters to the others came out and joined his brothers tom was at the wheel and he lost no time in speeding up the car and on they went along the dusty road in the direction of stockbridge  i do hope they catch that fellow and get back mr sandersons money was graces comment as she watched the departure of the touring car out of one of the upper windows of the hotel  whats it all about asked ada waltham who had not been present when dick had burst in on the others she was quickly told and then asked why didnt they take my brother along with them  i dont know i am sure ada answered grace perhaps he wasnt around  he was down in the writingroom with dick  well i am sure i dont know why he isnt with them was the reply  i dont think they are treating chester just right retorted the rich girl rather abruptly and then left the room with her nose tilted high in the air  what a way to act murmured nellie  i am afraid that sooner or later we will have some sort of rupture with the walthams was doras comment she gave a little sigh too bad i should hate to have anything happen to spoil this tour  well i dont think the boys treat chester waltham just right returned grace somewhat coldly they treat him as if he were a strangeran outsider and then she too left the room leaving her sister and dora to gaze at each other questioningly  along the dusty road sped the touring car tom running as rapidly as safety would permit soon fernwood was left far behind and they began to ascend a slight hill  presently they came to a crossroad and here they had to stop to study a muchfaded signboard so as to decide which was the proper road to take even then as they continued their way they were all a little doubtful  that signboard was so twisted it didnt point right down this road was sams comment it would be just like some boys to twist it out of shape just for the fun of sending folks on the wrong road  well i played a joke like that myself once confessed tom  then if we are on the wrong road on account of some boys tricks tom youll simply be getting paid back for what you did returned his older brother  half a mile more was covered and then the road grew rapidly worse tom had slowed down and was just on the point of stopping when a low hissing sound reached the ears of all  goodnight was toms comment  what is it tom a puncture queried sam  oh no its only a gas well trying to find its way to the surface of the ground was the dry comment everybody out and to work  they leaped to the ground and soon saw that sams conjecture was correct a sharp stone had cut into one of the front shoes making a hole about as large in diameter as a slate pencil  might know a thing like this would happen just when we were in a hurry grumbled dick  never mind now is our time to make a record came cheerfully from sam he glanced at his watch four minutes after two come on let us see how quickly we can get that new tire on  all threw off their coats and caps and set to work in the shade of some trees while one jacked up the car another worked to get off the damaged shoe and inner tube in the meanwhile the third got ready another shoe with an inner tube and thus working hand in hand the three got the new tire in place and pumped up in less than ten minutes  while dick and sam were putting away the tools tom walked a bit ahead on the road he looked around a turn and then came back much crestfallen  well im paid back for monkeying with those roadsigns years ago he announced the fellows who fixed that sign some distance behind us have got one on me this is nothing but a woods road and ends in the timber right around the bend  which means that we have got to turn back and take the other road put in sam quickly  thats it some fun turning around here was dicks comment its about as narrow as it was on that road where they were doing the blasting  oh i guess i can make it answered tom and then all got in the car once again  by going ahead and backing half a dozen times tom at last managed to get the touring car headed the other way then he put on speed once more and they raced off to where they had made the false turn  but all this had taken time and as a consequence although they ran along the other highway at a speed of nearly forty miles an hour they saw nothing of the autostage which had gone on ahead  i guess this is stockbridge was dicks comment a little later as they came in sight of a straggling village several buggies and farm wagons were in sight and likewise a couple of cheap automobiles but nothing that looked like a stage  has the autostage from fernwood got in yet questioned sam of a storekeeper who sat in a tilted chair under the wooden awning of his establishment  yes it got in some time ago was the drawledout reply of the storekeeper  then has it gone on to riverview queried dick  reckon it has stranger  do you know if any passengers got off here asked tom  old mrs harrison got off  anybody else  i didnt see anybody elsebut then i wasnt watchin very closely explained the storekeeper  the only other persons in sight besides the storekeeper were two children too small to be questioned about the stage passengers the rovers looked at each other questioningly  might as well go right through and follow that stage said dick if he is on board there is no use of letting him get away if he isnt we can come back here and look for him  the others deemed this good advice and in a moment more they left stockbridge at a rate of speed which made the storekeeper leap up from his comfortable chair to gaze after them in amazement  some of them speeders he murmured to himself if they dont look out theyll be took in for breakin the law  for a mile or more the road outside of stockbridge was fairly good beyond it grew poorer and poorer and tom had to reduce speed once more for fear of another puncture or a blowout as they sped along the highway all the youths kept a sharp lookout for blackie crowden but no one came in sight who answered in the least to the description of that individual  im sure id know him if i saw him said sam who had studied a copy of the mans photograph  so would i answered tom hes got a face that is somewhat unusual and to this dick agreed  on and on they went the road now being little more than a country lane here the dust was about six inches deep and a big cloud floated behind the machine  almost looks as if we were on the wrong road again observed dick but hardly had he spoken when they came out to another crossroad here a signboard pointed to the left and the highway was as good as any they had yet traveled  only one mile more cried sam  it wont take long to cover that answered tom and then turned on the power and in less than two minutes more they were approaching the center of riverview a fairsized town located on the stream which gave it its name  there is the autostage drawn up in front of the hotel announced sam  yes and its empty answered dick  the driver of the autostage was at the town pump getting a drink of water he looked at the three rovers curiously as they confronted him  did i have a passenger that stuttered he repeated in answer to their question i sure did have such a fellow why he stuttered wose than any man i ever heard and he whistled too awful funny why i had all i could do to keep from laughin in his face  we want to find that man very much and right away announced dick will you let us know where you let him off  thats a funny thing mister announced the autostage driver you see after we left stockbridge i didnt have nobody in but that man he paid me the fare to this place before i started then when we was about halfway here i looked around in the back of the stage and by gum he was gone  gone came from the three rovers  yes sir he was gone i looked back and there he stood on the side of the road as soon as he saw that i saw him he waved his hand to me and disappeared     chapter xxiii  back at ashton   the three rovers listened in astonishment to what the autostage driver had to say concerning the sudden disappearance of blackie crowden  then he must have jumped from the stage while you were running remarked dick  thats just what he did do mister and he took some chances too believe me for i wasnt runnin at less than twenty miles an hour  did he have any baggage with him questioned tom  he had a small handbag thats all  would you remember the place where he jumped off came from sam eagerly  yes it was on the road back of herejust before you turn into this highway  you mean the road that was so thick with dust remarked tom  thats the place he jumped off at a spot where the bushes are pretty thick and there are three trees standin close together just back of the bushes  i think i know that place said dick there is a small white cottage on the hillside just behind it  youve struck it answered the stage driver i reckon as how he was goin to call on somebody at the cottage but why he didnt ask me to stop is a mystery why he might have broken a leg gettin off that way  that man is a criminal and he did it to throw you off his track announced sam do you know what i think he continued to his brothers i think blackie crowden must have gotten on to the fact that we were at fernwood and made up his mind to clear out as soon as possible then he got afraid that we might question folks including this stage driver and so jumped from the autostage to throw us off his trail provided we should follow the stage  i guess you have struck the nail on the head sam answered his oldest brother but come on let us see if we can find some trace of him and in less than a minute more they had turned their machine around and were heading for the spot mentioned to them by the stage driver  it was only a short run and soon they halted beside the bushes hedging in three tall trees eagerly they looked around in all directions but not a soul was in sight  im going up to the farmhouse announced sam  and ill go with you added dick tom you stay down here and take a look around if you see anything of him blow the auto horn three times  at the farmhouse the two rovers found themselves confronted by an elderly man and his wife who looked at them rather curiously  no there hasnt been anybody around here so far as i know announced the farmer we havent had a visitor for several days  i was out to the well about five minutes ago put in his wife and if anybody had come up to the house or the barn id have seen him  the fellow we are after is a criminal explained dick so if you dont mind well take a look around for him  a criminal cried the farmer say thats bad certainly look around all you please and i hope if he is anywhere near youll catch him id go around with you myself only i cant very well on account of this rheumatism of mine  the two rovers walked around the cottage and the outbuildings but found not the least trace of blackie crowden then rather crestfallen they returned to the automobile  perhaps theres some mistake and it wasnt crowden at all was sams comment  well it was a man who stuttered anyway and the general description fitted crowden answered his brother  when they reached the automobile they found tom gazing curiously at a piece of newspaper which he had picked up from the ground it was rather crumpled as if it had been used for wrapping purposes  see anything of him tom asked dick  no was the answer but look here do either of you recognize this print he held out the paper which was the lower half of a newspaper page part of this was devoted to reading matter and the rest to advertisements  why sure i know that paper cried dick see that advertisement of the russel department store and that advertisement of betts shoe store thats a part of the knoxbury weekly leader  thats just what it is ejaculated sam where did you get that paper tom  found it right here beside the bushes it looks as if it had been used to wrap something in  then that proves two things announced dick flatly one is that the man who stutters was really blackie crowden for who else could have been here with something wrapped in a knoxbury newspaper and the other thing is that he did as the stage driver saidleft that stage somewhere near here  right you are dick returned his youngest brother but that doesnt answer the questionwhere is he now  i think he got on to the fact that we were in fernwood and that it was his business to get out just as quickly as he could said tom and if that is true it is more than likely that he is a good distance away from here by now and keeping to side roads where he thinks he will not be followed  but what brought him to fernwood in the first place questioned sam  give it up of course he may have friends or relatives here but i dont know how we are going to find out the truth about that and what good will it do us if we do  a half hour was spent in that vicinity the boys tramping up and down the road and through the fields and woods looking for some trace of the missing man then they returned to fernwood  im going down to the postoffice to post our letters announced dick ill see if the postmaster knows anything about crowden  the postmaster of fernwood was a young man and glad enough to give what information he could when he heard what dick had to say  yes that man was here several times he remarked he seemed very anxious to get some letters and he posted several letters himself although whom they were addressed to i dont know  you havent any idea where he was stopping  not the slightest and this was all the postmaster could tell them  no use of our staying here any longer announced tom when the boys had rejoined the others at the hotel i guess crowden just came to this outoftheway place to get and send mail  dont you think hell come back thinking therell be some letters for him questioned his wife  well take care of that was the reply well notify the local authorities and also the postmaster so if crowden turns up again hell be arrested at once and this matter was attended to before they left the town  chester waltham grumbled somewhat because the rovers had not taken him along on the trip to riverview but the three brothers paid little attention to this although sam showed that he was rather anxious because of the way in which grace stood up for the brother of her seminary chum  it had been planned that the tour from valley brook to the west should be taken through ashton so one morning a few days later found the whole party in the old college town  too bad that brill and hope are both closed for the season remarked dora we might have met some of our old friends  well it doesnt make much difference to me grinned back sam it seems like only yesterday since i graduated  i am glad my school days are over announced ada waltham i never did care for studying  before proceeding farther the rovers had decided to call on the sandersons so they went away from the hotel at ashton leaving the walthams behind a letter had been sent ahead to minnie so she was not much surprised at their arrival her appearance however shocked them greatly from looking round and ruddy her face had taken on a pale and careworn look  we are having all sorts of bad luck this year she said in answer to an inquiry of dora and while the boys had gone off to find mr sanderson who was at the barn first came the loss of that money then father was taken sick and now he tells me that the crops this year are not going to be nearly as good as usual  that is certainly too bad minnie said dora sympathetically i wish we could do something to help you she paused for a moment i suppose you hear from songbird occasionally  oh yes he writes to me regularly he is hard at work and last week he sent father a check for one hundred dollars this of course is a good deal of money for the poor fellow to scrape together but it isnt much towards four thousand dollars  it certainly is too bad about the crops not being good said nellie who being the daughter of a farmer knew exactly what such a calamity means to the average man who depends on the soil for his living  father wouldnt mind it so much if it was not for this interest on the mortgage you see he had expected to pay the whole amount off and that of course would stop the interest now he has to pay the usual amount two hundred and forty dollars a year which you see is twenty dollars a month it worries him a good deal  did you say songbird sent him a hundred dollars questioned grace curiously  yes it was money he had earned and some that his folks had given him i am glad to say father didnt think much of accepting it at first added minnie her face brightening a little but poor john urged it so that at last he took it and sent it over to the bank  then i suppose songbird and your father are on fairly good terms now remarked dora  no i am sorry to say that is not true dora at first father seemed to get over it but lately he has been as bitter as ever you see his sickness and the bad crops and the interest money to be paid on the mortgage worry him a great deal and he takes it all out on poor john he sticks to it that john should have been more careful while he was carrying such a large amount minnie turned her face away and two tears stole down her cheeks its a shamean awful burning shame but what in the world am i to do  it surely is too bad minnie said dora kindly placing her arm around the girls waist while nellie and grace looked on sympathetically if we could help you at all we would do it we have some news of blackie crowden and the others have gone out to tell your father about it and then she related what had occurred during the stop at fernwood  oh if only they could find that fellow and get back the money sobbed minnie but maybe the most of it has been spent she added dolefully  oh let us hope not cried nellie he couldnt spend any such amount as that in so short a time  he might if he drank and gambled it away put in her sister oh wouldnt it be too bad if they did catch this blackie crowden and then found that he had squandered all that money     chapter xxiv  at the festival   while dora and her cousins were talking to minnie the others had sought out mr sanderson who was down in the barn superintending the stowing away of some grain the farmer listened with interest to what they had to tell him about blackie crowden but shook his head dolefully  im pretty well satisfied that theyll never get that money back for me now he announced a fellow of that character would use up cash about as fast as he could lay hands on it  well let us live in hopes returned dick not knowing what else to say  the farmer asked them about their tour and said he trusted that they would have a good time then sam ventured to mention songbird  better not talk to me about that young man declared mr sanderson drawing down the corners of his mouth he may mean well enough but hes not my kind and ive told minnie she had better stop having him call and also stop writing to him  oh mr sanderson i think you are doing our chum an injustice cried sam it wasnt his fault that he was robbed of that four thousand dollars  humph thats as how you look at it grumbled the farmer ive said what i think and ill stick to it and nothing that the rovers could say would alter his decision in this matter  oh im so sorry for minnie i really dont know how to express myself were doras words when the party were once more on the way to the ashton hotel if her father compels her to give up songbird it will just about break her heart  i dont believe shes the one to give up songbird answered sam she isnt that kind of girl and he looked at grace but her eyes at that moment were turned in another direction he followed the look and saw that she was gazing at chester waltham who with his sister had driven their car to meet the others  there is one thing about this whole matter that worries me said dick and that is that when they catch this blackie crowdenand i think theyll land on the fellow sooner or latermost of the money may be gone there will be some satisfaction in placing such a rascal behind the bars but that wont give mr sanderson his cash back nor lift that mortgage  weve just got news and we thought we would let you know about it cried ada waltham as the runabout came to a standstill close to the other automobiles there is to be a grand festival at larkinburg this evening and if it is not necessary to stay in ashton tonight we might as well go to that place and attend the festival i received a letter at the ashton postoffice from two girls who used to go to hope and they are to be at the affair and they write that it will be well worth attending  oh yes let us go to larkinburg by all means cried grace i know the two girlsjennie cross and mabel stanford the festival will certainly be well worth while if they say so  let me seehow many miles is it to larkinburg questioned tom  only sixty so we can make the run with ease if we start directly after lunch answered chester waltham  the matter was talked over for a few minutes and as a result it was decided to go ahead and make the town mentioned in ample time to attend the festival  they are going to have a concert and some outdoor tableaux with refreshments said grace ada was telling me all about it  well that will be much better than staying in ashton doing nothing returned dora and besides we must be getting along on our trip dick says we are really a day behind in our schedule  during the stop at the ashton hotel for lunch chester waltham had been very attentive to grace and had asked her if she did not wish to change places with his sister on the run to larkinburg but she had declined offering some excuse which was far from satisfactory to the young millionaire  i thought you were going to put in part of this tour with me he had said rather reproachfully besides if you will come in with me it will give ada a chance to visit with the others  well ill ride with you some time grace had answered i want ada to have as good a time as any of us  the long hours spent on the road had proved rather tiring to mrs stanhope and mrs laning and when larkinburg was reached they were glad enough to rest in a comfortable room which dick engaged for them  you young folks can go to the festival said mrs stanhope with a smile we are going to stay here and go to bed early and so it was arranged  the festival was held in a large grove bordering a beautiful stream and located some distance from the center of the town as soon as our friends had arrived they had called up the two former students of hope and it had been decided that these girls along with their escorts should join the others and all should attend the festival together  we can easily pack the whole crowd in our three cars announced dick  i cant carry any extra people in my runabout complained chester waltham of course one of the fellows might stand on the running board but  well take them dont worry answered sam weve got some vacant seats you know and four extra wont count  the girls from hope were a jolly pair and so were the two young men who accompanied them all got in the rovers machines and away they went followed closely by the waltham runabout a parking space had been set aside and there our friends found themselves surrounded by machines of all sorts and a jolly laughing crowd numbering several thousands of people  oh how pretty burst from graces lips as they strolled toward the place where the concert and the tableaux were to be given  a stage had been constructed among some trees and bushes with a background of the river and here scores of lamps and lanterns twinkled forth the seats were placed along a sloping bank and soon the whole crowd was gathered to listen to the opening number of the concert  as soon as the machines were parked chester waltham almost ignoring his sister had devoted his attention to grace doing this while sam was busy talking over some matters with his brothers waltham had walked over to the seats with grace beside him and now he saw to it that she was placed where he could talk to her with ease this of course did not particularly suit sam but he was helpless in the matter and so made the best of it  the concert was a fine one and the tableaux which were interspersed between the various musical numbers were intensely interesting  certainly well worth attending was toms comment when that portion of the festival came to an end amid a loud clapping of hands  and now for some refreshments announced dick come on let us hurry or the tables may all be filled for some long tables decorated with lanterns had been set under the trees at one side of the grove  my but it is rather chilly here was graces comment when they were moving toward the tables i feel positively cold  didnt you bring your jacket questioned sam  yes but i left it in the auto  ill go and get it he returned and ran off to procure the garment he found that more machines had come in and it was some little while before he could locate their automobile and pick out the jacket  in the meanwhile chester waltham leaving his sister with the other girls from hope had gone on with grace and seated her at one of the tables with the others of the party opposite there was but one vacant seat left next to grace and this the young millionaire appropriated  i dont know what sam will do when he gets here remarked grace anxiously  oh i guess hell find a seat somewhere answered chester waltham coolly  the youngest rover was rather surprised on getting back to find every seat filled and the young millionaire sitting beside the girl who was so dear to his heart but he made no comment he helped grace don the jacket and then stood back until there was a vacant seat at a table some distance away  i think it was rather mean of chester waltham to appropriate that seat whispered nellie to dora while they were being served  i think so myself nellie was the low reply  at last the festival came to an end and all those in the crowd prepared to go home  i hope you enjoyed your refreshments said sam rather coolly as he came up to graces side  why yes i enjoyed them very much answered the girl she looked at him rather pointedly didnt you think the sandwiches and cake and other things were very nice  nice enough he grumbled come on let us get back to the hotel im as tired as a dog and he started to walk away leaving the others to follow him  his words and the manner in which they were spoken rather nettled grace and she walked toward the automobiles in silence with the others in front and behind her but chester waltham remained at her side and as they approached the machines he caught her by the arm  say grace come on and take a ride with me he half whispered its a beautiful night come on you dont want to go back to the hotel yet  but what about ada she questioned  oh she can take your place in one of the other autos cant she  iisuppose so faltered grace she hardly knew how to go on she did not wish particularly to take a ride with waltham and at the same time she was hurt over the way sam had spoken to her  see here sis cried the young millionaire i am going to take miss laning back in my runabout she says you can take her place with the rovers  oh all right chester answered the sister hope you have a nice time of it she added to grace  there was a large crowd down among the automobiles and our friends had all they could do in the semidarkness to get their machines out on the road in safety  where is grace demanded sam as some of the others came up to him he had just turned on the lights of both cars  she is going to ride back with chester answered ada waltham youll have to let me ride back with you and she laughed lightly  oh all right come ahead returned the youngest rover he spoke as lightly as he could he did not wish to let the others know his true feelings there was a strange bitterness in his heart and for the moment he wished that he had never come on this tour     chapter xxv  a call for assistance   ada waltham did all she could to make herself agreeable to sam and the others but the youngest rover was in no mood for raillery and on the way back to larkinburg had but little to say  chester waltham had lost no time in assisting grace into his runabout and in getting his car out of the congestion in the parking space then he put on speed and soon the pair were whirled away out of the sight of the others  its a dandy night for a ride was toms remark there was some moonshine and the stars glittered clear in the heavens overhead  that is true tom answered his wife but dont you think we had better get back to the hotel and go to bed i heard dick say something about a long day of it tomorrow  oh yes nellie well get back it wouldnt be fair to go off and leave mother and mrs stanhope alone  when they reached the hotel at larkinburg the rovers expected to find the waltham runabout in the garage and they were consequently somewhat surprised when they saw no sign of the machine  we certainly couldnt have passed them on the road observed dick he turned to his youngest brother you didnt see them did you  no they went on ahead answered sam shortly and his manner of speech showed that he was thoroughly out of sorts  having placed the touring cars in the care of the garage keeper the rovers joined the others on the piazza of the hotel then dora slipped upstairs to see if her mother and mrs laning were all right she found both of them sleeping soundly and did not disturb them  sam could not content himself with sitting down and so lounged around in one place and another and finally said he would go inside and write a letter to the folks at home he was still writing when tom came in to join him  sam did chester waltham say anything about where he was going to take grace asked tom as he sat down beside his brother  no he didnt say a word to me was the short reply and sam went on writing  did grace say anything  no  tom said nothing for a moment drumming his fingers on the writing table at last he heaved something of a sigh  seems to me if they were going on a long ride they might have said something to us about it he observed nellie is rather worried  oh i guess theyve got a right to take a ride if they want to came rather crossly from sam he finished his letter with a flourish folded it and rammed it into an envelope which he quickly addressed  oh of course but tom did not finish and as sam after stamping his letter arose he did the same i wonder if we had better stay up for them  i think ill go to bed  sam and tom looked sharply at his younger brother  well whats the use of staying up  a whole lot of use sam rover and you know it if i were you i wouldnt let chester waltham ride over me  who says i am letting him ride over me retorted sam and now his manner showed that he was quite angry  i say so answered tom bluntly if you have got half the sand in you that i always thought you had you wouldnt stand for it all of us know how matters were going on between you and grace now to let this fellow step in even if he is a young millionaire is downright foolish if you really care for grace its up to you to go in and take her  yes but suppose that she cares for waltham and his money more than she cares for me asked sam hesitatingly  do you think grace is the kind of a girl to be caught by money sam and now as the two were in a deserted part of the hallway tom took his brother by both arms and held him firmly  nno ii cant say that exactly faltered sam but just the same why does she favor him at all  maybe its because you havent been as outspoken as you ought to be its one thing for a girl to know what you think of her but just the same the average girl wants you to tell her so in plain words now it may not be any of my business but you know that i want you to be happy and that i am unusually interested because of nellie it seems to me if i were you id go to grace the first chance i had and have a clear understanding  ii cant go to her now shes out with waltham stammered sam  then hang around until they get back and see to it that you have a chance to talk with her before she goes to her room returned tom and then as some other people came up the conversation had to come to an end  a half hour passed and ada waltham excused herself chester and grace must be having a fine ride she observed on retiring otherwise they would have returned by this time  maybe they had a breakdown observed dick ive been told that some of the roads around here are far from good  oh dont say that cried the girl chester hates to have to make any repairs when he is alone time and again he has run to a garage on a flat tire rather than put another one on himself  another half hour dragged by and now dora turned to whisper to dick  dont you think we had better retire she asked i never supposed grace was going to stay out as late as this  no well stay up he answered nellie has told tom that she isnt going to bed until her sister gets back so it wont do for us to leave them here on the piazza alone  mr rover telephone call for mr rover came the announcement from a bellboy as he appeared upon the piazza  which mr rover demanded sam eagerly  the party said any of em would do answered the bellboy  ill go said sam eagerly before either of his brothers or their wives could speak  all right sam ill follow in case you want me or any of the others answered tom  the telephone booths were located in the lobby of the hotel and sam was quickly shown to one of them while he talked tom stood by but caught only a few words of what was said  hello  oh is this you sam came over the wire in graces voice im so glad i have been trying to get somebody for the last ten minutes but they couldnt give me the hotel connection  where are you questioned the youth has anything happened for the tone of the girls voice indicated that she was very much agitated  oh sam i want you or some of the others to come and get me cried grace the runabout has broken down and i dont think mr waltham can fix it and we are miles and miles away from larkinburg  a breakdown eh why sure ill come and get you grace where are you  i am at a farmhouse on the road between dennville and corbytownthe akerson place if you come take the road to dennville and then drive toward corbytown well hang a lantern on the stepping block so you will know where to stop  all right grace ill be there just as soon as i can make it answered sam and then he added quickly you werent hurt when the breakdown happened were you  not very much although i was a good deal shaken up mr waltham had his face and his hand scraped by the broken windshield  well you take good care of yourself and ill start right away returned the youngest rover and after a few words more hung up the receiver  it did not take sam long to acquaint the others with what had occurred and then he ran down to the hotel garage to get out one of the touring cars  dont you think i had better go along asked tom chester waltham may be in a fix and need assistance and besides they may both be more hurt than grace said  yes i guess youd better come answered his brother and soon having received directions from the garage keeper as to how to get to dennville the pair were on the way  how did grace seem to be when you spoke to her questioned tom as sam ran the car as rapidly as the semidarkness of the night permitted  she seemed to be all unstrung was sams thoughtful reply  then the accident may have been worse than she admitted sam  i hope not but well soon see and then as a straight stretch of fairly good road appeared before them sam turned on the power and the touring car sped onward faster than ever  inside of half an hour they reached dennville a sleepy little town located in the midst of a number of hills all the houses were dark and the stores closed up and not a soul was in sight they ran into the tiny public square and there found several signboards  here we are cried sam corbytown four miles this way and he pointed with his hand  well look at the other signboards first to see whether there is another road answered his brother but there was only the one and so sam turned the touring car into this and they sped forward once more but now at a reduced rate of speed for the road was decidedly hilly and far from good  what possessed waltham to take such a road as this remarked tom after they had passed a particularly bad spot  dont ask me was the reply its no wonder he had a breakdown if he took this road on high speed  they were going up a long hill at the top a large and wellkept farm spread out and beyond the hill dropped away on a road that was worse than ever  hello theres a light cried tom as they approached the house belonging to the farm  i see it answered his brother and in a few seconds more they ran up to the horseblock and brought the touring car to a standstill sam at the same time sounding the horn  but the summons was unnecessary for their approach had been eagerly looked for by grace and hardly had the machine come to a standstill when she flew out of the farmhouse to meet them  oh im so glad youve come she burst out if you hadnt i dont know what i should have done she was somewhat hysterical and on the verge of tears  are you sure that youre not hurt grace asked sam quickly and as he spoke he caught her by one hand and placed an arm on her shoulder  ii dont think i am hurt sam she faltered and then looked rather tearfully into his face but it was an awful experienceawful and then as he drew a little closer she suddenly burst into a fit of weeping and rested her head on his shoulder     chapter xxvi  sam frees his mind   in spite of his funloving disposition tom rover was a very wise young man so as soon as he saw grace resting on his brothers shoulder he promptly turned away to interview the farmer and his wife who lived in the farmhouse and who had answered the girls knock on their door  i cant tell much about the accident said mr akerson me and my wife were just goin to bed when the young lady knocked on the door and begged us to take her in and then asked if we had a telephone she said she had been in an automobile breakdown but she didnt give us many particulars except to say that she thought the front axle of the machine was broken  well a broken axle is bad enough was toms prompt comment they are lucky that no necks were broken  the poor girl was dreadfully shook up put in mrs akerson she just went on somethin terrible i had all i could do to quiet her at first  didnt the young man come here with her questioned tom  no she said she had left him down on the road with the machine she said he was all worked up over the accident  i should think he would be returned tom and said no more on the subject yet he thought it very strange that chester waltham had not accompanied grace to the farmhouse and thus made certain that help was summoned  tom and his brother had entered the sittingroom of the farmhouse next to it was a litup diningroom and to this sam and grace had walked the latter between her sobs telling of what had happened  oh sam it was dreadful cried grace mr waltham was so reckless i couldnt understand him at all when i said i would ride with him i supposed we were going right back to the hotel but on the way he said it was too fine a night to go in yet and begged me to go a little farther and so finally i consented then he drove the car on and on ever so many miles until we reached dennville  but if you didnt want to go that far grace why didnt you tell him  i didseveral times but he wouldnt listen to me of course i didnt want to act rude and when i told him to turn back he only laughed at me then when we got to dennville and i told him that i positively would not go any farther he said oh yes you will we are going to have a good long ride i am going to make you pay up in full for not riding with me before  the mean fellow murmured sam id like to punch him for that  oh but sam that wasnt the worst of it went on the girl and now she blushed painfully and hung her head then he started up on this side road and he ran the car as fast as ever i was dreadfully scared but he only laughed and told me to enjoy myself and when the car bumped over some stones and i was thrown against him he put his arm around me andand he did his best to kiss me  what  but i didnt allow it i pushed him away and when he laughed at me i told him that if he tried it again i would box his ears then just after we had passed this place he reached over and caught hold of me and tried to pull me toward him then i boxed him just as i had said i would that made him furious and he put on a burst of speed and the next minute there was a terrible bump and a crash and both of us were almost thrown out of the car the windshield was broken and also i think the front axle and he was scratched in several places oh it was awful and again grace hid her face on sams shoulder  well it served him right if he got hurt and if his runabout was ruined was the youths comment he drew grace closer to him than ever then you didnt really care for him he whispered  oh sam sam how can you ask such a question she murmured  because i didnt know i thought you see hehe is a millionaire and  why sam rover do you think that money would make any difference to me and now she raised her face to look him full in the eyes  i am mighty glad to know it hasnt made any difference he returned quickly and then caught and held her tight once more  i suppose you young men are goin back to help the fellow with his busted machine remarked mr akerson to tom  ii suppose so returned tom slowly and then looked toward sam and grace  oh i dont want to go back cried the girl quickly i want to return to the hotel in larkinburg  all right ill take you back grace answered sam if you say so well leave waltham right where he is  i think it would be the right thing to do sam under ordinary circumstances was the reply but then we mustnt forget about ada she will be greatly worried if i come back and let her know that we left her brother out here on the open road with a broken machine  ill tell you what well do grace you stay here and tom and i will go down and see what waltham has got to say for himself he turned to the people of the house she can stay here a little longer cant she well make it all right with you  certainly she can stay answered mr akerson and there wont be anything to pay outside of the telephone toll and thats only twenty cents  please dont stay too long implored grace as the two rovers hurried away  not a minute longer than is necessary returned sam  on the way down the hill to where the accident had occurred sam gave his brother the particulars of the affair not mincing matters so far as it concerned chester waltham  i was thinking that that was about the way it would turn out was toms dry comment with so much money waltham thinks he can do about as he pleases i reckon now sam you are sorry you didnt talk to grace before  i sure am tom was the reply and sams tones showed what a weight had been taken from his heart im going to fix it up with grace before another twentyfour hours pass  thats the way to talk boy go to it i wish you every success and tom clapped his brother on the shoulder affectionately  even though all the lights were out it did not take the two rovers long to locate the disabled runabout which rested among some stones on the side of the highway as grace had stated the windshield was a mass of smashed glass and the front axle had broken close to the left wheel  they can certainly be thankful they didnt break their necks was toms comment as he walked around the wreck  waltham doesnt seem to be anywhere around here returned sam wonder where he went to  both looked up and down the highway and presently saw a figure approaching from down the road it proved to be chester waltham he was capless and walked with a limp  hello who are you challenged the young millionaire and then as he drew closer he added oh the rovers eh did grace get you on the phone  she did answered sam and then added sharply youve made a nice mess of it here havent you  say i dont want any such talk from you blustered the rich young man evidently he was in far from a good humor  ill say what i please waltham without asking your permission continued the youngest rover you had no right to bring miss laning away out here against her wishes it was a contemptible thing to do  you talk as if you were my master retorted chester waltham this isnt any of your affair and you keep out of it  we are perfectly willing to keep out of it if you say so waltham broke in tom we came down here merely to see if we could help you in any way but i see your front axle is broken and you will have to get the garage people to help you out with that  wheres grace asked the young millionaire the subject of the brokendown runabout did not seem to interest him  she is up at the farmhouse on the hill answered tom  and we are going to take her back to the larkinburg hotel in our auto added sam  oh all right then go ahead and do it  do you want to ride with us questioned tom  i dont know that i do ill stay here and take care of my runabout if youll tell my sister that im all right that is all i want  very well just as you say answered tom he took his brother by the arm come on sam there is no use of wasting time here  ill be with you in a minute tom was the younger brothers reply you go on ahead i want to say just a few words more to waltham  no use of your getting into a fight sam returned tom in a low voice  there wont be any fight unless he starts it  tom walked slowly up the road and sam turned back to where chester waltham had settled himself on the mudguard of the brokendown runabout  see here waltham i want to say a few words more to you began sam and his tone of voice was such that the young millionaire leaped at once to his feet i want to warn you about how you treat miss laning in the future  to warn me repeated chester waltham not knowing what else to say  exactly up at the farmhouse she told me all of what took place between you she was all unstrung and quite hysterical now this wont do at all and i want you to know it after this if you are going to travel with us youve got to act the gentleman and treat her like a lady  humph  no humph about it i mean just what i say if you dont behave yourself and dont treat her like a lady illill  well what will you do sneered chester waltham  ill tell you what ill do and now sam shook his finger in the young millionaires face ill give you the soundest thrashing you ever had in your life  ah do you mean to threaten me  i certainly do  when it comes to a thrashing maybe two can play at that game observed the young millionaire but it was plainly to be seen that sams decided stand had disconcerted him  all right waltham ill be ready for you but remember what i said we came out here to have a good time and i am not going to allow you to spoil it for miss laning or for anybody else  humph you make me tired sneered the rich young man go on i dont want to be bothered with you any longer the whole bunch of you is too nambypamby for me i think my sister and i could have a much better time if we werent with you  as far as you personally are concerned you cant leave us any too quickly to suit me returned sam  is that so well i guess you can call it off then so far as my sister and i are concerned but if you think rover that you have seen the last of this affair you are mistaken went on the young millionaire pointedly you think you are going to run things to suit yourself dont you well ill put a spoke in your wheela spoke that you never dreamed of you just wait and see and then chester waltham turned back and sat down once more on his wrecked runabout leaving sam to walk up the road to rejoin tom in a very thoughtful mood     chapter xxvii  a telegram from new york   it was not until the small hours of the morning that the two rovers and grace returned to the hotel in larkinburg they found dick and his wife and nellie anxiously awaiting their return  oh i am so glad that you werent hurt cried nellie as she embraced her sister i was so worried and she hugged her again and again  you can rest assured nellie that ill never go out with chester waltham again never cried grace come on i am going to my room goodnight everybody she called back and in another moment had retired from their view followed by her sister  why sam what does it mean cried dora as she looked on in bewilderment  it means that chester waltham ought to have had a good thrashing declared the youngest rover and then he and tom told of what had occurred  i guess it will be a good job done if we part company with the walthams remarked dick after the subject had been discussed for some time he is not of our class even if he has money  i feel rather sorry for his sister added dora although once in a while she shows the same haughtiness of manner that chester displays its too bad too for they might be really nice company  with so much excitement going on it was small wonder that the rover party did not come downstairs that morning until quite late sam was the first to show himself he being anxious to know how grace had fared  here is a letter for your brother mr rover said the clerk at the desk when sam approached him it was left here by that mr waltham  hand it over returned the youth and then added did mr waltham bring his wrecked runabout to the garage here  no sir he just came here got his sister paid his bill and went off  oh i see sam could not help but show his surprise ill take this letter to my brother he added and hurried off  the communication was a short one yet the rovers and the others read it with interest in it chester waltham said that in consideration of the way he had been treated by some members of the party he considered it advisable for his sister and himself to continue their tour separately he added that he trusted miss laning did not feel any ill effects because of the breakdown on the road  and just to think that ada went off without saying goodbye cried grace when she saw the letter i didnt think she would be quite so mean as that  probably she took her brothers part she usually did returned her sister well i think we are well rid of them  so do i put in tom personally i dont care if we never see them again  he said he was going to put a spoke in our wheel mused sam i wonder if hell dare to do anything to harm us  oh its likely he was talking through his hat returned dick but for once the oldest rover was mistaken  now that our friends were by themselves there seemed to be a general air of relief the only one of the party who was rather quiet was grace but sam did everything he could to make it pleasant for her and before nightfall she was as jolly as ever  the run during that day was through a particularly beautiful section of the country and about one oclock they stopped in a grove and partook of a lunch which had been put up for them at the larkinburg hotel then they moved forward once again with dick and tom at the steering wheels of the cars  still seventythree miles to go if we want to make etoria today announced dick after consulting the guide book im afraid that will be quite a ride for you ladies he added turning to mrs stanhope and mrs laning  oh yes let us go on to etoria by all means pleaded sam  any particular reason for going to that city asked tom quickly  yes ive got a reason but im not going to tell you returned his younger brother and then as both dick and tom looked at him questioningly he blushed and turned away  oh go ahead i think i can stand it said mrs stanhope with a smile  i am getting used to traveling declared mrs laning its much more comfortable than i at first supposed it would be  nightfall found them still ten miles from etoria and dick asked the others if they wished to stop anywhere along the way for supper all declared however that they would rather keep on until the city was reached  they tell me that they have got a dandy hotel theresomething new said sam we ought to get firstclass accommodations there  etoria was a city of some fifty thousand inhabitants with a long main street brightly lighted up the new hotel was opposite a beautiful public park an ideal location sam seemed to be in unusual haste to finish his supper and immediately it was over he asked grace if she would not take a walk with him  we are going to do up the town so dont worry if we get back a little late he told mrs laning and then whispered something in her ear which made her smile and gaze at him fondly  they pursued their way along the main street of the town and while doing so the youngest rover kept his eyes on the various shops that were passed at last they came to a large jewelry establishment and here he brought the girl to a halt  its open he cried thats what i call luck i was afraid they would all be closed  grace looked at the store and at the display of jewelry in the window and then looked at sam  i guess you know what its going to be grace he said rather tenderly and looked her full in the eyes i want you to have just as good a one as dora or nellie  oh sam ii dont understand she stammered  its an engagement ring we are going in here and see what sort of rings this man has got it looks like a reliable place  oh sam and now blushing deeply grace clung to his arm an engagement ring  sure you ought to have had it long ago then maybe we wouldnt have had any trouble  there wasnt any trouble samat least i didnt make any trouble she repeated and then as he caught her arm and dragged her into the shop she murmured oh ii feel so funny to go into a store for a thing like that dont you think i had better wait outside  you can if you want to after the jeweler has measured your finger grace but whats the use of being so backward as soon as we get back home you are going to be mrs sam rover so you might as well get used to such things first as last  fortunately for the young couple it was a very elderly manquite fatherly in appearancewho came to wait on them  a diamond ring he queried why certainly ill be pleased to show everything we have and then he measured graces finger and brought forth several trays of glittering gems  grace would have been satisfied with almost any of the rings but sam was rather critical and insisted upon obtaining a beautiful bluewhite diamond which was almost the counterpart of the stone dick had bestowed upon dora  now youve got to promise to have this engraved by eight oclock tomorrow morning said the youngest rover to the jeweler we are on an automobile tour and we cant wait any longer than that and thereupon the shopkeeper promised that the order should be duly filled  oh sam how extravagant you are murmured grace when the pair were returning to the hotel why that ring cost a dreadful lot of money her eyes were shining like stars  it isnt a bit too good for such a girl as you he declared stoutly and then gave her hand a squeeze that meant a great deal  when they left etoria the next morning sam had the engagement ring tucked safely away in his pocket he had confided in dick and the oldest rover managed it so that that noon they stopped at a large country hotel and obtained the use of a private diningroom this sam had decorated with flowers and just before the meal commenced he slipped the engagement ring upon graces finger  oh sam oh grace shrieked nellie when she saw the sparkling circlet on her sisters finger  oh so thats whats going on is it cried dora joyfully grace allow me to congratulate you and then she kissed the girl and immediately afterward kissed sam numerous other kisses and handshakes followed and for the time being sam and grace were the happiest young people in the world  let us send telegrams home announcing the affair suggested the youngest rover after the meal was at an end i know dad as well as aunt martha and uncle randolph will be glad to hear of it  the telegrams were quickly prepared and sent off in the messages sam notified those at home where the touring party would be for the next ten days  after that several days slipped by quickly the tourists had covered a good many miles and were now approaching the mississippi river the weather had been ideal and not a single puncture or blowout had come to cause them trouble sam and grace were much together and as the youngest rover declared were having the time of their lives  its queer i dont get more word from new york remarked dick one evening when they had reached a city which i shall call pemberton dad acknowledged that telegram of sams but he didnt say a word about that lansing deal or anything about the bruno bonds  well let us hope that no news is good news returned tom anyway im not going to worry until i know there is something to worry about  that evening came word from valley brook stating that everything was going along well at the farm and that mr anderson rover was confining himself closely to business in new york  the mississippi was crossed and then the tourists headed in the direction of colorado springs it was their intention to make the springs the turning point of the trip with a side trip by the cog railway to pikes peak they would return by the way of denver some days later found them in topeka where they had decided to rest up for a day or two during that time only one short telegram had come from mr anderson rover stating that the bruno bonds had been sold at a fair profit but that the lansing deal was still uncertain  we stand to win or lose quite a lot of money on that lansing deal dick explained to sam its rather a peculiar affair the whole thing is being engineered by a wall street syndicate  on the morning of the second day in topeka when sam and grace and some of the others had gone shopping dick heard one of the bellboys call his name  telegram he said to tom i hope this is from dad and that it contains good news  the telegram proved to be what is known as a night letter and its contents caused the two rovers much astonishment the communication ran as follows       have been following up the lansing deal closely affairs are      getting rather clouded and i am afraid we may lose out a new      opposition has appeared a combination headed by your former      friend waltham he is still in the west but his agents are      working against us he has also bought controlling interest in      the haverford deal evidently means to hit us as hard as      possible will know more in a day or two and will let you know      at once of any change in affairs                                           anderson rover     chapter xxviii  cloudburst and flood   i see it cried tom thats the spoke chester waltham told sam he would put in our wheel  i guess you are right returned his older brother evidently waltham is a meaner fellow than i took him to be just because grace would not put up with his ungentlemanly attentions he evidently is going to do what he can to make trouble for us  i dont understand what dad means by the haverford deal went on tom as he studied the telegram i thought that deal was closed long ago  they thought of closing it tom but at the last moment something went wrong and the men who were going into the matter withdrew that put a large part of the burden on our shoulders we have at least forty thousand dollars invested in it now if waltham has bought a controlling interest as dad says he will be able to swing it any way he pleases just as he may be able to swing the lansing deal too  how much money have we got locked up in that the last i heard it was only about eight thousand dollars  when i left dad said he expected to put in another twelve thousand which would make a total of twenty thousand dollars tom  phew then that makes a grand total of sixty thousand dollars in the two deals chester waltham must have a lot of loose money if he can jump into deals as big as those are at a moments notice  oh a young millionaire like waltham can get hold of cash whenever he wants it answered dick he ran his hand through his hair thoughtfully this looks bad to me perhaps i had better take a train back to new york without delay  oh if you did that it would spoil the trip for dora protested his brother  its better to spoil the trip than to let chester waltham get the better of us  why not send a telegram asking if it will do any good for you to come home questioned tom and after a little discussion dick decided to do this and the telegram was sent without delay a few hours later word came back that if dick was needed his father would send for him  the stay in topeka was extended to the best part of a week for that night a furious rainstorm set in which lasted two days the downpour was unusually heavy and as a consequence many of the outlying roads became wellnigh impassable  during the last day of the storm sam received a long letter from songbird in which the wouldbe poet told of how he was working to make his way in the world and also earn some money that he might pay back the amount lost by mr sanderson he added that so far the authorities had been unable to find any further trace of blackie crowden  its too bad was sams comment after he had read this communication poor songbird i suppose he feels as bad as ever over the loss of that money  at last the sun once more broke through the clouds and the journey of the tourists was resumed close to the city the roads were in fairly good condition but farther out they soon found evidences of the tremendous downpour of the days before deep gullies had been cut here and there and occasionally they came across washedout trees and brushwood  well have to take it a bit slowly especially after dark remarked dick  when they passed over some of the rivers they found the rushing waters reached almost to the flooring of the bridges and on the second day out they found one bridge swept completely away so that they had to make a detour of many miles to gain another crossing  what a tremendous loss to some of these farmers remarked mrs laning as they rolled past numerous cornfields where the stalks had been swept down and covered with mud i am glad to say we never had anything like this at cedarville  and we never had anything like it at valley brook either returned dick this is the worst washout i ever saw  at noon they stopped at a small town for dinner and there they heard numerous reports concerning the storm in one place it had taken away a barn and a cowshed and in another it had undermined the foundations of several houses  the water up to hickyville was three feet deep in the street said one man at the hotel the folks had to rescue people by boats and rafts one man had four cows drowned and up at ganey point a man lost all his pigs and two horses  the party had scarcely left that town when it began to rain again the downpour however was for a time so light that they did not think it worth while to stop or to turn back  well put the tops up said tom and maybe in a little while the clouds will blow away  but toms hopes were doomed to disappointment the downpour was comparatively light for about an hour but then just as they were passing through a patch of timber it suddenly came on with great fury  great scott burst out sam as a gust of wind drove the rain under the automobile tops well have to put down the side curtains  right you are answered dick and then the machines were halted and all the curtains were lowered and fastened but even this did not protect them entirely for the wind drove the rain in between the numerous cracks of the covering  how many miles to the next stopping place queried nellie  about thirty answered tom that is if we go as far as we calculated to when we left this morning  oh i dont see how we are going to make thirty miles more in such a storm as this cried her sister  well be lucky to make any kind of stopping place announced dick grimly just listen to that  there was a wild roaring of wind outside and then came a flash of lightning followed by a deafening clap of thunder  oh oh came in a shriek from the girls and involuntarily they placed their hands to their ears  richard do you think it is safe to stay under the trees in such a storm as this questioned mrs stanhope fearfully  before dick could reply to this question there came more lightning and thunder and then a crash in the woods as a big tree was laid low  oh dear listen cried nellie suppose one of the trees should come down on the autos  that is what i was afraid of added her mother i think we had better get out of here  all right if you say so answered dick i was only thinking about the awful wind its going to hit us pretty hard when we get out on the open road  the automobiles had drawn up side by side so that those in one machine could converse with those in the other now dick started up one of the touring cars and was followed a minute later by tom at the wheel of the other automobile  once in the open air those in the machines realized how furiously the wind was blowing and how heavily the rain was descending the automobiles fairly shook and shivered in the blasts and despite their efforts to keep themselves dry all those in the automobiles were speedily drenched the downpour was so heavy that the landscape on all sides was completely blotted out  oh dick what in the world shall we do gasped dora and it was plainly to be seen that she was badly frightened  id turn in somewhere if i only knew where answered her husband trying his best to peer through the rainspattered windshield i dont see anything like a house anywhere around do you  no i cant see a thing  dick was running along cautiously and now of a sudden he put on the brakes just ahead of him had appeared a flood of water and how deep it was there was no telling  listen cried mrs stanhope when the automobile had come to a standstill did i hear somebody calling  scarcely had she spoken when there came another vivid flash of lightning followed by more thunder and then a downpour heavier than ever as the lightning flashed out dick was surprised to see a girl splashing through the water on the road and running toward them  look look he ejaculated unless i am mistaken its ada waltham  it is it is exclaimed dora what in the world is she doing out alone in such a downpour as this  as the girl on the road came closer to the touring car dick threw up one of the curtains opened the door and sprang out to meet her  oh mr rover gasped ada waltham is it really you how fortunate wont you please help me  whats wrong he demanded quickly  chester hes lost  lost where  he tried to cross the river yonder in the storm and the bridge broke and let the automobile down i managed to save myself and jumped ashore but he was carried off by the torrent the rich girl clasped her hands nervously oh please save him mr rover please do  by this time the second automobile had come up and dick waved to tom to stop seeing that something was wrong tom quickly alighted followed by sam  whats wrong came from both of the new arrivals as they gazed at ada waltham in astonishment  miss waltham says her brother is lostthat he has been carried off in the flood of yonder river answered dick  oh please hurry burst out the girl eagerly please hurry or it will be too late i dont think chester can swim  all right well tell the others where we are going and then well do what we can answered dick but if that flood is very strong we may have  dick was unable to finish his speech just then there came more lightning followed by a deafening crash of thunder then the very heavens seemed to open to let down a torrent of water which seemed to fairly engulf them  oh oh oh came from the women and the girls oh what a terrible storm  it is a cloudburst thats what it is gasped sam  youre right ejaculated tom look see how the water in the river is rising its a cloudburst and a flood  tom was rightthere had been a cloudburst but fortunately not directly over the heads of our friends otherwise they might have perished in the terrible downpour which immediately followed the catastrophe had occurred at a point about a mile farther up the river and now the waters from this flood were coming down with great swiftness and rising higher and higher every instant  weve got to get out of here was sams comment already they were standing in water up to their ankles weve got to find higher ground  oh sam sam please dont let my brother drown pleaded ada waltham catching him by the arm  well do what we can to save him ada but weve got to save ourselves first he answered  see there is a little hill ahead came from dick as he did his best to look through the rain which was coming down as heavily as ever let us run to the top of the rise then well be in less danger from the flood if the river gets much higher he turned to the distracted girl come you had better go with us then we will see what we can do for your brother  oh dick dick if you dont hurry well be swept away sure cried dora and then made room so that ada might get in beside her  in a moment more the three rovers had reentered the touring cars and then the machines were sent forward through the water which was now nearly a foot deep on the roadway  oh i never saw such a storm in my life was mrs lanings comment  if only we get out of this alive breathed mrs stanhope being naturally a very nervous woman she was on the verge of a collapse  running with care through the swirling water that covered the roadway they at length reached a rise of ground several feet above the flood here they stopped at the highest point they could gain bringing the machines side by side  when the storm had started in earnest the three rovers had donned their raincoats now with rain caps pulled well down over their heads they once more alighted  if you can show us where your auto went into the river well see if we can locate your brother announced dick to ada waltham maybe he got out and is walking somewhere around here he added by way of encouragement  oh dear im so nervous i can scarcely stand gasped the girl and when she reached the ground they had to support her  splashing along through the water that covered the roadway they slowly progressed until they gained a point where the youths felt it would be impossible for ada waltham to go any farther  there is what is left of the bridge over yonder cried the girl pointing with her hand  the rovers looked in that direction and saw a few sticks of timber sticking out of the swirling waters which were running down stream as turbulently as ever  i dont think there is any use of looking for chester around that bridge was toms remark most likely he was carried down streamhow far there is no telling i think the best thing we can do is to take a look farther down  that is just my opinion returned his older brother i think you had better return to the autos it wont do any good for you to remain out in this storm he continued to the girl  when the party got back to the cars they found a farmer and his grown son standing by the machines  i was just telling the ladies you had better run your automobiles up to my place said the farmer its about ten or fifteen feet higher than this and consequently just so much safer besides the ladies can come into the house  we want to find this young ladys brother he was swept off the bridge yonder returned dick  so the ladies were telling me returned james barlow you come up to the house and ill go out with you weve got a big rowboat that may come in handy say aint this some storm worst letdown ive ever seen in these parts     chapter xxix  the rescue on the river   it did not take long to run the automobiles down the road and up a side lane leading to the farmers house here the ladies got out and then the machines were placed in a barn  you will do all you can to find my brother wailed ada waltham anxiously  yes well do our level best answered dick and tom and sam said practically the same  the rovers consulted with mr barlow and his son james and all five walked down as close to the edge of the river as the effects of the cloudburst would allow they saw bushes trees and parts of buildings coming down the swiftlyflowing stream the waters of which were now thick with mud  here is my rowboat announced the farmer pointing to where the craft was tied fast to a large tree you can use it if you want to but it looks to me like rather a hopeless matter to try to do anything while the river is raging like this you had better wait until it calms down a little  the trouble of it is it may then be too late answered tom he looked at his brothers i think we can manage it he added  the matter was discussed for fully a quarter of an hour and during that time the storm seemed to let up a little the first awful effects of the cloudburst were passing and the water was going down slowly but surely  well try it announced dick at last if we cant manage the rowboat well come ashore farther down the stream  the craft was a substantial one and there were two pairs of oars and to these james barlow added a sweep to be used as a rudder then the three rovers embarked tom and sam to do the rowing and the other brother to guide the craft it was hard dangerous work as they realized as soon as they struck the current of the swollen stream they were sent along pellmell and it was all they could do to keep themselves from crashing into one object or another on the way  look out or youll get upset yelled james barlow to them and then his voice was drowned out in the rushing and roaring of the elements around them  a half hour passedwhich to the rovers just then seemed almost an age during that time the three kept their eyes wide open for a possible sight of chester waltham or anybody else who might have been carried away by the flood  there is somebody suddenly called out dick a man caught in a tree  is it waltham demanded tom quickly  i cant make out he is crouched in a heap on some limbs and is waving frantically for us  not without additional peril did the rovers turn the rowboat across the river for the tree in which the man was crouching was on the shore opposite to that from which they had embarked  hello there are two fellows in the tree announced tom as they drew closer  the second man crouched behind the trunk so that they had not at first been able to see him  help help came from the fellow who had been waving so frantically to them and now as they drew still closer they saw that the individual was chester waltham the young millionaire was capless and coatless and his face and hands were much scratched  were in luck thats sure was toms comment in a low voice  and im glad on his sisters account added sam  when we bring the boat up beside the tree you lower yourself into it waltham directed dick but be careful how you do it or well upset the current here is very swift  yes yes ill be careful answered the young millionaire in a voice which trembled so that he could scarcely speak he was of course much surprised to discover that it was the rovers who had come to his assistance  he was so exhausted that to get out of the tree in safety was all but impossible and finally dick had to assist him while tom and sam did all they could to hold the rowboat in position  its fine of you to come for me panted chester waltham when he found himself safe in the rowboat didid my sisister get you or what  yes she escaped and told us of your plight answered dick briefly  good for ada now get me safe on shore once more and ill pay you handsomely for your trouble  you wont have to pay us a cent waltham was sams quick reply just sit still so that the boat doesnt go over  can i help you in any way  no sit still thats all came from tom sharply the idea of having waltham speak of paying them at such a time disgusted him  in the meantime the second fellow in the tree had moved down a limb or two with the idea of following waltham into the rowboat but now as he looked at the three rovers he suddenly drew back  hi there dont you want to come with us cried dick considerably astonished over the mans actions  to this the individual in the tree made no reply he kept behind the trunk and finally waved a hand as if to motion them away  say is that fellow crazy questioned sam  he must be was toms comment he turned to chester waltham do you know him  no hes a stranger to me i tried to speak to him but he was so scared and cold from the ducking he got he did nothing but chatter so i couldnt understand him  see here its foolish to stay up there called out dick come on down and well take you ashore  ddodont want to gggo came the stutteredout reply ggowheep came in a funny little whistle gggo aaway  well of all the scared fellows commenced tom  great scott i wonder if that fellow can be blackie crowden ejaculated sam  gggo awaway stuttered the man in the tree and then tried to say something more but the words only ended in a strange little whistle  sam do you really think it can be the fellow who robbed songbird demanded dick what would he be doing away out here  why blackie crowden came from denver or colorado springs announced the youngest rover remember we are not so many miles away from those places he raised his voice you come down out of there crowden we know you and we want you  at this command the man in the tree seemed much disturbed he tried to speak but because of his natural stutter and his terror of the situation through which he was passing his effort was a failure  if you dont come down well haul you down ordered dick finally and then after a little more urging the fellow finally consented to come out of the tree and dropped into the rowboat  blackie crowden as sure as fate murmured sam as soon as he got a good look at the fellows features well if this isnt luck  evidently you know this fellow came from chester waltham curiously  we sure do declared sam hes the man who knocked our college chum john powell down on the road near ashton and robbed him of four thousand dollars  i dididnt rrrob any bobody stuttered blackie crowden its all a mimismismistatatake and he ended with his usual queer whistle  well see about that later crowden put in dick sternly now you sit perfectly still or else maybe youll go overboard and be drowned  it would be difficult to describe the joy with which ada waltham greeted her brother on his safe return she flew into his arms and as wet as he was hugged him over and over again  oh i was so afraid youd be drowned chester and then she added quickly how grand it was for the rovers to go to your assistance  it certainly was very fine of them to do it returned the young millionaire and now it must be admitted that he seemed very much disturbed in mind im going to pay them back you see if i dont he added after a thoughtful pause  blackie crowden had done his best to make them believe that he was not guilty of the attack upon songbird but the rovers would not listen to this and put him through such a grilling that finally he broke down and confessed all  i wouldnt have done the deed at all if it hadnt been that i was worried over another matter he said amid much stuttering and whistling i aint a bad man naturally even though i do drink and gamble a little if it hadnt been for a lawyer named belright fogg i would never have robbed the young man  belright fogg came from the rovers  what has that shyster lawyer to do with it added sam  do you know he is a shyster lawyer  we sure do added tom promptly  then you will understand me when i tell you how it was some time ago i was mixed up in a land transaction it is a long story and all i need to tell you is that belright fogg was in it too i did some things that i oughtnt to and that gave fogg a hold on me finally he claimed that i owed him three hundred dollars and he said if i didnt pay up he would make it hot for me and maybe land me in jail that got me scared and i said id get the money somehow  then by accident i saw powell get the money from the bank and i followed him on horseback passed him and took the cash as you know as soon as the deed was done i was sorry for it but then it was too late stuttered blackie crowden and hung his head  and did you go to belright fogg and give him the three hundred dollars queried sam  yes i met him in leadenfield at a road house kept by a frenchman named bissette  then i was right after all cried sam i accused fogg of meeting you but he denied it  well he got the three hundred all right enough stuttered crowden  and how was it you tried to keep out of our sight in that flood asked sam curiously did you know us  i knew yousaw you follow me to the depot at dentonville you thought i got on that train but i didnti took a night freight  i see that is why the authorities didnt spot you  thats it but you were asking about fogg continued blackie crowden speculatively  and did he know you had stolen the money demanded dick sharply  im pretty sure he did although he didnt ask any questions he knew about the robbery and he knew well enough that i didnt have any three hundred dollars of my own to give him  what did you do with the rest of the money crowden i hope you didnt spend it questioned sam anxiously  spend it came in a bitter stutter from the criminal i didnt get any chance to spend it all i had was two hundred dollars  then what became of the other thirtyfive hundred questioned tom  its in a room at the ashton hotel unless somebody found it and stole it  at the ashton hotel cried sam  thats it you see after i met fogg i stopped at ashton for one night and put up at the old hotel on the cheesley turnpike i hid the money in an outoftheway corner of a clothes closet because i didnt want to carry it on my person then when i was on the street i heard that you were on my trail and i got scared and i was afraid to go back to the hotel to get it  can you remember what room it was queried tom  yes it was a back roomnumber twentytwo i put the money in a hole in the wall back of an upper shelf  we had better notify the authorities at ashton of this said tom to his brothers  let us telegraph to songbird and tell him to go to ashton suggested sam if the money is there songbird ought to have the fun of getting it and returning it to mr sanderson  all right lets do it cried dick and so the matter was arranged     chapter xxx  mrs sam roverconclusion   well thats good news and im mighty glad to hear it  it was dick who spoke three days after the incidents recorded in the last chapter our friends had been staying at the farmhouse of mr barlow blackie crowden had been turned over to the local authorities the oldest rover making the charge against him crowden had pleaded for mercy but the boys while sympathizing with him had thought it best to let the law take its course chester waltham and his sister had also remained at the farmhouse which fortunately was a large one so that the whole party was not particularly crowded for room  the rescue of the young millionaire from the river had worked wonders and he was now heartily ashamed of himself not only for the way he had treated grace but also on account of the instructions he had sent to his agents in wall street  you can rest assured mr rover that my opposition to your plans in new york will be withdrawn he said to dick i am going to telegraph to my agents as soon as i get a chance and i want you and your brothers to understand that i appreciate thoroughly your goodness in coming to my rescue it was a splendid thing to do i am not going to insult you by offering you any rewardall i can say is that i thank you from the bottom of my heart and that evening chester waltham and his sister had taken their departure stating that the accident at the bridge had ended their idea of touring farther and that they were going to take the first train they could get for the east  the thing that dick called good news was a long night letter sent over the wires by songbird the former poet of brill had received their message concerning blackie crowden and also belright fogg and had at once hurried to ashton and to the hotel on the cheesley turnpike there in room twentytwo as mentioned by crowden he had found the package containing the thirtyfive hundred dollars next he had called on belright fogg and had scared the shyster lawyer so completely that fogg had returned the three hundred dollars received from crowden with scarcely a protest then the happy youth had driven over to the sanderson place the sandersons had been surprised to see him and amazed to learn that he had recovered so large a portion of the stolen money       as i had already paid mr sanderson one hundred dollars      wrote songbird it made a total of thirtynine hundred      returned to him and he told me that i need not bother about      the other hundred but i paid it just the same for i had just      been fortunate enough to sell six of my poemstwo to a      magazine and four to a weekly paperfor one hundred and sixty      dollars       of course we had a grand time and mr sanderson has forgiven      everything he and minnie think you are mighty smart fellows      and i agree with them minnie and i have fixed matters all up      between us and we are the happiest couple you ever saw i      dont know how to thank you enough for what you have done for      me and all i can add is god bless you every one  good old songbird murmured sam as he read the communication a second time ill wager he feels a hundred per cent better than he did  and to think he sold six of his poems commented tom i shouldnt wonder if he thinks more of that than he does of getting the money back he added somewhat drily  on the following day came another telegram this time from mr rover stating that the opposition of the waltham interests in wall street had been suddenly withdrawn but he added that business matters in the metropolis were becoming more and more arduous for him and he asked when dick expected to get back  im afraid its getting too much for dear old dad was dicks comment on perusing this message i think the best thing i can do is to get back and help him  well if you go back i think ill go back myself said tom anyway this tour seems to have come to a standstill with so much rain  im willing to go back if you fellows say so put in sam  ill wager he and grace want to get ready for their wedding remarked tom slily  thats just what we do returned sam boldly were going to be married early this fall arent we grace and he gazed fondly at the girl who nodded and then turned away to hide her blushes  but the tour did not come to an end as quickly as might have been expected on the day following it was such fair weather that they left the barlow farm and started once more on their trip westward colorado springs was soon gained and passing on to manitou they left the automobiles and took the cog railway to the summit of pikes peak then on the day following they motored up to denver  we can ship our automobiles home by freight said dick and by returning by train we can be back in new york in no time  a week later found the entire party once more in the east while dick and tom settled down to help their father at the offices in wall street the others returned to valley brook and to cedarville to prepare for the coming wedding  and where is it to be sam questioned tom when the brothers were on the point of parting  oh it can only be in one place was sams answer  and i guess i know where that is returned tom with a grin  both dick and tom had been married in the cedarville union church a little stone edifice covered with ivy which was located not a great distance from the homes of the lanings and the stanhopes and also putnam hall as before it was a question if the numerous guests who were expected to the ceremony would be able to get into the building but both grace and sam said they would have to make the best of it  as soon as the wedding invitations were issued the presents began to come in and they were fully as numerous and as costly as had been the gifts bestowed upon dora and upon nellie from mr rover came as was to be expected a bankbook containing an amount written therein which was the duplicate of that he had bestowed upon dick and dora and likewise upon tom and nellie  you can always depend on dad was sams comment his voice choking a little the best dad anybody ever had  indeed you are right answered the bridetobe and im going to love him just as if he were my own father  sams own present to his bride was a gold wristwatch set in diamonds and pearlsa beautiful affair over which the happy girl went wild with delight  at last came the eventful day full of golden sunshine all of the rovers had arrived in cedarville and were quartered at the hotel many other guests were at the stanhope homestead and at the laning farm and still othersformer cadetshad come back not only to attend the wedding but also to take another look at dear old putnam hall  among the old guard who had thus presented themselves were fred garrison larry colby bart conners and harry blossom among those who had attended brill were stanley browne spud jackson bob grimes and of course songbird  im engaged to minnie whispered the latter to the rovers at the first opportunity we are going to be married just as soon as my income will permit and what do you think ive sold four more poemsgot eighty dollars for them and his face beamed as they had never seen it shine before  i congratulate you songbird returned sam heartily i certainly hope you get to be the bestknown poet in the united states  oh i dont know about that i am going to buckle down to business my uncle thinks i am doing wonderfully well and he says if i keep on he is going to give me a substantial increase in salary after the first of the year im going to write verses just as a side issue  as at the other weddings the ceremony was set for high noon soon the guests began to arrive and before long the old church was crowded to its capacity with many standing up in the aisles and in the rear and even at the side windows which were wide open  captain putnam in full uniform and looking a little grayer than ever was there and with him george strong his head assistant with whom sam had always been very friendly there were also numerous girls there who had formerly attended hope seminary and of these one was a flower girl and two were bridesmaids  sams best man was his old putnam hall chum fred garrison while among the ushers were songbird stanley spud bob and some others of his former classmates  presently the organ pealed out and the minister appeared followed a moment later by sam then up the aisle came grace on the arm of mr laning and daintily attired in white with a flowing veil beset with orange blossoms  oh how pretty she looks said more than one and they spoke the truth for grace certainly made a beautiful bride  the ceremony was a brief but solemn one and then as the organ pealed out joyously the happy pair walked forth from the church to enter an automobile which whirled them off to the laning homestead to that place they were followed by a great number of invited guests an elaborate wedding dinner had been prepared and an orchestra from the city had been hired and all sat down to a feast of good things with music  well have to give them a sendoffsame as they gave me said tom to his brother dick while the festivities were at their height theyll be getting ready to go away soon  sure well give them a sendoff returned the oldest brother come on let us get busy  down at the barns an automobile was in readiness to take sam and his bride away on their wedding trip this car dick and tom and a number of others lost no time in decorating with white streamers and a placard which read we are on our wedding trip congratulate us  arent you going to stay to have a dance questioned nellie of her sister a little later  of course answered grace and shortly after that she and sam tripped around to the tuneful measures of a twostep all of the young folks present joined in the older folks looking on with much satisfaction  i can hardly believe it declared old aunt martha as she took off her spectacles to wipe her eyes why it dont seem no time since sam was just a baby  the dancing continued for some time but then of a sudden came a cry from dora  where are sam and grace i dont see them anywhere  they are gone they have given us the slip  no theyve gone upstairs wait here and well give them a shower  the young folks gathered in the hallway and out on the piazza and a few minutes later sam and grace appeared both ready for their tour then came a grand shower of rice and confetti mingled with two or three old shoes and in the midst of this the happy laughing young couple escaped to the automobile which was now drawn up before the door the chauffeur was ready for the start and in an instant more the machine shot down the lane and out into the roadway  goodbye goodbye and good luck to you was the cry  goodbye everybody came back from the touring car and sam and grace stood up to wave their hands to those left behind then the touring car disappeared around a turn of the road and they were gone                                       and now let me add a few words more and thus bring to a close this long series of adventures in which the three rover boys dick tom and sam have played such an important part  a number of years have passed and many changes of importance have occurred mr anderson rover has retired from active participation in the rover company and dick is now the president with tom secretary and sam treasurer the concern is doing remarkably well and all of the rovers are reported to be wealthy the father has returned to the farm at valley brook where he lives in peace and comfort with uncle randolph and aunt martha who despite their years are still in the best of health  a year after sams marriage to grace songbird powell married minnie sanderson the wouldbe poet has made quite a business man of himself and what perhaps is of even greater pleasure to himself has had many of his poems accepted by our leading periodicals  when sam was first married he went to live in an apartment close to those occupied by dick and tom but two years later the three brothers had a chance to buy a beautiful plot of ground on riverside drive facing the noble hudson river and on this they built three beautiful houses adjoining one another  i guess we are in new york to stay was the way the oldest brother had expressed himself and if that is so we may as well make ourselves as comfortable here as possible  before the young folks moved into the new homes dick and dora were blessed with a little son who later on was named john after mr john laning little jack as he was always called by the others was a wonderfully bright and clever lad and a great source of comfort to his parents later still the young couple had a daughter whom they named martha after dicks aunt  tom and nellie had twin boys that were speedily christened andy after mr anderson rover and randy after toms uncle randolph then sam came along with a daughter who was called mary after mrs laning and with a son whom he called fred after his old school chum fred garrison  the young rover boys had a great many qualities similar to those displayed by their fathers little jack was as strong and sturdy as dick had ever been and young fred had many of the peculiarities of sam while andy and randy the twins were the equal of their father tom for creating fun  i dont know what were ever going to do with those kids remarked tom one day after andy and randy had played a big joke on jack and fred some day theyll pull the house down over our ears  well andy and randy are simply chips of the old block laughed dick rover i suppose well all have to do as our folks did with ussend the lads off to some strict boarding school  if i ever do send them off i know where it will be answered tom rover our old putnam hall chum larry colby has opened a firstclass military academy which he calls colby hall if i ever send them away i think ill send them to larry  that wouldnt be a half bad idea put in sam rover larry was always a firstclass fellow and i dont doubt but what he is running a firstclass school  well those boys are too young yet to leave home was dick rovers comment if they are to go to boarding school that must come later  a few years after that jack andy and randy and fred were sent to colby hall and it is possible that some day i may tell you of what happened there to this younger generation of rovers  dick tom and sam were happy and with good reason they had the best of wives and children that they dearly loved and though they worked hard they were surrounded with every comfort every summer and at christmas time they left new york either for valley brook or for cedarville there to receive the warmest of welcomes life looked rosy to all of them and here we will leave them and say goodbye                                   the end     this isnt all       would you like to know what became of the good friends you have      made
