45461033	the past condition of organic nature  lecture ii of vi lectures to working men at the museum of practical geology 1863 on darwins work origin of species   by thomas h huxley     in the lecture which i delivered last monday evening i endeavoured to sketch in a very brief manner but as well as the time at my disposal would permit the present condition of organic nature meaning by that large title simply an indication of the great broad and general principles which are to be discovered by those who look attentively at the phenomena of organic nature as at present displayed the general result of our investigations might be summed up thus we found that the multiplicity of the forms of animal life great as that may be may be reduced to a comparatively few primitive plans or types of construction that a further study of the development of those different forms revealed to us that they were again reducible until we at last brought the infinite diversity of animal and even vegetable life down to the primordial form of a single cell  we found that our analysis of the organic world whether animals or plants showed in the long run that they might both be reduced into and were in fact composed of the same constituents and we saw that the plant obtained the materials constituting its substance by a peculiar combination of matters belonging entirely to the inorganic world that then the animal was constantly appropriating the nitrogenous matters of the plant to its own nourishment and returning them back to the inorganic world in what we spoke of as its waste and that finally when the animal ceased to exist the constituents of its body were dissolved and transmitted to that inorganic world whence they had been at first abstracted thus we saw in both the blade of grass and the horse but the same elements differently combined and arranged we discovered a continual circulation going onthe plant drawing in the elements of inorganic nature and combining them into food for the animal creation the animal borrowing from the plant the matter for its own support giving off during its life products which returned immediately to the inorganic world and that eventually the constituent materials of the whole structure of both animals and plants were thus returned to their original source there was a constant passage from one state of existence to another and a returning back again  lastly when we endeavoured to form some notion of the nature of the forces exercised by living beings we discovered that theyif not capable of being subjected to the same minute analysis as the constituents of those beings themselvesthat they were correlative withthat they were the equivalents of the forces of inorganic naturethat they were in the sense in which the term is now used convertible with them that was our general result  and now leaving the present i must endeavour in the same manner to put before you the facts that are to be discovered in the past history of the living world in the past conditions of organic nature we have tonight to deal with the facts of that historya history involving periods of time before which our mere human records sink into utter insignificancea history the variety and physical magnitude of whose events cannot even be foreshadowed by the history of human life and human phenomenaa history of the most varied and complex character  we must deal with the history then in the first place as we should deal with all other histories the historical student knows that his first business should be to inquire into the validity of his evidence and the nature of the record in which the evidence is contained that he may be able to form a proper estimate of the correctness of the conclusions which have been drawn from that evidence so here we must pass in the first place to the consideration of a matter which may seem foreign to the question under discussion we must dwell upon the nature of the records and the credibility of the evidence they contain we must look to the completeness or incompleteness of those records themselves before we turn to that which they contain and reveal the question of the credibility of the history happily for us will not require much consideration for in this history unlike those of human origin there can be no cavilling no differences as to the reality and truth of the facts of which it is made up the facts state themselves and are laid out clearly before us  but although one of the greatest difficulties of the historical student is cleared out of our path there are other difficultiesdifficulties in rightly interpreting the facts as they are presented to uswhich may be compared with the greatest difficulties of any other kinds of historical study  what is this record of the past history of the globe and what are the questions which are involved in an inquiry into its completeness or incompleteness that record is composed of mud and the question which we have to investigate this evening resolves itself into a question of the formation of mud you may think perhaps that this is a vast stepof almost from the sublime to the ridiculousfrom the contemplation of the history of the past ages of the worlds existence to the consideration of the history of the formation of mud but in nature there is nothing mean and unworthy of attention there is nothing ridiculous or contemptible in any of her works and this inquiry you will soon see i hope takes us to the very root and foundations of our subject  how then is mud formed always with some trifling exception which i need not consider nowalways as the result of the action of water wearing down and disintegrating the surface of the earth and rocks with which it comes in contactpounding and grinding it down and carrying the particles away to places where they cease to be disturbed by this mechanical action and where they can subside and rest for the ocean urged by winds washes as we know a long extent of coast and every wave loaded as it is with particles of sand and gravel as it breaks upon the shore does something towards the disintegrating process and thus slowly but surely the hardest rocks are gradually ground down to a powdery substance and the mud thus formed coarser or finer as the case may be is carried by the rush of the tides or currents till it reaches the comparatively deeper parts of the ocean in which it can sink to the bottom that is to parts where there is a depth of about fourteen or fifteen fathoms a depth at which the water is usually nearly motionless and in which of course the finer particles of this detritus or mud as we call it sinks to the bottom  or again if you take a river rushing down from its mountain sources brawling over the stones and rocks that intersect its path loosening removing and carrying with it in its downward course the pebbles and lighter matters from its banks it crushes and pounds down the rocks and earths in precisely the same way as the wearing action of the sea waves the matters forming the deposit are torn from the mountainside and whirled impetuously into the valley more slowly over the plain thence into the estuary and from the estuary they are swept into the sea the coarser and heavier fragments are obviously deposited first that is as soon as the current begins to lose its force by becoming amalgamated with the stiller depths of the ocean but the finer and lighter particles are carried further on and eventually deposited in a deeper and stiller portion of the ocean  it clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology for it is evident that supposing this which i now sketch to be the sea bottom and supposing this to be a coastline from the washing action of the sea upon the rock wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud the mud will be carried down and at length deposited in the deeper parts of this sea bottom where it will form a layer and then while that first layer is hardening other mud which is coming from the same source will of course be carried to the same place and as it is quite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there it deposits itself above it and forms another layer and in that way you gradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above the other and conveying a record of time  it is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface so that if they were upheaved afterwards and you had a series of these different layers of mud converted into sandstone or limestone as the case might be you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first and that the upper layers were formed afterwards here you see is the first step in the historythese layers of mud give us an idea of time  the whole surface of the earthi speak broadly and leave out minor qualificationsis made up of such layers of mud so hard the majority of them that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone or other varieties of rock and seeing that every part of the crust of the earth is made up in this way you might think that the determination of the chronology the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust is a comparatively simple matter take a broad average ascertain how fast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea or in the estuary of rivers take it to be an inch or two or three inches a year or whatever you may roughly estimate it at then take the total thickness of the whole series of stratified rocks which geologists estimate at twelve or thirteen miles or about seventy thousand feet make a sum in short division divide the total thickness by that of the quantity deposited in one year and the result will of course give you the number of years which the crust has taken to form  truly that looks a very simple process it would be so except for certain difficulties the very first of which is that of finding how rapidly sediments are deposited but the main difficultya difficulty which renders any certain calculations of such a matter out of the questionis this the seabottom on which the deposit takes place is continually shifting  instead of the surface of the earth being that stable fixed thing that it is popularly believed to be being in common parlance the very emblem of fixity itself it is incessantly moving and is in fact as unstable as the surface of the sea except that its undulations are infinitely slower and enormously higher and deeper  now what is the effect of this oscillation take the case to which i have previously referred the finer or coarser sediments that are carried down by the current of the river will only be carried out a certain distance and eventually as we have already seen on reaching the stiller part of the ocean will be deposited at the bottom  let c y fig 4 be the seabottom y d the shore x y the sealevel then the coarser deposit will subside over the region b the finer over a while beyond a there will be no deposit at all and consequently no record will be kept simply because no deposit is going on now suppose that the whole land c d which we have regarded as stationary goes down as it does so both a and b go further out from the shore which will be at y1 x1 y1 being the new sealevel the consequence will be that the layer of mud a being now for the most part further than the force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest debris will of course receive no more deposits and having attained a certain thickness will now grow no thicker  we should be misled in taking the thickness of that layer whenever it may be exposed to our view as a record of time in the manner in which we are now regarding this subject as it would give us only an imperfect and partial record it would seem to represent too short a period of time  illustration fig4  suppose on the other hand that the land c d had gone on rising slowly and graduallysay an inch or two inches in the course of a centurywhat would be the practical effect of that movement why that the sediment a and b which has been already deposited would eventually be brought nearer to the shorelevel and again subjected to the wear and tear of the sea and directly the sea begins to act upon it it would of course soon cut up and carry it away to a greater or less extent to be redeposited further out  well as there is in all probability not one single spot on the whole surface of the earth which has not been up and down in this way a great many times it follows that the thickness of the deposits formed at any particular spot cannot be taken even supposing we had at first obtained correct data as to the rate at which they took place as affording reliable information as to the period of time occupied in its deposit so that you see it is absolutely necessary from these facts seeing that our record entirely consists of accumulations of mud superimposed one on the other seeing in the next place that any particular spots on which accumulations have occurred have been constantly moving up and down and sometimes out of the reach of a deposit and at other times its own deposit broken up and carried away it follows that our record must be in the highest degree imperfect and we have hardly a trace left of thick deposits or any definite knowledge of the area that they occupied in a great many cases and mark this that supposing even that the whole surface of the earth had been accessible to the geologistthat man had had access to every part of the earth and had made sections of the whole and put them all togethereven then his record must of necessity be imperfect  but to how much has man really access if you will look at this map you will see that it represents the proportion of the sea to the earth this coloured part indicates all the dry land and this other portion is the water you will notice at once that the water covers threefifths of the whole surface of the globe and has covered it in the same manner ever since man has kept any record of his own observations to say nothing of the minute period during which he has cultivated geological inquiry so that threefifths of the surface of the earth is shut out from us because it is under the sea let us look at the other twofifths and see what are the countries in which anything that may be termed searching geological inquiry has been carried out a good deal of france germany and great britain and ireland bits of spain of italy and of russia have been examined but of the whole great mass of africa except parts of the southern extremity we know next to nothing little bits of india but of the greater part of the asiatic continent nothing bits of the northern american states and of canada but of the greater part of the continent of north america and in still larger proportion of south america nothing  under these circumstances it follows that even with reference to that kind of imperfect information which we can possess it is only of about the tenthousandth part of the accessible parts of the earth that has been examined properly therefore it is with justice that the most thoughtful of those who are concerned in these inquiries insist continually upon the imperfection of the geological record for i repeat it is absolutely necessary from the nature of things that that record should be of the most fragmentary and imperfect character unfortunately this circumstance has been constantly forgotten men of science like young colts in a fresh pasture are apt to be exhilarated on being turned into a new field of inquiry to go off at a handgallop in total disregard of hedges and ditches losing sight of the real limitation of their inquiries and to forget the extreme imperfection of what is really known geologists have imagined that they could tell us what was going on at all parts of the earths surface during a given epoch they have talked of this deposit being contemporaneous with that deposit until from our little local histories of the changes at limited spots of the earths surface they have constructed a universal history of the globe as full of wonders and portents as any other story of antiquity  but what does this attempt to construct a universal history of the globe imply it implies that we shall not only have a precise knowledge of the events which have occurred at any particular point but that we shall be able to say what events at any one spot took place at the same time with those at other spots  let us see how far that is in the nature of things practicable suppose that here i make a section of the lake of killarney and here the section of another lakethat of loch lomond in scotland for instance the rivers that flow into them are constantly carrying down deposits of mud and beds or strata are being as constantly formed one above the other at the bottom of those lakes now there is not a shadow of doubt that in these two lakes the lower beds are all older than the upperthere is no doubt about that but what does this tell us about the age of any given bed in loch lomond as compared with that of any given bed in the lake of killarney it is indeed obvious that if any two sets of deposits are separated and discontinuous there is absolutely no means whatever given you by the nature of the deposit of saying whether one is much younger or older than the other but you may say as many have said and think that the case is very much altered if the beds which we are comparing are continuous suppose two beds of mud hardened into rocka and bare seen in section fig 5  illustration fig 5  well you say it is admitted that the lowermost bed is always the older very well b therefore is older than a no doubt as a whole it is so or if any parts of the two beds which are in the same vertical line are compared it is so but suppose you take what seems a very natural step further and say that the part a of the bed a is younger than the part b of the bed b is this sound reasoning if you find any record of changes taking place at b did they occur before any events which took place while a was being deposited it looks all very plain sailing indeed to say that they did and yet there is no proof of anything of the kind as the former director of this institution sir h de la beche long ago showed this reasoning may involve an entire fallacy it is extremely possible that a may have been deposited ages before b it is very easy to understand how that can be to return to fig 4 when a and b were deposited they were substantially contemporaneous a being simply the finer deposit and b the coarser of the same detritus or waste of land now suppose that that seabottom goes down as shown in fig 4 so that the first deposit is carried no farther than a forming the bed al and the coarse no farther than b forming the bed b1 the result will be the formation of two continuous beds one of fine sediment a a1 overlapping another of coarse sediment b b1 now suppose the whole seabottom is raised up and a section exposed about the point al no doubt at this spot the upper bed is younger than the lower but we should obviously greatly err if we concluded that the mass of the upper bed at a was younger than the lower bed at b for we have just seen that they are contemporaneous deposits still more should we be in error if we supposed the upper bed at a to be younger than the continuation of the lower bed at bl for a was deposited long before b1 in fine if instead of comparing immediately adjacent parts of two beds one of which lies upon another we compare distant parts it is quite possible that the upper may be any number of years older than the under and the under any number of years younger than the upper  now you must not suppose that i put this before you for the purpose of raising a paradoxical difficulty the fact is that the great mass of deposits have taken place in seabottoms which are gradually sinking and have been formed under the very conditions i am here supposing  do not run away with the notion that this subverts the principle i laid down at first the error lies in extending a principle which is perfectly applicable to deposits in the same vertical line to deposits which are not in that relation to one another  it is in consequence of circumstances of this kind and of others that i might mention to you that our conclusions on and interpretations of the record are really and strictly only valid so long as we confine ourselves to one vertical section i do not mean to tell you that there are no qualifying circumstances so that even in very considerable areas we may safely speak of conformably superimposed beds being older or younger than others at many different points but we can never be quite sure in coming to that conclusion and especially we cannot be sure if there is any break in their continuity or any very great distance between the points to be compared  well now so much for the record itselfso much for its imperfectionsso much for the conditions to be observed in interpreting it and its chronological indications the moment we pass beyond the limits of a vertical linear section  now let us pass from the record to that which it containsfrom the book itself to the writing and the figures on its pages this writing and these figures consist of remains of animals and plants which in the great majority of cases have lived and died in the very spot in which we now find them or at least in the immediate vicinity you must all of you be awareand i referred to the fact in my last lecturethat there are vast numbers of creatures living at the bottom of the sea these creatures like all others sooner or later die and their shells and hard parts lie at the bottom and then the fine mud which is being constantly brought down by rivers and the action of the wear and tear of the sea covers them over and protects them from any further change or alteration and of course as in process of time the mud becomes hardened and solidified the shells of these animals are preserved and firmly imbedded in the limestone or sandstone which is being thus formed you may see in the galleries of the museum up stairs specimens of limestones in which such fossil remains of existing animals are imbedded there are some specimens in which turtles eggs have been imbedded in calcareous sand and before the sun had hatched the young turtles they became covered over with calcareous mud and thus have been preserved and fossilized  not only does this process of imbedding and fossilization occur with marine and other aquatic animals and plants but it affects those land animals and plants which are drifted away to sea or become buried in bogs or morasses and the animals which have been trodden down by their fellows and crushed in the mud at the rivers bank as the herd have come to drink in any of these cases the organisms may be crushed or be mutilated before or after putrefaction in such a manner that perhaps only a part will be left in the form in which it reaches us it is indeed a most remarkable fact that it is quite an exceptional case to find a skeleton of any one of all the thousands of wild land animals that we know are constantly being killed or dying in the course of nature they are preyed on and devoured by other animals or die in places where their bodies are not afterwards protected by mud there are other animals existing in the sea the shells of which form exceedingly large deposits you are probably aware that before the attempt was made to lay the atlantic telegraphic cable the government employed vessels in making a series of very careful observations and soundings of the bottom of the atlantic and although as we must all regret up to the present time that project has not succeeded we have the satisfaction of knowing that it yielded some most remarkable results to science the atlantic ocean had to be sounded right across to depths of several miles in some places and the nature of its bottom was carefully ascertained well now a space of about 1000 miles wide from east to west and i do not exactly know how many from north to south but at any rate 600 or 700 miles was carefully examined and it was found that over the whole of that immense area an excessively fine chalky mud is being deposited and this deposit is entirely made up of animals whose hard parts are deposited in this part of the ocean and are doubtless gradually acquiring solidity and becoming metamorphosed into a chalky limestone thus you see it is quite possible in this way to preserve unmistakable records of animal and vegetable life whenever the seabottom by some of those undulations of the earths crust that i have referred to becomes upheaved and sections or borings are made or pits are dug then we become able to examine the contents and constituents of these ancient seabottoms and find out what manner of animals lived at that period  now it is a very important consideration in its bearing on the completeness of the record to inquire how far the remains contained in these fossiliferous limestones are able to convey anything like an accurate or complete account of the animals which were in existence at the time of its formation upon that point we can form a very clear judgment and one in which there is no possible room for any mistake there are of course a great number of animalssuch as jellyfishes and other animalswithout any hard parts of which we cannot reasonably expect to find any traces whatever there is nothing of them to preserve within a very short time you will have noticed after they are removed from the water they dry up to a mere nothing certainly they are not of a nature to leave any very visible traces of their existence on such bodies as chalk or mud then again look at land animals it is as i have said a very uncommon thing to find a land animal entire after death insects and other carnivorous animals very speedily pull them to pieces putrefaction takes place and so out of the hundreds of thousands that are known to die every year it is the rarest thing in the world to see one imbedded in such a way that its remains would be preserved for a lengthened period not only is this the case but even when animal remains have been safely imbedded certain natural agents may wholly destroy and remove them  almost all the hard parts of animalsthe bones and so onare composed chiefly of phosphate of lime and carbonate of lime some years ago i had to make an inquiry into the nature of some very curious fossils sent to me from the north of scotland fossils are usually hard bony structures that have become imbedded in the way i have described and have gradually acquired the nature and solidity of the body with which they are associated but in this case i had a series of holes in some pieces of rock and nothing else those holes however had a certain definite shape about them and when i got a skilful workman to make castings of the interior of these holes i found that they were the impressions of the joints of a backbone and of the armour of a great reptile twelve or more feet long this great beast had died and got buried in the sand the sand had gradually hardened over the bones but remained porous water had trickled through it and that water being probably charged with a superfluity of carbonic acid had dissolved all the phosphate and carbonate of lime and the bones themselves had thus decayed and entirely disappeared but as the sandstone happened to have consolidated by that time the precise shape of the bones was retained if that sandstone had remained soft a little longer we should have known nothing whatsoever of the existence of the reptile whose bones it had encased  how certain it is that a vast number of animals which have existed at one period on this earth have entirely perished and left no trace whatever of their forms may be proved to you by other considerations there are large tracts of sandstone in various parts of the world in which nobody has yet found anything but footsteps not a bone of any description but an enormous number of traces of footsteps there is no question about them there is a whole valley in connecticut covered with these footsteps and not a single fragment of the animals which made them has yet been found let me mention another case while upon that matter which is even more surprising than those to which i have yet referred there is a limestone formation near oxford at a place called stonesfield which has yielded the remains of certain very interesting mammalian animals and up to this time if i recollect rightly there have been found seven specimens of its lower jaws and not a bit of anything else neither limbbones nor skull or any part whatever not a fragment of the whole system of course it would be preposterous to imagine that the beasts had nothing else but a lower jaw the probability is as dr buckland showed as the result of his observations on dead dogs in the river thames that the lower jaw not being secured by very firm ligaments to the bones of the head and being a weighty affair would easily be knocked off or might drop away from the body as it floated in water in a state of decomposition the jaw would thus be deposited immediately while the rest of the body would float and drift away altogether ultimately reaching the sea and perhaps becoming destroyed the jaw becomes covered up and preserved in the river silt and thus it comes that we have such a curious circumstance as that of the lower jaws in the stonesfield slates so that you see faulty as these layers of stone in the earths crust are defective as they necessarily are as a record the account of contemporaneous vital phenomena presented by them is by the necessity of the case infinitely more defective and fragmentary  it was necessary that i should put all this very strongly before you because otherwise you might have been led to think differently of the completeness of our knowledge by the next facts i shall state to you  the researches of the last threequarters of a century have in truth revealed a wonderful richness of organic life in those rocks certainly not fewer than thirty or forty thousand different species of fossils have been discovered you have no more ground for doubting that these creatures really lived and died at or near the places in which we find them than you have for like scepticism about a shell on the seashore the evidence is as good in the one case as in the other  our next business is to look at the general character of these fossil remains and it is a subject which it will be requisite to consider carefully and the first point for us is to examine how much the extinct flora and fauna as a wholedisregarding altogether the succession of their constituents of which i shall speak afterwardsdiffer from the flora and fauna of the present dayhow far they differ in what we do know about them leaving altogether out of consideration speculations based upon what we do not know  i strongly imagine that if it were not for the peculiar appearance that fossilised animals have any of you might readily walk through a museum which contains fossil remains mixed up with those of the present forms of life and i doubt very much whether your uninstructed eyes would lead you to see any vast or wonderful difference between the two if you looked closely you would notice in the first place a great many things very like animals with which you are acquainted now you would see differences of shape and proportion but on the whole a close similarity  i explained what i meant by orders the other day when i described the animal kingdom as being divided in subkingdoms classes and orders if you divide the animal kingdom into orders you will find that there are about one hundred and twenty the number may vary on one side or the other but this is a fair estimate that is the sum total of the orders of all the animals which we know now and which have been known in past times and left remains behind  now how many of those are absolutely extinct that is to say how many of these orders of animals have lived at a former period of the worlds history but have at present no representatives that is the sense in which i meant to use the word extinct i mean that those animals did live on this earth at one time but have left no one of their kind with us at the present moment so that estimating the number of extinct animals is a sort of way of comparing the past creation as a whole with the present as a whole among the mammalia and birds there are none extinct but when we come to the reptiles there is a most wonderful thing out of the eight orders or thereabouts which you can make among reptiles onehalf are extinct these diagrams of the plesiosaurus the ichthyosaurus the pterodactyle give you a notion of some of these extinct reptiles and here is a cast of the pterodactyle and bones of the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus just as fresh as if it had been recently dug up in a churchyard thus in the reptile class there are no less than half of the orders which are absolutely extinct if we turn to the amphibia there was one extinct order the labyrinthodonts typified by the large salamanderlike beast shown in this diagram  no order of fishes is known to be extinct every fish that we find in the stratato which i have been referringcan be identified and placed in one of the orders which exist at the present day there is not known to be a single ordinal form of insect extinct there are only two orders extinct among the crustacea there is not known to be an extinct order of these creatures the parasitic and other worms but there are two not to say three absolutely extinct orders of this class the echinodermata out of all the orders of the coelenterata and protozoa only one the rugose corals  so that you see out of somewhere about 120 orders of animals taking them altogether you will not at the outside estimate find above ten or a dozen extinct summing up all the orders of animals which have left remains behind them you will not find above ten or a dozen which cannot be arranged with those of the present day that is to say that the difference does not amount to much more than ten per cent and the proportion of extinct orders of plants is still smaller i think that that is a very astounding a most astonishing fact seeing the enormous epochs of time which have elapsed during the constitution of the surface of the earth as it at present exists it is indeed a most astounding thing that the proportion of extinct ordinal types should be so exceedingly small  but now there is another point of view in which we must look at this past creation suppose that we were to sink a vertical pit through the floor beneath us and that i could succeed in making a section right through in the direction of new zealand i should find in each of the different beds through which i passed the remains of animals which i should find in that stratum and not in the others first i should come upon beds of gravel or drift containing the bones of large animals such as the elephant rhinoceros and cave tiger rather curious things to fall across in piccadilly if i should dig lower still i should come upon a bed of what we call the london clay and in this as you will see in our galleries upstairs are found remains of strange cattle remains of turtles palms and large tropical fruits with shellfish such as you see the like of now only in tropical regions if i went below that i should come upon the chalk and there i should find something altogether different the remains of ichthyosauri and pterodactyles and ammonites and so forth  i do not know what mr godwin austin would say comes next but probably rocks containing more ammonites and more ichthyosauri and plesiosauri with a vast number of other things and under that i should meet with yet older rocks containing numbers of strange shells and fishes and in thus passing from the surface to the lowest depths of the earths crust the forms of animal life and vegetable life which i should meet with in the successive beds would looking at them broadly be the more different the further that i went down or in other words inasmuch as we started with the clear principle that in a series of naturallydisposed mud beds the lowest are the oldest we should come to this result that the further we go back in time the more difference exists between the animal and vegetable life of an epoch and that which now exists that was the conclusion to which i wished to bring you at the end of this lecture
