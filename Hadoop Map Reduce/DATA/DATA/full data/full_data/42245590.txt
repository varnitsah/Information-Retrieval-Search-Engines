42245590	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     cupboard love   in the comfortable livingroom at neggets farm half parlour and half kitchen three people sat at tea in the waning light of a november afternoon  conversation which had been brisk had languished somewhat owing to mrs negget glancing at frequent intervals toward the door behind which she was convinced the servant was listening and checking the finest periods and the most startling suggestions with a warning ssh  go on uncle she said after one of these interruptions  i forget where i was said mr martin bodfish shortly  under our bed mr negget reminded him  yes watching said mrs negget eagerly  it was an odd place for an expoliceman especially as a small legacy added to his pension had considerably improved his social position but mr bodfish had himself suggested it in the professional hope that the person who had taken mrs neggets gold brooch might try for further loot  he had indeed suggested baiting the dressingtable with the farmers watch an idea which mr negget had promptly vetoed  i cant help thinking that mrs pottle knows something about it said mrs negget with an indignant glance at her husband  mrs pottle said the farmer rising slowly and taking a seat on the oak settle built in the fireplace has been away from the village for near a fortnit  i didnt say she took it snapped his wife  i said i believe she knows something about it and so i do  shes a horrid woman  look at the way she encouraged her girl looey to run after that young traveller from smithsons  the whole fact of the matter is it isnt your brooch so you dont care  i said began mr negget  i know what you said retorted his wife sharply and i wish youd be quiet and not interrupt uncle  heres my uncle been in the police twentyfive years and you wont let him put a word in edgeways  my way o looking at it said the expoliceman slowly is different to that o the law my idea is an always has been that everybody is guilty until theyve proved their innocence  its a wonderful thing to me said mr negget in a low voice to his pipe as they should come to a house with a retired policeman living in it  looks to me like somebody that aint got much respect for the police  the expoliceman got up from the table and taking a seat on the settle opposite the speaker slowly filled a long clay and took a spill from the fireplace  his pipe lit he turned to his niece and slowly bade her go over the account of her loss once more  i missed it this morning said mrs negget rapidly at ten minutes past twelve oclock by the clock and halfpast five by my watch which wants looking to  id just put the batch of bread into the oven and gone upstairs and opened the box that stands on my drawers to get a lozenge and i missed the brooch  do you keep it in that box  asked the expoliceman slowly  always replied his niece  i at once came down stairs and told emma that the brooch had been stolen  i said that i named no names and didnt wish to think bad of anybody and that if i found the brooch back in the box when i went up stairs again i should forgive whoever took it  and what did emma say  inquired mr bodfish  emma said a lot o things replied mrs negget angrily  im sure by the lot she had to say youd ha thought she was the missis and me the servant  i gave her a months notice at once and she went straight up stairs and sat on her box and cried  sat on her box  repeated the exconstable impressively  oh  thats what i thought said his niece but it wasnt because i got her off at last and searched it through and through  i never saw anything like her clothes in all my life  there was hardly a button or a tape on and as for her stockings  she dont get much time said mr negget slowly  thats right i thought youd speak up for her cried his wife shrilly  look here began mr negget laying his pipe on the seat by his side and rising slowly  keep to the case in hand said the exconstable waving him back to his seat again  now lizzie  i searched her box through and through said his niece but it wasnt there then i came down again and had a rare good cry all to myself  thats the best way for you to have it remarked mr negget feelingly  mrs neggets uncle instinctively motioned his niece to silence and holding his chin in his hand scowled frightfully in the intensity of thought  see a cloo inquired mr negget affably  you ought to be ashamed of yourself george said his wife angrily speaking to uncle when hes looking like that  mr bodfish said nothing it is doubtful whether he even heard these remarks but he drew a huge notebook from his pocket and after vainly trying to point his pencil by suction took a knife from the table and hastily sharpened it  was the brooch there last night  he inquired  it were said mr negget promptly  lizzie made me get up just as the owd clock were striking twelve to get her a lozenge  it seems pretty certain that the brooch went since then mused mr bodfish  it would seem like it to a plain man said mr negget guardedly  i should like to see the box said mr bodfish  mrs negget went up and fetched it and stood eyeing him eagerly as he raised the lid and inspected the contents  it contained only a few lozenges and some bone studs  mr negget helped himself to a lozenge and going back to his seat breathed peppermint  properly speaking that ought not to have been touched said the exconstable regarding him with some severity  eh  said the startled farmer putting his finger to his lips  never mind said the other shaking his head  its too late now  he doesnt care a bit said mrs negget somewhat sadly  he used to keep buttons in that box with the lozenges until one night he gave me one by mistake  yes you may laughim glad you can laugh  mr negget feeling that his mirth was certainly illtimed shook for some time in a noble effort to control himself and despairing at length went into the back place to recover  sounds of blows indicative of emma slapping him on the back did not add to mrs neggets serenity  the point is said the exconstable could anybody have come into your room while you was asleep and taken it  no said mrs negget decisively  im a very poor sleeper and id have woke at once but if a flock of elephants was to come in the room they wouldnt wake george  hed sleep through anything  except her feeling under my piller for her handkerchief corroborated mr negget returning to the sittingroom  mr bodfish waved them to silence and again gave way to deep thought three times he took up his pencil and laying it down again sat and drummed on the table with his fingers  then he arose and with bent head walked slowly round and round the room until he stumbled over a stool  nobody came to the house this morning i suppose  he said at length resuming his seat  only mrs driver said his niece  what time did she come  inquired mr bodfish  here look here  interposed mr negget  ive known mrs driver thirty year amost  what time did she come  repeated the exconstable pitilessly  his niece shook her head  it might have been eleven and again it might have been earlier she replied  i was out when she came  out  almost shouted the other  mrs negget nodded  she was sitting in here when i came back  her uncle looked up and glanced at the door behind which a small staircase led to the room above  what was to prevent mrs driver going up there while you were away  he demanded  i shouldnt like to think that of mrs driver said his niece shaking her head but then in these days one never knows what might happen never  ive given up thinking about it  however when i came back mrs driver was here sitting in that very chair you are sitting in now  mr bodfish pursed up his lips and made another note  then he took a spill from the fireplace and lighting a candle went slowly and carefully up the stairs  he found nothing on them but two caked rims of mud and being too busy to notice mr neggets frantic signalling called his nieces attention to them  what do you think of that  he demanded triumphantly  somebodys been up there said his niece  it isnt emma because she hasnt been outside the house all day and it cant be george because he promised me faithful hed never go up there in his dirty boots  mr negget coughed and approaching the stairs gazed with the eye of a stranger at the relics as mr bodfish hotly rebuked a suggestion of his nieces to sweep them up  seems to me said the consciencestricken mr negget feebly as theyre rather large for a woman  mud cakes said mr bodfish with his most professional manner a small boot would pick up a lot this weather  so it would said mr negget and with brazen effrontery not only met his wifes eye without quailing but actually glanced down at her boots  mr bodfish came back to his chair and ruminated  then he looked up and spoke  it was missed this morning at ten minutes past twelve he said slowly it was there last night  at eleven oclock you came in and found mrs driver sitting in that chair  no the one youre in interrupted his niece  it dont signify said her uncle  nobody else has been near the place and emmas box has been searched  thoroughly searched testified mrs negget  now the point is what did mrs driver come for this morning  resumed the exconstable  did she come  he broke off and eyed with dignified surprise a fine piece of wireless telegraphy between husband and wife  it appeared that mr negget sent off a humorous message with his left eye the right being for some reason closed to which mrs negget replied with a series of frowns and staccato shakes of the head which her husband found easily translatable  under the austere stare of mr bodfish their faces at once regained their wonted calm and the exconstable in a somewhat offended manner resumed his inquiries  mrs driver has been here a good bit lately he remarked slowly  mr neggets eyes watered and his mouth worked piteously  if you cant behave yourself georgebegan began his wife fiercely  what is the matter demanded mr bodfish  im not aware that ive said anything to be laughed at  no more you have uncle retorted his niece only george is such a stupid  hes got an idea in his silly head that mrs driverbut its all nonsense of course  ive merely got a bit of an idea that its a weddingring not a brooch mrs driver is after said the farmer to the perplexed constable  mr bodfish looked from one to the other  but you always keep yours on lizzie dont you  he asked  yes of course replied his niece hurriedly but george has always got such strange ideas  dont take no notice of him  her uncle sat back in his chair his face still wrinkled perplexedly then the wrinkles vanished suddenly chased away by a huge glow and he rose wrathfully and towered over the matchmaking mr negget  how dare you he gasped  mr negget made no reply but in a cowardly fashion jerked his thumb toward his wife  oh george  how can you say so  said the latter  i should never ha thought of it by myself said the farmer but i think theyd make a very nice couple and im sure mrs driver thinks so  the exconstable sat down in wrathful confusion and taking up his notebook again watched over the top of it the silent charges and countercharges of his niece and her husband  if i put my finger on the culprit he asked at length turning to his niece what do you wish done to her  mrs negget regarded him with an expression which contained all the christian virtues rolled into one  nothing she said softly  i only want my brooch back  the exconstable shook his head at this leniency  well do as you please he said slowly  in the first place i want you to ask mrs driver here to tea tomorrowoh i dont mind neggets ridiculous ideaspity he hasnt got something better to think of if shes guilty ill soon find it out  ill play with her like a cat with a mouse  ill make her convict herself  look here said mr negget with sudden vigour  i wont have it i wont have no woman asked here to tea to be got at like that  theres only my friends comes here to tea and if any friend stole anything o mine id be one o the first to hush it up  if they were all like you george said his wife angrily where would the law be  or the police  demanded mr bodfish staring at him  i wont have it  repeated the farmer loudly  im the law here and im the police here  that little tiny bit o dirt was off my boots i dare say  i dont care if it was  very good said mr bodfish turning to his indignant niece if he likes to look at it that way theres nothing more to be said  i only wanted to get your brooch back for you thats all but if hes against it  im against your asking mrs driver here to my house to be got at said the farmer  o course if you can find out who took the brooch and get it back again anyway thats another matter  mr bodfish leaned over the table toward his niece  if i get an opportunity ill search her cottage he said in a low voice  strictly speaking it aint quite a legal thing to do o course but many o the finest pieces of detective work have been done by breaking the law  if shes a kleptomaniac its very likely lying about somewhere in the house  he eyed mr negget closely as though half expecting another outburst but none being forthcoming sat back in his chair again and smoked in silence while mrs negget with a carpetbrush which almost spoke swept the pieces of dried mud from the stairs  mr negget was the last to go to bed that night and finishing his pipe over the dying fire sat for some time in deep thought  he had from the first raised objections to the presence of mr bodfish at the farm but family affection coupled with an idea of testamentary benefits had so wrought with his wife that he had allowed her to have her own way  now he half fancied that he saw a chance of getting rid of him  if he could only enable the widow to catch him searching her house it was highly probable that the exconstable would find the village somewhat too hot to hold him  he gave his right leg a congratulatory slap as he thought of it and knocking the ashes from his pipe went slowly up to bed  he was so amiable next morning that mr bodfish who was trying to explain to mrs negget the difference between theft and kleptomania spoke before him freely  the exconstable defined kleptomania as a sort of amiable weakness found chiefly among the upper circles and cited the case of a lady of title whose love of diamonds combined with great hospitality was a source of much embarrassment to her guests  for the whole of that day mr bodfish hung about in the neighbourhood of the widows cottage but in vain and it would be hard to say whether he or mr negget who had been discreetly shadowing him felt the disappointment most  on the day following however the exconstable from a distant hedge saw a friend of the widows enter the cottage and a little later both ladies emerged and walked up the road  he watched them turn the corner and then with a cautious glance round which failed however to discover mr negget the exconstable strolled casually in the direction of the cottage and approaching it from the rear turned the handle of the door and slipped in  he searched the parlour hastily and then after a glance from the window ventured up stairs  and he was in the thick of his selfimposed task when his graceless nephew by marriage who had met mrs driver and referred pathetically to a raging thirst which he had hoped to have quenched with some of her homebrewed brought the ladies hastily back again  ill go round the back way said the wily negget as they approached the cottage  i just want to have a look at that pig of yours  he reached the back door at the same time as mr bodfish and placing his legs apart held it firmly against the frantic efforts of the exconstable the struggle ceased suddenly and the door opened easily just as mrs driver and her friend appeared in the front room and the farmer with a keen glance at the door of the larder which had just closed took a chair while his hostess drew a glass of beer from the barrel in the kitchen  mr negget drank gratefully and praised the brew  from beer the conversation turned naturally to the police and from the police to the listening mr bodfish who was economizing space by sitting on the bread pan and trembling with agitation  hes a lonely man said negget shaking his head and glancing from the corner of his eye at the door of the larder  in his wildest dreams he had not imagined so choice a position and he resolved to give full play to an idea which suddenly occurred to him  i dare say said mrs driver carelessly conscious that her friend was watching her  and the heart of a little child said negget you wouldnt believe how simple he is  mrs clowes said that it did him credit but speaking for herself she hadnt noticed it  he was talking about you night before last said negget turning to his hostess not that thats anything fresh  he always is talking about you nowadays  the widow coughed confusedly and told him not to be foolish  ask my wife said the farmer impressively they were talking about you for hours  hes a very shy man is my wifes uncle but you should see his face change when your names mentioned  as a matter of fact mr bodfishs face was at that very moment taking on a deeper shade of crimson  everything you do seems to interest him continued the farmer disregarding mrs drivers manifest distress he was asking lizzie about your calling on monday how long you stayed and where you sat and after shed told him im blest if he didnt go and sit in the same chair  this romantic setting to a perfectly casual action on the part of mr bodfish affected the widow visibly but its effect on the exconstable nearly upset the breadpan  but here continued mr negget with another glance at the larder he might go on like that for years  hes a wunnerful shy manbig and gentle and shy  he wanted lizzie to ask you to tea yesterday  now mr negget said the blushing widow  do be quiet  fact replied the farmer solemn fact i assure you  and he asked her whether you were fond of jewellery  i met him twice in the road near here yesterday said mrs clowes suddenly  perhaps he was waiting for you to come out  i dare say replied the farmer  i shouldnt wonder but what hes hanging about somewhere near now unable to tear himself away  mr bodfish wrung his hands and his thoughts reverted instinctively to instances in his memory in which charges of murder had been altered by the direction of a sensible judge to manslaughter  he held his breath for the next words  mr negget drank a little more ale and looked at mrs driver  illustration mrs driver fell rack beore the emerging form of mr bodfish  i wonder whether youve got a morsel of bread and cheese  he said slowly  ive come over that hungry  the widow and mr bodfish rose simultaneously  it required not the brain of a trained detective to know that the cheese was in the larder  the unconscious mrs driver opened the door and then with a wild scream fell back before the emerging form of mr bodfish into the arms of mrs clowes  the glass of mr negget smashed on the floor and the farmer himself with every appearance of astonishment stared at the apparition openmouthed  mrbodfish  he said at length slowly  mr bodfish incapable of speech glared at him ferociously  leave him alone said mrs clowes who was ministering to her friend cant you see the mans upset at frightening her  shes coming round mr bodfish dont be alarmed  very good said the farmer who found his injured relatives gaze somewhat trying  ill go and leave him to explain to mrs driver why he was hidden in her larder  it dont seem a proper thing to me  why you silly man said mrs clowes gleefully as she paused at the door that dont want any explanation  now mr bodfish were giving you your chance  mind you make the most of it and dont be too shy  she walked excitedly up the road with the farmer and bidding him goodbye at the corner went off hastily to spread the news  mr negget walked home soberly and hardly staying long enough to listen to his wifes account of the finding of the brooch between the chest of drawers and the wall went off to spend the evening with a friend and ended by making a night of it
