washingtonhis boyhood   the washington family is of an ancient english stock the genealogy of which has been traced up to the century immediately succeeding the conquest among the knights and barons who served under the count palatine bishop of durham to whom william the conqueror had granted that important see was william de hertburn at that period surnames were commonly derived from castles or estates and de hertburn in 1183 in exchanging the village of hertburn for the manor of wessyngton assumed the name of de wessyngton from this period the family has been traced through successive generations until the name first dropping the de varied from wessyngton to wassington wasshington and finally to washington the head of the family to which our washington immediately belongs sprang from lawrence washington esq of grays inn he was mayor of northampton and received a grant of the manor of sulgrave from henry viii sir william washington of packington was his direct descendant the washingtons were attached to the stuart dynasty lieutcol james washington perished in defence of that cause sir henry washington son of sir william distinguished himself under prince rupert in 1643 at the storming of bristol and still more in 1646 in the defence of worcester against the arms of fairfax we hear little of the washingtons after the death of charles i england during the protectorate was an uncomfortable residence for those who had adhered to the stuarts and many sought refuge in other lands among many who emigrated to the western wilds were john and andrew washington greatgrandsons of the grantee of sulgrave  the brothers arrived in virginia in 1657 and purchased lands in westmoreland county on the northern neck between the potomac and rappahannock rivers john married a miss anna pope of the same county and took up his residence on bridges creek near where it falls into the potomac he became an extensive planter and in process of time a magistrate and member of the house of burgesses having a spark of the old military fire of the family we find him as colonel washington leading the virginia forces in cooperation with those of maryland against a band of seneca indians who were ravaging the settlements along the potomac  the estate continued in the family his grandson augustine the father of our washington was born there in 1694 he was twice married first april 20th 1715 to jane daughter of caleb butler esq of westmoreland county by whom he had four children of whom only two lawrence and augustine survived the years of childhood their mother died november 24th 1728 and was buried in the family vault on the 6th of march 1730 he married in second nuptials mary the daughter of colonel ball a young and beautiful girl said to be the belle of the northern neck by her he had four sons george samuel john augustine and charles and two daughters elizabeth or betty as she was commonly called and mildred who died in infancy  george the eldest the subject of this biography was born on the 22d of february 11th o s 1732 in the homestead on bridges creek this house commanded a view over many miles of the potomac and the opposite shore of maryland not a vestige of it remains two or three decayed fig trees with shrubs and vines linger about the place and here and there a flower grown wild serves to mark where a garden has been such at least was the case a few years since but these may have likewise passed away a stone marks the site of the house and an inscription denotes its being the birthplace of washington  not long after the birth of george his father removed to an estate in stafford county opposite fredericksburg the house stood on a rising ground overlooking a meadow which bordered the rappahannock this was the home of georges boyhood but this like that in which he was born has disappeared  in those days the means of instruction in virginia were limited and it was the custom among the wealthy planters to send their sons to england to complete their education this was done by augustine washington with his eldest son lawrence george as his intellect dawned received the rudiments of education in the best establishment for the purpose that the neighborhood afforded it was what was called in popular parlance an old field schoolhouse humble enough in its pretensions and kept by one of his fathers tenants named hobby the instruction doled out by him must have been the simplest kind reading writing and ciphering perhaps but george had the benefit of mental and moral culture at home from an excellent father when he was about seven or eight years old his brother lawrence returned from england a welleducated and accomplished youth there was a difference of fourteen years in their ages which may have been one cause of the strong attachment which took place between them lawrence looked down with a protecting eye upon the boy whose dawning intelligence and perfect rectitude won his regard while george looked up to his manly and cultivated brother as a model in mind and manners  lawrence washington had something of the old military spirit of the family and circumstances soon called it into action spanish depredations on british commerce had recently provoked reprisals admiral vernon commanderinchief in the west indies had accordingly captured porto bello on the isthmus of darien the spaniards were preparing to revenge the blow the french were fitting out ships to aid them troops were embarked in england for another campaign in the west indies a regiment of four battalions was to be raised in the colonies and sent to join them at jamaica there was a sudden outbreak of military ardor in the province lawrence washington now twentytwo years of age caught the infection he obtained a captains commission in the newlyraised regiment and embarked with it for the west indies in 1740 he served in the joint expeditions of admiral vernon and general wentworth and acquired the friendship and confidence of both of those officers we have here the secret of that martial spirit so often cited of george in his boyish days he had seen his brother fitted out for the wars he had heard by letter and otherwise of the warlike scenes in which he was mingling all his amusements took a military turn he made soldiers of his schoolmates they had their mimic parades reviews and sham fights  lawrence washington returned home in the autumn of 1742 he formed an attachment to anne the eldest daughter of the honorable william fairfax of fairfax comity his addresses were well received and they became engaged their nuptials were delayed by the sudden and untimely death of his father which took place on the 12th of april 1743 after a short but severe attack of gout in the stomach and when but fortynine years of age george had been absent from home on a visit during his fathers illness and just returned in time to receive a parting look of affection  augustine washington left large possessions distributed by will among his children to lawrence the estate on the banks of the potomac with other real property and several shares in ironworks to augustine the second son by the first marriage the old homestead and estate in westmoreland the children by the second marriage were severally well provided for and george when he became of age was to have the house and lands on the rappahannock  in the month of july the marriage of lawrence with miss fairfax took place he now settled himself on his estate on the banks of the potomac to which he gave the name of mount vernon in honor of the admiral augustine took up his abode at the homestead on bridges creek and married anne daughter and coheiress of william aylett esq of westmoreland county  george now eleven years of age and the other children of the second marriage had been left under the guardianship of their mother to whom was intrusted the proceeds of all their property until they should severally come of age she proved herself worthy of the trust endowed with plain direct good sense thorough conscientiousness and prompt decision she governed her family strictly but kindly exacting deference while she inspired affection george being her eldest son was thought to be her favorite yet she never gave him undue preference and the implicit deference exacted from him in childhood continued to be habitually observed by him to the day of her death he inherited from her a high temper and a spirit of command but her early precepts and example taught him to restrain and govern that temper and to square his conduct on the exact principles of equity and justice  having no longer the benefit of a fathers instructions at home and the scope of tuition of hobby being too limited for the growing wants of his pupil george was now sent to reside with augustine washington at bridges creek and enjoy the benefit of a superior school in that neighborhood kept by a mr williams his education however was plain and practical he never attempted the learned languages nor manifested any inclination for rhetoric or belleslettres his object or the object of his friends seems to have been confined to fitting him for ordinary business his manuscript schoolbooks still exist and are models of neatness and accuracy before he was thirteen years of age he had copied into a volume forms for all kinds of mercantile and legal papers bills of exchange notes of hand deeds bonds and the like this early selftuition gave him throughout life a lawyers skill in drafting documents and a merchants exactness in keeping accounts he was a selfdisciplinarian in physical as well as mental matters and practised himself in all kinds of athletic exercises such as running leaping wrestling pitching quoits and tossing bars his frame even in infancy had been large and powerful and he now excelled most of his playmates in contests of agility and strength above all his inherent probity and the principles of justice on which he regulated all his conduct even at this early period of life were soon appreciated by his schoolmates he was referred to as an umpire in their disputes and his decisions were never reversed as he had formerly been military chieftain he was now legislator of the school thus displaying in boyhood a type of the future man     chapter ii washingtons youthfirst surveying expedition   the attachment of lawrence washington to his brother george seems to have acquired additional strength and tenderness on their fathers death he now took a truly paternal interest in his concerns and had him as frequently as possible a guest at mount vernon lawrence had deservedly become a popular and leading personage in the country he was a member of the house of burgesses and adjutantgeneral of the district with the rank of major and a regular salary a frequent sojourn with him brought george into familiar intercourse with the family of his fatherinlaw the hon william fairfax who resided at a beautiful seat called belvoir a few miles below mount vernon and on the same woody ridge bordering the potomac  william fairfax was a man of liberal education and intrinsic worth of an ancient english family in yorkshire he had entered the army at the age of twentyone had served with honor both in the east and west indies and officiated as governor of new providence after having aided in rescuing it from pirates for some years past he had resided in virginia to manage the immense landed estates of his cousin lord fairfax and lived at belvoir in the style of an english country gentleman surrounded by an intelligent and cultivated family of sons and daughters an intimacy with a family like this in which the frankness and simplicity of rural and colonial life were united with european refinement could not but have a beneficial effect in moulding the character and manners of a somewhat homebred schoolboy  other influences were brought to bear on george during his visit at mount vernon his brother lawrence still retained some of his military inclinations fostered no doubt by his post of adjutantgeneral william fairfax as we have shown had been a soldier and in many trying scenes some of lawrences comrades of the provincial regiment who had served with him in the west indies were occasional visitors at mount vernon or a ship of war possibly one of vernons old fleet would anchor in the potomac and its officers be welcome guests at the tables of lawrence and his fatherinlaw thus military scenes on sea and shore would become the topics of conversation we can picture to ourselves george a grave and earnest boy with an expanding intellect and a deepseated passion for enterprise listening to such conversations with a kindling spirit and a growing desire for military life in this way most probably was produced that desire to enter the navy which he evinced when about fourteen years of age the great difficulty was to procure the assent of his mother she was brought however to acquiesce a midshipmans warrant was obtained but at the eleventh hour the mothers heart faltered this was her eldest born a son whose strong and steadfast character promised to be a support to herself and a protection to her other children the thought of his being completely severed from her and exposed to the hardships and perils of a boisterous profession overcame even her resolute mind and at her urgent remonstrances the nautical scheme was given up  to school therefore george returned and continued his studies for nearly two years longer devoting himself especially to mathematics and accomplishing himself in those branches calculated to fit him either for civil or military service among these one of the most important in the actual state of the country was land surveying in this he schooled himself thoroughly using the highest processes of the art making surveys about the neighborhood and keeping regular field books some of which we have examined in which the boundaries and measurements of the fields surveyed were carefully entered and diagrams made with a neatness and exactness as if the whole related to important land transactions instead of being mere school exercises thus in his earliest days there was perseverance and completeness in all his undertakings nothing was left half done or done in a hurried and slovenly manner the habit of mind thus cultivated continued throughout life he took a final leave of school in the autumn of 1747 and went to reside with his brother lawrence at mount vernon here he continued his mathematical studies and his practice in surveying being a favorite of sir william fairfax he was now an occasional inmate of belvoir among the persons at present residing there was thomas lord fairfax cousin of william fairfax and of whose immense landed property the latter was the agent another inmate was george william fairfax about twentytwo years of age the eldest son of the proprietor he had been educated in england and since his return had married a daughter of colonel carey of hampton on james river he had recently brought home his bride and her sister to his fathers house  the merits of washington were known and appreciated by the fairfax family though not quite sixteen years of age he no longer seemed a boy nor was he treated as such tall athletic and manly for his years his early selftraining and the code of conduct he had devised gave a gravity and decision to his conduct his frankness and modesty inspired cordial regard lord fairfax was a staunch foxhunter and kept horses and hounds in the english style the hunting season had arrived the neighborhood abounded with sport but foxhunting in virginia required bold and skilful horsemanship he found washington as bold as himself in the saddle and as eager to follow the hounds he forthwith took him into peculiar favor made him his hunting companion and it was probably under the tuition of this hardriding old nobleman that the youth imbibed that fondness for the chase for which he was afterwards remarked  this foxhunting intercourse was attended with important results his lordships possessions beyond the blue ridge had never been regularly settled nor surveyed lawless intruderssquatters as they were calledwere planting themselves along the finest streams and in the richest valleys and virtually taking possession of the country it was the anxious desire of lord fairfax to have these lands examined surveyed and portioned out into lots preparatory to ejecting these interlopers or bringing them to reasonable terms in washington notwithstanding his youth he beheld one fit for the task the proposition had only to be offered to washington to be eagerly accepted it was the very kind of occupation for which he had been diligently training himself all the preparations required by one of his simple habits were soon made and in the month of march 1748 just after he had completed his sixteenth year washington set out on horseback in company with george william fairfax  their route lay by ashleys gap a pass through the blue ridge that beautiful line of mountains which as yet almost formed the western frontier of inhabited virginia they entered the great valley of virginia where it is about twentyfive miles wide a lovely and temperate region diversified by gentle swells and slopes admirably adapted to cultivation the blue ridge bounds it on one side the north mountain a ridge of the alleghanies on the other while through it flows that bright and abounding river which on account of its surpassing beauty was named by the indians the shenandoahthat is to say the daughter of the stars  the first station of the travellers was at a kind of lodge in the wilderness where the steward or landbailiff of lord halifax resided with such negroes as were required for farming purposes and which washington terms his lordships quarter it was situated not far from the shenandoah and about twelve miles from the site of the present town of winchester in a diary kept with his usual minuteness washington speaks with delight of the beauty of the trees and the richness of the land in the neighborhood and of his riding through a noble grove of sugar maples on the banks of the shenandoah and at the present day the magnificence of the forests which still exist in this favored region justifies his eulogium  his surveys commenced in the lower part of the valley some distance above the junction of the shenandoah with the potomac and extended for many miles along the former river here and there partial clearings had been made by squatters and hardy pioneers and their rude husbandry had produced abundant crops of grain hemp and tobacco more than two weeks were passed by them in the wild mountainous regions of frederick county and about the south branch of the potomac surveying lands and laying out lots camped out the greater part of the time and subsisting on wild turkeys and other game having completed his surveys washington set forth from the south branch of the potomac on his return homeward crossed the mountains to the great cacapehon traversed the shenandoah valley passed through the blue ridge and on the 12th of april found himself once more at mount vernon for his services he received according to his notebook a doubloon per day when actively employed  the manner in which he had acquitted himself in this arduous expedition and his accounts of the country surveyed gave great satisfaction to lord fairfax who shortly afterwards moved across the blue ridge and took up his residence at the place heretofore noted as his quarters here he laid out a manor containing ten thousand acres of arable grazing lands vast meadows and noble forests and projected a spacious manor house giving to the place the name of greenway court  it was probably through the influence of lord fairfax that washington received the appointment of public surveyor this conferred authority on his surveys and entitled them to be recorded in the county offices and so invariably correct have these surveys been found that to this day wherever any of them stand on record they receive implicit credit for three years he continued in this occupation which proved extremely profitable from the vast extent of country to be surveyed and the very limited number of public surveyors it made him acquainted also with the country the nature of the soil in various parts and the value of localities all which proved advantageous to him in his purchases in after years  while thus employed for months at a time surveying the lands beyond the blue ridge he was often an inmate of greenway court the projected manor house was never even commenced on a green knoll overshadowed by trees was a long stone building one story in height with dormerwindows two wooden belfries chimneys studded with swallow and martin coops and a roof sloping down in the old virginia fashion into low projecting eaves that formed a verandah the whole length of the house it was probably the house originally occupied by his steward or land agent but was now devoted to hospitable purposes and the reception of guests  here washington had full opportunity in the proper seasons of indulging his fondness for field sports and once more accompanying his lordship in the chase the conversation of lord fairfax too was full of interest and instruction to an inexperienced youth from his cultivated talents his literary taste and his past intercourse with the best society of europe and its most distinguished authors he had brought books too with him into the wilderness and from washingtons diary we find that during his sojourn here he was diligently reading the history of england and the essays of the spectator three or four years were thus passed by washington the greater part of the time beyond the blue ridge but occasionally with his brother lawrence at mount vernon     chapter iii rival claims of the english and the frenchpreparations for hostilities   during the time of washingtons surveying campaigns among the mountains a grand colonizing scheme had been set on foot destined to enlist him in hardy enterprises and in some degree to shape the course of his future fortunes the treaty of peace concluded at aixlachapelle which had put an end to the general war of europe had left undefined the boundaries between the british and french possessions in america immense regions were still claimed by both nations and each was now eager to forestall the other by getting possession of them and strengthening its claim by occupancy  the most desirable of these regions lay west of the alleghany mountains extending from the lakes to the ohio and embracing the valley of that river and its tributary streams the french claimed all this country quite to the alleghany mountains by the right of discovery in 1673 padre marquette with his companion joliet of quebec both subjects of the crown of france had passed down the mississippi in a canoe quite to the arkansas thereby according to an alleged maxim in the law of nations establishing the right of their sovereign not merely to the river so discovered and its adjacent lands but to all the country drained by its tributary streams of which the ohio was one a claim the ramifications of which might be spread like the meshes of a web over half the continent  to this illimitable claim the english opposed a right derived at second hand from a traditionary indian conquest a treaty they said had been made at lancaster in 1744 between commissioners from pennsylvania maryland and virginia and the iroquois or six nations whereby the latter for four hundred pounds gave up all right and title to the land west of the alleghany mountains even to the mississippi which land according to their traditions had been conquered by their forefathers it is undoubtedly true that such a treaty was made and such a pretended transfer of title did take place under the influence of spirituous liquors but it is equally true that the indians in question did not at the time possess an acre of the land conveyed and that the tribes actually in possession scoffed at their pretensions and claimed the country as their own from time immemorial  such were the shadowy foundations of claims which the two nations were determined to maintain to the uttermost and which ripened into a series of wars ending in a loss to england of a great part of her american possessions and to france of the whole  as yet in the region in question there was not a single white settlement mixed iroquois tribes of delawares shawnees and mingoes had migrated into it early in the century from the french settlements in canada and taken up their abodes about the ohio and its branches the french pretended to hold them under their protection but their allegiance if ever acknowledged had been sapped of late years by the influx of fur traders from pennsylvania these were often rough lawless men generally in the employ of some trader who at the head of his retainers and a string of packhorses would make his way over mountains and through forests to the banks of the ohio establish his headquarters in some indian town and disperse his followers to traffic among the hamlets huntingcamps and wigwams exchanging blankets gaudy colored cloth trinketry powder shot and rum for valuable furs and peltry in this way a lucrative trade with these western tribes was springing up and becoming monopolized by the pennsylvanians  to secure a participation in this trade and to gain a foothold in this desirable region became now the wish of some of the most intelligent and enterprising men of virginia and maryland among whom were lawrence and augustine washington with these views they projected a scheme in connection with john hanbury a wealthy london merchant to obtain a grant of land from the british government for the purpose of forming settlements or colonies beyond the alleghanies government readily countenanced a scheme by which french encroachments might be forestalled and prompt and quiet possession secured of the great ohio valley an association was accordingly chartered in 1749 by the name of the ohio company and five hundred thousand acres of land was granted to it west of the alleghanies between the monongahela and kanawha rivers though part of the land might be taken up north of the ohio should it be deemed expedient the company were to pay no quitrent for ten years but they were to select twofifths of their lands immediately to settle one hundred families upon them within seven years to build a fort at their own expense and maintain a sufficient garrison in it for defence against the indians mr thomas lee president of the council of virginia took the lead in the concerns of the company at the outset and by many has been considered its founder on his death which soon took place lawrence washington had the chief management his enlightened mind and liberal spirit shone forth in his earliest arrangements  before the company had received its charter the french were in the field early in 1749 the marquis de la galisionniere governor of canada despatched celeron de bienville an intelligent officer at the head of three hundred men to the banks of the ohio to make peace as he said between the tribes that had become embroiled with each other during the late war and to renew the french possession of the country celeron de bienville distributed presents among the indians made speeches reminding them of former friendship and warned them not to trade with the english he furthermore nailed leaden plates to trees and buried others in the earth at the confluence of the ohio and its tributaries bearing inscriptions purporting that all the lands on both sides of the rivers to their sources appertained as in foregone times to the crown of france the indians gazed at these mysterious plates with wondering eyes but surmised their purport they mean to steal our country from us murmured they and they determined to seek protection from the english  celeron finding some traders from pennsylvania trafficking among the indians he summoned them to depart and wrote by them to james hamilton governor of pennsylvania telling him the object of his errand to those parts and his surprise at meeting with english traders in a country to which england had no pretensions intimating that in future any intruders of the kind would be rigorously dealt with his letter and a report of his proceedings on the ohio roused the solicitude of the governor and council of pennsylvania for the protection of their indian trade shortly afterwards one hugh crawford who had been trading with the miami tribes on the wabash brought a message from them speaking of the promises and threats with which the french were endeavoring to shake their faith but assuring the governor that their friendship for the english would last while the sun and moon ran round the world  governor hamilton knew the value of indian friendship and suggested to the assembly that it would be better to clinch it with presents and that as soon as possible an envoy accordingly was sent off early in october who was supposed to have great influence among the western tribes this was one george croghan a veteran trader shrewd and sagacious who had been frequently to the ohio country with packhorses and followers and made himself popular among the indians by dispensing presents with a lavish hand he was accompanied by andrew montour a canadian of half indian descent who was to act as interpreter they were provided with a small present for the emergency but were to convoke a meeting of all the tribes at logstown on the ohio early in the ensuing spring to receive an ample present which would be provided by the assembly  it was some time later in the same autumn that the ohio company brought their plans into operation and despatched an agent to explore the lands upon the ohio and its branches as low as the great falls the man chosen for the purpose was christopher gist a hardy pioneer experienced in woodcraft and indian life he was allowed a woodsman or two for the service of the expedition he set out on the 31st of october crossed the ridges of the alleghany arrived at shannopin a delaware village on the alleghany swam his horses across that river and descending along its valley arrived at logstown an important indian village a little below the site of the present city of pittsburg here usually resided tanacharisson a seneca chief of great note being head sachem of the mixed tribes which had migrated to the ohio and its branches he was generally surnamed the halfking being subordinate to the iroquois confederacy the chief was absent at this time as were most of his people it being the hunting season george croghan the envoy from pennsylvania with montour his interpreter had passed through logstown a week previously on his way to the twightwees and other tribes on the miami branch of the ohio scarce any one was to be seen about the village but some of croghans rough people whom he had left behindreprobate indian traders as gist terms them he took his departure from logstown and at beaver creek a few miles below the village he left the river and struck into the interior of the present state of ohio here he overtook george croghan at muskingum a town of wyandots and mingoes he had ordered all the traders in his employ who were scattered among the indian villages to rally at this town where he had hoisted the english flag over his residence and over that of the sachem this was in consequence of the hostility of the french who had recently captured in the neighborhood three white men in the employ of frazier an indian trader and had carried them away prisoners to canada  gist was well received by the people of muskingum they were indignant at the french violation of their territories and the capture of their english brothers they had not forgotten the conduct of celeron de bienville in the previous year and the mysterious plates which he had nailed against trees and sunk in the ground a council of the nation was now held in which gist invited them in the name of the governor of virginia to visit that province where a large present of goods awaited them sent by their father the great king over the water to his ohio children the invitation was graciously received but no answer could be given until a grand council of the western tribes had been held which was to take place at logstown in the ensuing spring  similar results attended visits made by gist and croghan to the delawares and the shawnees at their villages about the scioto river all promised to be at the gathering at logstown from the shawnee village near the mouth of the scioto the two emissaries shaped their course north two hundred miles crossed the great moneami or miami river on a raft swimming their horses and on the 17th of february arrived at piqua the principal town of the twightwees or miamis the most powerful confederacy of the west combining four tribes and extending its influence even beyond the mississippi a king or sachem of one or other of the different tribes presided over the whole the head chief at present was the king of the piankeshas at this town croghan formed a treaty of alliance in the name of the governor of pennsylvania with two of the miami tribes and gist was promised by the king of the piankeshas that the chiefs of the various tribes would attend the meeting at logstown to make a treaty with virginia in the height of these demonstrations of friendship two envoys from the french governor of canada entered the councilhouse and sought a renewal of the ancient alliance but the piankesha chief turned his back upon the ambassadors and left the councilhouse  when gist returned to the shawnee town near the mouth of the scioto and reported to his indian friends there the alliance he had formed with the miami confederacy there was great feasting and speechmaking and firing of guns he had now happily accomplished the chief object of his missionnothing remained but to descend the ohio to the great falls this however he was cautioned not to do a large party of indians allies of the french were hunting in that neighborhood who might kill or capture him he crossed the river attended only by a lad as a travelling companion and aide and proceeded cautiously down the east side until within fifteen miles of the falls here he came upon traps newly set and indian footprints not a day old and heard the distant report of guns the story of indian hunters then was true abandoning all idea therefore of visiting the falls and contenting himself with the information concerning them which he had received from others he shaped his course homeward  while gist had been making his painful way homeward the two ottawa ambassadors had returned to fort sandusky bringing word to the french that their friendship had been rejected and their hostility defied by the miamis they informed them also of the gathering of the western tribes that was to take place at logstown to conclude a treaty with the virginians  it was a great object with the french to prevent this treaty and to spirit up the ohio indians against the english this they hoped to effect through the agency of one captain joncaire a veteran of the wilderness who had grown gray in indian diplomacy and was now sent to maintain french sovereignty over the valley of the ohio he appeared at logstown accompanied by another frenchman and forty iroquois warriors he found an assemblage of the western tribes feasting and rejoicing and firing off guns for george croghan and montour the interpreter were there and had been distributing presents on behalf of the governor of pennsylvania  joncaire was said to have the wit of a frenchman and the eloquence of an iroquois he made an animated speech to the chiefs in their own tongue the gist of which was that their father onontio that is to say the governor of canada desired his children of the ohio to turn away the indian traders and never to deal with them again on pain of his displeasure so saying he laid down a wampum belt of uncommon size by way of emphasis to his message for once his eloquence was of no avail a chief rose indignantly shook his finger in his face and stamping on the ground this is our land said he what right has onontio here the english are our brothers they shall live among us as long as one of us is alive we will trade with them and not with you and so saying he rejected the belt of wampum  joncaire returned to an advanced post recently established on the upper part of the river whence he wrote to the governor of pennsylvania the marquis de la jonquiere governor of new france having ordered me to watch that the english make no treaty in the ohio country i have signified to the traders of your government to retire you are not ignorant that all these lands belong to the king of france and that the english have no right to trade in them he concluded by reiterating the threat made two years previously by celeron de bienville against all intruding fur traders in the meantime in the face of all these protests and menaces mr gist under sanction of the virginia legislature proceeded in the same year to survey the lands within the grant of the ohio company lying on the south side of the ohio river as far down as the great kanawha  the french now prepared for hostile contingencies they launched an armed vessel of unusual size on lake ontario fortified their tradinghouse at niagara strengthened their outposts and advanced others on the upper waters of the ohio a stir of warlike preparation was likewise to be observed among the british colonies it was evident that the adverse claims to the disputed territories if pushed home could only be settled by the stern arbitrament of the sword  in virginia especially the war spirit was manifest the province was divided into military districts each having an adjutantgeneral with the rank of major and the pay of one hundred and fifty pounds a year whose duty was to attend to the organization and equipment of the militia such an appointment was sought by lawrence washington for his brother george who set about preparing himself with his usual method and assiduity for his new duties virginia had among its floating population some military relics of the late spanish war among these was a certain adjutant muse a westmoreland volunteer who had served with lawrence washington in the campaigns in the west indies he now undertook to instruct his brother george in the art of war lent him treatises on military tactics put him through the manual exercise and gave him some idea of evolutions in the field another of lawrences campaigning comrades was jacob van braam a dutchman by birth who had been in the british army but was now out of service and professing to be a complete master of fence recruited his slender purse in this time of military excitement by giving the virginian youth lessons in the sword exercise under the instructions of these veterans mount vernon from being a quiet rural retreat was suddenly transformed into a school of arms  washingtons martial studies however were interrupted for a time by the critical state of his brothers health the constitution of lawrence had always been delicate and he had been obliged repeatedly to travel for a change of air there were now pulmonary symptoms of a threatening nature and by advice of his physicians he determined to pass a winter in the west indies taking with him his favorite brother george as a companion they accordingly sailed for barbadoes on the 28th of september 1751 george kept a journal of the voyage with logbook brevity recording the wind and weather but no events worth citation they landed at barbadoes on the 3d of november the resident physician of the place gave a favorable report of lawrences case and held out hopes of a cure  the brothers had scarcely been a fortnight at the island when george was taken down by a severe attack of smallpox skilful medical treatment with the kind attentions of friends and especially of his brother restored him to health in about three weeks but his face always remained slightly marked  the residence at barbadoes failed to have the anticipated effect on the health of lawrence and he determined to seek the sweet climate of bermuda in the spring he felt the absence from his wife and it was arranged that george should return to virginia and bring her out to meet him at that island accordingly on the 22d of december george set sail in the industry bound to virginia where he arrived on the 1st of february 1752 after five weeks of stormy winter seafaring  lawrence remained through the winter at barbadoes but the very mildness of the climate relaxed and enervated him he felt the want of the bracing winter weather to which he had been accustomed even the invariable beauty of the climate the perpetual summer wearied the restless invalid still some of the worst symptoms of his disorder had disappeared and he seemed to be slowly recovering but the nervous restlessness and desire of change often incidental to his malady had taken hold of him and early in march he hastened to bermuda he had come too soon the keen air of early spring brought on an aggravated return of his worst symptoms he was now afflicted with painful indecision and his letters perplexed his family leaving them uncertain as to his movements and at a loss how to act at one time he talked of remaining at bermuda the next letter written shortly afterwards in a moment of despondency talks of the possibility of hurrying home to his grave the last was no empty foreboding he did indeed hasten back and just reached mount vernon in time to die under his own roof his death took place on the 26th of july 1752 when but thirtyfour years of age  lawrence left a wife and an infant daughter to inherit his ample estates in case his daughter should die without issue the estate of mount vernon and other lands specified in his will were to be enjoyed by her mother during her lifetime and at her death to be inherited by his brother george the latter was appointed one of the executors of the will but such was the implicit confidence reposed in his judgment and integrity that although he was but twenty years of age the management of the affairs of the deceased was soon devolved upon him almost entirely     chapter iv washingtons mission to the french commander   the meeting of the ohio tribes delawares shawnees and mingoes to form a treaty of alliance with virginia took place at logstown at the appointed time the chiefs of the six nations declined to attend colonel fry and two other commissioners from virginia concluded a treaty with the tribes above named by which the latter engaged not to molest any english settlers south of the ohio tanacharisson the halfking now advised that his brothers of virginia should build a strong house at the fork of the monongahela to resist the designs of the french mr gist was accordingly instructed to lay out a town and build a fort at chartiers creek on the east side of the ohio a little below the site of the present city of pittsburg he commenced a settlement also in a valley just beyond laurel hill not far from the youghiogeny and prevailed on eleven families to join him the ohio company about the same time established a tradingpost well stocked with english goods at wills creek now the town of cumberland  the ohio tribes were greatly incensed at the aggressions of the french who were erecting posts within their territories and sent deputations to remonstrate but without effect there were reports that the french were ascending the mississippi from louisiana france it was said intended to connect louisiana and canada by a chain of military posts and hem the english within the alleghany mountains  the ohio company complained loudly to the lieutenantgovernor of virginia the hon robert dinwiddie of the hostile conduct of the french and their indian allies they found in dinwiddie a ready listener he was a stockholder in the company a commissioner captain william trent was sent to expostulate with the french commander on the ohio for his aggressions on the territory of his brittanic majesty he bore presents also of guns powder shot and clothing for the friendly indians trent was not a man of the true spirit for a mission to the frontier he stopped a short time at logstown though the french were one hundred and fifty miles further up the river and directed his course to piqua the great town of the twightwees where gist and croghan had been so well received by the miamis all now was reversed the place had been attacked by the french and indians the miamis defeated with great loss the english traders taken prisoners the piankesha chief who had so proudly turned his back upon the ottawa ambassadors had been sacrificed by the hostile savages and the french flag hoisted in triumph on the ruins of the town the whole aspect of affairs was so threatening on the frontier that trent lost heart and returned home without accomplishing his errand  governor dinwiddie now looked round for a person more fitted to fulfil a mission which required physical strength and moral energy a courage to cope with savages and a sagacity to negotiate with white men washington was pointed out as possessed of those requisites it is true he was not yet twentytwo years of age but public confidence in his judgment and abilities had been manifested by renewing his appointment of adjutantgeneral and assigning him the northern division he was accordingly chosen for the expedition  by his letter of instructions he was directed to repair to logstown and hold a communication with tanacharisson monacatoocha alias scarooyadi the next in command and the other sachems of the mixed tribes friendly to the english inform them of the purport of his errand and request an escort to the headquarters of the french commander to that commander he was to deliver his credentials and the letter of governor dinwiddie and demand an answer in the name of his brittanic majesty but not to wait for it beyond a week on receiving it he was to request a sufficient escort to protect him on his return he was moreover to acquaint himself with the numbers and force of the french stationed on the ohio and in its vicinity their capability of being reinforced from canada the forts they had erected where situated how garrisoned the object of their advancing into those parts and how they were likely to be supported washington set off from williamsburg on the 30th of october 1753 the very day on which he received his credentials at fredericksburg he engaged his old master of fence jacob van braam to accompany him as interpreter  having provided himself at alexandria with necessaries for the journey he proceeded to winchester then on the frontier where he procured horses tents and other travelling equipments and then pushed on by a road newly opened to wills creek where he arrived on the 14th of november here he met with mr gist the intrepid pioneer whom he engaged to accompany and pilot him in the present expedition he secured the services also of one john davidson as indian interpreter and of four frontiersmen with this little band he set forth on the 15th of november through a wild country rendered almost impassable by recent storms of rain and snow  as the rivers were all swollen so that the horses had to swim them washington sent all the baggage down the monongahela in a canoe under care of two of the men who had orders to meet him at the confluence of that river with the alleghany where their united waters form the ohio as i got down before the canoe writes he in his journal i spent some time in viewing the rivers and the land at the fork which i think extremely well situated for a fort as it has the absolute command of both rivers the ohio company had intended to build a fort about two miles from this place on the southeast side of the river but washington gave the fork the decided preference french engineers of experience proved the accuracy of his military eye by subsequently choosing it for the site of fort duquesne noted in frontier history  in this neighborhood lived shingiss the king or chief sachem of the delawares washington visited him at his village to invite him to the council at logstown he was one of the greatest warriors of his tribe and subsequently took up the hatchet at various times against the english though now he seemed favorably disposed and readily accepted the invitation  they arrived at logstown after sunset on the 24th of november the halfking was absent at his huntinglodge on beaver creek about fifteen miles distant but washington had runners sent out to invite him and all the other chiefs to a grand talk on the following day about three oclock the halfking arrived washington had a private conversation with him in his tent through davidson the interpreter he found him intelligent patriotic and proudly tenacious of his territorial rights he stated that the french had built two forts differing in size but on the same model a plan of which he gave of his own drawing the largest was on lake erie the other on french creek fifteen miles apart with a wagon road between them the nearest and levellest way to them was now impassable lying through large and miry savannas they would have therefore to go by venango and it would take five or six sleeps or days of good travelling to reach the nearest fort  on the following morning at nine oclock the chiefs assembled at the councilhouse where washington according to his instructions informed them that he was sent by their brother the governor of virginia to deliver to the french commandant a letter of great importance both to their brothers the english and to themselves and that he was to ask their advice and assistance and some of their young men to accompany and provide for him on the way and be his safeguard against the french indians who had taken up the hatchet he concluded by presenting the indispensable document in indian diplomacy a string of wampum  the chiefs according to etiquette sat for some moments silent after he had concluded as if ruminating on what had been said or to give him time for further remark the halfking then rose and spoke in behalf of the tribes assuring him that they considered the english and themselves brothers and one people and that they intended to return the french the speechbelts or wampums which the latter had sent them this in indian diplomacy is a renunciation of all friendly relations an escort would be furnished to washington composed of mingoes shannoahs and delawares in token of the love and loyalty of those several tribes but three days would be required to prepare for the journey  washington remonstrated against such delay but was informed that an affair of such moment where three speechbelts were to be given up was not to be entered into without due consideration besides the young men who were to form the escort were absent hunting and the halfking could not suffer the party to go without sufficient protection his own french speechbelt also was at his huntinglodge whither he must go in quest of it moreover the shannoah chiefs were yet absent and must be waited for washington soon found that to urge a more speedy departure would be offensive to indian dignity and decorum so he was fain to await the gathering together of the different chiefs with their speechbelts  in fact there was some reason for all this caution tidings had reached the sachems that captain joncaire had called a meeting at venango of the mingoes delawares and other tribes and made them a speech informing them that the french for the present had gone into winterquarters but intended to descend the river in great force and fight the english in the spring he had advised them therefore to stand aloof for should they interfere the french and english would join cut them all off and divide their land between them  with these rumors preying on their minds the halfking and three other chiefs waited on washington in his tent in the evening and after representing that they had complied with all the requisitions of the governor of virginia endeavored to draw from the youthful ambassador the true purport of his mission to the french commandant washington had anticipated an inquiry of the kind knowing how natural it was that these poor people should regard with anxiety and distrust every movement of two formidable powers thus pressing upon them from opposite sides he managed however to answer them in such a manner as to allay their solicitude without transcending the bounds of diplomatic secrecy  after a day or two more of delay and further consultations in the councilhouse the chiefs determined that but three of their number should accompany the mission as a greater number might awaken the suspicions of the french accordingly on the 30th of november washington set out for the french post having his usual party augmented by an indian hunter and being accompanied by the halfking an old shannoah sachem named jeskakake and another chief sometimes called belt of wampum from being the keeper of the speechbelts but generally bearing the sounding appellation of white thunder  although the distance to venango by the route taken was not above seventy miles yet such was the inclemency of the weather and the difficulty of travelling that washington and his party did not arrive there until the 4th of december the french colors were flying at a house to which washington repaired and inquired of three french officers whom he saw there where the commandant resided one of them promptly replied that he had the command of the ohio it was in fact the redoubtable captain joncaire the veteran intriguer of the frontier on being apprised however of the nature of washingtons errand he informed him that there was a general officer at the next fort where he advised him to apply for an answer to the letter of which he was the bearer  in the meantime he invited washington and his party to a supper at headquarters it proved a jovial one joncaire and his brother officers pushed the bottle briskly the wine says washington as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully with it soon banished the restraint which at first appeared in their conversation and gave a license to their tongues to reveal their sentiments more freely washington retained his sobriety and his composure throughout the bacchanalian outbreak he took careful note however of all their revelations and collected a variety of information concerning the french forces how and where they were distributed the situations and distances of their forts and their means and mode of obtaining supplies if the veteran diplomatist of the wilderness had intended this revel for a snare he was completely foiled by his youthful competitor  on the following day there was no travelling on account of excessive rain joncaire in the meantime having discovered that the halfking was with the mission expressed his surprise that he had not accompanied it to his quarters on the preceding day washington in truth had feared to trust the sachem within the reach of the politic frenchman nothing would do now but joncaire must have the sachems at headquarters here his diplomacy was triumphant he received them with open arms he was enraptured to see them his indian brothers how could they be so near without coming to visit him he made them presents but above all plied them so potently with liquor that the poor halfking jeskakake and white thunder forgot all about their wrongs their speeches their speechbelts and all the business they had come upon paid no heed to the repeated cautions of their english friends and were soon in a complete state of frantic extravagance or drunken oblivion  all that day and the next was the party kept at venango by the stratagems of joncaire and his emissaries to detain and seduce the sachems it was not until twelve oclock on the 7th of december that washington was able to extricate them out of their clutches and commence his journey a french commissary by the name of la force and three soldiers set off in company with him la force went as if on ordinary business but he proved one of the most active daring and mischiefmaking of those anomalous agents employed by the french among the indian tribes it is probable that he was at the bottom of many of the perplexities experienced by washington at venango and now travelled with him for the prosecution of his wiles he will be found hereafter acting a more prominent part and ultimately reaping the fruit of his evil doings  after four days of weary travel the party reached the fort it was situated on a kind of island on the west fork of french creek about fifteen miles south of lake erie on the death of the late general the fort had remained in charge of one captain reparti until within a week past when the chevalier legardeur de st pierre had arrived and taken command  the reception of washington at the fort was very different from the unceremonious one experienced at the outpost of joncaire and his convivial messmates when he presented himself at the gate accompanied by his interpreter van braam he was met by the officer second in command and conducted in due military form to his superioran ancient and silverhaired chevalier of the military order of st louis courteous but ceremonious mingling the polish of the french gentleman of the old school with the precision of the soldier having announced his errand washington offered his credentials and the letter of governor dinwiddie and was disposed to proceed at once to business with the prompt frankness of a young man unhackneyed in diplomacy the chevalier however politely requested him to retain the documents in his possession until his predecessor captain reparti should arrive who was hourly expected from the next post  at two oclock the captain arrived the letter and its accompanying documents were then offered again and received in due form and the chevalier and his officers retired with them into a private apartment in this letter dinwiddie complained of the intrusion of french forces into the ohio country erecting forts and making settlements in the western parts of the colony of virginia so notoriously known to be the property of the crown of great britain he inquired by whose authority and instructions the french commandergeneral had marched this force from canada and made this invasion intimating that his own action would be regulated by the answer he should receive and the tenor of the commission with which he was honored at the same time he required of the commandant his peaceable departure  the two following days were consumed in councils of the chevalier and his officers over the letter and the necessary reply washington occupied himself in the meantime in observing and taking notes of the plan dimensions and strength of the fort and of every thing about it he gave orders to his people also to take an exact account of the canoes in readiness and others in the process of construction for the conveyance of troops down the river in the ensuing spring as the weather continued stormy with much snow and the horses were daily losing strength he sent them down unladen to venango to await his return by water in the meantime he discovered that busy intrigues were going on to induce the halfking and the other sachems to abandon him and renounce all friendship with the english upon learning this he urged the chiefs to deliver up their speechbelts immediately as they had promised thereby shaking off all dependence upon the french they accordingly pressed for an audience that very evening a private one was at length granted them by the commander in presence of one or two of his officers the halfking reported the result of it to washington the venerable but astute chevalier cautiously evaded the acceptance of the proffered wampum made many professions of love and friendship and said he wished to live in peace and trade amicably with the tribes of the ohio in proof of which he would send down some goods immediately for them to logstown  on the evening of the 14th the chevalier delivered to washington his sealed reply to the letter of governor dinwiddie the purport of previous conversations with the chevalier and the whole complexion of affairs on the frontier left no doubt of the nature of that reply the business of his mission being accomplished washington prepared on the 15th to return by water to venango but a secret influence was at work which retarded every movement the commandant writes he ordered a plentiful store of liquor and provisions to be put on board our canoes and appeared to be extremely complaisant though he was exerting every artifice which he could invent to set our indians at variance with us to prevent their going until after our departure presents rewards and every thing which could be suggested by him or his officers he had promised them a present of guns if they would wait until the morning as i was very much pressed by the indians to wait this day for them i consented on the promise that nothing should hinder them in the morning  the next morning 16th the french in fulfilment of their promise had to give the present of guns they then endeavored to detain the sachems with liquor but washington reminded the halfking that his royal word was pledged to depart and urged it upon him so closely that exerting unwonted resolution and selfdenial he turned his back upon the liquor and embarked  it was rough and laborious navigation french creek was swollen and turbulent and full of floating ice the frail canoes were several times in danger of being staved to pieces against rocks it was not until the 22d that they reached venango here washington was obliged most unwillingly to part company with the sachems white thunder had hurt himself and was ill and unable to walk and the others determined to remain at venango for a day or two and convey him down the river in a canoe  on the 25th of december washington and his little party set out by land from venango on their route homeward they had a long winters journey before them through a wilderness beset with dangers and difficulties the packhorses laden with tents baggage and provisions were completely jaded it was feared they would give out washington dismounted gave up his saddlehorse to aid in transporting the baggage and requested his companions to do the same none but the drivers remained in the saddle  the cold increased there was deep snow that froze as it fell the horses grew less and less capable of travelling for three days they toiled on slowly and wearily washington was impatient to accomplish his journey and make his report to the governor he determined therefore to hasten some distance in advance of the party and then strike for the fork of the ohio by the nearest course directly through the woods he accordingly put the cavalcade under the command of van braam then disencumbering himself of all superfluous clothing buckling himself up in a watchcoat strapping his pack on his shoulders containing his papers and provisions and taking gun in hand struck manfully ahead accompanied only by mr gist who had equipped himself in like manner  at night they lit a fire and camped by it in the woods at two oclock in the morning they were again on foot and pressed forward until they struck the southeast fork of beaver creek at a place bearing the sinister name of murdering town here washington in planning his route had intended to leave the regular path and strike through the woods for shannopins town two or three miles above the fork of the ohio where he hoped to be able to cross the alleghany river on the ice  at murdering town he found a party of indians who appeared to have known of his coming and to have been waiting for him one of them accosted mr gist and expressed great joy at seeing him the wary woodsman regarded him narrowly and thought he had seen him at joncaires if so he and his comrades were in the french interest and their lying in wait boded no good the indian was very curious in his inquiries as to when they had left venango how they came to be travelling on foot etc these questions increased the distrust of gist and rendered him extremely cautious in reply  the route hence to shannopins town lay through a trackless wild of which the travellers knew nothing it was deemed therefore expedient to engage one of the indians as a guide he entered upon his duties with alacrity took washingtons pack upon his back and led the way by what he said was the most direct course after travelling briskly for eight or ten miles washington became fatigued and his feet were chafed he thought too they were taking a direction too much to the northeast he came to a halt therefore and determined to light a fire make a shelter of the bark and branches of trees and encamp there for the night the indian demurred he offered as washington was fatigued to carry his gun but the latter was too wary to part with his weapon the indian now grew churlish mr gists suspicions increased but he said nothing washingtons also were awakened they proceeded some distance further the guide paused and listened he had heard he said the report of a gun towards the north must be from his cabin he accordingly turned his steps in that direction  they went on two miles farther when washington signified his determination to encamp at the first water they should find the guide said nothing but kept doggedly on after a little while they arrived at an opening in the woods when the indian who was about fifteen paces ahead suddenly turned levelled his gun and fired washington was startled for an instant but feeling that he was not wounded demanded quickly of mr gist if he was shot the latter answered in the negative the indian in the meantime had run forward and screened himself behind a large white oak where he was reloading his gun they overtook and seized him gist would have put him to death on the spot but washington humanely prevented him  arriving at a small stream they ordered the indian to make a fire and took turns to watch over the guns while he was thus occupied gist observed to washington that since he would not suffer the indian to be killed they must manage to get him out of the way and then decamp with all speed and travel all night to leave this perfidious neighborhood behind them but first it was necessary to blind the guide as to their intentions he accordingly addressed him in a friendly tone and adverting to the late circumstance pretended to suppose he had lost his way and fired his gun merely as a signal the indian whether deceived or not readily chimed in with the explanation he said he now knew the way to his cabin which was at no great distance  well then replied gist you can go home and as we are tired we will remain here for the night and follow your track at daylight  whatever might have been the original designs of the savage he was evidently glad to get off gist followed him cautiously for a distance and listened until the sound of his footsteps died away returning then to washington they proceeded about half a mile made another fire set their compass and fixed their course by the light of it then leaving it burning pushed forward and travelled as fast as possible all night continuing on the next day they never relaxed their speed until nightfall when they arrived on the banks of the alleghany river about two miles above shannopins town  washington had expected to find the river frozen completely over it was so only for about fifty yards from each shore while great quantities of broken ice were driving down the main channel trusting that he had outtravelled pursuit he encamped on the border of the river still it was an anxious night and he was up at daybreak to devise some means of reaching the opposite bank no other mode presented itself than by a raft and to construct this they had but one poor hatchet with this they set resolutely to work and labored all day but the sun went down before their raft was finished they launched it however and getting on board endeavored to propel it across with setting poles before they were half way over the raft became jammed between cakes of ice and they were in imminent peril washington planted his pole on the bottom of the stream and leaned against it with all his might to stay the raft until the ice should pass by the rapid current forced the ice against the pole with such violence that he was jerked into the water where it was at least ten feet deep and only saved himself from being swept away and drowned by catching hold of one of the raft logs  it was now impossible with all their exertions to get to either shore abandoning the raft therefore they got upon an island near which they were drifting here they passed the night exposed to intense cold by which the hands and feet of mr gist were frozen in the morning they found the drift ice wedged so closely together that they succeeded in getting from the island to the opposite side of the river and before night were in comfortable quarters at the house of frazier an indian trader at the mouth of turtle creek on the monongahela  leaving fraziers on the 1st of january where they had been detained two or three days endeavoring to procure horses they arrived on the 2d at gists residence sixteen miles from the monongahela here they separated and washington having purchased a horse continued his homeward course he reached williamsburg on the 16th of january where he delivered to governor dinwiddie the letter of the french commandant and made him a full report of the events of his mission  we have been minute in our account of this expedition as it was an early test and development of the various talents and characteristics of washington the prudence sagacity resolution firmness and selfdevotion manifested by him throughout pointed him out not merely to the governor but to the public at large as one eminently fitted notwithstanding his youth for important trusts involving civil as well as military duties it is an expedition that may be considered the foundation of his fortunes from that moment he was the rising hope of virginia     chapter v military expedition to the frontier   the reply of the chevalier de st pierre was such as might have been expected from that courteous but wary commander he should transmit he said the letter of governor dinwiddie to his general the marquis du quesne to whom observed he it better belongs than to me to set forth the evidence and reality of the rights of the king my master upon the lands situated along the river ohio and to contest the pretensions of the king of great britain thereto his answer shall be a law to me  this was considered evasive and only intended to gain time the information given by washington of what he had observed on the frontier convinced governor dinwiddie and his council that the french were preparing to descend the ohio in the spring and take military possession of the country washingtons journal was printed and widely promulgated throughout the colonies and england and awakened the nation to a sense of the impending danger and the necessity of prompt measures to anticipate the french movements  captain trent was dispatched to the frontier commissioned to raise a company of one hundred men march with all speed to the fork of the ohio and finish as soon as possible the fort commenced there by the ohio company he was enjoined to act only on the defensive but to capture or destroy whoever should oppose the construction of the works or disturb the settlements the choice of captain trent for this service notwithstanding his late inefficient expedition was probably owing to his being brotherinlaw to george croghan who had grown to be quite a personage of consequence on the frontier where he had an establishment or tradinghouse and was supposed to have great influence among the western tribes so as to be able at any time to persuade many of them to take up the hatchet washington was empowered to raise a company of like force at alexandria to procure and forward munitions and supplies for the projected fort at the fork and ultimately to have command of both companies  governor dinwiddie in the meantime called upon the governors of the other provinces to make common cause against the foe he endeavored also to effect alliances with the indian tribes of the south the catawbas and cherokees by way of counterbalancing the chippewas and ottawas who were devoted to the french the colonies however felt as yet too much like isolated territories the spirit of union was wanting some pleaded a want of military funds some questioned the justice of the cause some declined taking any hostile step that might involve them in a war unless they should have direct orders from the crown  dinwiddie convened the house of burgesses to devise measures for the public security here his high idea of prerogative and of gubernatorial dignity met with a grievous countercheck from the dawning spirit of independence when he propounded his scheme of operations on the ohio some of the burgesses had the hardihood to doubt the claims of the king to the disputed territory a doubt which the governor reprobated as savoring strongly of a most disloyal french spirit others demurred to any grant of means for military purposes which might be construed into an act of hostility to meet this scruple it was suggested that the grant might be made for the purpose of encouraging and protecting all settlers on the waters of the mississippi and under this specious plea ten thousand pounds were grudgingly voted  ways and means being provided governor dinwiddie augmented the number of troops to be enlisted to three hundred divided into six companies the command of the whole as before was offered to washington but he shrank from it as a charge too great for his youth and inexperience it was given therefore to colonel joshua fry an english gentleman of worth and education and washington was made second in command with the rank of lieutenantcolonel the recruiting at first went on slowly governor dinwiddie proclaimed a bounty of two hundred thousand acres of land on the ohio river to be divided among the officers and soldiers who should engage in this expedition one thousand to be laid off contiguous to the fort at the fork for the use of the garrison this was a tempting bait to the sons of farmers who readily enlisted in the hope of having at the end of a short campaign a snug farm of their own in this land of promise  it was a more difficult matter to get officers than soldiers very few of those appointed made their appearance one of the captains had been promoted two declined washington found himself left almost alone to manage a number of selfwilled undisciplined recruits happily he had with him in the rank of lieutenant that soldier of fortune jacob van braam his old master of fence and travelling interpreter in his emergency he forthwith nominated him captain and wrote to the governor to confirm the appointment on the 2d of april washington set off from alexandria for the new fort at the fork of the ohio he had but two companies with him amounting to about one hundred and fifty men the remainder of the regiment was to follow under colonel fry with the artillery which was to be conveyed up the potomac while on the march he was joined by a detachment under captain adam stephen an officer destined to serve with him at distant periods of his military career at winchester he found it impossible to obtain conveyances by gentle means and was obliged reluctantly to avail himself of the militia law of virginia and impress horses and wagons for service giving the owners orders on government for their appraised value even then out of a great number impressed he obtained but ten after waiting a week thus slenderly fitted out washington and his little force made their way toilfully across the mountains having to prepare the roads as they went for the transportation of the cannon which were to follow on with the other division under colonel fry they cheered themselves with the thoughts that this hard work would cease when they should arrive at the companys tradingpost and storehouse at wills creek where captain trent was to have packhorses in readiness with which they might make the rest of the way by light stages before arriving there they were startled by a rumor that trent and all his men had been captured by the french with regard to trent the news soon proved to be false for they found him at wills creek on the 20th of april with regard to his men there was still an uncertainty he had recently left them at the fork of the ohio busily at work on the fort under the command of his lieutenant frazier washington was eager to press forward and ascertain the truth but it was impossible trent inefficient as usual had failed to provide packhorses it was necessary to send to winchester sixty miles distant for baggage wagons and await their arrival all uncertainty as to the fate of the men however was brought to a close by their arrival on the 25th conducted by an ensign and bringing with them their working implements the french might well boast that they had again been too quick for the english captain contrecoeur an alert officer had embarked about a thousand men with fieldpieces in a fleet of sixty bateaux and three hundred canoes dropped down the river from venango and suddenly made his appearance before the fort on which the men were working and which was not half completed landing drawing up his men and planting his artillery he summoned the fort to surrender allowing one hour for a written reply all that the ensign could obtain was permission to depart with his men taking with them their working tools  such was the ensigns story he was accompanied by two indian warriors sent by the halfking to ascertain where the detachment was what was its strength and when it might be expected at the ohio they bore a speech from that sachem to washington and another with a belt of wampum for the governor of virginia in these he plighted his steadfast faith to the english and claimed assistance from his brothers of virginia and pennsylvania one of these warriors washington forwarded on with the speech and wampum to governor dinwiddie the other he prevailed on to return to the halfking bearing a speech from him addressed to the sachems warriors of the six united nations shannoahs and delawares our friends and brethren in this he informed them that he was on the advance with a part of the army to clear the road for a greater force coming with guns ammunition and provisions and he invited the halfking and another sachem to meet him on the road as soon as possible to hold a council  in fact his situation was arduous in the extreme regarding the conduct of the french in the recent occurrence an overt act of war he found himself thrown with a handful of raw recruits far on a hostile frontier in the midst of a wilderness with an enemy at hand greatly superior in number and discipline provided with artillery and all the munitions of war and within reach of constant supplies and reinforcements besides the french that had come from venango he had received credible accounts of another party ascending the ohio and of six hundred chippewas and ottawas marching down scioto creek to join the hostile camp still notwithstanding the accumulating danger it would not do to fall back nor show signs of apprehension his indian allies in such case might desert him the soldiery too might grow restless and dissatisfied  in this dilemma he called a council of war in which it was determined to proceed to the ohio company storehouse at the mouth of redstone creek fortify themselves there and wait for reinforcements here they might keep up a vigilant watch upon the enemy and get notice of any hostile movement in time for defence or retreat and should they be reinforced sufficiently to enable them to attack the fort they could easily drop down the river with their artillery  with these alternatives in view washington detached sixty men in advance to make a road and at the same time wrote to governor dinwiddie for mortars and grenadoes and cannon of heavy metal aware that the assembly of pennsylvania was in session and that the maryland assembly would also meet in the course of a few days he wrote directly to the governors of those provinces acquainting them with the hostile acts of the french and with his perilous situation and endeavoring to rouse them to cooperation in the common cause  before setting off for redstone creek he discharged trents men who having enlisted as volunteers considered themselves exempt from the rigor of martial law and had become refractory from his detachment ordering them to await colonel frys commands they however in the true spirit of volunteers from the backwoods dispersed to their homes  on the 29th of april washington set out from wills creek at the head of one hundred and sixty men he soon overtook those sent in advance to work the road they had made but little progress it was a difficult task to break a road through the wilderness sufficient for the artillery coming on with colonel frys division all hands were now set to work but with all their labor they could not accomplish more than four miles a day on the 9th of may they were not further than twenty miles from wills creek at a place called the little meadows  every day came gloomy accounts from the ohio brought chiefly by traders who with packhorses bearing their effects were retreating to the more settled parts of the country some exaggerated the number of the french as if strongly reinforced all represented them as diligently at work constructing a fort by their account washington perceived the french had chosen the very place which he had noted in his journal as best fitted for the purpose one of the traders gave information concerning la force the french emissary who had beset washington when on his mission to the frontier and acted as he thought the part of a spy he had been at gists new settlement beyond laurel hill and was prowling about the country with four soldiers at his heels on a pretended hunt after deserters washington suspected him to be on a reconnoitering expedition it was reported moreover that the french were lavishing presents on the indians about the lower part of the river to draw them to their standard among all these flying reports and alarms washington was gratified to learn that the halfking was on his way to meet him at the head of fifty warriors  after infinite toil through swamps and forests and over rugged mountains the detachment arrived at the youghiogeny river where they were detained some days constructing a bridge to cross it this gave washington leisure to correspond with governor dinwiddie concerning matters which had deeply annoyed him by an illjudged economy of the virginia government at this critical juncture its provincial officers received less pay than that allowed in the regular army it is true the regular officers were obliged to furnish their own table but their superior pay enabled them to do it luxuriously whereas the provincials were obliged to do hard duty on salt provisions and water the provincial officers resented this inferiority of pay as an indignity and declared that nothing prevented them from throwing up their commissions but unwillingness to recede from approaching danger  other instances of false economy were pointed out by washington forming so many drags upon the expedition that he quite despaired of success be the consequence what it will however adds he i am determined not to leave the regiment but to be among the last men that leave the ohio even if i serve as a private volunteer which i greatly prefer to the establishment we are upon i have a constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most severe trials and i flatter myself resolution to face what any man dares as shall be proved when it comes to the test  while the bridge over the youghiogeny was in the course of construction the indians assured washington he would never be able to open a wagonroad across the mountain to redstone creek he embarked therefore in a canoe with a lieutenant three soldiers and an indian guide to try whether it was possible to descend the river the river was bordered by mountains and obstructed by rocks and rapids indians might thread such a labyrinth in their light canoes but it would never admit the transportation of troops and military stores washington kept on for thirty miles until he came to a place where the river fell nearly forty feet in the space of fifty yards there he ceased to explore and returned to camp resolving to continue forward by land  on the 23d indian scouts brought word that the french were not above eight hundred strong and that about half their number had been detached at night on a secret expedition close upon this report came a message from the halfking it is reported said he that the french army is coming to meet major washington be on your guard against them my brethren for they intend to strike the first english they shall see  in the evening washington was told that the french were crossing the ford of the youghiogeny about eighteen miles distant he now hastened to take a position in a place called the great meadows where he caused the bushes to be cleared away made an intrenchment and prepared what he termed a charming field for an encounter a party of scouts were mounted on wagonhorses and sent out to reconnoitre they returned without having seen an enemy  on the 25th mr gist arrived from his place about fifteen miles distant la force had been there at noon on the previous day with a detachment of fifty men and gist had since come upon their track within five miles of the camp washington detached seventyfive men in pursuit of him and his prowling band about nine oclock at night came an indian messenger from the halfking who was encamped with several of his people about six miles off the chief had seen tracks of two frenchmen and was convinced their whole body must be in ambush near by washington considered this the force which had been hovering about him for several days and determined to forestall their hostile designs leaving a guard with the baggage and ammunition he set out before ten oclock with forty men to join his indian ally they groped their way in single file by footpaths through the woods in a heavy rain and murky darkness it was near sunrise when they reached the camp of the halfking  the chieftain received the youthful commander with great demonstrations of friendship and engaged to go hand in hand with him against the lurking enemy he set out accordingly accompanied by a few of his warriors and his associate sachem scarooyadi or monacatoocha and conducted washington to the tracks which he had discovered upon these he put two of his indians they followed them up like hounds and brought back word that they had traced them to a low bottom surrounded by rocks and trees where the french were encamped having built a few cabins for shelter from the rain  a plan was now concerted to come upon them by surprise washington with his men on the right the halfking with his warriors on the left all as silently as possible washington was the first upon the ground as he advanced from among the rocks and trees at the head of his men the french caught sight of him and ran to their arms a sharp firing instantly took place and was kept up on both sides for about fifteen minutes washington and his party were most exposed and received all the enemys fire the french at length having lost several of their number gave way and ran they were soon overtaken twentyone were captured and but one escaped a canadian who carried the tidings of the affair to the fort on the ohio the indians would have massacred the prisoners had not washington prevented them ten of the french had fallen in the skirmish and one been wounded washingtons loss was one killed and three wounded he had been in the hottest fire and having for the first time heard balls whistle about him considered his escape miraculous jumonville the french leader had been shot through the head at the first fire  of the twentyone prisoners the two most important were an officer of some consequence named drouillon and the subtle and redoubtable la force as washington considered the latter an arch mischiefmaker he was rejoiced to have him is his power the prisoners were conducted to the camp at the great meadows and sent on the following day 29th under a strong escort to governor dinwiddie then at winchester washington had treated them with great courtesy had furnished drouillon and la force with clothing from his own scanty stock and at their request given them letters to the governor bespeaking for them the respect and favor due to their character and personal merit  the situation of washington was now extremely perilous contrecoeur it was said had nearly a thousand men with him at the fort beside indian allies and reinforcements were on the way to join him the messengers sent by jumonville previous to the late affair must have apprised him of the weakness of the encampment on the great meadows washington hastened to strengthen it he wrote by express also to colonel fry who lay ill at wills creek urging instant reinforcements  the halfking was full of fight he sent the scalps of the frenchmen slain in the late skirmish accompanied by black wampum and hatchets to all his allies summoning them to take up arms and join him at redstone creek for their brothers the english had now begun in earnest he went off for his home promising to send down the river for all the mingoes and shawnees and to be back at the camp on the 30th with thirty or forty warriors accompanied by their wives and children to assist him in the transportation of his people and their effects thirty men were detached and twenty horses  i shall expect every hour to be attacked writes washington to governor dinwiddie on the 26th and by unequal numbers which i must withstand if there are five to one for i fear the consequence will be that we shall lose the indians if we suffer ourselves to be driven back your honor may depend i will not be surprised let them come at what hour they will and this is as much as i can promise but my best endeavors shall not be wanting to effect more     chapter vi misfortunescapitulation of fort necessity   scarcity began to prevail in the camp contracts had been made with george croghan for flour of which he had large quantities at his frontier establishment for he was now trading with the army as well as with the indians none however made its appearance at one time the troops were six days without flour in this time of scarcity the halfking his fellow sachem scarooyadi and thirty or forty warriors arrived bringing with them their wives and childrenso many more hungry mouths to be supplied  news came of the death of colonel fry at wills creek and that he was to be succeeded in the command of the expedition by colonel innes of north carolina who was actually at winchester with three hundred and fifty north carolina troops the colonel however never came to the camp nor did the north carolina troops render any service in the campaignthe fortunes of which might otherwise have been very different by the death of fry the command of the regiment devolved on washington  the palisaded fort was now completed and was named fort necessity from the pinching famine that had prevailed during its construction the scanty force in camp was augmented to three hundred by the arrival from wills creek of the men who had been under colonel fry with them came the surgeon of the regiment dr james craik a scotchman by birth and one destined to become a faithful and confidential friend of washington for the remainder of his life  a letter from governor dinwiddie announced however that captain mackay would soon arrive with an independent company of one hundred men from south carolina the title of independent company had a sound ominous of trouble troops of the kind raised in the colonies under direction of the governors were paid by the crown and the officers had kings commissions such doubtless had captain mackay i should have been particularly obliged writes washington to governor dinwiddie if you had declared whether he was under my command or independent of it i hope he will have more sense than to insist upon any unreasonable distinction because he and his officers have commissions from his majesty  on the 9th arrived washingtons early instructor in military tactics adjutant muse recently appointed a major in the regiment he was accompanied by montour the indian interpreter now a provincial captain and brought with him nine swivels and a small supply of powder and ball fifty or sixty horses were forthwith sent to wills creek to bring on further supplies and mr gist was urged to hasten forward the artillery major muse was likewise the bearer of a belt of wampum and a speech from governor dinwiddie to the halfking with medals for the chiefs and goods for presents among the friendly indians a measure which had been suggested by washington they were distributed with that grand ceremonial so dear to the red man  on the 10th there was agitation in the camp scouts hurried in with word as washington understood them that a party of ninety frenchmen were approaching the report of the scouts had been either exaggerated or misunderstood the ninety frenchmen in military array dwindled down into nine french deserters according to their account the fort at the fork was completed and named duquesne in honor of the governor of canada it was proof against all attack excepting with bombs on the land side the garrison did not exceed five hundred but two hundred more were hourly expected and nine hundred in the course of a fortnight  on the same day captain mackay arrived with his independent company of south carolinians the cross purposes which washington had apprehended soon manifested themselves the captain was civil and well disposed but full of formalities and points of etiquette holding a commission direct from the king he could not bring himself to acknowledge a provincial officer as his superior he encamped separately kept separate guards would not agree that washington should assign any rallying place for his men in case of alarm and objected to receive from him the parole and countersign though necessary for their common safety washington conducted himself with circumspection avoiding everything that might call up a question of command and reasoning calmly whenever such question occurred but he urged the governor by letter to prescribe their relative rank and authority  on the 11th of june washington resumed the laborious march for redstone creek as captain mackay could not oblige his men to work on the road unless they were allowed a shilling sterling a day and as washington did not choose to pay this nor to suffer them to march at their ease while his own faithful soldiers were laboriously employed he left the captain and his independent company as a guard at fort necessity and undertook to complete the military road with his own men accordingly he and his virginia troops toiled forward through the narrow defiles of the mountains working on the road as they went  at gists establishment about thirteen miles from fort necessity washington received certain intelligence that ample reinforcements had arrived at fort duquesne and a large force would instantly be detached against him coming to a halt he began to throw up intrenchments calling in two foraging parties and sending word to captain mackay to join him with all speed the captain and his company arrived in the evening the foraging parties the next morning a council of war was held in which the idea of awaiting the enemy at this place was unanimously abandoned  a rapid and toilsome retreat ensued there was a deficiency of horses washington gave up his own to aid in transporting the military munitions leaving his baggage to be brought on by soldiers whom he paid liberally the other officers followed his example the weather was sultry the roads were rough provisions were scanty and the men dispirited by hunger on the 1st of july they reached the great meadows here the virginians exhausted by fatigue hunger and vexation declared they would carry the baggage and drag the swivels no further contrary to his original intentions therefore washington determined to halt here for the present and fortify sending off expresses to hasten supplies and reinforcements from wills creek where he had reason to believe that two independent companies from new york were by this time arrived  the retreat to the great meadows had not been in the least too precipitate captain de villiers a brotherinlaw of jumonville had actually sallied forth from fort duquesne at the head of upwards of five hundred french and several hundred indians eager to avenge the death of his relative arriving about dawn of day at gists plantation he surrounded the works which washington had hastily thrown up there and fired into them finding them deserted he concluded that those of whom he came in search had made good their retreat to the settlements and it was too late to pursue them he was on the point of returning to fort duquesne when a deserter arrived who gave word that washington had come to a halt in the great meadows where his troops were in a starving condition de villiers ordered the fellow into confinement to be rewarded if his words proved true otherwise to be hanged he then pushed forward for the great meadows  in the meantime washington had exerted himself to enlarge and strengthen fort necessity nothing of which had been done by captain mackay and his men while encamped there the fort was about a hundred feet square protected by trenches and palisades it stood on the margin of a small stream nearly in the centre of the great meadows which is a grassy plain perfectly level surrounded by wooded hills of a moderate height and at that place about two hundred and fifty yards wide washington asked no assistance from the south carolina troops but set to work with his virginians animating them by word and example sharing in the labor of felling trees hewing off the branches and rolling up the trunks to form a breastwork  at this critical juncture he was deserted by his indian allies they were disheartened at the scanty preparations for defence against a superior force and offended at being subjected to military command the halfking thought he had not been sufficiently consulted and that his advice had not been sufficiently followed such at least were some of the reasons which he subsequently gave for abandoning the youthful commander on the approach of danger most of his warriors followed his example  early in the morning of the 3d while washington and his men were working on the fort a sentinel came in wounded and bleeding having been fired upon scouts brought word shortly afterwards that the french were in force about four miles off washington drew up his men on level ground outside of the works to await their attack about eleven oclock there was a firing of musketry from among trees on rising ground but so distant as to do no harm suspecting this to be a stratagem designed to draw his men into the woods he ordered them to keep quiet and refrain from firing until the foe should show themselves and draw near the firing was kept up but still under cover he now fell back with his men into the trenches ordering them to fire whenever they could get sight of an enemy in this way there was skirmishing throughout the day the french and indians advancing as near as the covert of the woods would permit in the meantime the rain fell in torrents the harassed and jaded troops were half drowned in their trenches and many of their muskets were rendered unfit for use  about eight at night the french requested a parley washington hesitated it might be a stratagem to gain admittance for a spy into the fort the request was repeated with the addition that an officer might be sent to treat with them under their parole for his safety unfortunately the chevalier de peyrouney engineer of the regiment and the only one that could speak french correctly was wounded and disabled washington had to send therefore his ancient swordsman and interpreter jacob van braam the captain returned twice with separate terms in which the garrison was required to surrender both were rejected he returned a third time with written articles of capitulation they were in french as no implements for writing were at hand van braam undertook to translate them by word of mouth a candle was brought and held close to the paper while he read the rain fell in torrents it was difficult to keep the light from being extinguished the captain rendered the capitulation article by article in mongrel english while washington and his officers stood listening endeavoring to disentangle the meaning one article stipulated that on surrendering the fort they should leave all their military stores munitions and artillery in possession of the french this was objected to and was readily modified  the main articles as washington and his officers understood them were that they should be allowed to return to the settlements without molestation from french or indians that they should march out of the fort with the honors of war drums beating and colors flying and with all their effects and military stores excepting the artillery which should be destroyed that they should be allowed to deposit their effects in some secret place and leave a guard to protect them until they could send horses to bring them away their horses having been nearly all killed or lost during the action that they should give their word of honor not to attempt any buildings or improvements on the lands of his most christian majesty for the space of a year that the prisoners taken in the skirmish of jumonville should be restored and until their delivery captain van braam and captain stobo should remain with the french as hostages  the next morning accordingly washington and his men marched out of their forlorn fortress with the honors of war bearing with them their regimental colors but leaving behind a large flag too cumbrous to be transported scarcely had they begun their march however when in defiance of the terms of capitulation they were beset by a large body of indians allies of the french who began plundering the baggage and committing other irregularities seeing that the french did not or could not prevent them and that all the baggage which could not be transported on the shoulders of his troops would fall into the hands of these savages washington ordered it to be destroyed as well as the artillery gunpowder and other military stores all this detained him until ten oclock when he set out on his melancholy march and continued on until three miles from fort necessity where he encamped for the night  in the following days march the troops seemed jaded and disheartened they were encumbered and delayed by the wounded provisions were scanty and they had seventy weary miles to accomplish before they could meet with supplies washington however encouraged them by his own steadfast and cheerful demeanor and by sharing all their toils and privations and at length conducted them in safety to wills creek where they found ample provisions in the military magazines leaving them here to recover their strength he proceeded with captain mackay to williamsburg to make his military report to the governor  a copy of the capitulation was subsequently laid before the virginia house of burgesses with explanations notwithstanding the unfortunate result of the campaign the conduct of washington and his officers was properly appreciated and they received a vote of thanks for their bravery and gallant defence of their country from the vote of thanks two officers were excepted major stobo who was charged with cowardice and washingtons unfortunate master of fence and blundering interpreter jacob van braam who was accused of treachery in purposely misinterpreting the articles of capitulation  we will here anticipate dates to record the fortunes of the halfking after his withdrawal from the camp he and several of his warriors with their wives and children retreated to aughquick in the back part of pennsylvania where george croghan had an agency and was allowed money from time to time for the maintenance of indian allies the halfking expressed himself perfectly disgusted with the white mans mode of warfare the french he said were cowards the english fools washington was a good man but wanted experience he would not take advice of the indians and was always driving them to fight according to his own notions for this reason he the halfking had carried off his wife and children to a place of safety after a time the chieftain fell dangerously ill and on his death which took place shortly afterwards there was great lamentation  early in august washington rejoined his regiment which had arrived at alexandria by the way of winchester letters from governor dinwiddie urged him to recruit it to the former number of three hundred men and join colonel innes at wills creek where that officer was stationed with mackays independent company of south carolinians and two independent companies from new york and had been employed in erecting a work to serve as a frontier post and rally point which work received the name of fort cumberland in honor of the duke of cumberland captaingeneral of the british army  in the meantime the french elated by their recent triumph and thinking no danger at hand relaxed their vigilance at fort duquesne stobo who was a kind of prisoner at large there found means to send a letter secretly by an indian dated july 28 and directed to the commander of the english troops it was accompanied by a plan of the fort there are two hundred men here writes he and two hundred expected the rest have gone off in detachments to the amount of one thousand besides indians none lodge in the fort but contrecoeur and the guard consisting of forty men and five officers the rest lodge in bark cabins around the fort the indians have access day and night and come and go when they please if one hundred trusty shawnees mingoes and delawares were picked out they might surprise the fort lodging themselves under the palisades by day and at night secure the guard with their tomahawks shut the sallygate and the fort is ours  the indian messenger carried the letter to aughquick and delivered it into the hands of george croghan the indian chiefs who were with him insisted upon his opening it he did so but on finding the tenor of it transmitted it to the governor of pennsylvania the secret information communicated by stobo may have been the cause of a project suddenly conceived by governor dinwiddie of a detachment which by a forced march across the mountains might descend upon the french and take fort duquesne at a single blow or failing that might build a rival fort in its vicinity he accordingly wrote to washington to march forthwith for wills creek with such companies as were complete leaving orders with the officers to follow as soon as they should have enlisted men sufficient to make up their companies  the ignorance of dinwiddie in military affairs and his want of forecast led him perpetually into blunders washington saw the rashness of an attempt to dispossess the french with a force so inferior that it could be harassed and driven from place to place at their pleasure before the troops could be collected and munitions of war provided the season would be too far advanced there would be no forage for the horses the streams would be swollen and unfordable the mountains rendered impassable by snow and frost and slippery roads  such are a few of the cogent reasons urged by washington in a letter to his friend william fairfax then in the house of burgesses which no doubt was shown to governor dinwiddie and probably had an effect in causing the rash project to be abandoned  in the month of october the house of burgesses made a grant of twenty thousand pounds for the public service and ten thousand more were sent out from england beside a supply of firearms the governor now applied himself to military matters with renewed spirit increased the actual force to ten companies and as there had been difficulties among the different kinds of troops with regard to precedence he reduced them all to independent companies so that there would be no officer in a virginia regiment above the rank of captain this shrewd measure upon which dinwiddie secretly prided himself as calculated to put an end to the difficulties in question immediately drove washington out of the service considering it derogatory to his character to accept a lower commission than that under which his conduct had gained him a vote of thanks from the legislature  governor sharpe of maryland appointed by the king commanderinchief of all the forces engaged against the french sought to secure his valuable services and authorized colonel fitzhugh whom he had placed in temporary command of the army to write to him to that effect the reply of washington 15th nov is full of dignity and spirit and shows how deeply he felt his military degradation you make mention says he of my continuing in the service and retaining my colonels commission this idea has filled me with surprise for if you think me capable of holding a commission that has neither rank nor emolument annexed to it you must maintain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness and believe me more empty than the commission itself i herewith inclose governor sharpes letter which i beg you will return to him with my acknowledgements for the favor he intended me  even had washington hesitated to take this step it would have been forced upon him by a further regulation of government in the course of the ensuing winter settling the rank of officers of his majestys forces when joined or serving with the provincial forces in north america which directed that all such as were commissioned by the king or by his general commanderinchief in north america should take rank of all officers commissioned by the governors of the respective provinces and further that the general and field officers of the provincial troops should have no rank when serving with the general and field officers commissioned by the crown but that all captains and other inferior officers of the royal troops should take rank over provincial officers of the same grade having older commissions these regulations originating in that supercilious assumption of superiority which sometimes overruns and degrades true british pride would have been spurned by washington as insulting to the character and conduct of his highminded brethren of the colonies another cause of vexation to washington was the refusal of governor dinwiddie to give up the french prisoners taken in the affair of de jumonville in fulfillment of the articles of capitulation his plea was that since the capitulation the french had taken several british subjects and sent them prisoners to canada he considered himself justifiable in detaining those frenchmen which he had in his custody washington felt deeply mortified by this obtuseness of the governor on a point of military punctilio and honorable faith but his remonstrances were unavailing la force not having acted in a military capacity and having offended against the peace and security of the frontier by his intrigues among the indians was kept in close durance  the refusal of governor dinwiddie to fulfill the article of the capitulation respecting the prisoners and the rigorous treatment of la force operated hardly upon the hostages stobo and van braam who in retaliation were confined in prison in quebec     chapter vii a campaign under general braddock   having resigned his commission and disengaged himself from public affairs washingtons first care was to visit his mother inquire into the state of domestic concerns and attend to the welfare of his brothers and sisters in these matters he was ever his mothers adjunct and counsellor discharging faithfully the duties of an eldest son who should consider himself a second father to the family he now took up his abode at mount vernon and prepared to engage in those agricultural pursuits for which even in his youthful days he had as keen a relish as for the profession of arms scarcely had he entered upon his rural occupations however when the service of his country once more called him to the field  the disastrous affair at the great meadows and the other acts of french hostility on the ohio had roused the attention of the british ministry who now prepared for military operations in america none of them professedly aggressive but rather to resist and counteract aggressions a plan of campaign was devised for 1755 having four objects to eject the french from lands which they held unjustly in the province of nova scotia to dislodge them from a fortress which they had erected at crown point on lake champlain within what was claimed as british territory to dispossess them of the fort which they had constructed at niagara between lake ontario and lake erie to drive them from the frontiers of pennsylvania and virginia and recover the valley of the ohio the duke of cumberland captaingeneral of the british army had the organization of this campaign and through his patronage majorgeneral edward braddock was intrusted with the execution of it being appointed generalissimo of all the forces in the colonies  braddock was a veteran in service and had been upwards of forty years in the guards that school of exact discipline and technical punctilio he was a brave and experienced officer but his experience was that of routine and rendered him pragmatical and obstinate impatient of novel expedients and his military precision which would have been brilliant on parade was a constant obstacle to alert action in the wilderness he was to lead in person the grand enterprise of the campaign that destined for the frontiers of virginia and pennsylvania it was the enterprise in which washington became enlisted and therefore claims our especial attention  prior to the arrival of braddock came out from england lieutenantcolonel sir john st clair deputy quartermastergeneral eager to make himself acquainted with the field of operations he made a tour of inspection in company with governor sharpe of maryland and appears to have been dismayed at sight of the impracticable wilderness the region of washingtons campaign from fort cumberland he wrote in february to governor morris of pennsylvania to have the road cut or repaired toward the head of the river youghiogeny and another opened from philadelphia for the transportation of supplies unfortunately the governor of pennsylvania had no money at his command and was obliged for expenses to apply to his assembly a set of men writes he quite unacquainted with every kind of military service and exceedingly unwilling to part with money on any terms however by dint of exertions he procured the appointment of commissioners to explore the country and survey and lay out the roads required at the head of the commission was george croghan the indian trader whose mission to the twightwees we have already spoken of  when sir john st clair had finished his tour of inspection he descended wills creek and the potomac for two hundred miles in a canoe to alexandria and repaired to virginia to meet general braddock the latter had landed on the 20th of february at hampton in virginia and proceeded to williamsburg to consult with governor dinwiddie shortly afterwards he was joined there by commodore keppel whose squadron of two shipsofwar and several transports had anchored in the chesapeake on board of these ships were two prime regiments of about five hundred men eachone commanded by sir peter halket the other by colonel dunbar together with a train of artillery and the necessary munitions of war the regiments were to be augmented to seven hundred men each by men selected by sir john st clair from virginia companies recently raised alexandria was fixed upon as the place where the troops should disembark and encamp the ships were accordingly ordered up to that place and the levies directed to repair thither  the plan of the campaign included the use of indian allies governor dinwiddie had already sent christopher gist to engage the cherokees and catawbas the bravest of the southern tribes who he had no doubt would take up the hatchet for the english peace being first concluded through the mediation of his government between them and the six nations and he gave braddock reason to expect at least four hundred indians to join him at fort cumberland general braddock apprehended difficulty in procuring wagons and horses sufficient to attend him in his march sir john st clair in the course of his tour of inspection had met with two dutch settlers at the foot of the blue ridge who engaged to furnish two hundred wagons and fifteen hundred carrying horses to be at fort cumberland early in may governor sharpe was to furnish above a hundred wagons for the transportation of stores on the maryland side of the potomac keppel furnished four cannons from his ships for the attack on fort duquesne and thirty picked seamen to assist in dragging them over the mountains they were to aid also in passing the troops and artillery on floats or in boats across the rivers and were under the command of a midshipman and lieutenant  trusting to these arrangements braddock proceeded to alexandria the troops had all been disembarked before his arrival and the virginia levies selected by sir john st clair to join the regiments of regulars were arrived there were beside two companies of hatchet men or carpenters six of rangers and one troop of light horse the levies having been clothed were ordered to march immediately for winchester to be armed the light horse were retained by the general as his escort and body guard  the din and stir of warlike preparation disturbed the quiet of mount vernon washington looked down from his rural retreat upon the ships of war and transports as they passed up the potomac with the array of arms gleaming along their decks the booming of cannon echoed among his groves alexandria was but a few miles distant occasionally he mounted his horse and rode to that place it was like a garrisoned town teeming with troops and resounding with the drum and fife a brilliant campaign was about to open under the auspices of an experienced general and with all the means and appurtenances of european warfare how different from the starveling expeditions he had hitherto been doomed to conduct what an opportunity to efface the memory of his recent disaster all his thoughts of rural life were put to flight the military part of his character was again in the ascendant his great desire was to join the expedition as a volunteer it was reported to general braddock the latter was apprised by governor dinwiddie and others of washingtons personal merits his knowledge of the country and his experience in frontier service the consequence was a letter from captain robert orme one of braddocks aidesdecamp written by the generals order inviting washington to join his staff  a volunteer situation on the staff of general braddock offered no emolument nor command and would be attended with considerable expense still he did not hesitate a moment to accept the invitation in the position offered to him all the questions of military rank which had hitherto annoyed him would be obviated and he could indulge his passion for arms without any sacrifice of dignity his arrival at headquarters was hailed by his young associates captains orme and morris the generals aidesdecamp who at once received him into frank companionship and a cordial intimacy commenced between them that continued throughout the campaign he experienced a courteous reception from the general who expressed in flattering terms the impression he had received of his merits  there were at that time four governors beside dinwiddie assembled at alexandria at braddocks request to concert a plan of military operationsgovernor shirley of massachusetts lieutenantgovernor delancey of new york lieutenantgovernor sharpe of maryland lieutenantgovernor morris of pennsylvania washington was presented to them in a manner that showed how well his merits were already appreciated  a grand council was held on the 14th of april composed of general braddock commodore keppel and the governors in discussing the campaign the governors were of opinion that new york should be made the centre of operations as it afforded easy access by water to the heart of the french possessions in canada braddock however did not feel at liberty to depart from his instructions which specified the recent establishments of the french on the ohio as the objects of his expedition  niagara and crown point were to be attacked about the same time with fort duquesne the former by governor shirley with his own and sir william pepperells regiments and some new york companies the latter by colonel william johnson sole manager and director of indian affairsa personage worthy of especial note he was a native of ireland and had come out to this country in 1734 to manage the landed estates owned by his uncle commodore sir peter warren in the mohawk country by his agency and his dealings with the native tribes he had acquired great wealth and become a kind of potentate in the indian country his influence over the six nations was said to be unbounded  the business of the congress being finished general braddock would have set out for fredericktown in maryland but few wagons or teams had yet come to remove the artillery washington had looked with wonder and dismay at the huge paraphernalia of war and the world of superfluities to be transported across the mountains recollecting the difficulties he had experienced in getting over them with his nine swivels and scanty supplies if our march is to be regulated by the slow movements of the train said he it will be tedious very tedious indeed  in the meanwhile sir john st clair who had returned to the frontier was storming at the camp at fort cumberland the road required of the pennsylvania government had not been commenced george croghan and the other commissioners were but just arrived in camp sir john according to croghan received them in a very disagreeable manner would not look at their draughts nor suffer any representations to be made to him in regard to the province but stormed like a lion rampant declaring that the want of the road and of the provisions promised by pennsylvania had retarded the expedition and might cost them their lives from the fresh numbers of french that might be poured into the country and that if the french defeated them by the delays of pennsylvania he would with his sword drawn pass through the province and treat the inhabitants as a parcel of traitors to his master the explosive wrath of sir john which was not to be appeased shook the souls of the commissioners and they wrote to governor morris urging that people might be set at work upon the road in reply mr richard peters governor morriss secretary wrote in his name get a number of hands immediately and further the work by all possible methods  a commission of a different kind was intrusted to george croghan governor morris by letter requested him to convene at aughquick in pennsylvania as many warriors as possible of the mixed tribes of the ohio distribute among them wampum belts sent for the purpose and engage them to meet general braddock when on the march and render him all the assistance in their power in reply croghan engaged to enlist a strong body of indians being sure of the influence of scarooyadi successor to the halfking and of his adjunct white thunder keeper of the speechbelts at the instance of governor morris croghan secured the services of another kind of force this was a band of hunters resolute men well acquainted with the country and inured to hardships they were under the command of captain jack one of the most remarkable characters of pennsylvania a complete hero of the wilderness he had been for many years a captive among the indians and having learnt their ways had formed this association for the protection of the settlements the band had become famous for its exploits and was a terror to the indians  general braddock set out from alexandria on the 20th of april washington remained behind a few days to arrange his affairs and then rejoined him at fredericktown in maryland where on the 10th of may he was proclaimed one of the generals aidesdecamp the troubles of braddock had already commenced the virginian contractors failed to fulfil their engagements of all the immense means of transportation so confidently promised but fifteen wagons and a hundred draughthorses had arrived and there was no prospect of more there was equal disappointment in provisions both as to quantity and quality and he had to send round the country to buy cattle for the subsistence of the troops  fortunately while the general was venting his spleen in anathemas against army contractors benjamin franklin arrived at fredericktown that eminent man then about fortynine years of age had been for many years member of the pennsylvania assembly and was now postmastergeneral for america the assembly understood that braddock was incensed against them supposing them adverse to the service of the war they had procured franklin to wait upon him not as if sent by them but as if he came in his capacity of postmastergeneral to arrange for the sure and speedy transmission of dispatches between the commanderinchief and the governors of the provinces  he was well received and became a daily guest at the generals table as the whole delay of the army was caused by the want of conveyances franklin observed one day to the general that it was a pity the troops had not been landed in pennsylvania where almost every farmer had his wagon then sir replied braddock you who are a man of interest there can probably procure them for me and i beg you will franklin consented an instrument in writing was drawn up empowering him to contract for one hundred and fifty wagons with four horses to each wagon and fifteen hundred saddle or packhorses for the service of his majestys forces to be at wills creek on or before the 20th of may and he promptly departed for lancaster to execute the commission  after his departure braddock attended by his staff and his guard of light horse set off for wills creek by the way of winchester the road along the north side of the potomac not being yet made this gave him writes washington a good opportunity to see the absurdity of the route and of damning it very heartily three of washingtons horses were knocked up before they reached winchester and he had to purchase others the discomforts of the rough road were increased with the general by his travelling with some degree of state in a chariot which he had purchased of governor sharpe in this he arrived at fort cumberland amid a thundering salute of seventeen guns by this time the general discovered that he was not in a region fitted for such display and his travelling chariot was abandoned  by the 19th of may the forces were assembled at fort cumberland the two royal regiments originally one thousand strong now increased to fourteen hundred by men chosen from the maryland and virginia levies two provincial companies of carpenters or pioneers thirty men each with subalterns and captains a company of guides composed of a captain two aids and ten men the troop of virginia light horse commanded by captain stewart the detachment of thirty sailors with their officers and the remnants of two independent companies from new york one of which was commanded by captain horatio gates of whom we shall have to speak much hereafter in course of this biography another person in camp of subsequent notoriety and who became a warm friend of washington was dr hugh mercer a scotchman about thirtythree years of age another was dr james craik who had become strongly attached to washington being about the same age and having been with him in the affair of the great meadows serving as surgeon in the virginia regiment to which he still belonged  braddocks camp was a complete study for washington during the halt at fort cumberland where he had an opportunity of seeing military routine in its strictest forms he had a specimen too of convivial life in the camp which the general endeavored to maintain even in the wilderness keeping a hospitable table for he is said to have been somewhat of a bon vivant  there was great detention at the fort caused by the want of forage and supplies the road not having been finished from philadelphia mr richard peters the secretary of governor morris was in camp to attend to the matter he had to bear the brunt of braddocks complaints the general declared he would not stir from wills creek until he had the governors assurance that the road would be opened in time braddock was also completely chagrined and disappointed about the indians the cherokees and catawbas whom dinwiddie had given him reason to expect in such numbers never arrived george croghan reached the camp with but about fifty warriors whom he had brought from aughquick at the generals request he sent a messenger to invite the delawares and shawnees from the ohio who returned with two chiefs of the former tribe among the sachems thus assembled were some of washingtons former alliesscarooyadi alias monacatoocha successor to the halfking white thunder the keeper of the speechbelts and silverheels so called probably from being swift of foot  notwithstanding his secret contempt for the indians braddock agreeably to his instructions treated them with great ceremony a grand council was held in his tent where all his officers attended the chiefs and all the warriors came painted and decorated for war they were received with military honors the guards resting on their firearms the general made them a speech through his interpreter expressing the grief of their father the great king of england at the death of the halfking and made them presents to console them they in return promised their aid as guides and scouts and declared eternal enmity to the french following the declaration with the war song making a terrible noise  for a time all went well the indians had their separate camp where they passed half the night singing dancing and howling the british were amused by their strange ceremonies their savage antics and savage decorations the indians on the other hand loitered by day about the english camp fiercely painted and arrayed gazing with silent admiration at the parade of the troops their marchings and evolutions and delighted with the horseraces with which the young officers recreated themselves unluckily the warriors had brought their families with them to wills creek and the women were even fonder than the men of loitering about the british camp the jealousy of the warriors was aroused to prevent discord the squaws were forbidden to come into the british camp this did not prevent their being sought elsewhere it was ultimately found necessary for the sake of quiet to send the women and children back to aughquick white thunder and several of the warriors accompanied them for their protection as to the three delaware chiefs they returned to the ohio promising the general they would collect their warriors together and meet him on his march they never kept their word  during the halt of the troops at wills creek washington had been sent to williamsburg to bring on four thousand pounds for the military chest he returned after a fortnights absence he found the general out of all patience and temper at the delays and disappointments in regard to horses wagons and forage making no allowances for the difficulties incident to a new country and to the novel and great demands upon its scanty and scattered resources he accused the army contractors of want of faith honor and honesty and in his moments of passion which were many extended the stigma to the whole country this stung the patriotic sensibility of washington and overcame his usual selfcommand and the proud and passionate commander was occasionally surprised by a wellmerited rebuke from his aiddecamp  the same pertinacity was maintained with respect to the indians george croghan informed washington that the sachems considered themselves treated with slight in never being consulted in war matters that he himself had repeatedly offered the services of the warriors under his command as scouts and outguards but his offers had been rejected washington ventured to interfere and to urge their importance for such purposes especially now when they were approaching the stronghold of the enemy as usual the general remained bigoted in his belief of the allsufficiency of welldisciplined troops either from disgust thus caused or from being actually dismissed the warriors began to disappear from the camp before braddock recommenced his march none remained to accompany him but scarooyadi and eight of his warriors  seeing the generals impatience at the nonarrival of conveyances washington again represented to him the difficulties he would encounter in attempting to traverse the mountains with such a train of wheelcarriages assuring him it would be the most arduous part of the campaign and recommended from his own experience the substitution as much as possible of packhorses braddock however had not been sufficiently harassed by frontier campaigning to depart from his european modes or to be swayed in his military operations by so green a counsellor at length the general was relieved from present perplexities by the arrival of the horses and wagons which franklin had undertaken to procure     chapter viii braddocks advancehis defeat   on the 10th of june braddock set off from fort cumberland with his aidesdecamp and others of his staff and his body guard of light horse sir peter halket with his brigade had marched three days previously and a detachment of six hundred men under the command of colonel chapman and the supervision of sir john st clair had been employed upwards of ten days in cutting down trees removing rocks and opening a road the march over the mountains proved as washington had foretold a tremendous undertaking it was with difficulty the heavily laden wagons could be dragged up the steep and rugged roads newly made or imperfectly repaired often they extended for three or four miles in a straggling and broken line with the soldiers so dispersed in guarding them that an attack on any side would have thrown the whole in confusion  by the time the advanced corps had struggled over two mountains and through the intervening forest and reached 16th june the little meadows where sir john st clair had made a temporary camp general braddock had become aware of the difference between campaigning in a new country or on the old wellbeaten battlegrounds of europe he now of his own accord turned to washington for advice thus unexpectedly called on washington gave his counsel with becoming modesty but with his accustomed clearness there was just now an opportunity to strike an effective blow at fort duquesne but it might be lost by delay the garrison according to credible reports was weak large reinforcements and supplies which were on their way would be detained by the drought which rendered the river by which they must come low and unnavigable the blow must be struck before they could arrive he advised the general therefore to divide his forces leave one part to come on with the stores and baggage and all the cumbrous appurtenances of an army and to throw himself in the advance with the other part composed of his choicest troops lightened of every thing superfluous that might impede a rapid march  his advice was adopted twelve hundred men selected out of all the companies and furnished with ten fieldpieces were to form the first division their provisions and necessaries to be carried on packhorses the second division with all the stores munitions and heavy baggage was to be brought on by colonel dunbar the least practicable part of the arrangement was with regard to the officers of the advance washington had urged a retrenchment of their baggage and camp equipage that as many of their horses as possible might be used as packhorses here was the difficulty brought up many of them in fashionable and luxurious life or the loitering indulgence of country quarters they were so encumbered with what they considered indispensable necessaries that out of two hundred and twelve horses generally appropriated to their use not more than a dozen could be spared by them for the public service  during the halt at the little meadows captain jack and his band of forest rangers whom croghan had engaged at governor morriss suggestion made their appearance in the camp the captain asked an interview with the general by whom it would seem he was not expected braddock received him in his tent in his usual stiff and stately manner the black rifle spoke of himself and his followers as men inured to hardships and accustomed to deal with indians who preferred stealth and stratagem to open warfare he requested his company should be employed as a reconnoitring party to beat up the indians in their lurkingplaces and ambuscades braddock who had a sovereign contempt for the chivalry of the woods and despised their boasted strategy replied to the hero of the pennsylvania settlements in a manner to which he had not been accustomed there was time enough he said for making arrangements and he had experienced troops on whom he could completely rely for all purposes captain jack withdrew indignant at so haughty a reception and informed his leathernclad followers of his rebuff they forthwith shouldered their rifles and turned their backs upon the camp  on the 19th of june braddocks first division set out with less than thirty carriages including those that transported ammunition for the artillery all strongly horsed the indians marched with the advanced party in the course of the day scarooyadi and his son being at a small distance from the line of march was surrounded and taken by some french and indians his son escaped and brought intelligence to his warriors they hastened to rescue or revenge him but found him tied to a tree the french had been disposed to shoot him but their savage allies declared they would abandon them should they do so having some tie of friendship or kindred with the chieftain who thus rejoined the troops unharmed  for several days washington had suffered from fever accompanied by intense headache and his illness increased in violence to such a degree that he was unable to ride and had to be conveyed for a part of the time in a covered wagon he was unable to bear the jolting of the wagon but it needed an interposition of the kindlyintended authority of general braddock to bring him to a halt at the great crossings of the youghiogeny there the general assigned him a guard provided him with necessaries and requested him to remain under care of his physician dr craik until the arrival of colonel dunbars detachment which was two days march in the rear giving him his word of honor that he should at all events be enabled to rejoin the main division before it reached the french fort  the march of the army after leaving washington was excessively slow in the course of the first day june 24th they came to a deserted indian camp the trees about it being stripped and painted with threats and scurrilous taunts written in the french language showing that white men were with the savages on the next day indians were seen hovering in the woods in crossing a mountain the carriages had to be lowered with the assistance of the sailors by means of tackle on the 26th there was a laborious march of but four miles in the evening they came to a deserted camp the fires of which were yet burning the march continued to be toilful and difficult on one day it did not exceed two miles having to cut a passage over a mountain on july 4th they encamped at thicketty run the general now supposed himself to be within thirty miles of fort duquesne two indians consented to reconnoitre it they returned on the 6th having been close to the fort but few men were to be seen and few tracks if any gist who had also reconnoitred the fort returned and corroborated their story he had however observed a smoke between the camp and the fort made probably by some scouting party  on the same day during the march three or four men loitering in the rear of the grenadiers were killed and scalped several of the grenadiers set off to take revenge they came upon a party of indians who held up boughs and grounded their armsthe concerted sign of amity not perceiving or understanding it the grenadiers fired upon them and one fell it proved to be the son of scarooyadi aware too late of their error the grenadiers brought the body to the camp the conduct of braddock was admirable on the occasion he sent for the father and the other indians and condoled with them on the lamentable occurrence making them the customary presents of expiation but what was more to the point he caused the youth to be buried with the honors of war at his request the officers attended the funeral and a volley was fired over the grave these soldierlike tributes of respect to the deceased and sympathy with the survivors soothed the feelings and gratified the pride of the father and attached him more firmly to the service  we will return now to washington in his sick encampment on the banks of the youghiogeny where he was left repining at the departure of the troops without him he now considered himself sufficiently recovered to rejoin the troops and his only anxiety was that he should not be able to do it in time for the great blow he was rejoiced therefore on the 3d of july by the arrival of an advanced party of one hundred men convoying provisions being still too weak to mount his horse he set off with the escort in a covered wagon and after a most fatiguing journey over mountain and through forest reached braddocks camp on the 8th of july it was on the east side of the monongahela about two miles from the river and about fifteen miles from fort duquesne  washington was warmly received on his arrival especially by his fellow aidesdecamp morris and orme he was just in time for the attack upon fort duquesne was to be made on the following day the neighboring country had been reconnoitred to determine upon a plan of attack the fort stood on the same side of the monongahela with the camp but there was a narrow pass between them of about two miles with the river on the left and a very high mountain on the right and in its present state quite impassable for carriages the route determined on was to cross the monongahela by a ford immediately opposite to the camp proceed along the west bank of the river for about five miles then recross by another ford to the eastern side and push on to the fort the river at these fords was shallow and the banks were not steep  according to the plan of arrangement lieutenantcolonel gage with the advance was to cross the river before daybreak march to the second ford and recrossing there take post to secure the passage of the main force the advance was to be composed of two companies of grenadiers one hundred and sixty infantry the independent company of captain horatio gates and two sixpounders washington who had already seen enough of regular troops to doubt their infallibility in wild bushfighting and who knew the dangerous nature of the ground they were to traverse ventured to suggest that the virginia rangers being accustomed to the country and to indian warfare might be thrown in the advance the proposition drew an angry reply from the general indignant very probably that a young provincial officer should presume to school a veteran like himself  early next morning july 9th before daylight colonel gage crossed with the advance he was followed at some distance by sir john st clair with a working party of two hundred and fifty men to make roads for the artillery and baggage they had with them their wagons of tools and two sixpounders by sunrise the main body turned out in full uniform all looked as if arrayed for a f√™te rather than a battle as it was supposed the enemy would be on the watch for the crossing of the troops it had been agreed that they should do it in the greatest order with bayonets fixed colors flying and drums and fifes beating and playing they accordingly made a gallant appearance as they forded the monongahela and wound along its banks and through the open forests about noon they reached the second ford gage with the advance was on the opposite side of the monongahela posted according to orders but the river bank had not been sufficiently sloped the artillery and baggage drew up along the beach and halted until one when the second crossing took place when all had passed there was again a halt close by a small stream called fraziers run until the general arranged the order of march  first went the advance under gage preceded by the engineers and guides and six light horsemen then sir john st clair and the working party with their wagons and the two sixpounders on each side were thrown out four flanking parties then at some distance the general was to follow with the main body the artillery and baggage preceded and flanked by light horse and squads of infantry while the virginian and other provincial troops were to form the rear guard  the ground before them was level until about half a mile from the river where a rising ground covered with long grass low bushes and scattered trees sloped gently up to a range of hills the whole country generally speaking was a forest with no clear opening but the road which was about twelve feet wide and flanked by two ravines concealed by trees and thickets had braddock been schooled in the warfare of the woods he would have thrown out indian scouts or virginia rangers in the advance and on the flanks to beat up the woods and ravines but he suffered his troops to march forward through the centre of the plain with merely their usual guides and flanking parties  it was now near two oclock the advanced party and the working party had crossed the plain and were ascending the rising ground braddock was about to follow with the main body and had given the word to march when he heard an excessively quick and heavy firing in front washington who was with the general surmised that the evil he had apprehended had come to pass for want of scouting parties ahead the advance parties were suddenly and warmly attacked braddock ordered lieutenantcolonel burton to hasten to their assistance with the vanguard of the main body eight hundred strong the residue four hundred were halted and posted to protect the artillery and baggage the firing continued with fearful yelling there was a terrible uproar by the generals orders an aidedecamp spurred forward to bring him an account of the nature of the attack without waiting for his return the general himself finding the turmoil increase moved forward leaving sir peter halket with the command of the baggage  the van of the advance had indeed been taken by surprise it was composed of two companies of carpenters or pioneers to cut the road and two flank companies of grenadiers to protect them suddenly the engineer who preceded them to mark out the road gave the alarm french and indians a body of them was approaching rapidly there was sharp firing on both sides at first several of the enemy fell among them their leader but a murderous fire broke out from among trees and a ravine on the right and the woods resounded with unearthly whoops and yellings the indian rifle was at work levelled by unseen hands most of the grenadiers and many of the pioneers were shot down the survivors were driven in on the advance  gage ordered his men to fix bayonets and form in order of battle they did so in hurry and trepidation he would have scaled a hill on the right whence there was the severest firing not a platoon would quit the line of march they were more dismayed by the yells than by the rifles of the unseen savages the latter extended themselves along the hill and in the ravines but their whereabouts was only known by their demoniac cries and the puffs of smoke from their rifles the soldiers fired wherever they saw the smoke the officers tried in vain to restrain them until they should see their foe all orders were unheeded in their fright they shot at random killing some of their own flanking parties and of the vanguard as they came running in the covert fire grew more intense in a short time most of the officers and many of the men of the advance were killed or wounded colonel gage himself received a wound the advance fell back in dismay upon sir john st clairs corps which was equally dismayed the cannon belonging to it were deserted  colonel burton had come up with the reinforcement and was forming his men to face the rising ground on the right when both of the advanced detachments fell back upon him and all now was confusion by this time the general was upon the ground he tried to rally the men the colors were advanced in different places to separate the men of the two regiments the general ordered the officers to form the men tell them off into small divisions and advance with them but the soldiers could not be prevailed upon either by threats or entreaties the virginia troops accustomed to the indian mode of fighting scattered themselves and took post behind trees whence they could pick off the lurking foe in this way they in some degree protected the regulars washington advised general braddock to adopt the same plan with the regulars but he persisted in forming them into platoons consequently they were cut down from behind logs and trees as fast as they could advance several attempted to take to the trees without orders but the general stormed at them called them cowards and even struck them with the flat of his sword several of the virginians who had taken post and were doing good service in this manner were slain by the fire of the regulars directed wherever a smoke appeared among the trees  the officers behaved with consummate bravery and washington beheld with admiration those who in camp or on the march had appeared to him to have an almost effeminate regard for personal ease and convenience now exposing themselves to imminent death with a courage that kindled with the thickening horrors in the vain hope of inspiriting the men to drive off the enemy from the flanks and regain the cannon they would dash forward singly or in groups they were invariably shot down for the indians aimed at every one who appeared to have command some were killed by random shot of their own men who crowded in masses fired with affrighted rapidity but without aim soldiers in the front ranks were killed by those in the rear between friend and foe the slaughter of the officers was terrible  throughout this disastrous day washington distinguished himself by his courage and presence of mind his brother aids orme and morris were wounded and disabled early in the action and the whole duty of carrying the orders of the general devolved on him his danger was imminent and incessant he was in every part of the field a conspicuous mark for the murderous rifle two horses were shot under him four bullets passed through his coat his escape without a wound was almost miraculous at one time he was sent to the main body to bring the artillery into action all there was likewise in confusion for the indians had extended themselves along the ravine so as to flank the reserve and carry slaughter into the ranks sir peter halket had been shot down at the head of his regiment the men who should have served the guns were paralyzed had they raked the ravines with grapeshot the day might have been saved in his ardor washington sprang from his horse wheeled and pointed a brass fieldpiece with his own hand and directed an effective discharge into the woods but neither his efforts nor example were of avail the men could not be kept to the guns  braddock still remained in the centre of the field in the desperate hope of retrieving the fortunes of the day his secretary shirley had fallen by his side five horses had been killed under him still he kept his ground vainly endeavoring to check the flight of his men or at least to effect their retreat in good order at length a bullet passed through his right arm and lodged itself in his lungs he fell from his horse but was caught by captain stewart of the virginia guards who with the assistance of another american and a servant placed him in a tumbril it was with much difficulty they got him out of the fieldin his despair he desired to be left there  the rout now became complete baggage stores artillery everything was abandoned the wagoners took each a horse out of his team and fled the officers were swept off with the men in this headlong flight it was rendered more precipitate by the shouts and yells of the savages numbers of whom rushed forth from their coverts and pursued the fugitives to the river side fortunately for the latter the victors gave up the pursuit in their eagerness to collect the spoil the shattered army continued its flight after it had crossed the monongahela a wretched wreck of the brilliant little force that had recently gleamed along its banks confident of victory out of eightysix officers twentysix had been killed and thirtysix wounded the number of rank and file killed and wounded was upwards of seven hundred  about a hundred men were brought to a halt about a quarter of a mile from the ford of the river here was braddock with his wounded aidesdecamp and some of his officers braddock was still able to give orders and had a faint hope of being able to keep possession of the ground until reinforced most of the men were stationed in a very advantageous spot about two hundred yards from the road and lieutenantcolonel burton posted out small parties and sentinels before an hour had elapsed most of the men had stolen off being thus deserted braddock and his officers continued their retreat he would have mounted his horse but was unable and had to be carried by soldiers orme and morris were placed on litters borne by horses they were subsequently joined by colonel gage with eighty men whom he had rallied  washington in the meantime notwithstanding his weak state being found most efficient in frontier service was sent to colonel dunbars camp forty miles distant with orders for him to hurry forward provisions hospital stores and wagons for the wounded under the escort of two grenadier companies it was a hard and a melancholy ride throughout the night and the following day the tidings of the defeat preceded him borne by the wagoners who had mounted their horses on braddocks fall and fled from the field of battle  washington arrived at the camp in the evening the orders which he brought were executed during the night and he was in the saddle early in the morning accompanying the convoy of supplies at gists plantation about thirteen miles off he met gage and his scanty force escorting braddock and his wounded officers captain stewart and a sad remnant of the virginia light horse still accompanied the general as his guard the captain had been unremitting in his attentions to him during the retreat there was a halt of one day at dunbars camp for the repose and relief of the wounded on the 13th they resumed their melancholy march and that night reached the great meadows  the proud spirit of braddock was broken by his defeat he remained silent the first evening after the battle only ejaculating at night who would have thought it he was equally silent the following day yet hope still seemed to linger in his breast from another ejaculation we shall better know how to deal with them another time he was grateful for the attentions paid to him by captain stewart and washington and more than once it is said expressed his admiration of the gallantry displayed by the virginians in the action he died on the night of the 13th at the great meadows the place of washingtons discomfiture in the previous year his obsequies were performed before break of day the chaplain having been wounded washington read the funeral service  reproach spared him not even when in his grave the failure of the expedition was attributed both in england and america to his obstinacy his technical pedantry and his military conceit he had been continually warned to be on his guard against ambush and surprise but without avail had he taken the advice urged on him by washington and others to employ scouting parties of indians and rangers he would never have been so signally surprised and defeated still his dauntless conduct on the field of battle shows him to have been a man of fearless spirit and he was universally allowed to be an accomplished disciplinarian  the obsequies of the unfortunate braddock being finished the escort continued its retreat with the sick and wounded on the 17th the sad cavalcade reached the fort and were relieved from the incessant apprehension of pursuit here too flying reports had preceded them brought by fugitives from the battle who with the disposition usual in such cases to exaggerate had represented the whole army as massacred dunbar arrived shortly afterward with the remainder of the army  the true reason why the enemy did not pursue the retreating army was not known until some time afterwards and added to the disgrace of the defeat they were not the main force of the french but a mere detachment of 72 regulars 146 canadians and 637 indians855 in all led by captain de beaujeu de contrecoeur the commander of fort duquesne had received information through his scouts that the english three thousand strong were within six leagues of his fort despairing of making an effectual defence against such a superior force he was balancing in his mind whether to abandon his fort without awaiting their arrival or to capitulate on honorable terms in this dilemma beaujeu prevailed on him to let him sally forth with a detachment to form an ambush and give check to the enemy de beaujeu was to have taken post at the river and disputed the passage at the ford for that purpose he was hurrying forward when discovered by the pioneers of gages advance party he was a gallant officer and fell at the beginning of the fight the whole number of killed and wounded of french and indians did not exceed seventy  the affair of braddock remains a memorable event in american history and has been characterized as the most extraordinary victory ever obtained and the farthest flight ever made it struck a fatal blow to the deference for british prowess which once amounted almost to bigotry throughout the provinces     chapter ix washington in commandpanics on the frontier   washington arrived at mount vernon on the 26th of july still in feeble condition from his long illness his campaigning thus far had trenched upon his private fortune and impaired one of the best of constitutions his connection with the army ceased at the death of braddock but his military duties continued as adjutantgeneral of the northern division of the province and he immediately issued orders for the county lieutenants to hold the militia in readiness for parade and exercise foreseeing that in the present defenceless state of the frontier there would be need of their services  tidings of the rout and retreat of the army had circulated far and near and spread consternation throughout the country immediate incursions both of french and indians were apprehended and volunteer companies began to form for the purpose of marching across the mountains to the scene of danger  on the 4th of august governor dinwiddie convened the assembly to devise measures for the public safety the sense of danger had quickened the slow patriotism of the burgesses they no longer held back supplies forty thousand pounds were promptly voted and orders issued for the raising of a regiment of one thousand men  washingtons friends urged him to present himself at williamsburg as a candidate for the command they were confident of his success notwithstanding that strong interest was making for the governors favorite colonel innes with mingled modesty and pride washington declined to be a solicitor the only terms he said on which he would accept a command were a certainty as to rank and emoluments a right to appoint his field officers and the supply of a sufficient military chest but to solicit the command and at the same time to make stipulations would be a little incongruous and carry with it the face of selfsufficiency  while this was in agitation he received letters from his mother again imploring him not to risk himself in these frontier wars his answer was characteristic honored madamif it is in my power to avoid going to the ohio again i shall but if the command is pressed upon me by the general voice of the country and offered upon such terms as cannot be objected against it would reflect dishonor on me to refuse it and that i am sure must and ought to give you greater uneasiness than my going in an honorable command upon no other terms will i accept it  on the very day that this letter was despatched aug 14 he received intelligence of his appointment to the command on the terms specified in his letters to his friends his commission nominated him commanderinchief of all the forces raised or to be raised in the colony the assembly also voted three hundred pounds to him and proportionate sums to the other officers and to the privates of the virginia companies in consideration of their gallant conduct and their losses in the late battle the officers next in command under him were lieutenantcolonel adam stephens and major andrew lewis  the appointment of washington to his present station was the more gratifying and honorable from being a popular one made in deference to public sentiment to which governor dinwiddie was obliged to sacrifice his strong inclination in favor of colonel innes it is thought that the governor never afterwards regarded washington with a friendly eye his conduct towards him subsequently was on various occasions cold and ungracious  having held a conference with governor dinwiddie at williamsburg and received his instructions washington repaired on the 14th of september to winchester where he fixed his headquarters it was a place as yet of trifling magnitude but important from its position being a central point where the main roads met leading from north to south and east to west and commanding the channels of traffic and communication between some of the most important colonies and a great extent of frontier  here he was brought into frequent and cordial communication with his old friend lord fairfax the stir of war had revived a spark of that military fire which animated the veteran nobleman in the days of his youth when an officer in the cavalry regiment of the blues he was lordlieutenant of the county greenway court was his headquarters he had organized a troop of horse which occasionally was exercised about the lawn of his domain and he was now as prompt to mount his steed for a cavalry parade as he ever was for a foxchase  his services were soon put in requisition washington having visited the frontier posts established recruiting places and taken other measures of security had set off for williamsburg on military business when an express arrived at winchester from colonel stephens who commanded at fort cumberland giving the alarm that a body of indians were ravaging the country burning the houses and slaughtering the inhabitants the express was instantly forwarded after washington in the meantime lord fairfax sent out orders for the militia of fairfax and prince william counties to arm and hasten to the defence of winchester where all was confusion and affright one fearful account followed another the whole country beyond it was said to be at the mercy of the savages they had blockaded the rangers in the little fortresses or outposts provided for the protection of neighborhoods they were advancing upon winchester with fire tomahawk and scalpingknife the country people were flocking into the town for safetythe townspeople were moving off to the settlements beyond the blue ridge the beautiful valley of the shenandoah was likely to become a scene of savage desolation  in the height of the confusion washington rode into the town he had been overtaken by colonel stephens express his presence inspired some degree of confidence and he succeeded in stopping most of the fugitives  expresses were sent off to hurry up the militia ordered out by lord fairfax scouts were ordered out to discover the number of the foe and convey assurances of succor to the rangers said to be blocked up in the fortresses though washington suspected the latter to be more encompassed by fear than by the enemy smiths were set to work to furbish up and repair such firearms as were in the place and wagons were sent off for musket balls flints and provisions instead however of animated cooperation washington was encountered by difficulties at every step the wagons in question had to be impressed and the wagoners compelled by force to assist no orders writes he are obeyed but such as a party of soldiers or my own drawn sword enforces without this not a single horse for the most earnest occasion can be had  in the meantime the panic and confusion increased on sunday an express hurried into town breathless with haste and terror the indians he said were but twelve miles off they had attacked the house of isaac julian the inhabitants were flying for their lives washington immediately ordered the town guards to be strengthened armed some recruits who had just arrived and sent out two scouts to reconnoitre the enemy it was a sleepless night in winchester horror increased with the dawn before the men could be paraded a second express arrived ten times more terrified than the former the indians were within four miles of the town killing and destroying all before them he had heard the constant firing of the savages and the shrieks of their victims  the terror of winchester now passed all bounds washington put himself at the head of about forty men militia and recruits and pushed for the scene of carnage the result is almost too ludicrous for record the whole cause of the alarm proved to be three drunken troopers carousing hallooing and ever and anon firing off their pistols washington interrupted them in the midst of their revel and blasphemy and conducted them prisoners to town the alarm thus originating had spread throughout the country a captain who arrived with recruits from alexandria reported that he had found the road across the blue ridge obstructed by crowds of people flying for their lives whom he endeavored in vain to stop they declared that winchester was in flames  at length the band of indians whose ravages had produced this consternation throughout the land and whose numbers did not exceed one hundred and fifty being satiated with carnage conflagration and plunder retreated bearing off spoils and captives intelligent scouts sent out by washington followed their traces and brought back certain intelligence that they had recrossed the alleghany mountains and returned to their homes on the ohio this report allayed the public panic and restored temporary quiet to the harassed frontier most of the indians engaged in these ravages were delawares and shawnees who since braddocks defeat had been gained over by the french scarooyadi successor to the halfking remained true to the english and vindicated his people to the governor and council of pennsylvania from the charge of having had any share in the late massacres  washington now learned the fate of the other enterprises included in the plan of military operations the defeat of braddock paralyzed the expedition against niagara the troops assembled at albany were struck with consternation and deserted by the end of august shirley was in force at oswego but storms sickness and other impediments caused the completion of the enterprise to be deferred until the following year  gen wm johnson it will be recollected had the command of the expedition against crown point on lake champlain a fort was erected at the carryingplace on the hudson between that river and lake george subsequently called fort edward part of the force were left to garrison it the main body advanced to lake george meanwhile there was great consternation in canada three thousand troops under baron de dieskaw had arrived at quebec yielding to public importunities he advanced to crown point for its defence his force was augmented by eight hundred canadians and seven hundred indians the latter under command of the chevalier st pierre  in the meantime johnson remained encamped on the south end of lake george on september 7th news was received that the french had been seen within four miles of the carryingplace a detachment was sent to intercept them which was attacked and driven back a panic seized upon the camp as the french emerged from the forest in battle array led by dieskaw but the canadians and indians held back the camp recovered from its panic artillery and musketry opened on the assailants whose fire began to slacken johnsons men and the indians leaped over the breastworks and a medley fight ensued that ended in the slaughter rout or capture of the enemy dieskaw was mortally wounded st pierre was slain in the attack on the detachment the baron had intended the surprise of fort edward but the indians and canadians refused to attack it fearful of the cannon he here changed his plan therefor and attempted to surprise the camp johnson having erected a stockaded fort which received the name of william henry garrisoned it and returned to albany in reward for his services he received five thousand pounds and a baronetcy  mortifying experience had convinced washington of the inefficiency of the militia laws and he now set about effecting a reformation through his great and persevering efforts an act was passed in the virginia legislature giving prompt operation to courtmartial punishing insubordination mutiny and desertion with adequate severity strengthening the authority of a commander so as to enable him to enforce order and discipline among officers as well as privates and to avail himself in time of emergency and for the common safety of the means and services of individuals in disciplining his men they were instructed not merely in ordinary and regular tactics but in all the strategy of indian warfare and what is called bushfightinga knowledge indispensable in the wild wars of the wilderness stockaded forts too were constructed at various points as places of refuge and defence in exposed neighborhoods  his exertions however were impeded by one of those questions of precedence which had so often annoyed him arising from the difference between crown and provincial commissions maryland having by a scanty appropriation raised a small militia force stationed captain dagworthy with a company of thirty men at fort cumberland which stood within the boundaries of that province dagworthy had served in canada in the preceding war and had received a kings commission this he had since commuted for halfpay and of course had virtually parted with its privileges he was nothing more therefore than a maryland provincial captain at the head of thirty men he now however assumed to act under his royal commission and refused to obey the orders of any officer however high his rank who merely held his commission from a governor nay when governor or rather colonel innes who commanded at the fort was called away to north carolina by his private affairs the captain took upon himself the command and insisted upon it as his right  parties instantly arose and quarrels ensued among the inferior officers grave questions were agitated between the governors of maryland and virginia as to the fort itself the former claiming it as within his province the latter insisting that as it had been built according to orders sent by the king it was the kings fort and could not be subject to the authority of maryland  washington refrained from mingling in this dispute but intimated that if the commanderinchief of the forces of virginia must yield precedence to a maryland captain of thirty men he should have to resign his commission as he had been compelled to do before by a question of military rank  so difficult was it however to settle these disputes of precedence especially where the claims of two governors came in collision that it was determined to refer the matter to majorgeneral shirley who had succeeded braddock in the general command of the colonies for this purpose washington was to go to boston obtain a decision from shirley of the point in dispute and a general regulation by which these difficulties could be prevented in future it was thought also that in a conference with the commanderinchief he might inform himself of the military measures in contemplation  accordingly on the 4th of february 1756 leaving colonel adam stephens in command of the troops washington set out on his mission accompanied by his aidedecamp captain george mercer of virginia and captain stewart of the virginia light horse the party travelled in virginia style on horseback attended by their black servants in livery in this way they accomplished a journey of five hundred miles in the depth of winter stopping for some days at philadelphia and new york those cities were then comparatively small and the arrival of a party of young southern officers attracted attention the late disastrous battle was still the theme of every tongue and the honorable way in which these young officers had acquitted themselves in it made them objects of universal interest washingtons fame especially had gone before him having been spread by the officers who had served with him and by the public honors decreed him by the virginia legislature  the mission to general shirley was entirely successful as to the question of rank a written order from the commanderinchief determined that dagworthy was entitled to the rank of a provincial captain only and of course must on all occasions give precedence to colonel washington as a provincial field officer the latter was disappointed however in the hope of getting himself and his officers put upon the regular establishment with commissions from the king and had to remain subjected to mortifying questions of rank and etiquette when serving in company with regular troops  from general shirley he learnt that the main objects of the ensuing campaign would be the reduction of fort niagara so as to cut off the communication between canada and louisiana the capture of ticonderoga and crown point as a measure of safety for new york the besieging of fort duquesne and the menacing of quebec by a body of troops which were to advance by the kennebec river  the official career of general shirley was drawing to a close he was recalled to england and was to be superseded by general abercrombie the general command in america however was to be held by the earl of loudoun who was invested with powers almost equal to those of a viceroy being placed above all the colonial governors beside his general command he was to be governor of virginia and colonel of a royal american regiment of four battalions to be raised in the colonies but furnished with officers who like himself had seen foreign service the campaign would open on his arrival which it was expected would be early in the spring and brilliant results were anticipated  washington remained ten days in boston receiving the most hospitable attentions from the polite and intelligent society of the place after which he returned to new york tradition gives very different motives from those of business for his sojourns in the latter city he found there an early friend and schoolmate beverly robinson son of john robinson speaker of the virginia house of burgesses he was living happily and prosperously with a young and wealthy bride having married one of the nieces and heiresses of mr adolphus philipse a rich landholder at the house of mr beverly robinson washington met miss mary philipse sister of mrs robinson a young lady whose personal attractions are said to have rivalled her reputed wealth a life of constant activity and care passed for the most part in the wilderness and on the frontier far from female society had left washington little mood or leisure for the indulgence of the tender sentiment but made him more sensible in the present brief interval of gay and social life to the attractions of an elegant woman brought up in the polite circle of new york that he was an open admirer of miss philipse is an historical fact that he sought her hand but was refused is traditional the most probable version of the story is that he was called away by his public duties before he had made sufficient approaches in his siege of the ladys heart to warrant a summons to surrender in the latter part of march we find him at williamsburg attending the opening of the legislature of virginia eager to promote measures for the protection of the frontier and the capture of fort duquesnethe leading object of his ambition while thus engaged he received a letter from a friend and confidant in new york warning him to hasten back to that city before it was too late as captain morris who had been his fellow aidedecamp under braddock was laying close siege to miss philipse sterner alarms however summoned him in another direction expresses from winchester brought word that the french had made another sortie from fort duquesne accompanied by a band of savages and were spreading terror and desolation through the country in this moment of exigency all softer claims were forgotten washington repaired in all haste to his post at winchester and captain morris was left to urge his suit unrivalled and carry off the prize  report had not exaggerated the troubles of the frontier it was marauded by merciless bands of savages led in some instances by frenchmen travellers were murdered farm houses burnt down families butchered and even stockaded forts or houses of refuge attacked in open day the marauders had crossed the mountains and penetrated the valley of the shenandoah washington on his arrival at winchester found the inhabitants in great dismay he resolved immediately to organize a force composed partly of troops from fort cumberland partly of militia from winchester and its vicinity to put himself at its head and scour the woods and suspected places in all the mountains and valleys of this part of the frontier in quest of the indians and their more cruel associates  he accordingly despatched an express to fort cumberland with orders for a detachment from the garrison but how said he are men to be raised at winchester since orders are no longer regarded in the county lord fairfax and other militia officers with whom he consulted advised that each captain should call a private muster of his men and read before them an address or exhortation as it was called being an appeal to their patriotism and fears and a summons to assemble on the 15th of april to enroll themselves for the projected mountain foray this measure was adopted the private musterings occurred the exhortation was read the time and place of assemblage appointed but when the day of enrollment arrived not more than fifteen men appeared upon the ground in the meantime the express returned with sad accounts from fort cumberland no troops could be furnished from that quarter the garrison was scarcely strong enough for selfdefence having sent out detachments in different directions  horrors accumulated at winchester every hour brought its tale of terror true or false of houses burnt families massacred or beleaguered and famishing in stockaded forts the danger approached a scouting party had been attacked in the warm spring mountain about twenty miles distant by a large body of french and indians mostly on horseback the captain of the scouting party and several of his men had been slain and the rest put to flight an attack was apprehended and the terrors of the people rose to agony they now turned to washington as their main hope the women surrounded him holding up their children and imploring him with tears and cries to save them from the savages the youthful commander looked round on the suppliant crowd with a countenance beaming with pity and a heart wrung with anguish a letter to governor dinwiddie drew from him an instant order for a militia force from the upper counties to his assistance but the virginia newspapers in descanting on the frontier troubles threw discredit on the army and its officers and attached blame to its commander stung to the quick by this injustice washington publicly declared that nothing but the imminent danger of the times prevented him from instantly resigning a command from which he could never reap either honor or benefit his sensitiveness called forth strong letters from his friends assuring him of the high sense entertained at the seat of government and elsewhere of his merits and services  in fact the situation and services of the youthful commander shut up in a frontier town destitute of forces surrounded by savage foes gallantly though despairingly devoting himself to the safety of a suffering people were properly understood throughout the country and excited a glow of enthusiasm in his favor the legislature too began at length to act but timidly and inefficiently its measure of relief was an additional appropriation of twenty thousand pounds and an increase of the provincial force to fifteen hundred men with this it was proposed to erect and garrison a chain of frontier forts extending through the ranges of the alleghany mountains from the potomac to the borders of north carolina a distance of between three and four hundred miles this was one of the inconsiderate projects devised by governor dinwiddie  washington in letters to the governor and to the speaker of the house of burgesses urged the impolicy of such a plan with their actual force and means the forts he observed ought to be within fifteen or eighteen miles of each other that their spies might be able to keep watch over the intervening country otherwise the indians would pass between them unperceived effect their ravages and escape to the mountains swamps and ravines before the troops from the forts could be assembled to pursue them they ought each to be garrisoned with eighty or a hundred men so as to afford detachments of sufficient strength without leaving the garrison too weak it was evident therefore observed he that to garrison properly such a line of forts would require at least two thousand men and even then a line of such extent might be broken through at one end before the other end could yield assistance his idea of a defensive plan was to build a strong fort at winchester the central point where all the main roads met of a wide range of scattered settlements where tidings could soonest be collected from every quarter and whence reinforcements and supplies could most readily be forwarded it was to be a grand deposit of military stores a residence for commanding officers a place of refuge for the women and children in time of alarm when the men had suddenly to take the field in a word it was to be the citadel of the frontier beside this he would have three or four large fortresses erected at convenient distances upon the frontiers with powerful garrisons so as to be able to throw out in constant succession strong scouting parties to range the country fort cumberland he condemned as being out of the province and out of the track of indian incursions  his representations with respect to military laws and regulations were equally cogent in the late act of the assembly for raising a regiment it was provided that in cases of emergency if recruits should not offer in sufficient number the militia might be drafted to supply the deficiencies but only to serve until december and not to be marched out of the province in this case said he before they have entered upon service or got the least smattering of duty they will claim a discharge if they are pursuing an enemy who has committed the most unheardof cruelties he has only to step across the potomac and he is safe then as to the limits of service they might just as easily have been enlisted for seventeen months as seven  then as to punishments death it was true had been decreed for mutiny and desertion but there was no punishment for cowardice for holding correspondence with the enemy for quitting or sleeping on ones post all capital offences according to the military codes of europe neither were there provisions for quartering or billeting soldiers or impressing wagons and other conveyances in times of exigency to crown all no courtmartial could sit out of virginia a most embarrassing regulation when troops were fifty or a hundred miles beyond the frontier he earnestly suggested amendments on all these points as well as with regard to the soldiers pay which was less than that of the regular troops or the troops of most of the other provinces  all these suggestions showing at this youthful age that forethought and circumspection which distinguished him throughout life were repeatedly and eloquently urged upon governor dinwiddie with very little effect the plan of a frontier line of twentythree forts was persisted in fort cumberland was pertinaciously kept up at a great and useless expense of men and money and the militia laws remained lax and inefficient it was decreed however that the great central fort at winchester recommended by washington should be erected  in the height of the alarm a company of one hundred gentlemen mounted and equipped volunteered their services to repair to the frontier they were headed by peyton randolph no doubt they would have conducted themselves gallantly had they been put to the test but before they arrived near the scene of danger the alarm was over about the beginning of may scouts brought in word that the tracks of the marauding savages tended toward fort duquesne as if on the return in a little while it was ascertained that they had recrossed the alleghany mountain to the ohio in such numbers as to leave a beaten track equal to that made in the preceding year by the army of braddock  the repeated inroads of the savages called for an effectual and permanent check the idea of being constantly subject to the irruptions of a deadly foe that moved with stealth and mystery and was only to be traced by its ravages and counted by its footprints discouraged all settlement of the country the beautiful valley of the shenandoah was fast becoming a deserted and a silent place her people for the most part had fled to the older settlements south of the mountains and the blue ridge was likely soon to become virtually the frontier line of the province     chapter x frontier service   throughout the summer of 1756 washington exerted himself diligently in carrying out measures determined upon for frontier security the great fortress at winchester was commenced and the work urged forward as expeditiously as the delays and perplexities incident to a badly organized service would permit it received the name of fort loudoun in honor of the commanderinchief whose arrival in virginia was hopefully anticipated  as to the sites of the frontier posts they were decided upon by washington and his officers after frequent and long consultations parties were sent out to work on them and men recruited and militia drafted to garrison them washington visited occasionally such as were in progress and near at hand in the autumn he made a tour of inspection along the whole line accompanied by his friend captain hugh mercer this tour furnished repeated proofs of the inefficiency of the militia system in one place he attempted to raise a force with which to scour a region infested by roving bands of savages after waiting several days but five men answered to his summons in another place where three companies had been ordered to the relief of a fort attacked by the indians all that could be mustered were a captain a lieutenant and seven or eight men when the militia were drafted and appeared under arms the case was not much better it was now late in the autumn their term of service by the act of the legislature expired in decemberhalf of the time therefore was lost in marching out and home their waste of provisions was enormous to be put on allowance like other soldiers they considered an indignity for want of proper military laws they were obstinate selfwilled and perverse the garrisons were weak for want of men but more so from indolence and irregularity not one was in a posture of defence few but might be surprised with the greatest ease at one fort the indians rushed from their lurkingplace pounced upon several children playing under the walls and bore them off before they were discovered another fort was surprised and many of the people massacred in the same manner  what rendered this years service peculiarly irksome and embarrassing to washington was the nature of his correspondence with governor dinwiddie that gentleman either from the natural hurry and confusion of his mind or from a real disposition to perplex was extremely ambiguous and unsatisfactory in most of his orders and replies in nothing was this disposition to perplex more apparent than in the governors replies respecting fort cumberland washington had repeatedly urged the abandonment of this fort as a place of frontier deposit being within the bounds of another province and out of the track of indian incursion so that often the alarm would not reach there until after the mischief had been effected he applied at length for particular and positive directions from the governor on this head the following says he is an exact copy of his answer fort cumberland is a kings fort and built chiefly at the charge of the colony therefore properly under our direction until a new governor is appointed now whether i am to understand this aye or no to the plain simple question asked is the fort to be continued or removed i know not but in all important matters i am directed in this ambiguous and uncertain way  governor dinwiddie subsequently made himself explicit on this point taking offence at some of washingtons comments on the military affairs on the frontier he made the stand of a selfwilled and obstinate man in the case of fort cumberland and represented it in such a light to lord loudoun as to draw from his lordship an order that it should be kept up and an implied censure of the conduct of washington in slighting a post of such paramount importance thus powerfully supported dinwiddie went so far as to order that the garrisons should be withdrawn from the stockades and small frontier forts and most of the troops from winchester to strengthen fort cumberland which was now to become headquarters by these meddlesome moves all previous arrangements were reversed everything was thrown into confusion and enormous losses and expenses were incurred governor dinwiddie had never recovered from the pique caused by the popular elevation of washington to the command in preference to his favorite colonel innes his irritation was kept alive by a little scottish faction who were desirous of disgusting washington with the service so as to induce him to resign and make way for his rival they might have carried their point during the panic at winchester had not his patriotism and his sympathy with the public distress been more powerful than his selflove he determined he said to bear up under these embarrassments in the hope of better regulations when lord loudoun should arrive to whom he looked for the future fate of virginia  while these events were occurring on the virginia frontier military events went on tardily and heavily at the north the campaign against canada hung fire the armament coming out for the purpose under lord loudoun was delayed gen abercrombie reached albany june 25th with two regiments july 12th word was received that the forts ontario and oswego were menaced by the french relief was delayed until the arrival of lord loudoun which took place on the 29th of july after some delays gen webb left albany august 12th for the relief of oswego but while the british commanders had debated fieldmarshal the marquis de montcalm had acted he was a different kind of soldier from abercrombie or loudoun a capacious mind and enterprising spirit animated a small but active and untiring frame quick in thought quick in speech quicker still in action he comprehended every thing at a glance and moved from point to point of the province with a celerity and secrecy that completely baffled his slow and pondering antagonists crown point and ticonderoga were visited and steps taken to strengthen their works then hastening to montreal he put himself at the head of a force of regulars canadians and indians ascended the st lawrence to lake ontario blocked up the mouth of the oswego by his vessels landed his guns and besieged the two forts drove the garrison out of one into the other killed the commander colonel mercer and compelled the garrisons to surrender prisoners of war his blow achieved montcalm returned in triumph to montreal  the season was now too far advanced for lord loudoun to enter upon any great military enterprise he postponed therefore the great northern campaign so much talked of and debated until the following year  circumstances had led washington to think that lord loudoun had received impressions to his prejudice by false representations of facts and that a wrong idea prevailed at headquarters respecting the state of military affairs in virginia he was anxious therefore for an opportunity of placing all these matters in a proper light and understanding that there was to be a meeting in philadelphia in the month of march between lord loudoun and the southern governors to consult about measures of defence for their respective provinces he wrote to governor dinwiddie for permission to attend it i cannot conceive writes dinwiddie in reply what service you can be of in going there as the plan concerted will in course be communicated to you and the other officers however as you seem so earnest to go i now give you leave  this ungracious reply seemed to warrant the suspicions entertained by some of washingtons friends that it was the busy pen of governor dinwiddie which had given the false representation of facts to lord loudoun about a month therefore before the time of the meeting washington addressed a long letter to his lordship explanatory of military affairs in the quarter where he had commanded in this he set forth the various defects in the militia laws of virginia the errors in its system of defence and the inevitable confusion which had thence resulted  the manner in which washington was received by lord loudoun on arriving in philadelphia showed him at once that his long explanatory letter had produced the desired effect and that his character and conduct were justly appreciated during his sojourn in philadelphia he was frequently consulted on points of frontier service and his advice was generally adopted on one point it failed he advised that an attack should be made on fort duquesne simultaneous with the attempts on canada at such time a great part of the garrison would be drawn away to aid in the defence of that province and a blow might be struck more likely to insure the peace and safety of the southern frontier than all its forts and defences lord loudoun however was not to be convinced or at least persuaded according to his plan the middle and southern provinces were to maintain a merely defensive warfare  washington was also disappointed a second time in the hope of having his regiment placed on the same footing as the regular army and of obtaining a kings commission the latter he was destined never to hold his representations with respect to fort cumberland had the desired effect in counteracting the mischievous intermeddling of dinwiddie the virginia troops and stores were ordered to be again removed to fort loudoun at winchester which once more became headquarters while fort cumberland was left to be occupied by a maryland garrison  the great plan of operations at the north was again doomed to failure the reduction of crown point on lake champlain which had long been meditated was laid aside and the capture of louisburg substituted as an acquisition of far greater importance this was a place of great consequence situated on the isle of cape breton and strongly fortified it commanded the fisheries of newfoundland overawed new england and was a main bulwark to acadia in july loudoun set sail for halifax with nearly six thousand men to join with admiral holbourne who had arrived at that port with eleven ships of the line and transports having on board six thousand men with this united force lord loudoun anticipated the certain capture of louisburg but the french were again too quick for him admiral de bois de la mothe had arrived at louisburg with seventeen ships of the line and three frigates the place was ascertained to be well fortified and garrisoned lord loudoun aware of the probability of defeat and the ruin it would bring upon british arms in america wisely though ingloriously returned to new york  scarce had the tidings of his lordships departure for louisburg reached canada when montcalm took the fort fort william henry on the southern shore of lake george was now his object colonel munro with five hundred men formed the garrison with eight thousand men montcalm invested the fort and after an obstinate resistance the brave colonel munro surrendered but not until most of his cannon were burst and his ammunition expended he obtained honorable terms montcalm demolished the fort and returned to canada  during these unfortunate operations to the north washington was stationed at winchester shorn of part of his force by a detachment to south carolina and left with seven hundred men to defend a frontier of more than three hundred and fifty miles in extent the capture and demolition of oswego by montcalm had produced a disastrous effect the whole country of the five nations was abandoned to the french the frontiers of pennsylvania maryland and virginia were harassed by repeated inroads of french and indians and washington had the mortification to see the noble valley of the shenandoah almost deserted by its inhabitants and fast relapsing into a wilderness  the year wore away on his part in the harassing service of defending a wide frontier with an insufficient and badly organized force and the vexations he experienced were heightened by continual misunderstandings with governor dinwiddie who was evidently actuated by the petty pique of a narrow and illiberal mind impatient of contradiction even when in error he took advantage of his official station to vent his spleen and gratify his petulance in a variety of ways incompatible with the courtesy of a gentleman it may excite a grave smile at the present day to find washington charged by this very smallminded man with looseness in his way of writing to him with remissness in his duty towards him and even with impertinence in the able and eloquent representations which he felt compelled to make of disastrous mismanagement in military affairs  the multiplied vexations which washington experienced from this man had preyed upon his spirits and contributed with his incessant toils and anxieties to undermine his health for some time he struggled with repeated attacks of dysentery and fever and continued in the exercise of his duties but the increased violence of his malady and the urgent advice of his friend dr craik the army surgeon induced him to relinquish his post towards the end of the year and retire to mount vernon the administration of dinwiddie however was now at an end he set sail for england in january 1758     chapter xi operations against the frenchwashingtons marriage   for several months washington was afflicted by returns of his malady accompanied by symptoms indicative as he thought of a decline a gradual improvement in his health and a change in his prospects encouraged him to continue in what really was his favorite career and at the beginning of april he was again in command at fort loudoun mr francis fauquier had been appointed successor to dinwiddie and until he should arrive mr john blair president of the council had from his office charge of the government in the latter washington had a friend who appreciated his character and services and was disposed to carry out his plans  the general aspect of affairs also was more animating under the able and intrepid administration of william pitt who had control of the british cabinet an effort was made to retrieve the disgraces of the late american campaign and to carry on the war with greater vigor the instructions for a common fund were discontinued there was no more talk of taxation by parliament lord loudoun from whom so much had been anticipated had disappointed by his inactivity and been relieved from a command in which he had attempted much and done so little  on the return of his lordship to england the general command in america devolved on majorgeneral abercrombie and the forces were divided into three detached bodies one under majorgeneral amherst was to operate in the north with the fleet under boscawen for the reduction of louisburg and the island of cape breton another under abercrombie himself was to proceed against ticonderoga and crown point on lake champlain and the third under brigadiergeneral forbes who had the charge of the middle and southern colonies was to undertake the reduction of fort duquesne the colonial troops were to be supplied like the regulars with arms ammunition tents and provisions at the expense of the government but clothed and paid by the colonies for which the king would recommend to parliament a proper compensation the provincial officers appointed by the governors and of no higher rank than colonel were to be equal in command when united in service with those who held direct from the king according to the date of their commissions by these wise provisions of mr pitt a fertile cause of heartburnings and dissensions was removed  it was with the greatest satisfaction washington saw his favorite measure at last adopted the reduction of fort duquesne and he resolved to continue in the service until that object was accomplished he had the satisfaction subsequently of enjoying the fullest confidence of general forbes who was to command the expedition who knew too well the sound judgment and practical ability evinced by him in the unfortunate campaign of braddock not to be desirous of availing himself of his counsels washington still was commanderinchief of the virginia troops now augmented by an act of the assembly to two regiments of one thousand men each one led by himself the other by colonel byrd the whole destined to make a part of the army of general forbes in the expedition against fort duquesne  before we proceed to narrate the expedition against fort duquesne however we will briefly notice the conduct of the two other expeditions which formed important parts in the plan of military operations for the year and first of that against louisburg and the island of cape breton majorgeneral amherst embarked in may with nearly twelve thousand men from halifax in the fleet of admiral boscawen with him went brigadiergeneral wolfe who was destined to gain an almost romantic celebrity on the 2d of june the fleet arrived at the bay of gabarus seven miles from louisburg boisterous weather prevented the landing until the 8th of june three divisions under brigadiers wolfe whetmore and laurens attempted the landing west of the harbor at a place feebly secured the boats forced their way through a high surf and under a heavy fire from the batteries wolfe sprang into the water when the boats grounded dashed through the surf with his men stormed the enemys breastworks and batteries and drove them from the shore by the side of wolfe was an irish youth twentyone years of age whom for his gallantry wolfe promoted to a lieutenancy his name was richard montgomery the other divisions effected a landing and louisburg was formally invested the weather continued boisterous and the siege advanced slowly chevalier drucour who commanded at louisburg made a brave defence his ships were at last all either fired or captured his cannon dismounted and being threatened with a general assault he capitulated at the earnest entreaty of the inhabitants  the second expedition was against the french forts on lakes george and champlain early in july abercrombie was on lake george with seven thousand regulars and nine thousand provincials major israel putnam who had served under johnson was present and with a scouting party reconnoitred the neighborhood upon his return abercrombie proceeded against ticonderoga the force embarked on the 5th of july in a vast flotilla of whaleboats rafts bateaux etc with abercrombie went lord howe a young nobleman who had greatly endeared himself to the army and the people they landed at the entrance of the strait leading to lake champlain formed into three columns and pushed forward the van of the centre column under lord howe encountered a detachment of the foe a severe conflict ensued the enemy were routed and lord howe was killed with him expired the masterspirit of the enterprise abercrombie fell back to the landingplace sent out detachments to secure a sawmill within two miles of the fort this done he advanced with his whole force and took post at the mill montcalm was strongly posted behind deep intrenchments with an abatis of felled trees in front of his lines the strength of his position was underrated and an assault was ordered which was repulsed with dreadful havoc after four hours of desperate and fruitless fighting abercrombie retreated to the landingplace and dismayed at the failure of the rash assault which had been made against the advice of his most judicious officers he embarked his troops and returned across the lake while stationed here planning fortifications colonel bradstreet was permitted to undertake an expedition against fort frontenac on the south side of lake ontario which was entirely successful  operations went on slowly in that part of the years campaign in which washington was immediately engagedthe expedition against fort duquesne brigadiergeneral forbes who was commanderinchief was detained at philadelphia by those delays and crosspurposes incident to military affairs in a new country colonel bouquet who was to command the advanced division took his station with a corps of regulars at raystown in the centre of pennsylvania there slowly assembled troops from various parts three thousand pennsylvanians twelve hundred and fifty south carolinians and a few hundred men from elsewhere  washington in the meantime gathered together his scattered regiment at winchester some from a distance of two hundred miles and diligently disciplined his recruits he had two virginia regiments under him amounting when complete to about nineteen hundred men seven hundred indian warriors also came lagging into his camp lured by the prospect of a successful campaign  the force thus assembling was in want of arms tents fieldequipage and almost every requisite washington had made repeated representations by letter of the destitute state of the virginia troops but without avail he was now ordered by sir john st clair the quartermastergeneral of the forces under general forbes to repair to williamsburg and lay the state of the case before the council he set off promptly on horseback attended by bishop the welltrained military servant who had served the late general braddock it proved an eventful journey though not in a military point of view in crossing a ferry of the pamunkey a branch of york river he fell in company with a mr chamberlayne who lived in the neighborhood and who in the spirit of virginian hospitality claimed him as a guest it was with difficulty washington could be prevailed on to halt for dinner so impatient was he to arrive at williamsburg and accomplish his mission  among the guests at mr chamberlaynes was a young and blooming widow mrs martha custis daughter of mr john dandridge both patrician names in the province her husband john parke custis had been dead about three years leaving her with two young children and a large fortune she is represented as being rather below the middle size but extremely well shaped with an agreeable countenance dark hazel eyes and hair and those frank engaging manners so captivating in southern women washingtons heart appears to have been taken by surprise the dinner which in those days was an earlier meal than at present seemed all too short the afternoon passed away like a dream bishop was punctual to the orders he had received on halting the horses pawed at the door but for once washington loitered in the path of duty the horses were countermanded and it was not until the next morning that he was again in the saddle spurring for williamsburg happily the white house the residence of mrs custis was in new kent county at no great distance from that city so that he had opportunities of visiting her in the intervals of business his time for courtship however was brief military duties called him back almost immediately to winchester but he feared should he leave the matter in suspense some more enterprising rival might supplant him during his absence as in the case of miss philipse at new york he improved therefore his brief opportunity to the utmost in a word before they separated they had mutually plighted their faith and the marriage was to take place as soon as the campaign against fort duquesne was at an end  on arriving at winchester he found his troops restless and discontented from prolonged inaction the inhabitants impatient of the burdens imposed on them and of the disturbances of an idle camp while the indians as he apprehended had deserted outright it was a great relief therefore when he received orders from the commanderinchief to repair to fort cumberland he arrived there on the 2d of july and proceeded to open a road between that post and headquarters at raystown thirty miles distant where colonel bouquet was stationed his troops were scantily supplied with regimental clothing the weather was oppressively warm he now conceived the idea of equipping them in the light indian hunting garb and even of adopting it himself two companies were accordingly equipped in this style and sent under the command of major lewis to headquarters the experiment was successful  the array was now annoyed by scouting parties of indians hovering about the neighborhood expresses passing between the posts were fired upon a wagoner was shot down washington sent out counterparties of cherokees colonel bouquet required that each party should be accompanied by an officer and a number of white men washington complied with the order though he considered them an encumbrance rather than an advantage on the other hand he earnestly discountenanced a proposition of colonel bouquet to make an irruption into the enemys country with a strong party of regulars such a detachment he observed could not be sent without a cumbersome train of supplies which would discover it to the enemy who must at that time be collecting his whole force at fort duquesne the enterprise therefore would be likely to terminate in a miscarriage if not in the destruction of the party we shall see that his opinion was oracular  as washington intended to retire from military life at the close of this campaign he had proposed himself to the electors of frederick county as their representative in the house of burgesses the election was coming on at winchester his friends pressed him to attend it and colonel bouquet gave him leave of absence but he declined to absent himself from his post for the promotion of his political interests there were three competitors in the field yet so high was the public opinion of his merit that though winchester had been his headquarters for two or three years past and he had occasionally enforced martial law with a rigorous hand he was elected by a large majority  on the 21st of july arrived tidings of the brilliant success of that part of the scheme of the years campaign conducted by general amherst and admiral boscawen this intelligence increased washingtons impatience at the delays of the expedition with which he was connected he wished to rival these successes by a brilliant blow in the south understanding that the commanderinchief had some thoughts of throwing a body of light troops in the advance he wrote to colonel bouquet earnestly soliciting his influence to have himself and his virginia regiment included in the detachment  he soon learnt to his surprise that the road to which his men were accustomed and which had been worked by braddocks troops in his campaign was not to be taken in the present expedition but a new one opened through the heart of pennsylvania from raystown to fort duquesne on the track generally taken by the northern traders he instantly commenced long and repeated remonstrances on the subject but the officers of the regular service had received a fearful idea of braddocks road from his own despatches wherein he had described it as lying across mountains and rocks of an excessive height vastly steep and divided by torrents and rivers whereas the pennsylvania traders who were anxious for the opening of the new road through their province described the country through which it would pass as less difficult above all it was a direct line and fifty miles nearer this route therefore to the great regret of washington was definitely adopted and sixteen hundred men were immediately thrown in the advance from raystown to work upon it  the first of september found washington still encamped at fort cumberland his troops sickly and dispirited and the brilliant expedition which he had anticipated dwindling down into a tedious operation of roadmaking at length in the month of september he received orders from general forbes to join him with his troops at raystown where he had just arrived having been detained by severe illness he was received by the general with the highest marks of respect on all occasions both in private and at councils of war that commander treated his opinions with the greatest deference he moreover adopted a plan drawn out by washington for the march of the army and an order of battle which still exists furnishing a proof of his skill in frontier warfare  it was now the middle of september yet the great body of men engaged in opening the new military road after incredible toil had not advanced above fortyfive miles to a place called loyal hannan a little beyond laurel hill colonel bouquet who commanded the division of nearly two thousand men sent forward to open this road had halted at loyal hannan to establish a military post and deposit he was upwards of fifty miles from fort duquesne and was tempted to adopt the measure so strongly discountenanced by washington of sending a party on a foray into the enemys country he accordingly detached major grant with eight hundred picked men some of them highlanders others in indian garb the part of washingtons virginian regiment sent forward by him from cumberland under command of major lewis the enterprise proved a disastrous one major grant conducted it with foolhardy bravado suffered himself to be led into an ambuscade and a scene ensued similar to that at the defeat of braddock the whole detachment was put to rout with dreadful carnage captain bullitt with fifty virginians who were in charge of the baggage formed a barricade with the wagons rallied some of the fugitives succeeded in checking the enemy for a time and collecting the wounded effected a rapid retreat lewis when surrounded by indians saved his life by surrendering to a french officer grant surrendered himself in like manner  washington who was at raystown when the disastrous news arrived was publicly complimented by general forbes on the gallant conduct of his virginian troops and bullitts behavior was a matter of great admiration the latter was soon after rewarded with a majors commission as a further mark of the high opinion now entertained of provincial troops for frontier service washington was given the command of a division partly composed of his own men to keep in the advance of the main body clear the roads throw out scouting parties and repel indian attacks  it was the 5th of november before the whole army assembled at loyal hannan winter was now at hand and upwards of fifty miles of wilderness were yet to be traversed by a road not yet formed before they could reach fort duquesne again washingtons predictions seemed likely to be verified and the expedition to be defeated by delay for in a council of war it was determined to be impracticable to advance further with the army that season three prisoners however who were brought in gave such an account of the weak state of the garrison at fort duquesne its want of provisions and the defection of the indians that it was determined to push forward the march was accordingly resumed but without tents or baggage and with only a light train of artillery  washington still kept the advance after leaving loyal hannan the road presented traces of the late defeat of grant being strewed with human bones at length the army arrived in sight of fort duquesne advancing with great precaution and expecting a vigorous defence but that formidable fortress the terror and scourge of the frontier and the object of such warlike enterprise fell without a blow the recent successes of the english forces in canada particularly the capture and destruction of fort frontenac had left the garrison without hope of reinforcements and supplies the whole force at the time did not exceed five hundred men and the provisions were nearly exhausted the commander therefore waited only until the english army was within one days march when he embarked his troops at night in bateaux blew up his magazines set fire to the fort and retreated down the ohio by the light of the flames on the 25th of november washington with the advanced guard marched in and planted the british flag on the yet smoking ruins  the ruins of the fortress were now put in a defensible state and garrisoned by two hundred men from washingtons regiment the name was changed to that of fort pitt in honor of the illustrious british minister it has since been modified into pittsburg and designates one of the most busy and populous cities of the interior the reduction of fort duquesne terminated as washington had foreseen the troubles and dangers of the southern frontier the french domination of the ohio was at an end the indians as usual paid homage to the conquering power and a treaty of peace was concluded with all the tribes between the ohio and the lakes  with this campaign ended for the present the military career of washington his great object was attained the restoration of quiet and security to his native province and having abandoned all hope of attaining rank in the regular army and his health being much impaired he gave up his commission at the close of the year and retired from the service followed by the applause of his fellowsoldiers and the gratitude and admiration of all his countrymen  his marriage with mrs custis took place shortly after his return it was celebrated on the 6th of january 1759 at the white house the residence of the bride in the good old hospitable style of virginia amid a joyous assemblage of relatives and friends     chapter xii campaigns in the northwashington at mount vernon   before following washington into the retirement of domestic life we think it proper to notice the events which closed the great struggle between england and france for empire in america abercrombie had been superseded in command by majorgeneral amherst according to the plan of operations for 1759 general wolfe was to ascend the st lawrence in a fleet of ships of war with eight thousand men and lay siege to quebec general amherst in the meantime was to advance against ticonderoga and crown point reduce them and push on to the st lawrence to cooperate with wolfe a third expedition under brigadiergeneral prideaux aided by sir william johnson was to attack fort niagara having reduced this fort he was to proceed against montreal  the last mentioned expedition was the first executed the fort was invested by general prideaux early in july the garrison six hundred strong made a resolute defence prideaux was killed on the 20th of july while visiting his trenches and general gage was sent to succeed him in command meantime the siege was pressed with vigor by sir william johnson learning that twelve hundred regular troops were hastening to the rescue of the besieged he despatched a force to intercept them they met within distant view of the fort and after a sharp conflict the french were routed and pursued through the woods the garrison having now no alternative surrendered the terms offered being honorable  meanwhile general amherst with twelve thousand men had descended lake george on the 23d they debarked and proceeded toward ticonderoga montcalm was absent for the protection of quebec the garrison did not exceed four hundred men a defence against amhersts overwhelming force would have been madness and bourlamarque who was in command consequently dismantled the fortifications as he did likewise those of crown point and retreated down the lake instead of following him up and hastening to cooperate with wolfe general amherst proceeded to repair the forts though neither was in present danger of being attacked his delay enabled the enemy to rally their forces at isle aux noix and deprive wolfe of the aid essential to the general success of the campaign  wolfe ascended the st lawrence in june with him were colonel guy carlton and lieutenantcolonel william howe both destined to achieve celebrity in the annals of the american revolution the troops debarked on the isle of orleans a little below quebec quebec is built around the point of a rocky promontory and flanked by precipices the st lawrence sweeps by it on the right and the st charles on the left the place was not then as now rendered impregnable by fortifications montcalm commanded the post his forces were drawn out along the northern shore below the city from the st charles to the falls of montmorency and their position was secured by intrenchments wolfe established batteries at the west point of the isle of orleans and at point levi on the south bank of the st lawrence within cannon range of the city from point levi the city was cannonaded the lower town was reduced to rubbish and many houses in the upper town were fired anxious for a decisive action wolfe on the 9th of july crossed to the north bank of the st lawrence and encamped below the montmorency he determined to attack montcalm in his camp however difficult to be approached and however strongly posted the plan of attack was complicated orders were misunderstood confusion ensued and the attack proved a disastrous failure news was now received of the capture of fort niagara ticonderoga and crown point their successes fired the sensitive commander and he declared he would never return without success he made a reconnoitering expedition above quebec rugged cliffs rose from the waters edge above them was a plain called the plains of abraham by which the upper town might be approached on its weakest side it was determined to attempt reaching the plains by scaling the cliffs at night on the 13th of september in flatbottomed boats the troops passed the town undetected landed in a cove called cape diamond scrambled and struggled with difficulty up a cragged path put to flight a sergeants guard at the summit and by break of day were in possession of the plains  montcalm was thunderstruck when intelligence of the fact was brought to him he hastened to the defence of the approaches to the city a desperate battle ensued on the fated plains wolfe who was in front of the english line was wounded in the wrist a second ball struck him in the breast he was borne to the rear it is all over with me said he and desired those about him to lay him down presently they cried they run they run see how they run who runs asked wolfe eagerly rousing from a lethargy into which he had fallen the enemy sir they give way everywhere now god be praised i will die in peace exclaimed the dying hero and turning upon his side expired the english had indeed obtained a complete victory and among the enemys losses was that of their gallant leader montcalm the english now in strong position on the plains hastened to fortify preparations were now made for the attack by both army and fleet on the upper and lower town but the spirit of the garrison was broken and they capitulated on the 17th of september  had amherst followed up his successors the years campaign would have ended in the subjugation of canada his delay gave de levi the successor of montcalm time to rally and struggle for the salvation of the province he laid siege to quebec in the spring and was on the eve of success when the arrival of a british fleet reversed the scene the besieging army retreated and made a last stand at montreal but being invested with an overwhelming force defence was hopeless on the 8th of september montreal and with it all canada surrendered and the contest between france and england for dominion in america was ended  for three months after his marriage washington resided with his bride at the white house during his sojourn there he repaired to williamsburg to take his seat in the house of burgesses by a vote of the house it had been determined to greet his installation by a signal testimonial of respect accordingly as soon as he took his seat mr robinson the speaker in eloquent language dictated by the warmth of private friendship returned thanks on behalf of the colony for the distinguished military services he had rendered to his country washington rose to reply blushedstammeredtrembled and could not utter a word sit down mr washington said the speaker with a smile your modesty equals your valor and that surpasses the power of any language i possess such was washingtons first launch into civil life in which he was to be distinguished by the same judgment devotion courage and magnanimity exhibited in his military career he attended the house frequently during the remainder of the session after which he conducted his bride to his favorite abode of mount vernon i am now i believe he writes fixed in this seat with an agreeable partner for life and i hope to find more happiness in retirement than i ever experienced in the wide and bustling world  mount vernon was his harbor of repose where he repeatedly furled his sail and fancied himself anchored for life no impulse of ambition tempted him thence nothing but the call of his country and his devotion to the public good the place was endeared to him by the remembrance of his brother lawrence and of the happy days he had passed here with that brother in the days of boyhood but it was a delightful place in itself and well calculated to inspire the rural feeling the mansion was beautifully situated on a swelling height crowned with wood and commanding a magnificent view up and down the potomac the grounds immediately about it were laid out somewhat in the english taste the estate was apportioned into separate farms devoted to different kinds of culture each having its allotted laborers much however was still covered with wild woods seamed with deep dells and runs of water and indented with inlets haunts of deer and lurkingplaces of foxes  these were as yet the aristocratical days of virginia the estates were large and continued in the same families by entails many of the wealthy planters were connected with old families in england the young men especially the elder sons were often sent to finish their education there and on their return brought out the tastes and habits of the mother country the governors of virginia were from the higher ranks of society and maintained a corresponding state a style of living prevailed that has long since faded away the houses were spacious commodious liberal in all their appointments and fitted to cope with the freehanded open hearted hospitality of the owners nothing was more common than to see handsome services of plate elegant equipages and superb carriagehorsesall imported from england  washington by his marriage had added above one hundred thousand dollars to his already considerable fortune and was enabled to live in ample and dignified style his intimacy with the fairfaxes and his intercourse with british officers of rank had perhaps had their influence on his mode of living he had his chariot and four with black postilions in livery for the use of mrs washington and her lady visitors as for himself he always appeared on horseback his stable was well filled and admirably regulated his stud was thoroughbred and in excellent order  a large virginia estate in those days was a little empire the mansionhouse was the seat of government with its numerous dependencies such as kitchens smokehouse workshops and stables in this mansion the planter ruled supreme his steward or overseer was his prime minister and executive officer he had his legion of house negroes for domestic service and his host of field negroes for the culture of tobacco indian corn and other crops and for other outofdoor labor their quarter formed a kind of hamlet apart composed of various huts with little gardens and poultry yards all well stocked and swarms of little negroes gambolling in the sunshine then there were large wooden edifices for curing tobacco the staple and most profitable production and mills for grinding wheat and indian corn of which large fields were cultivated for the supply of the family and the maintenance of the negroes  washington carried into his rural affairs the same method activity and circumspection that had distinguished him in military life he kept his own accounts posted up his books and balanced them with mercantile exactness the products of his estate became so noted for the faithfulness as to quality and quantity with which they were put up that it is said any barrel of flour that bore the brand of george washington mount vernon was exempted from the customary inspection in the west india ports  he was an early riser often before daybreak in the winter when the nights were long he breakfasted at seven in summer at eight in winter two small cups of tea and three or four cakes of indian meal called hoe cakes formed his frugal repast immediately after breakfast he mounted his horse and visited those parts of the estate where any work was going on seeing to every thing with his own eyes and often aiding with his own hand dinner was served at two oclock he ate heartily but was no epicure nor critical about his food his beverage was small beer or cider and two glasses of old madeira he took tea of which he was very fond early in the evening and retired for the night about nine oclock  illustration mount vernon vol i  washington delighted in the chase in the hunting season when he rode out early in the morning to visit distant parts of the estate where work was going on he often took some of the dogs with him for the chance of starting a fox which he occasionally did though he was not always successful in killing him he was a bold rider and an admirable horseman though he never claimed the merit of being an accomplished foxhunter in the height of the season however he would be out with the foxhounds two or three times a week accompanied by his guests at mount vernon and the gentlemen of the neighborhood especially the fairfaxes of belvoir of which estate his friend george william fairfax was now the proprietor on such occasions there would be a hunting dinner at one or other of those establishments at which convivial repasts washington is said to have enjoyed himself with unwonted hilarity  the waters of the potomac also afforded occasional amusement in fishing and shooting the fishing was sometimes on a grand scale when the herrings came up the river in shoals and the negroes of mount vernon were marshalled forth to draw the seine which was generally done with great success canvasback ducks abounded at the proper season and the shooting of them was one of washingtons favorite recreations the river border of his domain however was somewhat subject to invasion an oysterman once anchored his craft at the landingplace and disturbed the quiet of the neighborhood by the insolent and disorderly conduct of himself and crew it took a campaign of three days to expel these invaders from the premises a more summary course was pursued with another interloper this was a vagabond who infested the creeks and inlets which bordered the estate lurking in a canoe among the reeds and bushes and making great havoc among the canvasback ducks he had been warned off repeatedly but without effect as washington was one day riding about the estate he heard the report of a gun from the margin of the river spurring in that direction he dashed through the bushes and came upon the culprit just as he was pushing his canoe from shore the latter raised his gun with a menacing look but washington rode into the stream seized the painter of the canoe drew it to shore sprang from his horse wrested the gun from the hands of the astonished delinquent and inflicted on him a lesson in lynch law that effectually cured him of all inclination to trespass again on these forbidden shores  occasionally he and mrs washington would pay a visit to annapolis at that time the seat of government of maryland and partake of the gayeties which prevailed during the session of the legislature dinners and balls abounded and there were occasional attempts at theatricals the latter was an amusement for which washington always had a relish though he never had an opportunity of gratifying it effectually neither was he disinclined to mingle in the dance and we remember to have heard venerable ladies who had been belles in his day pride themselves on having had him for a partner though they added he was apt to be a ceremonious and grave one  in this round of rural occupation rural amusements and social intercourse washington passed several tranquil years the halcyon season of his life his marriage was unblessed with children but those of mrs washington experienced from him parental care and affection and the formation of their minds and manners was one of the dearest objects of his attention his domestic concerns and social enjoyments however were not permitted to interfere with his public duties he was active by nature and eminently a man of business by habit as judge of the county court and member of the house of burgesses he had numerous calls upon his time and thoughts and was often drawn from home for whatever trust he undertook he was sure to fulfil with scrupulous exactness  about this time we find him engaged with other men of enterprise in a project to drain the great dismal swamp and render it capable of cultivation this vast morass was about thirty miles long and ten miles wide and its interior but little known with his usual zeal and hardihood he explored it on horseback and on foot in many parts it was covered with dark and gloomy woods of cedar cypress and hemlock or deciduous trees the branches of which were hung with long drooping moss other parts were almost inaccessible from the density of brakes and thickets entangled with vines briers and creeping plants and intersected by creeks and standing pools in the centre of the morass he came to a great piece of water six miles long and three broad called drummonds pond but more poetically celebrated as the lake of the dismal swamp it was more elevated than any other part of the swamp and capable of feeding canals by which the whole might be traversed having made the circuit of it and noted all its characteristics he encamped for the night upon the firm land which bordered it and finished his explorations on the following day in the ensuing session of the virginia legislature the association in behalf of which he had acted was chartered under the name of the dismal swamp company and to his observations and forecast may be traced the subsequent improvement and prosperity of that once desolate region     chapter xiii colonial discontents   tidings of peace gladdened the colonies in the spring of 1763 the definite treaty between england and france had been signed at fontainbleau now it was trusted there would be an end to these horrid ravages that had desolated the interior of the country the month of may proved the fallacy of such hopes in that month the famous insurrection of the indian tribes broke out which from the name of the chief who was its prime mover and masterspirit is commonly called pontiacs war the delawares and shawnees and other of those emigrant tribes of the ohio among whom washington had mingled were foremost in this conspiracy some of the chiefs who had been his allies had now taken up the hatchet against the english the plot was deep laid and conducted with indian craft and secrecy at a concerted time an attack was made upon all the posts from detroit to fort pitt late fort duquesne several of the small stockaded forts the places of refuge of woodland neighborhoods were surprised and sacked with remorseless butchery the frontiers of pennsylvania maryland and virginia were laid waste and a considerable time elapsed before the frontier was restored to tolerable tranquility  fortunately washingtons retirement from the army prevented his being entangled in this savage war which raged throughout the regions he had repeatedly visited or rather his active spirit had been diverted into a more peaceful channel for he was at this time occupied in the enterprise just noticed for draining the great dismal swamp  public events were now taking a tendency which without any political aspirations or forethought of his own was destined gradually to bear him away from his quiet home and individual pursuits and launch him upon a grander and wider sphere of action than any in which he had hitherto been engaged  whatever might be the natural affection of the colonies for the mother countryand there are abundant evidences to prove that it was deeprooted and strongit had never been properly reciprocated they yearned to be considered as children they were treated by her as changelings her navigation laws had shut their ports against foreign vessels obliged them to export their productions only to countries belonging to the british crown to import european goods solely from england and in english ships and had subjected the trade between the colonies to duties all manufactures too in the colonies that might interfere with those of the mother country had been either totally prohibited or subjected to intolerable restraints the acts of parliament imposing these prohibitions and restrictions had at various times produced sore discontent and opposition on the part of the colonies there was nothing however to which the jealous sensibilities of the colonies were more alive than to any attempt of the mother country to draw a revenue from them by taxation from the earliest period of their existence they had maintained the principle that they could only be taxed by a legislature in which they were represented  in 1760 there was an attempt in boston to collect duties on foreign sugar and molasses imported into the colonies writs of assistance were applied for by the customhouse officers authorizing them to break open ships stores and private dwellings in quest of articles that had paid no duty and to call the assistance of others in the discharge of their odious task the merchants opposed the execution of the writ on constitutional grounds the question was argued in court where james otis spoke so eloquently in vindication of american rights that all his hearers went away ready to take arms against writs of assistance another ministerial measure was to instruct the provincial governors to commission judges not as theretofore during good behavior but during the kings pleasure new york was the first to resent this blow at the independence of the judiciary the lawyers appealed to the public through the press against an act which subjected the halls of justice to the prerogative their appeals were felt beyond the bounds of the province and awakened a general spirit of resistance  thus matters stood at the conclusion of the war one of the first measures of ministers on the return of peace was to enjoin on all naval officers stationed on the coasts of the american colonies the performance under oath of the duties of customhouse officers for the suppression of smuggling this fell ruinously upon a clandestine trade which had long been connived at between the english and spanish colonies profitable to both but especially to the former and beneficial to the mother country opening a market to her manufactures as a measure of retaliation the colonists resolved not to purchase british fabrics but to clothe themselves as much as possible in home manufactures the demand for british goods in boston alone was diminished upwards of 10000 pounds sterling in the course of a year  in 1764 george grenville now at the head of government ventured upon the policy from which walpole his predecessor had wisely abstained early in march the eventful question was debated whether they had a right to tax america it was decided in the affirmative next followed a resolution declaring it proper to charge certain stamp duties in the colonies and plantations but no immediate step was taken to carry it into effect mr grenville however gave notice to the american agents in london that he should introduce such a measure on the ensuing session of parliament in the meantime parliament perpetuated certain duties on sugar and molassesheretofore subjects of complaint and oppositionnow reduced and modified so as to discourage smuggling and thereby to render them more productive duties also were imposed on other articles of foreign produce or manufacture imported into the colonies to reconcile the latter to these impositions it was stated that the revenue thus raised was to be appropriated to their protection and security in other words to the support of a standing army intended to be quartered upon them we have here briefly stated but a part of what burke terms an infinite variety of paper chains extending through no less than twentynine acts of parliament from 1660 to 1764 by which the colonies had been held in thraldom  the new englanders were the first to take the field against the project of taxation they denounced it as a violation of their rights as freemen of their chartered rights by which they were to tax themselves for their support and defence of their rights as british subjects who ought not to be taxed but by themselves or their representatives they sent petitions and remonstrances on the subject to the king the lords and the commons in which they were seconded by new york and virginia all was in vain in march 1765 the act was passed according to which all instruments in writing were to be executed on stamped paper to be purchased from the agents of the british government what was more all offences against the act could be tried in any royal marine or admiralty court throughout the colonies however distant from the place where the offence had been committed thus interfering with that most inestimable right a trial by jury  it was an ominous sign that the first burst of opposition to this act should take place in virginia that colony had hitherto been slow to accord with the republican spirit of new england founded at an earlier period of the reign of james i before kingly prerogative and ecclesiastical supremacy had been made matters of doubt and fierce dispute it had grown up in loyal attachment to king church and constitution was aristocratical in its tastes and habits and had been remarked above all the other colonies for its sympathies with the mother country moreover it had not so many pecuniary interests involved in these questions as had the people of new england being an agricultural rather than a commercial province but the virginians are of a quick and generous spirit readily aroused on all points of honorable pride and they resented the stamp act as an outrage on their rights  washington occupied his seat in the house of burgesses when on the 29th of may the stamp act became a subject of discussion among the burgesses sat patrick henry a young lawyer who had recently distinguished himself by pleading against the exercise of the royal prerogative in church matters and who was now for the first time a member of the house rising in his place he introduced his celebrated resolutions declaring that the general assembly of virginia had the exclusive right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants and that whoever maintained the contrary should be deemed an enemy to the colony the speaker mr robinson objected to the resolutions as inflammatory henry vindicated them as justified by the nature of the case went into an able and constitutional discussion of colonial rights and an eloquent exposition of the manner in which they had been assailed  the resolutions were modified to accommodate them to the scruples of the speaker and some of the members but their spirit was retained the lieutenantgovernor fauquier startled by this patriotic outbreak dissolved the assembly and issued writs for a new election but the clarion had sounded  washington returned to mount vernon full of anxious thoughts inspired by the political events of the day and the legislative scene which he witnessed his recent letters had spoken of the state of peaceful tranquillity in which he was living those now written from his rural home show that he fully participated in the popular feeling and that while he had a presentiment of an arduous struggle his patriotic mind was revolving means of coping with it in the meantime from his quiet abode at mount vernon he seemed to hear the patriotic voice of patrick henry which had startled the house of burgesses echoing throughout the land and rousing one legislative body after another to follow the example of that of virginia at the instigation of the general court or assembly of massachusetts a congress was held in new york in october composed of delegates from massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland and south carolina in this they denounced the acts of parliament imposing taxes on them without their consent and extending the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty as violations of their rights and liberties as natural born subjects of great britain and prepared an address to the king and a petition to both houses of parliament praying for redress similar petitions were forwarded to england by the colonies not represented in the congress  the very preparations for enforcing the stamp act called forth popular tumults in various places in boston the stamp distributor was hanged in effigy his windows were broken a house intended for a stamp office was pulled down and the effigy burnt in a bonfire made of the fragments in virginia mr george mercer had been appointed distributor of stamps but on his arrival at williamsburg publicly declined officiating it was a fresh triumph to the popular cause the bells were rung for joy the town was illuminated and mercer was hailed with acclamations of the people the 1st of november the day when the act was to go into operation was ushered in with portentous solemnities there was great tolling of bells and burning of effigies in the new england colonies at boston the ships displayed their colors but halfmast high many shops were shut funeral knells resounded from the steeples and there was a grand autodafe in which the promoters of the act were paraded and suffered martyrdom in effigy at new york the printed act was carried about the streets on a pole surmounted by a deaths head with a scroll bearing the inscription the folly of england and ruin of america  these are specimens of the marks of popular reprobation with which the stamp act was universally nullified no one would venture to carry it into execution in fact no stamped paper was to be seen all had been either destroyed or concealed all transactions which required stamps to give them validity were suspended or were executed by private compact the courts of justice were closed until at length some conducted their business without stamps union was becoming the watchword the merchants of new york philadelphia boston and such other colonies as had ventured publicly to oppose the stamp act agreed to import no more british manufactures after the 1st of january unless it should be repealed so passed away the year 1765  the dismissal of mr grenville from the cabinet gave a temporary change to public affairs the stamp act was repealed on the 18th of march 1766 to the great joy of the sincere friends of both countries still there was a fatal clause in the repeal which declared that the king with the consent of parliament had power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of america in all cases whatsoever as the people of america were contending for principles not mere pecuniary interests this reserved power of the crown and parliament left the dispute still open and chilled the feeling of gratitude which the repeal might otherwise have inspired further aliment for public discontent was furnished by other acts of parliament one imposed duties on glass pasteboard white and red lead painters colors and tea the duties to be collected on the arrival of the articles in the colonies another empowered naval officers to enforce the acts of trade and navigation another wounded to the quick the pride and sensibilities of new york the mutiny act had recently been extended to america with an additional clause requiring the provincial assemblies to provide the troops sent out with quarters and to furnish them with fire beds candles and other necessaries at the expense of the colonies the governor and assembly of new york refused to comply with this requisition as to stationary forces insisting that it applied only to troops on a march an act of parliament now suspended the powers of the governor and assembly until they should comply  boston continued to be the focus of what the ministerialists termed sedition the general court of massachusetts not content with petitioning the king for relief against the recent measures of parliament especially those imposing taxes as a means of revenue drew up a circular calling on the other colonial legislatures to join with them in suitable efforts to obtain redress in the ensuing session governor sir francis bernard called upon them to rescind the resolution on which the circular was foundedthey refused to comply and the general court was consequently dissolved the governors of other colonies required of their legislatures an assurance that they would not reply to the massachusetts circularthese legislatures likewise refused compliance and were dissolved all this added to the growing excitement  nothing however produced a more powerful effect upon the public sensibilities throughout the country than certain military demonstrations at boston in consequence of repeated collisions between the people of that place and the commissioners of customs two regiments of troops were sent from halifax to overawe the disaffected citizens it was resolved in a town meeting that the king had no right to send troops thither without the consent of the assembly the selectmen accordingly refused to find quarters for the soldiers and while some encamped on the common others were quartered to the great indignation of the public in faneuil hall  throughout these public agitations washington endeavored to preserve his equanimity still he was too true a patriot not to sympathize in the struggle for colonial rights which now agitated the whole country and we find him gradually carried more and more into the current of political affairs a letter written on the 5th of april 1769 to his friend george mason shows the important stand he was disposed to take in the previous year the merchants and traders of boston salem connecticut and new york had agreed to suspend for a time the importation of all articles subject to taxation similar resolutions had recently been adopted by the merchants of philadelphia washingtons letter is emphatic in support of the measure at a time writes he when our lordly masters in great britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of american freedom it seems highly necessary that something should be done to avert the stroke and maintain the liberty which we have derived from our ancestors  mason in his reply concurred with him in opinion our all is at stake said he and the little conveniences and comforts of life when set in competition with our liberty ought to be rejected not with reluctance but with pleasure the result of the correspondence was the draft by the latter of a plan of association the members of which were to pledge themselves not to import or use any articles of british merchandise or manufacture subject to duty this paper washington was to submit to the consideration of the house of burgesses at the approaching session in the month of may  the legislature of virginia opened on this occasion with a brilliant pageant while military force was arrayed to overawe the republican puritans of the east it was thought to dazzle the aristocratical descendants of the cavaliers by the reflex of regal splendor lord botetourt one of the kings lords of the bedchamber had recently come out as governor of the province junius described him as a cringing bowing fawning swordbearing courtier the words of political satirists however are always to be taken with great distrust however his lordship may have bowed in presence of royalty he elsewhere conducted himself with dignity and won general favor by his endearing manners  he had come out however with a wrong idea of the americans they had been represented to him as factious immoral and prone to sedition but vain and luxurious and easily captivated by parade and splendor the latter foibles were aimed at in his appointment and fitting out it was supposed that his titled rank would have its effect then to prepare him for occasions of ceremony a coach of state was presented to him by the king his opening of the session was in the style of the royal opening of parliament he proceeded in due parade from his dwelling to the capitol in his state coach drawn by six milkwhite horses having delivered his speech according to royal form he returned home with the same pomp and circumstance  the time had gone by however for such display to have the anticipated effect the virginian legislators penetrated the intention of this pompous ceremonial and regarded it with a depreciating smile sterner matters occupied their thoughts they had come prepared to battle for their rights and their proceedings soon showed lord botetourt how much he had mistaken them spirited resolutions were passed denouncing the recent act of parliament imposing taxes the power to do which on the inhabitants of this colony was legally and constitutionally vested in the house of burgesses with consent of the council and of the king or of his governor for the time being copies of these resolutions were ordered to be forwarded by the speaker to the legislatures of the other colonies with a request for their concurrence  other proceedings of the burgesses showed their sympathy with their fellowpatriots of new england a joint address of both houses of parliament had recently been made to the king assuring him of their support in any further measures for the due execution of the laws in massachusetts and beseeching him that all persons charged with treason or misprision of treason committed within that colony since the 30th of december 1767 might be sent to great britain for trial as massachusetts had no general assembly at this time having been dissolved by government the legislature of virginia generously took up the cause an address to the king was resolved on stating that all trials for treason or misprision of treason or for any crime whatever committed by any person residing in a colony ought to be in and before his majestys courts within said colony and beseeching the king to avert from his royal subjects those dangers and miseries which would ensue from seizing and carrying beyond sea any person residing in america suspected of any crime whatever thereby depriving them of the inestimable privilege of being tried by a jury from the vicinage as well as the liberty of producing witnesses on such trial  lord botetourt was astonished and dismayed when he heard of these hightoned proceedings repairing to the capitol on the following day at noon he summoned the speaker and members to the council chamber and addressed them in the following words mr speaker and gentlemen of the house of burgesses i have heard of your resolves and augur ill of their effects you have made it my duty to dissolve you and you are dissolved accordingly  the spirit conjured up by late decrees of parliament was not so easily allayed the burgesses adjourned to a private house peyton randolph their late speaker was elected moderator washington now brought forward a draft of the articles of association concerted between him and george mason they formed the groundwork of an instrument signed by all present pledging themselves neither to import nor use any goods merchandise or manufactures taxed by parliament to raise a revenue in america this instrument was sent throughout the country for signature and the scheme of nonimportation hitherto confined to a few northern colonies was soon universally adopted  the popular ferment in virginia was gradually allayed by the amiable and conciliatory conduct of lord botetourt his lordship soon became aware of the erroneous notions with which he had entered upon office his semiroyal equipage and state were laid aside he examined into public grievances became a strenuous advocate for the repeal of taxes and authorized by his despatches from the ministry assured the public that such repeal would speedily take place his assurance was received with implicit faith and for a while virginia was quieted  in the month of may the general court of massachusetts hitherto prorogued met according to charter a committee immediately waited on the governor declaring that it was impossible to do business with dignity and freedom while the town was invested by sea and land and a military guard was stationed at the statehouse and they requested the governor as his majestys representative to have such forces removed out of the port and gates of the city during the session of the assembly the governor replied that he had no authority over either the ships or troops the court persisted in refusing to transact business while so circumstanced and the governor was obliged to transfer the session to cambridge there he addressed a message to that body in july requiring funds for the payment of the troops and quarters for their accommodation the assembly after ample discussion of past grievances resolved that the establishment of a standing army in the colony in a time of peace was an invasion of natural rights that a standing army was not known as a part of the british constitution and that the sending an armed force to aid the civil authority was unprecedented and highly dangerous to the people  after waiting some days without receiving an answer to his message the governor sent to know whether the assembly would or would not make provision for the troops in their reply they followed the example of the legislature of new york by declining to furnish funds for the purposes specified being incompatible with their own honor and interest and their duty to their constituents they were in consequence again prorogued to meet in boston on the 10th of january  so stood affairs in massachusetts in the meantime the nonimportation associations being generally observed throughout the colonies produced the effect on british commerce which washington had anticipated and parliament was incessantly importuned by petitions from british merchants imploring its intervention to save them from ruin  early in 1770 an important change took place in the british cabinet the duke of grafton suddenly resigned and the reins of government passed into the hands of lord north he was a man of limited capacity but a favorite of the king and subservient to his narrow colonial policy his administration so eventful to america commenced with an error in the month of march an act was passed revoking all the duties laid in 1767 excepting that on tea this single tax was continued as he observed to maintain the parliamentary right of taxationthe very right which was the grand object of contest here was the stumblingblock at the threshold of lord norths administration in vain the members of the opposition urged that this single exception while it would produce no revenue would keep alive the whole cause of contention that so long as a single external duty was enforced the colonies would consider their rights invaded and would remain unappeased lord north was not to be convinced on the very day in which this ominous bill was passed in parliament a sinister occurrence took place in boston some of the young men of the place insulted the military while under arms the latter resented it the young men after a scuffle were put to flight and pursued the alarm bells rang a mob assembled the customhouse was threatened the troops in protecting it were assailed with clubs and stones and obliged to use their firearms before the tumult could be quelled four of the populace were killed and several wounded the troops were now removed from the town which remained in the highest state of exasperation and this untoward occurrence received the opprobrious and somewhat extravagant name of the boston massacre  in virginia the public discontents which had been allayed by the conciliatory conduct of lord botetourt and by his assurances made on the strength of letters received from the ministry that the grievances complained of would be speedily redressed now broke out with more violence than ever the virginians spurned the mockremedy which left the real cause of complaint untouched his lordship also felt deeply wounded by the disingenuousness of ministers which had led him into such a predicament and wrote home demanding his discharge before it arrived an attack of bilious fever acting upon a delicate and sensitive frame enfeebled by anxiety and chagrin laid him in his grave he left behind him a name endeared to the virginians by his amiable manners his liberal patronage of the arts and above all by his zealous intercession for their rights     chapter xiv expedition to the ohiotea tax   in the midst of these popular turmoils washington was induced by public as well as private considerations to make another expedition to the ohio he was one of the virginia board of commissioners appointed at the close of the late war to settle the military accounts of the colony among the claims which came before the board were those of the officers and soldiers who had engaged to serve until peace under the proclamation of governor dinwiddie holding forth a bounty of two hundred thousand acres of land to be apportioned among them according to rank those claims were yet unsatisfied washington became the champion of those claims and an opportunity now presented itself for their liquidation the six nations by a treaty in 1768 had ceded to the british crown in consideration of a sum of money all the lands possessed by them south of the ohio land offices would soon be opened for the sale of them washington determined at once to visit the lands thus ceded affix his mark on such tracts as he should select and apply for a grant from government in behalf of the soldiers claim  washington had for a companion in this expedition his friend and neighbor dr craik they set out on the 5th of october with three negro attendants two belonging to washington and one to the doctor the whole party was mounted and there was a led horse for the baggage after twelve days travelling they arrived at fort pitt late fort duquesne it was garrisoned by two companies of royal irish commanded by a captain edmonson a hamlet of about twenty loghouses inhabited by indian traders had sprung up within three hundred yards of the fort and was called the town it was the embryo city of pittsburg now so populous at one of the houses a tolerable frontier inn they took up their quarters but during their brief sojourn they were entertained with great hospitality at the fort here at dinner washington met his old acquaintance george croghan who had figured in so many capacities and experienced so many vicissitudes on the frontier he was now colonel croghan deputyagent to sir william johnson  on the day following the repast at the fort washington visited croghan at his abode on the alleghany river where he found several of the chiefs of the six nations assembled one of them the white mingo by name made him a speech accompanied as usual by a belt of wampum  at pittsburg the travellers left their horses and embarked in a large canoe to make a voyage down the ohio as far as the great kanawha colonel croghan engaged two indians for their service and an interpreter named john nicholson the colonel and some of the officers of the garrison accompanied them as far as logstown the scene of washingtons early diplomacy and his first interview with the halfking here they breakfasted together after which they separated the colonel and his companions cheering the voyagers from the shore as the canoe was borne off by the current of the beautiful ohio  washingtons propensities as a sportsman had here full play deer were continually to be seen coming down to the waters edge to drink or browsing along the shore there were innumerable flocks of wild turkeys and streaming flights of ducks and geese so that as the voyagers floated along they were enabled to load their canoe with game at night they encamped on the river bank lit their fire and made a sumptuous hunters repast about seventyfive miles below pittsburg the voyagers landed at a mingo town which they found in a stir of warlike preparationsixty of the warriors being about to set off on a foray into the cherokee country against the catawbas  on the 24th about three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at captema creek and two days more of voyaging brought them to an indian hunting camp near the mouth of the muskingum here it was necessary to land and make a ceremonious visit for the chief of the hunting party was kiashuta a seneca sachem the head of the river tribes he was noted to have been among the first to raise the hatchet in pontiacs conspiracy and almost equally vindictive with that potent warrior as washington approached the chieftain he recognized him for one of the indians who had accompanied him on his mission to the french in 1753 kiashuta retained a perfect recollection of the youthful ambassador though seventeen years had matured him into thoughtful manhood with hunters hospitality he gave him a quarter of a fine buffalo just slain but insisted that they should encamp together for the night  at the mouth of the great kanawha the voyagers encamped for a day or two to examine the lands in the neighborhood and washington set up his mark upon such as he intended to claim on behalf of the soldiers grant here washington was visited by an old sachem who approached him with great reverence at the head of several of his tribe and addressed him through nicholson the interpreter he had heard he said of his being in that part of the country and had come from a great distance to see him on further discourse the sachem made known that he was one of the warriors in the service of the french who lay in ambush on the banks of the monongahela and wrought such havoc in braddocks army he declared that he and his young men had singled out washington as he made himself conspicuous riding about the field of battle with the generals orders and had fired at him repeatedly but without success whence they had concluded that he was under the protection of the great spirit had a charmed life and could not be slain in battle at the great kanawha washingtons expedition down the ohio terminated having visited all the points he wished to examine his return to fort pitt and thence homeward affords no incident worthy of note  the discontents of virginia which had been partially soothed by the amiable administration of lord botetourt were irritated anew under his successor the earl of dunmore this nobleman had for a short time held the government of new york when appointed to that of virginia he lingered for several months at his former post in the meantime he sent his military secretary captain foy to attend to the despatch of business until his arrival awarding to him a salary and fees to be paid by the colony the pride of the virginians was piqued at his lingering at new york as if he preferred its gayety and luxury to the comparative quiet and simplicity of williamsburg the first measure of the assembly at its opening was to demand by what right he had awarded a salary and fees to his secretary without consulting it and to question whether it was authorized by the crown his lordship had the good policy to rescind the unauthorized act and in so doing mitigated the ire of the assembly but he lost no time in proroguing a body which from various symptoms appeared to be too independent and disposed to be untractable  he continued to prorogue it from time to time seeking in the interim to conciliate the virginians and soothe their irritated pride at length after repeated prorogations he was compelled by circumstances to convene it on the 1st of march 1773 washington was prompt in his attendance on the occasion and foremost among the patriotic members who eagerly availed themselves of this long wished for opportunity to legislate upon the general affairs of the colonies one of their most important measures was the appointment of a committee of eleven persons whose business it should be to obtain the most clear and authentic intelligence of all such acts and resolutions of the british parliament or proceedings of administration as may relate to or affect the british colonies and to maintain with their sister colonies a correspondence and communication the plan thus proposed by their noble patriotic sister colony of virginia was promptly adopted by the people of massachusetts and soon met with general concurrence these corresponding committees in effect became the executive power of the patriot party producing the happiest concert of design and action throughout the colonies  notwithstanding the decided part taken by washington in the popular movement very friendly relations existed between him and lord dunmore the latter appreciated his character and sought to avail himself of his experience in the affairs of the province it was even concerted that washington should accompany his lordship on an extensive tour which the latter intended to make in the course of the summer along the western frontier a melancholy circumstance occurred to defeat this arrangement  we have spoken of washingtons paternal conduct towards the two children of mrs washington the daughter miss custis had long been an object of extreme solicitude she was of a fragile constitution and for some time past had been in very declining health early in the present summer symptoms indicated a rapid change for the worse washington was absent from home at the time on his return to mount vernon he found her in the last stage of consumption though not a man given to bursts of sensibility he is said on the present occasion to have evinced the deepest affliction kneeling by her bedside and pouring out earnest prayers for her recovery she expired on the 19th of june in the seventeenth year of her age this of course put an end to washingtons intention of accompanying lord dunmore to the frontier he remained at home to console mrs washington in her afflictionfurnishing his lordship however with travelling hints and directions and recommending proper guides  the general covenant throughout the colonies against the use of taxed tea had operated disastrously against the interests of the east india company and produced an immense accumulation of the proscribed article in their warehouses to remedy this lord north brought in a bill 1773 by which the company were allowed to export their teas from england to any part whatever without paying export duty this by enabling them to offer their teas at a low price in the colonies would he supposed tempt the americans to purchase large quantities thus relieving the company and at the same time benefiting the revenue by the impost duty confiding in the wisdom of this policy the company disgorged their warehouses freighted several ships with tea and sent them to various parts of the colonies this brought matters to a crisis one sentiment one determination pervaded the whole continent taxation was to receive its definitive blow whoever submitted to it was an enemy to his country from new york and philadelphia the ships were sent back unladen to london in charleston the tea was unloaded and stored away in cellars and other places where it perished at boston the action was still more decisive the ships anchored in the harbor some small parcels of tea were brought on shore but the sale of them was prohibited  to settle the matter completely and prove that on a point of principle they were not to be trifled with a number of inhabitants disguised as indians boarded the ships in the night 18th december broke open all the chests of tea and emptied the contents into the sea the general opposition of the colonies to the principle of taxation had given great annoyance to government but this individual act concentrated all its wrath upon boston a bill was forthwith passed in parliament commonly called the boston port bill by which all lading and unlading of goods wares and merchandise were to cease in that town and harbor on and after the 4th of june and the officers of the customs to be transferred to salem  another law passed soon after altered the charter of the province decreeing that all counsellors judges and magistrates should be appointed by the crown and hold office during the royal pleasure this was followed by a third intended for the suppression of riots and providing that any person indicted for murder or other capital offence committed in aiding the magistracy might be sent by the governor to some other colony or to great britain for trial  such was the bolt of parliamentary wrath fulminated against the devoted town of boston before it fell there was a session in may of the virginia house of burgesses the social position of lord dunmore had been strengthened in the province by the arrival of his lady and a numerous family of sons and daughters the house of burgesses was opened in form and one of its first measures was an address of congratulation to the governor on the arrival of his lady it was followed up by an agreement among the members to give her ladyship a splendid ball on the 27th of the month  all things were going on smoothly and smilingly when a letter received through the corresponding committee brought intelligence of the vindictive measure of parliament by which the port of boston was to be closed on the approaching 1st of june the letter was read in the house of burgesses and produced a general burst of indignation all other business was thrown aside and this became the sole subject of discussion a protest against this and other recent acts of parliament was entered upon the journal of the house and a resolution was adopted on the 24th of may setting apart the 1st of june as a day of fasting prayer and humiliation on the following morning the burgesses were summoned to attend lord dunmore in the council chamber where he made them the following laconic speech mr speaker and gentlemen of the house of burgesses i have in my hand a paper published by order of your house conceived in such terms as reflect highly upon his majesty and the parliament of great britain which makes it necessary for me to dissolve you and you are dissolved accordingly  as on a former occasion the assembly though dissolved was not dispersed the members adjourned to the long room of the old raleigh tavern and passed resolutions denouncing the boston port bill as a most dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty and rights of all north america recommending their countrymen to desist from the use not merely of tea but of all kinds of east indian commodities pronouncing an attack on one of the colonies to enforce arbitrary taxes an attack on all and ordering the committee of correspondence to communicate with the other corresponding committees on the expediency of appointing deputies from the several colonies of british america to meet annually in general congress at such place as might be deemed expedient to deliberate on such measures as the united interests of the colonies might require  this was the first recommendation of a general congress by any public assembly though it had been previously proposed in town meetings at new york and boston a resolution to the same effect was passed in the assembly of massachusetts before it was aware of the proceedings of the virginia legislature the measure recommended met with prompt and general concurrence throughout the colonies and the fifth day of september next ensuing was fixed upon for the meeting of the first congress which was to be held at philadelphia  on the 29th letters arrived from boston giving the proceedings of a town meeting recommending that a general league should be formed throughout the colonies suspending all trade with great britain but twentyfive members of the late house of burgesses including washington were at that time remaining in williamsburg they held a meeting on the following day at which peyton randolph presided as moderator after some discussion it was determined to issue a printed circular bearing their signatures and calling a meeting of all the members of the late house of burgesses on the 1st of august to take into consideration this measure of a general league the circular recommended them also to collect in the meantime the sense of their respective counties  in the meantime the boston port bill had been carried into effect on the 1st of june the harbor of boston was closed at noon and all business ceased the two other parliamentary acts altering the charter of massachusetts were to be enforced no public meetings excepting the annual town meetings in march and may were to be held without permission of the governor  general thomas gage had recently been appointed to the military command of massachusetts and the carrying out of these offensive acts as lieutenantcolonel he had led the advance guard on the field of braddocks defeat fortune had since gone well with him rising in the service he had been governor of montreal and had succeeded amherst in the command of the british forces on this continent he was linked to the country also by domestic ties having married into one of the most respectable families of new jersey in the various situations in which he had hitherto been placed he had won esteem and rendered himself popular but with all his experience in america he had formed a most erroneous opinion of the character of the people the americans said he to the king will be lions only as long as the english are lambs and he engaged with five regiments to keep boston quiet  the manner in which his attempts to enforce the recent acts of parliament were resented showed how egregiously he was in error at the suggestion of the assembly a paper was circulated through the province by the committee of correspondence entitled a solemn league and covenant the subscribers to which bound themselves to break off all intercourse with great britain from the 1st of august until the colony should be restored to the enjoyment of its chartered rights and to renounce all dealings with those who should refuse to enter into this compact  the very title of league and covenant had an ominous sound and startled general gage he issued a proclamation denouncing it as illegal and traitorous furthermore he encamped a force of infantry and artillery on boston common as if prepared to enact the lion an alarm spread through the adjacent country boston is to be blockaded boston is to be reduced to obedience by force or famine the spirit of the yeomanry was aroused they sent in word to the inhabitants promising to come to their aid if necessary and urging them to stand fast to the faith     chapter xv the first general congress   shortly after washingtons return to mount vernon in the latter part of june he presided as moderator at a meeting of the inhabitants of fairfax county wherein after the recent acts of parliament had been discussed a committee was appointed with himself as chairman to draw up resolutions expressive of the sentiments of the present meeting and to report the same at a general meeting of the county to be held in the courthouse on the 18th of july  the committee met according to appointment with washington as chairman the resolutions framed at the meeting insisted as usual on the right of selfgovernment and the principle that taxation and representation were in their nature inseparable that the various acts of parliament for raising revenue taking away trials by jury ordering that persons might be tried in a different country from that in which the cause of accusation originated closing the port of boston abrogating the charter of massachusetts bay etc etc were all part of a premeditated design and system to introduce arbitrary government into the colonies that the sudden and repeated dissolutions of assemblies whenever they presumed to examine the illegality of ministerial mandates or deliberated on the violated rights of their constituents were part of the same system and calculated and intended to drive the people of the colonies to a state of desperation and to dissolve the compact by which their ancestors bound themselves and their posterity to remain dependent on the british crown the resolutions furthermore recommended the most perfect union and cooperation among the colonies solemn covenants with respect to nonimportation and nonintercourse and a renunciation of all dealings with any colony town or province that should refuse to agree to the plan adopted by the general congress they also recommended a dutiful petition and remonstrance from the congress to the king asserting their constitutional rights and privileges lamenting the necessity of entering into measures that might be displeasing declaring their attachment to his person family and government and their desire to continue in dependence upon great britain beseeching him not to reduce his faithful subjects of america to desperation and to reflect that from our sovereign there can be but one appeal  the resolutions reported by the committee were adopted and washington was chosen a delegate to represent the county at the general convention of the province to be held at williamsburg on the 1st of august on the date appointed the convention assembled washington appeared on behalf of fairfax county and presented the resolutions already cited as the sense of his constituents he is said by one who was present to have spoken in support of them in a strain of uncommon eloquence the convention was six days in session resolutions in the same spirit with those passed in fairfax county were adopted and peyton randolph richard henry lee george washington patrick henry richard bland benjamin harrison and edmund pendleton were appointed delegates to represent the people of virginia in the general congress  general gage from the time of taking command at boston had been perplexed how to manage its inhabitants had they been hotheaded impulsive and prone to paroxysm his task would have been comparatively easy but it was the cool shrewd common sense by which all their movements were regulated that confounded him there was no uproar no riots everything was awfully systematic and according to rule town meetings were held in which public rights and public measures were eloquently discussed by john adams josiah quincy and other eminent men over these meetings samuel adams presided as moderator a man clear in judgment calm in conduct inflexible in resolution deeply grounded in civil and political history and infallible on all points of constitutional law  gage was at a loss how to act it would not do to disperse these assemblages by force of arms for the people who composed them mingled the soldier with the polemic and like their prototypes the covenanters of yore if prone to argue were as ready to fight so the meetings continued to be held pertinaciously faneuil hall was at times unable to hold them and they swarmed from that revolutionary hive into old south church the liberty tree became a rallying place for any popular movement and a flag hoisted on it was saluted by all processions as the emblem of the popular cause  when the time approached for the meeting of the general congress at philadelphia washington was joined at mount vernon by patrick henry and edmund pendleton and they performed the journey together on horseback it was a noble companionship henry was then in the youthful vigor and elasticity of his bounding genius ardent acute fanciful eloquent pendleton schooled in public life a veteran in council with native force of intellect and habits of deep reflection washington in the meridian of his days mature in wisdom comprehensive in mind sagacious in foresight such were the apostles of liberty repairing on their august pilgrimage to philadelphia from all parts of the land to lay the foundations of a mighty empire  congress assembled on monday the 5th of september in a large room in carpenters hall there were fiftyone delegates representing all the colonies excepting georgia the meeting has been described as awfully solemn the most eminent men of the various colonies were now for the first time brought together they were known to each other by fame but were personally strangers the object which had called them together was of incalculable magnitude the liberties of no less than three millions of people with that of all their posterity were staked on the wisdom and energy of their councils  there being an inequality in the number of delegates from the different colonies a question arose as to the mode of voting whether by colonies by the poll or by interests after some debate it was determined that each colony should have but one vote whatever might be the number of its delegates the deliberations of the house were to be with closed doors and nothing but the resolves promulgated unless by order of the majority to give proper dignity and solemnity to the proceedings it was moved on the following day that each morning the session should be opened by prayer in the course of the day a rumor reached philadelphia that boston had been cannonaded by the british it produced a strong sensation and when congress met on the following morning 7th the effect was visible in every countenance the delegates from the east were greeted with a warmer grasp of the hand by their associates from the south the rumor proved to be erroneous  owing to closed doors and the want of reporters no record exists of the discussions and speeches made in the first congress the first public measure was a resolution declaratory of their feelings with regard to the recent acts of parliament violating the rights of the people of massachusetts and of their determination to combine in resisting any force that might attempt to carry those acts into execution  a committee of two from each province reported a series of resolutions which were adopted and promulgated by congress as a declaration of colonial rights in this were enumerated their natural rights to the enjoyment of life liberty and property and their rights as british subjects among the latter was participation in legislative councils this they could not exercise through representatives in parliament they claimed therefore the power of legislating in their provincial assemblies consenting however to such acts of parliament as might be essential to the regulation of trade but excluding all taxation internal or external for raising revenue in america the common law of england was claimed as a birthright including the right of trial by a jury of the vicinage of holding public meetings to consider grievances and of petitioning the king the benefits of all such statutes as existed at the time of the colonization were likewise claimed together with the immunities and privileges granted by royal charters or secured by provincial laws the maintenance of a standing army in any colony in time of peace without the consent of its legislature was pronounced contrary to law the exercise of the legislative power in the colonies by a council appointed during pleasure by the crown was declared to be unconstitutional and destructive to the freedom of american legislation then followed a specification of the acts of parliament passed during the reign of george iii infringing and violating these rights these werethe sugar act the stamp act the two acts for quartering troops the tea act the act suspending the new york legislature the two acts for the trial in great britain of offences committed in america the boston port bill the act for regulating the government of massachusetts and the quebec act  to these grievous acts and measures it was added americans cannot submit but in hopes their fellow subjects in great britain will on a revision of them restore us to that state in which both countries found happiness and prosperity we have for the present only resolved to pursue the following peaceable measures 1st to enter into a nonimportation nonconsumption and nonexportation agreement or association 2d to prepare an address to the people of great britain and a memorial to the inhabitants of british america 3d to prepare a loyal address to his majesty the abovementioned association was accordingly formed and committees were to be appointed in every county city and town to maintain it vigilantly and strictly  masterly state papers were issued by congress in conformity to the resolutions viz a petition to the king drafted by mr dickinson of philadelphia an address to the people of canada by the same hand inviting them to join the league of the colonies another to the people of great britain drafted by john jay of new york and a memorial to the inhabitants of the british colonies by richard henry lee of virginia  the congress remained in session fiftyone days every subject according to adams was discussed with a moderation an acuteness and a minuteness equal to that of queen elizabeths privy council the papers issued by it have deservedly been pronounced masterpieces of practical talent and political wisdom from the secrecy that enveloped its discussions we are ignorant of the part taken by washington in the debates the similarity of the resolutions however in spirit and substance to those of the fairfax county meeting in which he presided and the coincidence of the measures adopted with those therein recommended show that he had a powerful agency in the whole proceedings of this eventful assembly patrick henry being asked on his return home whom he considered the greatest man in congress replied if you speak of eloquence mr rutledge of south carolina is by far the greatest orator but if you speak of solid information and sound judgment colonel washington is unquestionably the greatest man on that floor  on the breaking up of congress washington hastened back to mount vernon where his presence was more than usually important to the happiness of mrs washington from the loneliness caused by the recent death of her daughter and the absence of her son the cheerfulness of the neighborhood had been diminished of late by the departure of george william fairfax for england to take possession of estates which had devolved to him in that kingdom his estate of belvoir so closely allied with that of mount vernon by family ties and reciprocal hospitality was left in charge of a steward or overseer through some accident the house took fire and was burnt to the ground it was never rebuilt the course of political events which swept washington from his quiet home into the current of public and military life prevented william fairfax who was a royalist though a liberal one from returning to his once happy abode and the hospitable intercommunion of mount vernon and belvoir was at an end for ever     chapter xvi military measuresaffairs at lexington   the rumor at the opening of congress of the cannonading of boston had been caused by measures of governor gage the public mind in boston and its vicinity had been rendered excessively jealous and sensitive by the landing and encamping of artillery upon the common and welsh fusiliers on fort hill and by the planting of four large fieldpieces on boston neck the only entrance to the town by land the country people were arming and disciplining themselves in every direction and collecting and depositing arms and ammunition in places where they would be at hand in case of emergency gage on the other hand issued orders that the munitions of war in all the public magazines should be brought to boston one of these magazines was the arsenal in the northwest part of charlestown between medford and cambridge two companies of the kings troops passed silently in boats up mystic river in the night took possession of a large quantity of gunpowder deposited there and conveyed it to castle williams intelligence of this sacking of the arsenal flew with lightning speed through the neighborhood in the morning several thousands of patriots were assembled at cambridge weapon in hand and were with difficulty prevented from marching upon boston to compel a restitution of the powder in the confusion and agitation a rumor stole out into the country that boston was to be attacked followed by another that the ships were cannonading the town and the soldiers shooting down the inhabitants the whole country was forthwith in arms numerous bodies of the connecticut people had made some marches before the report was contradicted  gage on the 1st of september before this popular agitation had issued writs for an election of an assembly to meet at salem in october seeing however the irritated state of the public mind he now countermanded the same by proclamation the people disregarding the countermand carried the election and ninety of the new members thus elected met at the appointed time they waited a whole day for the governor to attend administer the oaths and open the session but as he did not make his appearance they voted themselves a provincial congress and chose for president of it john hancocka man of great wealth popular and somewhat showy talents and ardent patriotism and eminent from his social position this selfconstituted body adjourned to concord about twenty miles from boston quietly assumed supreme authority and issued a remonstrance to the governor virtually calling him to account for his military operations in fortifying boston neck and collecting warlike stores about him thereby alarming the fears of the whole province and menacing the lives and property of the bostonians  general gage overlooking the irregularity of its organization entered into explanations with the assembly but failed to give satisfaction as winter approached he found his situation more and more critical boston was the only place in massachusetts that now contained british forces and it had become the refuge of all the tories of the province that is to say of all those devoted to the british government there was animosity between them and the principal inhabitants among whom revolutionary principles prevailed the town itself almost insulated by nature and surrounded by a hostile country was like a place besieged  the provincial congress conducted its affairs with the order and system so formidable to general gage having adopted a plan for organizing the militia it had nominated general officers two of whom artemas ward and seth pomeroy had accepted the executive powers were vested in a committee of safety this was to determine when the services of the militia were necessary was to call them forthto nominate their officers to the congressto commission them and direct the operations of the army another committee was appointed to furnish supplies to the forces when called out hence named the committee of supplies under such auspices the militia went on arming and disciplining itself in every direction  arrangements had been made for keeping up an active correspondence between different parts of the country and spreading an alarm in case of any threatening danger under the direction of the committees just mentioned large quantities of military stores had been collected and deposited at concord and worcester  this semibelligerent state of affairs in massachusetts produced a general restlessness throughout the land the weakhearted apprehended coming troubles the resolute prepared to brave them military measures hitherto confined to new england extended to the middle and southern provinces and the roll of the drum resounded through the villages virginia was among the first to buckle on its armor it had long been a custom among its inhabitants to form themselves into independent companies equipped at their own expense having their own peculiar uniform and electing their own officers though holding themselves subject to militia law they had hitherto been selfdisciplined but now they continually resorted to washington for instruction and advice considering him the highest authority on military affairs he was frequently called from home therefore in the course of the winter and spring to different parts of the country to review independent companies all of which were anxious to put themselves under his command as fieldofficer  mount vernon therefore again assumed a military tone as in former days when he took his first lessons there in the art of war two occasional and important guests in this momentous crisis were general charles lee1 and major horatio gates2 to washington the visits of these gentlemen were extremely welcome at this juncture from their military knowledge and experience especially as much of it had been acquired in america in the same kind of warfare if not the very same campaigns in which he himself had mingled both were interested in the popular cause lee was full of plans for the organization and disciplining of the militia and occasionally accompanied washington in his attendance on provincial reviews he was subsequently very efficient at annapolis in promoting and superintending the organization of the maryland militia  footnote 1 general charles lee was an englishman by birth and a highly cultivated production of european warfare he was born in 1731 and may almost be said to have been cradled in the army for he received a commission by the time he was eleven years of age he served in the french war of america in 1762 obtained a colonels commission and went with burgoyne to portugal having a caustic pen he undertook to write on colonial questions and thereby lost the favor of the ministry he then went to poland won the favor of king stanislaus in 1769 obtained the rank of majorgeneral in the polish army and served in a campaign against the turks leaving the polish army he led a restless life about europe and in 1773 coming to america openly espoused the colonial cause he was a man of eccentric habits caustic humor extensive military experience and was considered a prodigious acquisition to the patriot cause  footnote 2 major horatio gates was an englishman by birth when twenty he served as a volunteer under cornwallis governor of halifax next as captain under braddock accompanied general monckton as aidedecamp to the west indies gained credit at the capture of martinico and was promoted to the rank of major his promotion did not equal his expectations and went to england and failing to attain his desires came to virginia in 1772 and purchased an estate in berkeley county where he settled he was now fortysix years of age  in the month of march the second virginia convention was held at richmond washington attended as delegate from fairfax county in this assembly patrick henry with his usual ardor and eloquence advocated measures for embodying arming and disciplining a militia force and providing for the defence of the colony washington joined him in the conviction and was one of a committee that reported a plan for carrying those measures into effect he was not an impulsive man to raise the battle cry but the executive man to marshal the troops into the field and carry on the war  while the spirit of revolt was daily gaining strength and determination in america a strange infatuation reigned in the british councils while the wisdom and eloquence of chatham were exerted in vain in behalf of american rights an empty braggadocio elevated to a seat in parliament was able to captivate the attention of the members and influence their votes by gross misrepresentations of the americans and their cause this was no other than colonel grant the same shallow soldier who had been guilty of a foolhardy bravado before the walls of fort duquesne which brought slaughter and defeat upon his troops we are told that he entertained parliament especially the ministerial side of the house with ludicrous stories of the cowardice of americans this taunting and braggart speech was made in the face of the conciliatory bill of the venerable chatham devised with a view to redress the wrongs of america the councils of the arrogant and scornful prevailed and instead of the proposed bill further measures of a stringent nature were adopted coercive of some of the middle and southern colonies but ruinous to the trade and fisheries of new england  at length the bolt so long suspended fell the troops at boston had been augmented to about four thousand men goaded on by the instigations of the tories and alarmed by the energetic measures of the whigs general gage now resolved to deal the latter a crippling blow this was to surprise and destroy their magazine of military stores at concord about twenty miles from boston it was to be effected on the night of the 18th of april by a force detached for the purpose preparations were made with great secrecy boats for the transportation of troops were launched and moored under the sterns of the menofwar grenadiers and light infantry were relieved from duty and held in readiness on the 18th officers were stationed on the roads leading from boston to prevent any intelligence of the expedition getting into the country at night orders were issued by general gage that no person should leave the town about ten oclock from eight to nine hundred men grenadiers light infantry and marines commanded by lieutenantcolonel smith embarked in the boats at the foot of boston common and crossed to lechmere point in cambridge whence they were to march silently and without beat of drum to the place of destination  the measures of general gage had not been shrouded in all the secrecy he imagined dr joseph warren one of the committee of safety had observed the preparatory disposition of the boats and troops and surmised some sinister intention he sent notice of these movements to john hancock and samuel adams both members of the provincial congress but at that time privately sojourning with a friend at lexington a design on the magazine at concord was suspected and the committee of safety ordered that the cannon collected there should be secreted and part of the stores removed on the night of the 18th dr warren sent off two messengers by different routes to give the alarm that the kings troops were actually sallying forth the messengers got out of boston just before the order of general gage went into effect to prevent any one from leaving the town about the same time a lantern was hung out of an upper window of the north church in the direction of charlestown this was a preconcerted signal to the patriots of that place who instantly despatched swift messengers to rouse the country  in the meantime colonel smith set out on his nocturnal march from lechmere point by an unfrequented path across marshes where at times the troops had to wade through water he had proceeded but a few miles when alarm guns booming through the night air and the clang of village bells showed that the news of his approach was travelling before him and the people were rising he now sent back to general gage for a reinforcement while major pitcairn was detached with six companies to press forward and secure the bridges at concord  pitcairn advanced rapidly capturing every one that he met or overtook within a mile and a half of lexington however a horseman was too quick on the spur for him and galloping to the village gave the alarm that the redcoats were coming drums were beaten guns fired by the time that pitcairn entered the village about seventy or eighty of the yeomanry in military array were mustered on the green near the church the sound of drum and the array of men in arms indicated a hostile determination pitcairn halted his men within a short distance of the church and ordered them to prime and load they then advanced at double quick time the major riding forward ordered the rebels as he termed them to disperse the order was disregarded a scene of confusion ensued with firing on both sides which party commenced it has been a matter of dispute the firing of the americans was irregular and without much effect that of the british was more fatal eight of the patriots were killed and ten wounded and the whole put to flight colonel smith soon arrived with the residue of the detachment and they all marched on towards concord about six miles distant  the alarm had reached that place in the dead hour of the preceding night the church bell roused the inhabitants they gathered together in anxious consultation the militia and minute men seized their arms and repaired to the parade ground near the church exertions were now made to remove and conceal the military stores a scout who had been sent out for intelligence brought word that the british had fired upon the people at lexington and were advancing upon concord there was great excitement and indignation part of the militia marched down the lexington road to meet them but returned reporting their force to be three times that of the americans the whole of the militia now retired to an eminence about a mile from the centre of the town and formed themselves into two battalions  about seven oclock the british came in sight they entered in two divisions by different roads concord is traversed by a river of the same name having two bridges the north and the south the grenadiers and light infantry took post in the centre of the town while strong parties of light troops were detached to secure the bridges and destroy the military stores two hours were expended in the work of destruction without much success so much of the stores having been removed or concealed during all this time the yeomanry from the neighboring towns were hurrying in with such weapons as were at hand and joining the militia on the height until the little cloud of war gathering there numbered about four hundred and fifty about ten oclock a body of three hundred undertook to dislodge the british from the north bridge as they approached the latter fired upon them killing two and wounding a third the patriots returned the fire with spirit and effect the british retreated to the main body the americans pursuing them across the bridge  by this time all the military stores which could be found had been destroyed colonel smith therefore made preparations for a retreat about noon he commenced his retrograde march for boston it was high time his troops were jaded by the night march and the mornings toils and skirmishings  the country was thoroughly alarmed the yeomanry were hurrying from every quarter to the scene of action as the british began their retreat the americans began the work of sore and galling retaliation along the open road the former were harassed incessantly by rustic marksmen who took deliberate aim from behind trees or over stone fences it was in vain they threw out flankers and endeavored to dislodge their assailants each pause gave time for other pursuers to come within reach and open attacks from different quarters for several miles they urged their way along woody defiles or roads skirted with fences and stone walls the retreat growing more and more disastrous before reaching lexington colonel smith received a severe wound in the leg and the situation of the retreating troops was becoming extremely critical when about two oclock they were met by lord percy with a brigade of one thousand men and two fieldpieces opening his brigade to the right and left he received the retreating troops into a hollow square where fainting and exhausted they threw themselves on the ground to rest his lordship showed no disposition to advance upon their assailants but contented himself with keeping them at bay with his fieldpieces which opened a vigorous fire from an eminence  hitherto the provincials being hasty levies without a leader had acted from individual impulse without much concert but now general heath was upon the ground he was one of those authorized to take command when the minute men should be called out dr warren also arrived on horseback having spurred from boston on receiving news of the skirmishing in the subsequent part of the day he was one of the most active and efficient men in the field his presence like that of general heath regulated the infuriated ardor of the militia and brought it into system  lord percy having allowed the troops a short interval for repose and refreshment continued the retreat toward boston as soon as he got under march the galling assault by the pursuing yeomanry was recommenced in flank and rear the british soldiery irritated in turn acted as if in an enemys country houses and shops were burnt down in lexington private dwellings along the road were plundered and their inhabitants maltreated their march became more and more impeded by the number of their wounded lord percy narrowly escaped death from a musketball which struck off a button of his waistcoat the provincials pressed upon him in rear others were advancing from roxbury dorchester and milton colonel pickering with the essex militia seven hundred strong was at hand there was danger of being intercepted in the retreat to charlestown the fieldpieces were again brought into play to check the ardor of the pursuit but they were no longer objects of terror the pursuit terminated a little after sunset at charlestown common where general heath brought the minute men to a halt  in this memorable affair the british loss was seventythree killed one hundred and seventyfour wounded and twentysix missing among the slain were eighteen officers the loss of the americans was fortynine killed thirtynine wounded and five missing this was the first blood shed in the revolutionary struggle the cry went through the land none felt the appeal more than the old soldiers of the french war it roused john stark of new hampshirea trapper and hunter in his youth a veteran in indian warfare a campaigner under abercrombie and amherst within ten minutes after receiving the alarm he was spurring towards the seacoast equally alert was his old comrade in frontier exploits colonel israel putnam3 a man on horseback with a drum passed through his neighborhood in connecticut proclaiming british violence at lexington putnam was in the field ploughing assisted by his son in an instant the team was unyoked the plough left in the furrow the lad sent home to give word of his fathers departure and putnam on horseback in his working garb urging with all speed to the camp  footnote 3 israel putnam was a soldier of native growth he had served at louisburg fort duquesne and crown point had signalized himself in indian warfare been captured by the savages tortured and rescued from the stake at the eleventh hour since the peace he had resided on his farm at pomfret in connecticut  the news reached virginia at a critical moment lord dunmore obeying a general order issued by the ministry to all the provincial governors had seized upon the military munitions of the province here was a similar measure to that of gage the cry went forth that the subjugation of the colonies was to be attempted all virginia was in combustion the standard of liberty was reared in every county there was a general cry to arms washington was looked to from various quarters to take command his old comrade in arms hugh mercer was about marching down to williamsburg at the head of a body of resolute men seven hundred strong entitled the friends of constitutional liberty and america whom he had organized and drilled in fredericksburg and nothing but a timely concession of lord dunmore with respect to some powder which he had seized prevented his being beset in his palace     chapter xvii capture of ticonderoga and crown pointwashington appointed commanderinchief   at the eastward the march of the revolution went on with accelerated speed thirty thousand men had been deemed necessary for the defence of the country the provincial congress of massachusetts resolved to raise thirteen thousand six hundred as its quota circular letters also were issued by the committee of safety urging the towns to enlist troops with all speed and calling for military aid from the other new england provinces  their appeals were promptly answered bodies of militia and parties of volunteers from new hampshire rhode island and connecticut hastened to join the minute men of massachusetts in forming a camp in the neighborhood of boston the command of the camp was given to general artemas ward already mentioned he was a native of shrewsbury in massachusetts and a veteran of the seven years warhaving served as lieutenantcolonel under abercrombie  as affairs were now drawing to a crisis and war was considered inevitable some bold spirits in connecticut conceived a project for the outset this was the surprisal of the old forts of ticonderoga and crown point already famous in the french war their situation on lake champlain gave them the command of the main route to canada so that the possession of them would be allimportant in case of hostilities they were feebly garrisoned and negligently guarded and abundantly furnished with artillery and military stores so much needed by the patriot army this scheme was set on foot in the purlieus as it were of the provincial legislature of connecticut then in session it was not openly sanctioned by that body but secretly favored and money lent from the treasury to those engaged in it sixteen men were thus enlisted in connecticut a greater number in massachusetts but the greatest accession of force was from what was called the new hampshire grants this was a region forming the present state of vermont it had long been a disputed territory claimed by new york and new hampshire the settlers had resisted the attempts of new york to eject them and formed themselves into an association called the green mountain boys with ethan allen at their head he and his lieutenants seth warner and remember baker were outlawed by the legislature of new york and allen was becoming a kind of robin hood among the mountains when the present crisis changed the relative position of things as if by magic boundary feuds were forgotten amid the great questions of colonial rights ethan allen at once stepped forward a patriot and volunteered with his green mountain boys to serve in the popular cause thus reinforced the party now two hundred and seventy strong pushed forward to castleton a place within a few miles of the head of lake champlain here a council of war was held on the 2d of may ethan allen was placed at the head of the expedition at this juncture benedict arnold afterwards so sadly renowned arrived at castleton he too had conceived the project of surprising ticonderoga and crown point his plan had been approved by the massachusetts committee of safety and he had received a colonels commission he claimed the right to command the expedition but the green mountain boys would follow no leader but allen arnold was fain to acquiesce the party arrived at shoreham opposite ticonderoga on the night of the 9th of may the boats were few and by daybreak a part of the force only had crossed allen announced his intention to make a dash at the fort at once before the garrison should wake  they mounted the hill briskly but in silence guided by a boy from the neighborhood the day dawned as allen arrived at a sally port a sentry pulled trigger on him but his piece missed fire he retreated through a covered way allen and his men followed another sentry was struck down by allen and begged for quarter it was granted on condition of his leading the way instantly to the quarters of the commandant captain delaplace who was yet in bed being arrived there allen thundered at the door and demanded a surrender of the fort by this time his followers had formed into two lines on the paradeground and given three hearty cheers the commandant appeared at his door halfdressed he gazed at allen in bewildered astonishment by whose authority do you act exclaimed he in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress replied allen with a flourish of his sword and an oath which we do not care to subjoin there was no disputing the point the garrison like the commander had been startled from sleep and made prisoners as they rushed forth in their confusion a surrender accordingly took place a great supply of military and naval stores so important in the present crisis was found in the fortress  colonel seth warner was now sent with a detachment against crown point which surrendered on the 12th of may without firing a gun the whole garrison being a sergeant and twelve men here were taken upward of a hundred cannon a plan was also concerted to surprise st johns on the sorel river the frontier post of canada it was led by arnold and was eminently successful a kings sloop of seventy tons with two brass sixpounders four bateaux and many valuable stores were captured the approach of troops from montreal rendered it necessary to abandon the post  thus a partisan band unpractised in the art of war had by a series of daring exploits and almost without the loss of a man won for the patriots the command of lakes george and champlain and thrown open the great highway to canada  the second general congress assembled at philadelphia on the 10th of may peyton randolph was again elected as president but being obliged to return and occupy his place as speaker of the virginia assembly john hancock of massachusetts was elevated to the chair  a lingering feeling of attachment to the mother country struggling with the growing spirit of selfgovernment was manifested in the proceedings of this remarkable body many of those most active in vindicating colonial rights and washington among the number still indulged the hope of an eventual reconciliation while few entertained or at least avowed the idea of complete independence a second humble and dutiful petition to the king was moved but met with strong opposition john adams condemned it as an imbecile measure calculated to embarrass the proceedings of congress he was for prompt and vigorous action other members concurred with him  a federal union was formed leaving to each colony the right of regulating its internal affairs according to its own individual constitution but vesting in congress the power of making peace or war of entering into treaties and alliances of regulating general commerce in a word of legislating on all such matters as regarded the security and welfare of the whole community the executive power was to be vested in a council of twelve chosen by congress from among its own members and to hold office for a limited time such colonies as had not sent delegates to congress might yet become members of the confederacy by agreeing to its conditions georgia which had hitherto hesitated soon joined the league which thus extended from nova scotia to florida  congress lost no time in exercising their federated powers in virtue of them they ordered the enlistment of troops the construction of forts in various parts of the colonies the provision of arms ammunition and military stores while to defray the expense of these and other measures avowedly of selfdefence they authorized the emission of notes to the amount of three millions of dollars bearing the inscription of the united colonies the faith of the confederacy being pledged for their redemption  the public sense of washingtons military talents and experience was evinced in his being chairman of all the committees appointed for military affairs most of the rules and regulations for the army and the measures for defence were devised by him  the situation of the new england army actually besieging boston became an early and absorbing consideration it was without munitions of war without arms clothing or pay in fact without legislative countenance or encouragement unless sanctioned and assisted by congress there was danger of its dissolution all this was the subject of much discussion out of doors the disposition to uphold the army was general but the difficult question was who should be commanderinchief there was a southern party in congress who were urgent for the appointment of a southern general to command and so many of our stanchest men says adams were in the plan that we could carry nothing without it on the other hand hancock himself had an ambition to be appointed to the command the opinion however evidently inclined in favor of washington adams rising in his place one day urged upon congress that they should adopt the army at cambridge and appoint a general he then proceeded to advance the name of washington the subject was postponed to a future day on the 15th of june the army was regularly adopted by congress and the pay of the commanderinchief fixed at five hundred dollars a month  in this stage of the business mr johnson of maryland rose and nominated washington for the station of commanderinchief the election was by ballot and was unanimous it was formally announced to him by the president on the following day when he had taken his seat in congress rising in his place he briefly expressed his high and grateful sense of the honor conferred on him and his sincere devotion to the cause but added he lest some unlucky event should happen unfavorable to my reputation i beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in the room that i this day declare with the utmost sincerity i do not think myself equal the command i am honored with as to pay i beg leave to assure the congress that as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness i do not wish to make any profit of it i will keep an exact account of my expenses those i doubt not they will discharge and that is all i desire  four majorgenerals were to be appointed general ward was elected the second in command and lee the third the other two majorgenerals were philip schuyler of new york and israel putnam of connecticut eight brigadiergenerals were likewise appointed seth pomeroy richard montgomery david wooster william heath joseph spencer john thomas john sullivan and nathaniel greene  at washingtons express request his old friend major horatio gates then absent at his estate in virginia was appointed adjutantgeneral with the rank of brigadier  in this momentous change in his condition which suddenly altered all his course of life and called him immediately to the camp washingtons thoughts recurred to mount vernon and its rural delights so dear to his heart whence he was to be again exiled his chief concern however was on account of the distress it might cause to his wife his letter to her on the subject is written in a tone of manly tenderness you may believe me writes he when i assure you in the most solemn manner that so far from seeking this appointment i have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it not only from my unwillingness to part with you and the family but from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my capacity and i should enjoy more real happiness in one month with you at home than i have the most distant prospect of finding abroad if my stay were to be seven times seven years but as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this service i shall hope that my undertaking it is designed to answer some good purpose  on the 20th of june he received his commission from the president of congress the following day was fixed upon for his departure for the army he reviewed previously at the request of their officers several militia companies of horse and foot every one was anxious to see the new commander and rarely has the public beau ideal of a commander been so fully answered he was now in the vigor of his days fortythree years of age stately in person noble in his demeanor calm and dignified in his deportment as he sat his horse with manly grace his military presence delighted every eye and wherever he went the air rang with acclamations     chapter xviii battle of bunker hill   while congress had been deliberating on the adoption of the army and the nomination of a commanderinchief events had been thickening and drawing to a crisis in the excited region about boston the provincial troops which blockaded the town prevented supplies by land the neighboring country refused to furnish them by water fresh provisions and vegetables were no longer to be procured and boston began to experience the privations of a besieged city  on the 25th of may arrived ships of war and transports from england bringing large reinforcements under generals howe burgoyne and henry clinton commanders of high reputation inspirited by these reinforcements general gage determined to take the field previously however he issued a proclamation 12th june putting the province under martial law threatening to treat as rebels and traitors all malcontents who should continue under arms together with their aiders and abettors but offering pardon to all who should lay down their arms and return to their allegiance from this proffered amnesty however john hancock and samuel adams were especially excepted  this proclamation only served to put the patriots on the alert against such measures as might be expected to follow and of which their friends in boston stood ready to apprise them the besieging force in the meantime was daily augmented by recruits and volunteers and now amounted to about fifteen thousand men distributed at various points about ten thousand belonged to massachusetts and were under the command of general artemas ward whose headquarters were at cambridge another body of troops under colonel john stark already mentioned came from new hampshire rhode island furnished a third under the command of general nathaniel greene a fourth was from connecticut under the veteran putnam these bodies of troops being from different colonies were independent of each other and had their several commanders those from new hampshire were instructed to obey general ward as commanderinchief with the rest it was a voluntary act rendered in consideration of his being military chief of massachusetts the province which as allies they came to defend there was in fact but little organization in the army nothing kept it together and gave it unity of action but a common feeling of exasperated patriotism  the troops knew but little of military discipline almost all were familiar with the use of firearms in hunting and fowling but the greater part were without military dress or accoutrements most of them were hasty levies of yeomanry some of whom had seized their rifles and fowlingpieces and turned out in their working clothes and homespun country garbs such was the army spread over an extent of ten or twelve miles and keeping watch upon the town of boston containing at that time a population of seventeen thousand souls and garrisoned with more than ten thousand british troops disciplined and experienced in the wars of europe  in the disposition of these forces general ward had stationed himself at cambridge with the main body of about nine thousand men and four companies of artillery lieutenantgeneral thomas second in command was posted with five thousand massachusetts connecticut and rhode island troops and three or four companies of artillery at roxbury and dorchester forming the right wing of the army while the left composed in a great measure of new hampshire troops stretched through medford to the hills of chelsea  we have already mentioned the peninsula of charlestown called from a village of the same name which lies opposite to the north side of boston the heights which swell up in rear of the village overlook the town and shipping the project was conceived in the besieging camp to seize and occupy those heights a council of war was held upon the subject general putnam was one of the most strenuous in favor of the measure some of the more wary and judicious among whom were general ward and dr warren doubted the expediency of intrenching themselves on those heights and the possibility of maintaining so exposed a post putnam made light of the danger he was seconded by general pomeroy a leader of like stamp and another veteran of the french war the daring councils of such men are always captivating to the inexperienced but in the present instance they were sanctioned by one whose opinion in such matters and in this vicinity possessed peculiar weight this was colonel william prescott of pepperell who commanded a regiment of minute men he too had seen service in the french war and acquired reputation as a lieutenant of infantry at the capture of cape breton this was sufficient to constitute him an oracle in the present instance he was now about fifty years of age tall and commanding in his appearance and retaining the port of a soldier his opinion probably settled the question and it was determined to seize on and fortify bunkers hill and dorchester heights  secret intelligence hurried forward the project general gage it was said intended to take possession of dorchester heights on the night of the 18th of june these heights lay on the opposite side of boston and the committee were ignorant of their localities those on charlestown neck being near at hand had some time before been reconnoitered by colonel richard gridley and other of the engineers it was determined to seize and fortify these heights on the night of friday the 16th of june in anticipation of the movement of general gage troops were drafted for the purpose and colonel prescott from his experience in military matters was chosen by general ward to conduct the enterprise his written orders were to fortify bunkers hill and defend the works until he should be relieved colonel richard gridley the chief engineer was to accompany him and plan the fortifications the detachment left cambridge about nine oclock colonel prescott taking the lead at charlestown neck they were joined by major brooks of bridges regiment and general putnam and here were the wagons laden with intrenching tools which first gave the men an indication of the nature of the enterprise  charlestown neck is a narrow isthmus connecting the peninsula with the main land having the mystic river about half a mile wide on the north and a large embayment of charles river on the south or right side it was now necessary to proceed with the utmost caution for they were coming on ground over which the british kept jealous watch they had erected a battery at boston on copps hill immediately opposite to charlestown five of their vessels of war were stationed so as to bear upon the peninsula from different directions and the guns of one of them swept the isthmus or narrow neck just mentioned  across this isthmus colonel prescott conducted the detachment undiscovered and up the ascent of bunkers hill this commences at the neck and slopes up for about three hundred yards to its summit which is about one hundred and twelve feet high it then declines toward the south and is connected by a ridge with breeds hill about sixty or seventy feet high the crests of the two hills are about seven hundred yards apart on attaining the heights a question rose which of the two they should proceed to fortify bunkers hill was specified in the written orders given to colonel prescott by general ward but breeds hill was much nearer to boston and had a better command of the town and shipping bunkers hill also being on the upper and narrower part of the peninsula was itself commanded by the same ship which raked the neck putnam was clear for commencing at breeds hill and making the principal work there while a minor work might be thrown up at bunkers hill as a protection in the rear and a rallying point in case of being driven out of the main work others concurred with this opinion gridley marked out the lines for the fortifications the men stacked their guns threw off their packs seized their trenching tools and set to work with great spirit so spiritedly though silently was the labor carried on that by morning a strong redoubt was thrown up as a main work flanked on the left by a breastwork partly cannonproof extending down the crest of breeds hill to a piece of marshy ground called the slough to support the right of the redoubt some troops were thrown into the village of charlestown at the southern foot of the hill  at dawn of day the americans at work were espied by the sailors on board of the ships of war and the alarm was given the captain of the lively the nearest ship without waiting for orders put a spring upon her cable and bringing her guns to bear opened a fire upon the hill the other ships and a floating battery followed his example their shot did no mischief to the works the cannonading roused the town of boston general gage could scarcely believe his eyes when he beheld on the opposite hill a fortification full of men which had sprung up in the course of the night he called a council of war the americans might intend to cannonade boston from this new fortification it was unanimously resolved to dislodge them how was this to be done a majority of the council including clinton and grant advised that a force should be landed on charlestown neck under the protection of their batteries so as to attack the americans in rear and cut off their retreat general gage objected that it would place his troops between two armies one at cambridge superior in numbers the other on the heights strongly fortified he was for landing in front of the works and pushing directly up the hill a plan adopted through a confidence that raw militia would never stand their ground against the assault of veteran troops  the sound of drum and trumpet the clatter of hoofs the rattling of guncarriages and all the other military din and bustle in the streets of boston soon apprised the americans on their rudely fortified height of an impending attack they were illfitted to withstand it being jaded by the nights labor and want of sleep hungry and thirsty having brought but scanty supplies and oppressed by the heat of the weather prescott sent repeated messages to general ward asking reinforcements and provisions ward issued orders for colonels stark and read then at medford to march to the relief of prescott with their new hampshire regiments  in the meantime the americans on breeds hill were sustaining the fire from the ships and from the battery on copps hill which opened upon them about ten oclock they returned an occasional shot from one corner of the redoubt without much harm to the enemy and continued strengthening their position until about eleven oclock when they ceased to work piled their intrenching tools in the rear and looked out anxiously and impatiently for the anticipated reinforcements and supplies the tools were ultimately carried to bunkers hill and a breastwork commenced by order of general putnam the importance of such a work was afterwards made apparent  about noon the americans descried twentyeight barges crossing from boston in parallel lines they contained a large detachment of grenadiers rangers and light infantry admirably equipped and commanded by majorgeneral howe a heavy fire from the ships and batteries covered their advance but no attempt was made to oppose them and they landed about one oclock at moultons point a little to the north of breeds hill here general howe made a pause on reconnoitering the works from this point the americans appeared to be much more strongly posted than he had imagined and he immediately sent over to general gage for more forces while awaiting their arrival refreshments were served out to the troops the americans meanwhile took advantage of the delay to strengthen their position the breastwork on the left of the redoubt extended to what was called the slough but beyond this the ridge of the hill and the slope toward mystic river were undefended leaving a pass by which the enemy might turn the left flank of the position and seize upon bunkers hill putnam ordered his chosen officer captain knowlton to cover this pass with the connecticut troops under his command a novel kind of rampart savoring of rural device was suggested by the rustic general about six hundred feet in the rear of the redoubt and about one hundred feet to the left of the breastwork was a post and railfence set in a low footwall of stone and extending down to mystic river the posts and rails of another fence were hastily pulled up and set a few feet in behind this and the intermediate space was filled up with new mown hay from the adjacent meadows this double fence it will be found proved an important protection to the redoubt although there still remained an unprotected interval of about seven hundred feet  while knowlton and his men were putting up this fence putnam proceeded with other of his troops to throw up the work on bunkers hill despatching his son captain putnam on horseback to hurry up the remainder of his men from cambridge by this time stark made his appearance with the new hampshire troops five hundred strong putnam detained some of starks men to aid in throwing up the works on bunkers hill and directed him to reinforce knowlton with the rest about two oclock warren arrived on the heights ready to engage in their perilous defence although he had opposed the scheme of their occupation he had recently been elected a majorgeneral but had not received his commission putnam offered him the command at the fence he declined it and merely asked where he could be of most service as a volunteer  the british now prepared for a general assault an easy victory was anticipated the main thought was how to make it most effectual the left wing commanded by general pigot was to mount the hill and force the redoubt while general howe with the right wing was to push on between the fort and mystic river turn the left flank of the americans and cut off their retreat general pigot accordingly advanced up the hill under cover of a fire from fieldpieces and howitzers planted on a small height near the landingplace on moultons point his troops commenced a discharge of musketry while yet at a long distance from the redoubts the americans within the works obedient to strict command retained their fire until the enemy were within thirty or forty paces when they opened upon them with a tremendous volley being all marksmen accustomed to take deliberate aim the slaughter was immense and especially fatal to officers the assailants fell back in some confusion but rallied on by their officers advanced within pistol shot another volley more effective than the first made them again recoil to add to their confusion they were galled by a flanking fire from the handful of provincials posted in charlestown shocked at the carnage and seeing the confusion of his troops general pigot was urged to give the word for a retreat  in the meantime general howe with the right wing advanced along mystic river toward the fence where stark read and knowlton were stationed thinking to carry this slight breastwork with ease and so get in the rear of the fortress his artillery proved of little avail being stopped by a swampy piece of ground while his columns suffered from two or three fieldpieces with which putnam had fortified the fence howes men kept up a fire of musketry as they advanced but not taking aim their shot passed over the heads of the americans the latter had received the same orders with those in the redoubt not to fire until the enemy should be within thirty paces when the british arrived within the stated distance a sheeted fire opened upon them from rifles muskets and fowlingpieces all levelled with deadly aim the carnage as in the other instance was horrible the british were thrown into confusion and fell back some even retreated to the boats  there was a general pause on the part of the british the american officers availed themselves of it to prepare for another attack which must soon be made prescott mingled among his men in the redoubt who were all in high spirits at the severe check they had given the regulars he praised them for their steadfastness in maintaining their post and their good conduct in reserving their fire until the word of command and exhorted them to do the same in the next attack putnam rode about bunkers hill and its skirts to rally and bring on reinforcements which had been checked or scattered in crossing charlestown neck by the raking fire from the ships and batteries before many could be brought to the scene of action the british had commenced their second attack they again ascended the hill to storm the redoubt their advance was covered as before by discharges of artillery charlestown which had annoyed them on their first attack by a flanking fire was in flames by shells thrown from copps hill and by marines from the ships the thunder of artillery from batteries and ships the bursting of bombshells the sharp discharges of musketry the shouts and yells of the combatants the crash of burning buildings arid the dense volumes of smoke which obscured the summer sun all formed a tremendous spectacle  the american troops although unused to war stood undismayed amidst a scene where it was bursting upon them with all its horrors reserving their fire as before until the enemy was close at hand they again poured forth repeated volleys with the fatal aim of sharpshooters the british stood the first shock and continued to advance but the incessant stream of fire staggered them their officers remonstrated threatened and even attempted to goad them on with their swords but the havoc was too deadly whole ranks were mowed down many of the officers were either slain or wounded and among them several of the staff of general howe the troops again gave way and retreated down the hill  a third attack was now determined on though some of howes officers remonstrated declaring it would be downright butchery a different plan was adopted instead of advancing in front of the redoubt it was to be taken in flank on the left where the open space between the breastwork and the fortified fence presented a weak point it having been accidentally discovered that the ammunition of the americans was nearly expended preparations were made to carry the works at the point of the bayonet general howe with the main body now made a feint of attacking the fortified fence but while a part of his force was thus engaged the rest brought some of the fieldpieces to enfilade the breastwork on the left of the redoubt a raking fire soon drove the americans out of this exposed place into the enclosure the troops were now led on to assail the works the americans again reserved their fire until their assailants were close at hand and then made a murderous volley by which several officers were laid low and general howe himself was wounded in the foot the british soldiery this time likewise reserved their fire and rushed on with fixed bayonet clinton and pigot had reached the southern and eastern sides of the redoubt and it was now assailed on three sides at once prescott ordered those who had no bayonets to retire to the back part of the redoubt and fire on the enemy as they showed themselves on the parapet the americans however had fired their last round their ammunition was exhausted and now succeeded a desperate and deadly struggle hand to hand with bayonets stones and the stocks of their muskets at length as the british continued to pour in prescott gave the order to retreat his men had to cut their way through two divisions of the enemy who were getting in rear of the redoubt and they received a destructive volley from those who had formed on the captured works by that volley fell the patriot warren who had distinguished himself throughout the action  while the americans were thus slowly dislodged from the redoubt stark read and knowlton maintained their ground at the fortified fence which indeed had been nobly defended throughout the action the resistance at this hastily constructed work was kept up after the troops in the redoubt had given way and until colonel prescott had left the hill thus defeating general howes design of cutting off the retreat of the main body which would have produced a scene of direful confusion and slaughter having effected their purpose the brave associates at the fence abandoned their weak outpost retiring slowly and disputing the ground inch by inch with a regularity remarkable in troops many of whom had never before been in action  the main retreat was across bunkers hill where putnam had endeavored to throw up a breastwork the veteran sword in hand rode to the rear of the retreating troops regardless of the balls whistling about him his only thought was to rally them at the unfinished works it was impossible however to bring the troops to a stand they continued on down the hill to the neck and across it to cambridge exposed to a raking fire from the ships and batteries and only protected by a single piece of ordnance the british were too exhausted to pursue them they contented themselves with taking possession of bunkers hill were reinforced from boston and threw up additional works during the night  thus ended the first regular battle between the british and the americans and most eventful in its consequences the former had gained the ground for which they contended but if a victory it was more disastrous and humiliating to them than an ordinary defeat according to their own returns their killed and wounded out of a detachment of two thousand men amounted to one thousand and fiftyfour and a large proportion of them officers the loss of the americans did not exceed four hundred and fifty  to the latter this defeat if defeat it might be called had the effect of a triumph it gave them confidence in themselves and consequence in the eyes of their enemies they had proved to themselves and to others that they could measure weapons with the disciplined soldiers of europe and inflict the most harm in the conflict  among the british officers slain was major pitcairn who at lexington had shed the first blood in the revolutionary war in the death of warren the americans had to lament the loss of a distinguished patriot and a most estimable man it was deplored as a public calamity he was one of the first who fell in the glorious cause of his country and his name has become consecrated in its history     chapter xix washington on his way to the camp   in a preceding chapter we left washington preparing to depart from philadelphia for the army before boston he set out on horseback on the 21st of june having for military companions of his journey majorgenerals lee and schuyler and being accompanied for a distance by several private friends as an escort he had a gentleman troop of philadelphia commanded by captain markoe the whole formed a brilliant cavalcade  general schuyler was a man eminently calculated to sympathize with washington in all his patriotic views and feelings and became one of his most faithful coadjutors sprung from one of the earliest and most respectable dutch families which colonized new york all his interests and affections were identified with the country he had received a good education applied himself at an early age to the exact sciences and became versed in finance military engineering and political economy he was one of those native born soldiers who had acquired experience in that american school of arms the old french war since the close of the french war he had served his country in various civil stations and been one of the most zealous and eloquent vindicators of colonial rights  they had scarcely proceeded twenty miles from philadelphia when they were met by a courier spurring with all speed bearing despatches from the army to congress communicating tidings of the battle of bunkers hill washington eagerly inquired particulars above all how acted the militia when told that they stood their ground bravely sustained the enemys firereserved their own until at close quarters and then delivered it with deadly effect it seemed as if a weight of doubt and solicitude were lifted from his heart the liberties of the country are safe exclaimed he  the news of the battle of bunkers hill had startled the whole country and this clattering cavalcade escorting the commanderinchief to the army was the gaze and wonder of every town and village  the journey may be said to have been a continual council of war between washington and the two generals one of the most frequent subjects of conversation was the province of new york its power and position rendered it the great link of the confederacy what measures were necessary for its defence and most calculated to secure its adherence to the cause the population of new york was more varied in its elements than that of almost any other of the provinces and had to be cautiously studied the new yorkers were of a mixed origin and stamped with the peculiarities of their respective ancestors the descendants of the old dutch and huguenot families the earliest settlers were still among the soundest and best of the population they inherited the love of liberty civil and religious of their forefathers and were those who stood foremost in the present struggle for popular rights a great proportion of the more modern families dating from the downfall of the dutch government in 1664 were english and scotch and among these were many loyal adherents to the crown  there was a power too of a formidable kind within the interior of the province which was an object of much solicitude this was the johnson family we have repeatedly had occasion to speak of sir william johnson his majestys general agent for indian affairs of his great wealth and his almost sovereign sway over the six nations in the recent difficulties between the crown and colonies sir william had naturally been in favor of the government which had enriched and honored him but he had viewed with deep concern the acts of parliament which were goading the colonists to armed resistance in the height of his solicitude he received despatches ordering him in case of hostilities to enlist the indians in the cause of government to the agitation of feelings produced by these orders many have attributed a stroke of apoplexy of which he died on the 11th of july 1774 about a year before the time of which we are treating his son and heir sir john johnson and his sonsinlaw colonel guy johnson and colonel claus felt none of the reluctance of sir william to use harsh measures in support of royalty they lived in a degree of rude feudal style in stone mansions capable of defence situated on the mohawk river and in its vicinity they had many scottish highlanders for tenants and among their adherents were violent men such as the butlers of tryon county and brant the mohawk sachem since famous in indian warfare they had recently gone about with armed retainers overawing and breaking up patriotic assemblages and it was known they could at any time bring a force of warriors in the field  tryon the governor of new york was at present absent in england having been called home by the ministry to give an account of the affairs of the province and to receive instructions for its management he was a tory in heart and had been a zealous opponent of all colonial movements and his talents and address gave him great influence over an important part of the community should he return with hostile instructions and should he and the johnsons cooperate the one controlling the bay and harbor of new york and the waters of the hudson by means of ships and land forces the others overrunning the valley of the mohawk and the regions beyond albany with savage hordes this great central province might be wrested from the confederacy and all intercourse broken off between the eastern and southern colonies all these circumstances and considerations many of which came under discussion in the course of this military journey rendered the command of new york a post of especial trust and importance and determined washington to confide it to general schuyler he was peculiarly fitted for it by his military talents his intimate knowledge of the province and its concerns especially what related to the upper parts of it and his experience in indian affairs  at newark in the jerseys washington was met on the 25th by a committee of the provincial congress sent to conduct him to the city the congress was in a perplexity it had in a manner usurped and exercised the powers of governor tryon during his absence while at the same time it professed allegiance to the crown which had appointed him he was now in the harbor just arrived from england and hourly expected to land washington too was approaching how were these double claims to ceremonious respect happening at the same time to be managed  in this dilemma a regiment of militia was turned out and the colonel instructed to pay military honors to whichever of the distinguished functionaries should first arrive washington was earlier than the governor by several hours and received those honors the landing of governor tryon took place about eight oclock in the evening the military honors were repeated he was received with great respect by the mayor and common council and transports of loyalty by those devoted to the crown it was unknown what instructions he had received from the ministry but it was rumored that a large force would soon arrive from england subject to his directions at this very moment a ship of war the asia lay anchored opposite the city its grim batteries bearing upon it greatly to the disquiet of the fainthearted among its inhabitants in this situation of affairs washington was happy to leave such an efficient person as general schuyler in command of the place  in the meantime the provincial congress of massachusetts then in session at watertown had made arrangements for the expected arrival of washington it sent on a deputation which met washington at springfield on the frontiers of the province and provided escorts and accommodations for him along the road thus honorably attended from town to town and escorted by volunteer companies and cavalcades of gentlemen he arrived at watertown on the 2d of july where he was greeted by congress with a congratulatory address in which however was frankly stated the undisciplined state of the army he was summoned to command an address of cordial welcome was likewise made to general lee  the ceremony over washington was again in the saddle and escorted by a troop of light horse and a cavalcade of citizens proceeded to the headquarters provided for him at cambridge three miles distant as he entered the confines of the camp the shouts of the multitude and the thundering of artillery gave note to the enemy beleaguered in boston of his arrival  his military reputation had preceded him and excited great expectations they were not disappointed his personal appearance notwithstanding the dust of travel was calculated to captivate the public eye as he rode through the camp amidst a throng of officers he was the admiration of the soldiery and of a curious throng collected from the surrounding country happy was the countryman who could get a full view of him to carry home an account of it to his neighbors  with washington modest at all times there was no false excitement on the present occasion nothing to call forth emotions of selfglorification the honors and congratulations with which he was received the acclamations of the public the cheerings of the army only told him how much was expected from him and when he looked round upon the raw and rustic levies he was to command a mixed multitude of people under very little discipline order or government scattered in rough encampments about hill and dale beleaguering a city garrisoned by veteran troops with ships of war anchored about its harbor and strong outposts guarding it he felt the awful responsibility of his situation and the complicated and stupendous task before him he spoke of it however not despondingly nor boastfully and with defiance but with that solemn and sedate resolution and that hopeful reliance on supreme goodness which belonged to his magnanimous nature     chapter xx siege of boston   on the 3d of july the morning after his arrival at cambridge washington took formal command of the army accompanied by general lee on whose military judgment he had great reliance he visited the different american posts and rode to the heights commanding views over boston and its environs being anxious to make himself acquainted with the strength and relative position of both armies  in visiting the different posts washington halted for a time at prospect hill which as its name denotes commanded a wide view over boston and the surrounding country here putnam had taken his position after the battle of bunkers hill fortifying himself with works which he deemed impregnable and here the veteran was enabled to point out to the commanderinchief and to lee the main features of the belligerent region which lay spread out like a map before them bunkers hill was but a mile distant to the west the british standard floating as if in triumph on its summit the main force under general howe was intrenching itself strongly about half a mile beyond the place of the recent battle howes sentries extended a hundred and fifty yards beyond the neck or isthmus over which the americans retreated after the battle a large force was intrenched south of the town on the neck leading to roxburythe only entrance to boston by land the troops were irregularly distributed in a kind of semicircle eight or nine miles in extent the left resting on winter hill the most northern post the right extending on the south to roxbury and dorchester neck  washington reconnoitred the british posts from various points of view everything about them was in admirable order the works appeared to be constructed with military science the troops to be in a high state of discipline the american camp on the contrary disappointed him he had expected to find eighteen or twenty thousand men under arms there were not much more than fourteen thousand he had expected to find some degree of system and discipline whereas all were raw militia he had expected to find works scientifically constructed and proofs of knowledge and skill in engineering whereas what he saw of the latter was very imperfect and confined to the mere manual exercise of cannon  in riding throughout the camp washington observed that nine thousand of the troops belonged to massachusetts the rest were from other provinces they were encamped in separate bodies each with its own regulations and officers of its own appointment some had tents others were in barracks and others sheltered themselves as best they might many were sadly in want of clothing and all said washington were strongly imbued with the spirit of insubordination which they mistook for independence  one of the encampments however was in striking contrast with the rest and might vie with those of the british for order and exactness here were tents and marquees pitched in the english style soldiers well drilled and well equipped everything had an air of discipline and subordination it was a body of rhode island troops which had been raised drilled and brought to the camp by brigadiergeneral greene1 of that province  footnote 1 nathaniel greene was born in rhode island in may 1742 was the son of quaker parents in his boyhood aided his father on a farm and in a mill but having a thirst for knowledge applied himself sedulously to various studies public affairs had aroused his martial spirit and he had applied himself to military studies in the month of may he had been elected commander of the rhode island contingent  having taken his survey of the army washington wrote to the president of congress representing its various deficiencies and among other things urging the appointment of a commissarygeneral a quartermastergeneral a commissary of musters and a commissary of artillery above all things he requested a supply of money as soon as possible i find myself already much embarrassed for want of a military chest in one of his recommendations we have an instance of frontier expediency learnt in his early campaigns speaking of the ragged condition of the army and the difficulty of procuring the requisite kind of clothing he advises that a number of huntingshirts not less than ten thousand should be provided as being the cheapest and quickest mode of supplying this necessity  the justice and impartiality of washington were called into exercise as soon as he entered upon his command in allaying discontents among his general officers caused by the recent appointments and promotions made by the continental congress general spencer was so offended that putnam should be promoted over his head that he left the army without visiting the commanderinchief but was subsequently induced to return general thomas felt aggrieved by being outranked by the veteran pomeroy the latter however declining to serve he found himself senior brigadier and was appeased  the congress of massachusetts manifested considerate liberality with respect to headquarters according to their minutes a committee was charged to procure a steward a housekeeper and two or three women cooks the wishes of washington were to be consulted in regard to the supply of his table this his station as commanderinchief required should be kept up in ample and hospitable style every day a number of his officers dined with him as he was in the neighborhood of the seat of the provincial government he would occasionally have members of congress and other functionaries at his board though social however he was not convivial in his habits he received his guests with courtesy but his mind and time were too much occupied by grave and anxious concerns to permit him the genial indulgence of the table he would retire early from the board leaving an aidedecamp or one of his officers to take his place colonel mifflin was the first person who officiated as aidedecamp he was a philadelphia gentleman of high respectability who had accompanied him from that city and received his appointment shortly after their arrival at cambridge the second aidedecamp was john trumbull2 son of the governor of connecticut trumbull was young and unaccustomed to society and soon found himself he says unequal to the elegant duties of his situation he gladly exchanged it therefore for that of major of brigade  footnote 2 in after years distinguished as a historical painter  the member of washingtons family most deserving of mention at present was his secretary mr joseph reed with this gentleman he had formed an intimacy in the course of his visits to philadelphia to attend the sessions of the continental congress mr reed was an accomplished man had studied law in america and at the temple in london and had gained a high reputation at the philadelphia bar he had since been highly instrumental in rousing the philadelphians to cooperate with the patriots of boston a sympathy of views and feelings had attached him to washington and induced him to accompany him to the camp  the arrival of gates in camp was heartily welcomed by the commanderinchief who had received a letter from that officer gratefully acknowledging his friendly influence in procuring him the appointment of adjutantgeneral washington may have promised himself much cordial cooperation from him recollecting the warm friendship professed by him when he visited at mount vernon and they talked together over their early companionship in arms but of that kind of friendship there was no further manifestation gates was certainly of great service from his practical knowledge and military experience at this juncture when the whole army had in a manner to be organized but from the familiar intimacy of washington he gradually estranged himself a contemporary has accounted for this by alleging that he was secretly chagrined at not having received the appointment of majorgeneral to which he considered himself well fitted by his military knowledge and experience and which he thought washington might have obtained for him had he used his influence with congress  the hazardous position of the army from the great extent and weakness of its lines was what most pressed on the immediate attention of washington and he summoned a council of war to take the matter into consideration in this it was urged that to abandon the line of works after the great labor and expense of their construction would be dispiriting to the troops and encouraging to the enemy while it would expose a wide extent of the surrounding country to maraud and ravage beside no safer position presented itself on which to fall back this being generally admitted it was determined to hold on to the works and defend them as long as possible and in the meantime to augment the army to at least twenty thousand men  washington now hastened to improve the defences of the camp strengthen the weak parts of the line and throw up additional works around the main forts the army was distributed into three grand divisions one forming the right wing was stationed on the heights of roxbury it was commanded by majorgeneral ward who had under him brigadiergenerals spencer and thomas another forming the left wing under majorgeneral lee having with him brigadiergenerals sullivan and greene was stationed on winter and prospect hills while the centre under majorgeneral putnam and brigadiergeneral heath was stationed at cambridge at washingtons recommendation joseph trumbull the eldest son of the governor received on the 24th of july the appointment of commissarygeneral of the continental army he had already officiated with talent in that capacity in the connecticut militia  nothing excited more gaze and wonder among the rustic visitors to the camp than the arrival of several rifle companies fourteen hundred men in all from pennsylvania maryland and virginia such stalwart fellows as washington had known in his early campaigns stark hunters and bush fighters many of them upwards of six feet high and of vigorous frame dressed in fringed frocks or rifle shirts and round hats their displays of sharp shooting were soon among the marvels of the camp one of these companies was commanded by captain daniel morgan a native of new jersey whose first experience in war had been to accompany braddocks army as a wagoner he had since carried arms on the frontier and obtained a command he and his riflemen in coming to the camp had marched six hundred miles in three weeks  while all his forces were required for the investment of boston washington was importuned by the legislature of massachusetts and the governor of connecticut to detach troops for the protection of different points of the seacoast where depredations by armed vessels were apprehended the case of new london was specified by governor trumbull where captain wallace of the rose frigate with two other ships of war had entered the harbor landed men spiked the cannon and gone off threatening future visits  washington referred to his instructions and consulted with his general officers and such members of the continental congress as happened to be in camp before he replied to these requests he then respectfully declined compliance in his reply he stated frankly and explicitly the policy and system on which the war was to be conducted it has been debated in congress and settled writes he that the militia or other internal strength of each province is to be applied for defence against those small and particular depredations which were to be expected and to which they were supposed to be competent this will appear the more proper when it is considered that every town and indeed every part of our seacoast which is exposed to these depredations would have an equal claim upon this army the great advantage the enemy have of transporting troops by being masters of the sea will enable them to harass us by diversions of this kind and should we be tempted to pursue them upon every alarm the army must either be so weakened as to expose it to destruction or a great part of the coast be still left unprotected i wish i could extend protection to all but the numerous detachments necessary to remedy the evil would amount to a dissolution of the army or make the most important operations of the campaign depend upon the piratical expeditions of two or three menofwar and transports  his refusal to grant the required detachments gave much dissatisfaction in some quarters until sanctioned and enforced by the continental congress all at length saw and acquiesced in the justice and wisdom of his decision it was in fact a vital question involving the whole character and fortune of the war and it was acknowledged that he met it with a forecast and determination befitting a commanderinchief  the great object of washington at present was to force the enemy to come out of boston and try a decisive action his lines had for some time cut off all communication of the town with the country and he had caused the live stock within a considerable distance of the place to be driven back from the coast out of reach of the menofwars boats at this critical juncture when endeavoring to provoke a general action a startling fact came to light the whole amount of powder in the camp would not furnish more than nine cartridges to a man  a gross error had been made by the committee of supplies when washington on taking command had required a return of the ammunition they had returned the whole amount of powder collected by the province upwards of three hundred barrels without stating what had been expended the blunder was detected on an order being issued for a new supply of cartridges it was found that there were but thirtytwo barrels of powder in store this was an astounding discovery washington instantly despatched letters and expresses to rhode island the jerseys ticonderoga and elsewhere urging immediate supplies of powder and lead no quantity however small to be considered beneath notice  a correspondence of an important character now took place between washington and general gage it was one intended to put the hostile services on a proper footing a strong disposition had been manifested among the british officers to regard those engaged in the patriot cause as malefactors outlawed from the courtesies of chivalric warfare washington was determined to have a full understanding on this point he was peculiarly sensitive with regard to gage they had been companions in arms in their early days but gage might now affect to look down upon him as the chief of a rebel army washington took an early opportunity to let him know that he claimed to be the commander of a legitimate force engaged in a legitimate cause and that both himself and his army were to be treated on a footing of perfect equality     chapter xxi projects for the invasion of canada   we must interrupt our narrative of the siege of boston to give an account of events in other quarters requiring the superintending care of washington as commanderinchief letters from general schuyler received in the course of july had awakened apprehensions of danger from the interior the johnsons were said to be stirring up the indians in the western parts of new york to hostility and preparing to join the british forces in canada  great rivalry since the exploits of ethan allen and benedict arnold at ticonderoga and on lake champlain had arisen between these doughty leaders allen claimed command at ticonderoga on the authority of the committee from the connecticut assembly which had originated the enterprise arnold claimed it on the strength of his instructions from the massachusetts committee of safety the public bodies themselves seemed perplexed what to do with the prize so bravely seized upon by these bold men the continental congress at length legitimated the exploit and as it were accepted the captured fortress the custody of it was committed to new york with the power to call on the new england colonies for aid the call was made and one thousand troops under colonel hinman were sent forward by the governor of connecticut  it had been the idea of the continental congress to have those posts dismantled and the cannon and stores removed to the south end of lake george where a strong post was to be established but both allen and arnold exclaimed against such a measure vaunting and with reason the importance of those forts both were ambitious of further laurels both were anxious to lead an expedition into canada and ticonderoga and crown point would open the way to it the key is ours writes allen to the new york congress if the colonies would suddenly push an army of two or three thousand men into canada they might make an easy conquest of all that would oppose them in the extensive province of quebec except a reinforcement from england should prevent it such a diversion would weaken gage and insure us canada  a letter to the same purport was written by allen to trumbull the governor of connecticut arnold urged the same project upon the attention of the continental congress his letter was dated from crown point where he had a little squadron composed of the sloop captured at st johns a schooner and a flotilla of bateaux all these he had equipped armed maimed and officered and his crews were devoted to him  within a few days after the date of this letter colonel hinman with the connecticut troops arrived the greater part of the green mountain boys now returned home their term of enlistment having expired ethan allen and his brother in arms seth warner repaired to congress to get pay for their men and authority to raise a new regiment they were received with distinguished honor by that body as to arnold difficulties instantly took place between him and colonel hinman arnold refused to give up to him the command of either post claiming on the strength of his instructions from the committee of safety of massachusetts a right to the command of all the posts and fortresses at the south end of lake champlain and lake george at this juncture arrived a committee of three members of the congress of massachusetts sent by that body to inquire into the manner in which he had executed his instructions complaints having been made of his arrogant and undue assumption of command arnold thunderstruck at being subjected to inquiry when he had expected an ovation disbanded his men and threw up his commission quite a scene ensued his men became turbulent some refused to serve under any other leader others clamored for their pay which was in arrears the storm was allayed by the interference of several of the officers and the assurances of the committee that every man should be paid  the project of an invasion of canada had at first met with no favor with the continental congress intelligence subsequently received induced it to change its plans sir guy carleton was said to be strengthening the fortifications and garrison at st johns and preparing to launch vessels on the lake wherewith to regain command of it and retake the captured posts powerful reinforcements were coming from england and elsewhere guy johnson was holding councils with the fierce cayugas and senecas and stirring up the six nations to hostility on the other hand canada was full of religious and political dissensions the late exploits of the americans on lake champlain had produced a favorable effect on the canadians who would flock to the patriot standard if unfurled among them by an imposing force now was the time to strike a blow to paralyze all hostility from this quarter now while carletons regular force was weak and before the arrival of additional troops influenced by these considerations congress now determined to extend the revolution into canada but it was an enterprise too important to be entrusted to any but discreet hands general schuyler then in new york was accordingly ordered on the 27th of june to proceed to ticonderoga and should he find it practicable and not disagreeable to the canadians immediately to take possession of st johns and montreal and pursue such other measures in canada as might have a tendency to promote the peace and security of these provinces  schuyler arrived at ticonderoga on the 18th of july colonel hinman it will be recollected was in temporary command at ticonderoga the garrison was about twelve hundred strong the greater part connecticut men brought by himself some were new york troops and some few green mountain boys schuyler on taking command despatched a confidential agent into canada major john brown an american who resided on the sorel river and was popular among the canadians he was to collect information as to the british forces and fortifications and to ascertain how an invasion and an attack on st johns would be considered by the people of the province in the meantime schuyler set diligently to work to build boats and prepare for the enterprise should it ultimately be ordered by congress  schuyler was excessively annoyed by the confusion and negligence prevalent around him and the difficulties and delays thereby occasioned he chafed in spirit at the disregard of discipline among his yeoman soldiery and their opposition to all system and regularity this was especially the case with the troops from connecticut officered generally by their own neighbors and familiar companions and unwilling to acknowledge the authority of a commander from a different province  he had calculated on being joined by this time by the regiment of green mountain boys which ethan allen and seth warner had undertaken to raise in the new hampshire grants unfortunately a quarrel had arisen between those brothers in arms which filled the green mountains with discord and party feuds the election of officers took place on the 27th of july it was made by committees from the different townships ethan allen was entirely passed by and seth warner nominated as lieutenantcolonel of the regiment allen was thunderstruck at finding himself thus suddenly dismounted his patriotism and love of adventure however were not quelled and he forthwith repaired to the army at ticonderoga to offer himself as a volunteer  schuyler was on the alert with respect to the expedition against canada from his agent major brown and from other sources he had learnt that there were about seven hundred kings troops in that province three hundred of them at st johns about fifty at quebec the remainder at montreal chamblee and the upper posts colonel guy johnson was at montreal with three hundred men mostly his tenants and with a number of indians two batteries had been finished at st johns mounting nine guns each other works were intrenched and picketed two large row galleys were on the stocks and would soon be finished now was the time according to his informants to carry canada it might be done with great ease and little cost the canadians were disaffected to british rule and would join the americans and so would many of the indians i am prepared writes he to washington to move against the enemy unless your excellency and congress should direct otherwise  while awaiting orders on this head he repaired to albany to hold a conference and negotiate a treaty with the caughnawagas and the warriors of the six nations whom as one of the commissioners of indian affairs he had invited to meet him at that place general richard montgomery was to remain in command at ticonderoga during his absence and to urge forward the military preparations the subsequent fortunes of this gallant officer are inseparably connected with the canadian campaign and have endeared his name to americans1  footnote 1 richard montgomery was born in the north of ireland in 1736 he entered the army at eighteen years of age served in the french war with gallantry afterward returned to england about three years before the revolution he sold his commission and emigrated to new york where he married a daughter of judge robert r livingston  while these things were occurring at ticonderoga several indian chiefs made their appearance in the camp at cambridge they came in savage state and costume as ambassadors from their respective tribes to have a talk about the impending invasion of canada one was chief of the caughnawaga tribe whose residence was on the banks of the st lawrence six miles above montreal others were from st francis about fortyfive leagues above quebec and were of a warlike tribe from which hostilities had been especially apprehended washington accustomed to deal with the red warriors of the wilderness received them with great ceremonial they dined at headquarters among his officers and it is observed that to some of the latter they might have served as models such was their grave dignity and decorum  a council fire was held the sachems all offered on behalf of their tribes to take up the hatchet for the americans should the latter invade canada the offer was embarrassing congress had publicly resolved to seek nothing but neutrality from the indian nations unless the ministerial agents should make an offensive alliance with them the chief of the st francis tribe declared that governor carleton had endeavored to persuade him to take up the hatchet against the americans but in vain  washington wished to be certain of the conduct of the enemy before he gave a reply to these indian overtures he wrote by express therefore to general schuyler requesting him to ascertain the intentions of the british governor with respect to the native tribes by the same express he communicated a plan which had occupied his thoughts for several days as the contemplated movement of schuyler would probably cause all the british force in canada to be concentrated in the neighborhood of montreal and st johns he proposed to send off an expedition of ten or twelve hundred men to penetrate to quebec by the way of the kennebec river  the express found schuyler in albany where he had been attending the conference with the six nations he had just received intelligence which convinced him of the propriety of an expedition into canada had sent word to general montgomery to get everything ready for it and was on the point of departing for ticonderoga to carry it into effect in reply to washington he declared his conviction from various accounts which he had received that carleton and his agents were exciting the indian tribes to hostility i should therefore not hesitate one moment adds he to employ any savages that might be willing to join us he expressed himself delighted with washingtons project of sending off an expedition to quebec regretting only that it had not been thought of earlier  having sent off these despatches schuyler hastened back to ticonderoga before he reached there montgomery had received intelligence that carleton had completed his armed vessels at st johns and was about to send them into lake champlain by the sorel river no time therefore was to be lost in getting possession of the isle aux noix which commanded the entrance to that river montgomery hastened therefore to embark with about a thousand men which were as many as the boats now ready could hold taking with him two pieces of artillery with this force he set off down the lake a letter to general schuyler explained the cause of his sudden departure and entreated him to follow on in a whaleboat leaving the residue of the artillery to come on as soon as conveyances could be procured  schuyler arrived at ticonderoga on the night of the 30th of august but too ill of a bilious fever to push on in a whaleboat he caused however a bed to be prepared for him in a covered bateau and ill as he was continued forward on the following day on the 4th of september he overtook montgomery at the isle la motte where he had been detained by contrary weather and assuming command of the little army kept on the same day to the isle aux noix about twelve miles south of st johns  the siege of boston had been kept up for several weeks without any remarkable occurrence the british remained within their lines diligently strengthening them the besiegers having received further supplies of ammunition were growing impatient of a state of inactivity towards the latter part of august there were rumors from boston that the enemy were preparing for a sortie washington was resolved to provoke it by a kind of challenge he accordingly detached fourteen hundred men to seize at night upon a height within musket shot of the enemys line on charlestown neck presuming that the latter would sally forth on the following day to dispute possession of it and thus be drawn into a general battle the task was executed with silence and celerity and by daybreak the hill presented to the astonished foe the aspect of a fortified post  the challenge was not accepted the british opened a heavy cannonade from bunkers hill but kept within their works the americans scant of ammunition could only reply with a single ninepounder this however sank one of the floating batteries which guarded the neck the evident unwillingness of the british to come forth was perplexing perhaps they persuaded themselves that the american army composed of crude halfdisciplined levies from different and distant quarters would gradually fall asunder and disperse or that its means of subsistence would be exhausted  in the meantime as it was evident the enemy did not intend to come out but were only strengthening their defences and preparing for winter washington was enabled to turn his attention to the expedition to be sent into canada by the way of the kennebec river a detachment of about eleven hundred men chosen for the purpose was soon encamped on cambridge common the proposed expedition was wild and perilous and required a hardy skilful and intrepid leader such a one was at hand benedict arnold was at cambridge occupied in settling his accounts with the massachusetts committee of safety whatever faults may have been found with his conduct in some particulars his exploits on lake champlain had atoned for them for valor in time of war covers a multitude of sins  washington had given him an honorable reception at headquarters and now considered him the very man for the present enterprise as he would be intrusted with dangerous powers washington beside a general letter of instructions addressed a special one to him individually full of cautious and considerate advice he was furnished with handbills for distribution in canada setting forth the friendly objects of the present expedition as well as of that under general schuyler and calling on the canadians to furnish necessaries and accommodations of every kind for which they were assured ample compensation  on the 13th of september arnold struck his tents and set out in high spirits washington enjoined upon him to push forward as rapidly as possible success depending upon celerity and counted the days as they elapsed after his departure impatient to receive tidings of his progress up the kennebec and expecting that the expedition would reach quebec about the middle of october in the interim came letters from general schuyler giving particulars of the main expedition  in a preceding chapter we left the general and his little army at the isle aux noix near the sorel river the outlet of the lake thence on the 5th of september he sent colonel ethan allen and major brown to reconnoitre the country between that river and the st lawrence to distribute friendly addresses among the people and ascertain their feelings this done and having landed his baggage and provisions the general proceeded along the sorel river the next day with his boats until within two miles of st johns when a cannonade was opened from the fort  in the night the camp was visited secretly by a person who informed general schuyler of the state of the fort the works were completed and furnished with cannon a vessel pierced for sixteen guns was launched and would be ready to sail in three or four days it was not probable that any canadians would join the army being disposed to remain neutral this intelligence being discussed in a council of war in the morning it was determined that they had neither men nor artillery sufficient to undertake a siege they returned therefore to the isle aux noix cast up fortifications and threw a boom across the channel of the river to prevent the passage of the enemys vessels into the lake and awaited the arrival of artillery and reinforcements from ticonderoga in the course of a few days the expected reinforcements arrived and with them a small train of artillery ethan allen also returned from his reconnoitring expedition of which he made a most encouraging report  preparations were now made for the investment of st johns by land and water major brown who had already acted as a scout was sent with one hundred americans and about thirty canadians towards chamblee to make friends in that quarter and to join the army as soon as it should arrive at st johns to quiet the restless activity of ethan allen who had no command in the army he was sent with an escort of thirty men to retrace his steps penetrate to la prairie and beat up for recruits among the people whom he had recently visited  for some time past general schuyler had been struggling with a complication of maladies but exerting himself to the utmost in the harassing business of the camp when everything was nearly ready he was attacked in the night by a severe access of his disorder which confined him to his bed and compelled him to surrender the conduct of the expedition to general montgomery since he could be of no further use therefore in this quarter he caused his bed as before to be placed on board a covered bateau and set off for ticonderoga to hasten forward reinforcements and supplies  on the 16th of september the day after schuylers departure montgomery proceeded to carry out the plans which had been concerted between them landing on the 17th at the place where they had formerly encamped within a mile and a half of the fort he detached a force of five hundred men to take a position at the junction of two roads leading to montreal and chamblee so as to intercept relief from those points he now proceeded to invest st johns which had a garrison of five or six hundred regulars and two hundred canadian militia its commander major preston made a brave resistance montgomery had not proper battering cannon his mortars were defective his artillerists unpractised and the engineer ignorant the siege went on slowly until the arrival of an artillery company under captain lamb lamb who was an able officer immediately bedded a thirteeninch mortar and commenced a fire of shot and shells upon the fort the distance however was too great and the positions of the batteries were ill chosen  a flourishing letter was received by the general from colonel ethan allen giving hope of further reinforcement i am now writes he at the parish of st ours four leagues from sorel to the south i have two hundred and fifty canadians under arms as i march they gather fast you may rely on it that i shall join you in about three days with five hundred or more canadian volunteers  but when on his way towards st johns when between longueil and la prairie allen met colonel brown with his party of americans and canadians a conversation took place between them brown assured him that the garrison at montreal did not exceed thirty men and might easily be surprised allens partisan spirit was instantly excited here was a chance for another bold stroke equal to that at ticonderoga a plan was forthwith agreed upon allen was to return to longueil which is nearly opposite montreal and cross the st lawrence in canoes in the night so as to land a little below the town brown with two hundred men was to cross above and montreal was to be attacked simultaneously at opposite points  all this was arranged and put in action without the consent or knowledge of general montgomery allen was again the partisan leader acting from individual impulse the whole force with which he undertook his part of this inconsiderate enterprise was thirty americans and eighty canadians with these he crossed the river on the night of the 24th of september guards were stationed on the roads to prevent any one passing and giving the alarm in montreal day dawned but there was no signal of major brown having performed his part of the scheme the day advanced but still no signal it was evident major brown had not crossed allen would gladly have recrossed the river but it was too late an alarm had been given to the town and he soon found himself encountered by about forty regular soldiers and a hasty levy of canadians and indians a smart action ensued most of allens canadian recruits gave way and fled a number of americans were slain and he at length surrendered this reckless dash at montreal was viewed with concern by the american commander i am apprehensive of disagreeable consequences arising from mr allens imprudence writes general schuyler the conduct of allen was also severely censured by washington his misfortune said he will i hope teach a lesson of prudence and subordination to others  washington who was full of solicitude about the fate of arnold received a despatch from him dated october 13th from the great portage or carryingplace between the kennebec and dead rivers the toils of the expedition up the kennebec river had been excessive part of the men of each division managed the boatspart marched along the banks those on board had to labor against swift currents to unload at rapids transport the cargoes and sometimes the boats themselves for some distance on their shoulders and then to reload those on land had to scramble over rocks and precipices to struggle through swamps and fenny streams or cut their way through tangled thickets which reduced their clothes to rags with all their efforts their progress was but from four to ten miles a day  by the time they arrived at the place whence the letter was written fatigue swamp fevers and desertion had reduced their numbers to about nine hundred and fifty effective men arnold however wrote in good heart the last division said he is just arrived three divisions are over the first carryingplace and as the men are in high spirits i make no doubt of reaching the river chaudiere in eight or ten days the greatest difficulty being i hope already past     chapter xxii war along the coastprogress of the siege   while the two expeditions were threatening canada from different quarters the war was going on along the seaboard the british in boston cut off from supplies by land fitted out small armed vessels to seek them along the coast of new england the inhabitants drove their cattle into the interior or boldly resisted the aggressors parties landing to forage were often repulsed by hasty levies of the yeomanry scenes of ravage and violence occurred stonington was cannonaded and further measures of vengeance were threatened by captain wallace of the rose manofwar a naval officer who had acquired an almost piratical reputation along the coast and had his rendezvous in the harbor of newport domineering over the waters of rhode island  to check these maraudings and to capture the enemys transports laden with supplies the provinces of massachusetts rhode island and connecticut fitted out two armed vessels each at their own expense without seeking the sanction or aid of congress washington also on his own responsibility ordered several to be equipped for like purpose  among the sturdy little new england seaports which had become obnoxious to punishment by resistance to nautical exactions was falmouth now portland in maine on the evening of the 11th of october lieutenant mowat of the royal navy appeared before it with several armed vessels and sent a letter on shore apprising the inhabitants that he was come to execute a just punishment on them for their premeditated attacks on the legal prerogatives of the best of sovereigns two hours were given them to remove the human species out of the town with much difficulty and on the surrendering of some arms a respite was obtained until nine oclock the next morning and the inhabitants employed the interval in removing their families and effects about halfpast nine oclock the signal gun was fired and within five minutes several houses were in flames the inhabitants standing on the heights were spectators of the conflagration all the vessels in the harbor were destroyed or carried away as prizes and the town left a smoking ruin  the conflagration of falmouth was as a bale of fire throughout the country lieutenant mowat had declared to the people of falmouth that he had orders from admiral graves to set fire to all the seaport towns between boston and halifax washington supposed such to be the case general sullivan was sent to portsmouth where there was a fortification of some strength to give the inhabitants his advice and assistance in warding off the menaced blow newport also was put on the alert and recommended to fortify itself under the feeling roused by these reports the general court of massachusetts exercising a sovereign power passed an act for encouraging the fitting out of armed vessels to defend the seacoast of america and for erecting a court to try and condemn all vessels that should be found infesting the same this act granting letters of marque and reprisal anticipated any measure of the kind on the part of the general government  the british ministry have in later days been exculpated from the charge of issuing such a desolating order as that said to have been reported by lieutenant mowat the orders under which that officer acted we are told emanated from general gage and admiral graves whatever part general gage may have had in this most illadvised and discreditable measure it was the last of his military government and he did not remain long enough in the country to see it carried into effect he sailed for england on the 10th of october not absolutely superseded but called home in order as it was considerately said to give his majesty exact information of everything and suggest such matters as his knowledge and experience of the service might enable him to furnish during his absence majorgeneral howe would act as commanderinchief he never returned to america  on the 15th of october a committee from congress arrived in camp sent to hold a conference with washington and with delegates from the governments of connecticut rhode island massachusetts and new hampshire on the subject of a new organization of the army the committee consisted of benjamin franklin thomas lynch of carolina and colonel harrison of virginia washington was president of the board of conference and mr joseph reed secretary the committee brought an intimation from congress that an attack upon boston was much desired if practicable washington called a council of war of his generals on the subject they were unanimously of the opinion that an attack would not be prudent at present  the board of conference was repeatedly in session for three or four days the report of its deliberations rendered by the committee produced a resolution of congress that a new army of twentytwo thousand two hundred and seventytwo men and officers should be formed to be recruited as much as possible from the troops actually in service unfortunately the term for which they were to be enlisted was to be but for one year it formed a precedent which became a recurring cause of embarrassment throughout the war  washingtons secretary mr reed had after the close of the conference signified to him his intention to return to philadelphia where his private concerns required his presence his departure was deeply regretted on the departure of mr reed his place as secretary was temporarily supplied by mr robert harrison of maryland and subsequently by colonel mifflin neither however attained to the affectionate confidence reposed in their predecessor  the measures which general howe had adopted after taking command in boston rejoiced the royalists seeming to justify their anticipations he proceeded to strengthen the works on bunkers hill and boston neck and to clear away houses and throw up redoubts on eminences within the town the patriot inhabitants were shocked by the desecration of the old south church which was converted into a ridingschool the north church was entirely demolished and used for fuel  about the last of october howe issued three proclamations the first forbade all persons to leave boston without his permission under pain of military execution the second forbade any one so permitted to take with him more than five pounds sterling under pain of forfeiting all the money found upon his person and being subject to fine and imprisonment the third called upon the inhabitants to arm themselves for the preservation of order within the town they to be commanded by officers of his appointment  washington had recently been incensed by the conflagration of falmouth the conduct of governor dunmore who had proclaimed martial law in virginia and threatened ruin to the patriots had added to his provocation the measures of general howe seemed of the same harsh character and he determined to retaliate would it not be prudent writes he to governor trumbull of connecticut to seize those tories who have been are and we know will be active against us why should persons who are preying upon the vitals of their country be suffered to stalk at large whilst we know they will do us every mischief in their power  in this spirit he ordered general sullivan who was fortifying portsmouth to seize upon such persons as held commissions under the crown and were acting as open and avowed enemies to their country and hold them as hostages for the security of the town still he was moderate in his retaliation and stopped short of private individuals  the season was fast approaching when the bay between the camp and boston would be frozen over and military operations might be conducted upon the ice general howe if reinforced would then very probably endeavor to relieve himself from the disgraceful confinement in which the ministerial troops had been all summer washington felt the necessity therefore of guarding the camps wherever they were most assailable and of throwing up batteries for the purpose he had been embarrassed throughout the siege by the want of artillery and ordnance stores but never more so than at the present moment in this juncture mr henry knox stepped forward and offered to proceed to the frontier forts on champlain in quest of a supply knox was one of the patriots who had fought on bunkers hill since when he had aided in planning the defences of the camp before boston the aptness and talent here displayed by him as an artillerist had recently induced washington to recommend him to congress for the command of a regiment of artillery congress had not yet acted on that recommendation in the meantime washington availed himself of the offered services of knox in the present instance he was instructed to take an account of the cannon mortars shells lead and ammunition that were wanting he was to hasten to new york procure and forward all that could be had there and thence proceed to the headquarters of general schuyler who was requested by letter to aid him in obtaining what further supplies of the kind were wanting from the forts at ticonderoga crown point st johns and even quebec should it be in the hands of the americans knox set off on his errand with promptness and alacrity  the reenlistment of troops actually in service was now attempted and proved a fruitful source of perplexity in a letter to the president of congress washington observes that half of the officers of the rank of captain were inclined to retire and it was probable their example would influence their men of those who were disposed to remain the officers of one colony were unwilling to mix in the same regiment with those of another many sent in their names to serve in expectation of promotion others stood aloof to see what advantages they could make for themselves while those who had declined sent in their names again to serve the difficulties were greater if possible with the soldiers than with the officers they would not enlist unless they knew their colonel lieutenantcolonel and captain connecticut men being unwilling to serve under officers from massachusetts and massachusetts men under officers from rhode island so that it was necessary to appoint the officers first  twenty days later he again writes to the president of congress i am sorry to be necessitated to mention to you the egregious want of public spirit which prevails here instead of pressing to be engaged in the cause of their country which i vainly flattered myself would be the case i find we are likely to be deserted in a most critical time our situation is truly alarming and of this general howe is well apprised no doubt when he is reinforced he will avail himself of the information in a letter to reed he disburdened his heart more completely such dearth of public spirit and such want of virtue such stockjobbing and fertility in all the low arts to obtain advantage of one kind or another in this great change of military arrangement i never saw before and i pray gods mercy that i may never be witness to again     chapter xxiii affairs in canada   despatches from schuyler dated october 26th gave washington another chapter of the canada expedition chamblee an inferior fort within five miles of st johns had been captured montgomery now pressed the siege of st johns with vigor major preston although suffering for want of provisions still held out manfully hoping for relief from general carleton colonel maclean a brave and veteran scot had enlisted three hundred of his countrymen at quebec and was to land at the mouth of the sorel where it empties into the st lawrence and proceeding along the latter river join carleton at st johns who would repair thither by the way of longueil  on september 31st carleton embarked his force at montreal in thirtyfour boats to cross the st lawrence and land at longueil as the boats approached the shore a terrible fire of artillery and musketry opened upon them from a detachment of green mountain boys and new york troops stationed there under the command of colonel seth warner the boats were thrown into confusion some were disabled others were driven on shore on an island and carleton retreated with the rest to montreal this disorder led to the surrender of st johns the garrison of which consisted of five hundred regulars and one hundred canadians colonel maclean who was to have cooperated with carleton met with no better fortune than that commander while in full march for st johns he encountered majors brown and livingston who pressed him back to the mouth of the sorel where hearing of the repulse of carleton and being deserted by his canadian recruits he embarked the residue of his troops and set off down the st lawrence to quebec the americans now took post at the mouth of the sorel where they erected batteries so as to command the st lawrence and prevent the descent of any armed vessels from montreal  arnold meanwhile was advancing with severe toil and difficulty his troops and effects were transported across the carryingpoint between the kennebec and dead rivers on the latter river they landed their boats and navigated its sluggish waters to the foot of snow crowned mountains here they experienced heavy rains some of their boats were overturned by torrents from the mountains and many of their provisions lost the sick list increased and the spirits of the army gave way but the energy of arnold was unabated he pushed on and at lake megantic the source of the chaudiere he met an emissary whom he had sent forward to sound the feelings of the french yeomanry his report being favorable arnold divided his provisions among his troops and with a light foraging party pushed rapidly ahead to procure and send back supplies chaudiere is little better than a mountain torrent full of rocks and rapids arnold embarked upon it with his little party in five bateaux and a birch canoe three of the boats were dashed to pieces the cargoes lost and the crews saved with difficulty at length they reached sertigan the first french settlement where they were cordially received here arnold bought provisions which he sent back by the canadians and indians to his troops the latter were in a state of starvation  arnold halted for a short time in the hospitable valley of chaudiere to give his troops repose and distributed among the inhabitants the printed manifesto with which he had been furnished by washington here he was joined by about forty norridgewock indians on the 9th of november the little army emerged from the woods at point levi on the st lawrence opposite to quebec  leaving arnold in full sight of quebec we turn to narrate the events of the upper expedition into canada montgomery appeared before montreal on the 12th of november general carleton had embarked with his little garrison and several of the civil officers of the place on board of a flotilla of ten or eleven small vessels and made sail in the night the town capitulated of course and montgomery took quiet possession his urbanity and kindness soon won the good will of the inhabitants both english and french and made the canadians sensible that he really came to secure their rights not to molest them intercepted letters acquainted him with arnolds arrival in the neighborhood of quebec  his great immediate object was the capture of carleton which would form a triumphal close to the enterprise and might decide the fate of canada the flotilla in which the general was embarked had made repeated attempts to escape down the st lawrence but had as often been driven back by the batteries thrown up by the americans at the mouth of the sorel it now lay anchored about fifteen miles above the river and montgomery prepared to attack it with bateaux and light artillery so as to force it down upon the batteries carleton saw his imminent peril disguising himself as a canadian voyager he set off on a dark night accompanied by six peasants in a boat with muffled oars which he assisted to pull slipped quietly and silently past all the batteries and guardboats and effected his escape to three rivers where he embarked in a vessel for quebec after his departure the flotilla surrendered  montgomery now placed garrisons in montreal st johns and chamblee and made final preparations for descending the st lawrence and cooperating with arnold against quebec to his disappointment and deep chagrin he found but a handful of his troops disposed to accompany him some pleaded ill health the term of enlistment of many had expired and they were bent on returning home and others who had no such excuses to make became exceedingly turbulent and mutinous nothing but a sense of public duty and gratitude to congress for an unsought commission had induced montgomery to engage in the service wearied by the continual vexations which beset it he avowed in a letter to schuyler his determination to retire as soon as the intended expedition against quebec was finished  general montgomery had been thwarted continually in his efforts by the want of subordination and discipline among his troops who said he carry the spirit of freedom into the camp and think for themselves accustomed as he had been in his former military experience to the implicit obedience of european troops the insubordination of these yeoman soldiery was intolerable to him  the tidings of the capture of montreal gave washington the liveliest satisfaction he now looked forward to equal success in the expedition against quebec certain passages of schuylers letters however gave him deep concern wherein that general complained of the embarrassments and annoyances he had experienced from the insubordination of the army habituated to order said he i cannot without pain see that disregard of discipline confusion and inattention which reign so generally in this quarter and i am determined to retire of this resolution i have advised congress  he had indeed done so in communicating to the president of congress the complaints of general montgomery and his intention to retire my sentiments said he exactly coincide with his i shall with him do everything in my power to put a finishing stroke to the campaign and make the best arrangement in my power in order to insure success to the next this done i must beg leave to retire congress however was too well aware of his value readily to dispense with his services his letter produced a prompt resolution expressive of their high sense of his attention and perseverance which merited the thanks of the united colonies  what however produced a greater effect upon schuyler than any encomium or entreaty on the part of congress were the expostulations of washington inspired by strong friendship and kindred sympathies i am exceedingly sorry writes the latter that you and general montgomery incline to quit the service let me ask you sir when is the time for brave men to exert themselves in the cause of liberty and their country if this is not should any difficulties that they may have to encounter at this important crisis deter them god knows there is not a difficulty that you both very justly complain of that i have not in an eminent degree experienced that i am not every day experiencing but we must bear up against them and make the best of mankind as they are since we cannot have them as we wish let me therefore conjure you and mr montgomery to lay aside such thoughtsas thoughts injurious to yourselves and extremely so to your country which calls aloud for gentlemen of your ability  this noble appeal went straight to the heart of schuyler and brought out a magnanimous reply i do not hesitate writes he to answer my dear generals question in the affirmative by declaring that now or never is the time for every virtuous american to exert himself in the cause of liberty and his country and that it is become a duty cheerfully to sacrifice the sweets of domestic felicity to attain the honest and glorious end america has in view  the true cause of schuylers wish to retire from official station was the annoyance he had suffered through the campaign from sectional prejudices the eastern troops persistently declared that the general commanding in that quarter ought to be of the colony whence the majority of the troops came his liberal treatment of british and canadian prisoners was also a cause of offence and rendered him unpopular     chapter xxiv incidents of the camparnold before quebec   the forming even of the skeleton of an army under the new regulations had been a work of infinite difficulty to fill it up was still more difficult the first burst of revolutionary zeal had passed away enthusiasm had been chilled by the inaction and monotony of a long encampment an encampment moreover destitute of those comforts which in experienced warfare are provided by a wellregulated commissariat the troops had suffered privations of every kind want of fuel clothing provisions they looked forward with dismay to the rigors of winter and longed for their rustic homes and their family firesides  the connecticut troops whose time was expiring were urged to remain until december 10th when their place would be supplied by new levies they refused and withdrew on the 1st thereby greatly weakening the lines this conduct excited great indignation and the homewardbound warriors met with a reception on their arrival at home which prompted many to return again to camp  on the very day after the departure homeward of these troops and while it was feared their example would be contagious a long lumbering train of wagons laden with ordnance and military stores and decorated with flags came wheeling into the camp escorted by continental troops and country militia they were part of the cargo of a large brigantine laden with munitions of war captured and sent in to cape ann by the schooner lee captain manly one of the cruisers sent out by washington beside the ordnance captured there were two thousand stand of arms one hundred thousand flints thirty thousand round shot and thirtytwo tons of musket balls  it was a cheering incident and was eagerly turned to account among the ordnance was a huge brass mortar of a new construction weighing near three thousand pounds it was considered a glorious trophy and there was a resolve to christen it mifflin washingtons secretary suggested the name the mortar was fixed in a bed old putnam mounted it dashed on it a bottle of rum and gave it the name of congress  with washington this transient gleam of nautical success was soon overshadowed by the conduct of the cruisers he had sent to the st lawrence failing to intercept the brigantines the objects of their cruise they landed on the island of st johns plundered the house of the governor and several private dwellings and brought off three of the principal inhabitants prisoners one of whom mr callbeck was president of the council and acted as governor these gentlemen made a memorial to washington of this scandalous maraud he instantly ordered the restoration of the effects which had been pillaged  shortly after the foregoing occurrence information was received of the indignities which had been heaped upon colonel ethan allen who was loaded with chains and thrown into prison when captured at montreal by general prescott who himself was now a prisoner in the hands of the americans it touched washington on a point on which he was most sensitive and tenacious the treatment of american officers when captured  a correspondence ensued between washington and general howe in which the former threatened as retaliation to inflict upon general prescott the same treatment and fate which colonel allen should experience in reply howe asserted that his command did not extend to canada and that he had no knowledge of allen or his fate general carleton he assumed would not in this case forfeit his past pretensions to decency and humanity the measure of retaliation threatened by washington was actually meted out by congress on the arrival of general prescott in philadelphia he was ordered into close confinement in jail though not put in irons but subsequently on account of his health he was released  at the time of this correspondence with howe washington was earnestly occupied preparing works for the bombardment of boston should that measure be resolved upon by congress general putnam in the preceding month had taken possession in the night of cobble hill without molestation from the enemy though a commanding eminence and in two days had constructed a work which from its strength was named putnams impregnable fortress he was now engaged on another work on lechmere point to be connected with the works at cobble hill by a bridge thrown across williss creek and a covered way lechmere point is immediately opposite the north part of boston and the scarborough shipofwar was anchored near it putnam availed himself of a dark and foggy day dec 17 to commence operations and broke ground with four hundred men at ten oclock in the morning on a hill at the point the mist says a contemporary account was so great as to prevent the enemy from discovering what he was about until near twelve oclock when it cleared up and opened to their view our whole party at the point and another at the causeway throwing a bridge over the creek the scarborough anchored off the point poured in a broadside the enemy from boston threw shells the garrison at cobble hill returned fire our men were obliged to decamp from the point but the work was resumed by the brave old general at night  on the next morning general heath was detached with a party of men to carry on the work which putnam had commenced it was to consist of two redoubts on one of which was to be a mortar battery there was as yet a deficiency of ordnance but the prize mortar was to be mounted which putnam had recently christened the congress for several days the labor at the works was continued the redoubts were thrown up and a covered way was constructed leading down to the bridge all this was done notwithstanding the continual fire of the enemy putnam anticipated great effects from this work and especially from his grand mortar shells there were in abundance for a bombardment the only thing wanting was a supply of powder  amid the various concerns of the war and the multiplied perplexities of the camp the thoughts of washington continually reverted to his home on the banks of the potomac a constant correspondence was kept up between him and his agent mr lund washington who had charge of his various estates the general gave clear and minute directions as to their management and the agent rendered as clear and minute returns of everything that had been done in consequence according to recent accounts mount vernon had been considered in danger lord dunmore was exercising martial law in the ancient dominion and it was feared that the favorite abode of the rebel commanderinchief would be marked out for hostility and that the enemy might land from their ships in the potomac and lay it waste washingtons brother john augustine had entreated mrs washington to leave it the people of loudoun had advised her to seek refuge beyond the blue ridge and had offered to send a guard to escort her she had declined the offer not considering herself in danger lund washington was equally free from apprehensions on the subject though alive to everything concerning mount vernon washington agreed with them in deeming it in no present danger of molestation by the enemy still he felt for the loneliness of mrs washingtons situation heightened as it must be by anxiety on his own account he wrote to her therefore by express in november inviting her to join him at the camp he at the same time wrote to lund washington engaging his continued services as an agent this person though bearing the same name and probably of the same stock does not appear to have been in any near degree of relationship  mrs washington came on with her own carriage and horses accompanied by her son mr custis and his wife escorts and guards of honor attended her from place to place and she was detained some time at philadelphia by the devoted attention of the inhabitants her arrival at cambridge was a glad event in the army  mrs washington presided at headquarters with dignity and affability some questions of ceremony had arisen and jealousies had been excited in reference to invitations to headquarters the presence of mrs washington relieved the general from numerous perplexities of this character after her arrival the camp assumed a more convivial tone than before and parties became common  while giving these familiar scenes and occurrences we are tempted to subjoin one furnished from the manuscript memoir of an eye witness a large party of virginia riflemen who had recently arrived in camp were strolling about cambridge and viewing the collegiate buildings now turned into barracks their halfindian equipments and fringed and ruffled hunting garbs provoked the merriment of some troops from marblehead chiefly fishermen and sailors who thought nothing equal to the round jacket and trowsers a bantering ensued between them there was snow upon the ground and snowballs began to fly when jokes were wanting the parties waxed warm with the contest they closed and came to blows both sides were reinforced and in a little while at least a thousand were at fisticuffs and there was a tumult in the camp worthy of the days of homer at this juncture writes our informant washington made his appearance whether by accident or design i never knew i saw none of his aides with him his black servant was just behind him mounted he threw the bridle of his own horse into his servants hands sprang from his seat rushed into the thickest of the mel√©e seized two tall brawny riflemen by the throat keeping them at armslength talking to and shaking them  as they were from his own province he may have felt peculiarly responsible for their good conduct they were engaged too in one of those sectional brawls which were his especial abhorrence his reprimand must therefore have been a vehement one he was commanding in his serenest moments but irresistible in his bursts of indignation on the present occasion we are told his appearance and stronghanded rebuke put an instant end to the tumult the combatants dispersed in all directions and in less than three minutes none remained on the ground but the two he had collared  the invasion of canada still shared the anxious thoughts of washington his last accounts of the movements of arnold left him at point levi opposite to quebec it was his intention to cross the river immediately at point levi however he was brought to a stand not a boat was to be found there letters to generals schuyler and montgomery had been carried by his faithless messengers to caramh√© the lieutenantgovernor who had caused all the boats of point levi to be either removed or destroyed  arnold was not a man to be disheartened by difficulties with great exertions he procured about forty birch canoes but stormy winds arose and for some days the river was too boisterous for such frail craft in the meantime the garrison at quebec was gaining strength the veteran maclean arrived down the river with his corps of royal highland emigrants and threw himself into the place the lizard frigate the hornet sloopofwar and two armed schooners were stationed in the river and guardboats patrolled at night  on the 13th of november arnold received intelligence that montgomery had captured st johns he was instantly roused to emulation his men too were inspirited by the news the wind had abated he determined to cross the river that very night at a late hour in the evening he embarked with the first division by four oclock in the morning a large part of his force had crossed without being perceived and landed about a mile and a half above cape diamond at wolfes cove so called from being the landingplace of that gallant commander just then a guardboat belonging to the lizard came slowly along shore and discovered them they hailed it and ordered it to land not complying it was fired into and three men were killed the boat instantly pulled for the frigate giving vociferous alarm  without waiting the arrival of the residue of his men for whom the canoes had been despatched arnold led those who had landed to the foot of the cragged defile once scaled by the intrepid wolfe and scrambled up it in all haste by daylight he had planted his daring flag on the farfamed heights of abraham here the main difficulty stared him in the face a strong line of walls and bastions traversed the promontory from one of its precipitous sides to the other enclosing the upper and lower towns on the right the great bastion of cape diamond crowned the rocky height of that name on the left was the bastion of la potasse close by the gate of st johns opening upon the barracks  a council of war was now held arnold who had some knowledge of the place was for dashing forward at once and storming the gate of st johns had they done so they might have been successful the gate was open and unguarded through some blunder and delay a message from the commander of the lizard to the lieutenantgovernor had not yet been delivered and no alarm had reached the fortress the formidable aspect of the place however awed arnolds associates cautious counsel is often fatal to a daring enterprise while the counsel of war deliberated the favorable moment passed away the lieutenantgovernor received the tardy message he hastily assembled the merchants officers of militia and captains of merchant vessels all promised to stand by him and the walls looking upon the heights were soon manned by the military arnold paraded his men within a hundred yards of the walls and caused them to give three hearty cheers hoping to excite a revolt in the place or to provoke the scanty garrison to a sally there was some firing on the part of the americans but merely as an additional taunt they were too far off for their musketry to have effect a large cannon on the ramparts was brought to bear on them and a few shots obliged the americans to retire and encamp  in the evening arnold sent a flag demanding in the name of the united colonies the surrender of the place some of the disaffected and the fainthearted were inclined to open the gates but were held in check by the mastiff loyalty of maclean the inhabitants gradually recovered from their alarm and armed themselves to defend their property the sailors and marines proved a valuable addition to the garrison which now really meditated a sortie arnold received information of all this from friends within the walls he heard about the same time of the capture of montreal and that general carleton having escaped from that place was on his way down to quebec he thought at present therefore to draw off on the 19th to point aux trembles aspentree point twenty miles above quebec there to await the arrival of general montgomery with troops and artillery as his little army wended its way along the high bank of the river towards its destined encampment a vessel passed below which had just touched at point aux trembles on board of it was general carleton hurrying on to quebec     chapter xxv washingtons perplexitiesnew york in danger   in the month of december a vessel had been captured bearing supplies from lord dunmore to the army at boston a letter on board from his lordship to general howe invited him to transfer the war to the southern colonies or at all events to send reinforcements thither intimating at the same time his plan of proclaiming liberty to indentured servants negroes and others appertaining to rebels and inviting them to join his majestys troops in a word to inflict upon virginia the horrors of a servile war if this man is not crushed before spring writes washington he will become the most formidable enemy america has his strength will increase as a snowball  general lee took the occasion to set forth his own system of policy had my opinion been thought worthy of attention would he say lord dunmore would have been disarmed of his teeth and claws he would seize tryon too and every governor government man placeman tory and enemy to liberty on the continent and confiscate their estates or at least lay them under heavy contributions for the public their persons should be secured in some of the interior towns as hostages for the treatment of those of our party whom the fortune of war shall throw into their hands they should be allowed a reasonable pension out of their fortunes for their maintenance  such was the policy advocated by lee in his letters and conversation and he soon had an opportunity of carrying it partly into operation newport being threatened by a naval armament from boston general lee was despatched at the request of the governor to put the island in a state of defence lee set out with alacrity having laid out works and given directions for fortifications he summoned before him a number of persons who had been in the habit of supplying the enemy and compelled them all to take an oath of fidelity to the continental claim those who refused were put under guard and sent to providence congress was disposed to consider these measures too highhanded but washington approved of them  december had been throughout a month of severe trial to washington during which he saw his army dropping away piecemeal before his eyes homeward every face was turned as soon as the term of enlistment was at an end scarce could the disbanding troops be kept a few days in camp until militia could be procured to supply their place washington made repeated and animated appeals to their patriotism they were almost unheeded he caused popular and patriotic songs to be sung about the camp they passed by like the idle wind home home home throbbed in every heart the desire of retiring into a chimneycorner says washington reproachfully seized the troops as soon as their terms expired  greene throughout this trying month was continually by washingtons side his letters expressing the same cares and apprehensions and occasionally in the same language with those of the commanderinchief show how completely he was in his councils the 31st of december arrived the crisis of the army for with that month expired the last of the old terms of enlistment we never have been so weak writes greene as we shall be tomorrow when we dismiss the old troops on this day washington received cheering intelligence from canada a junction had taken place a month previously between arnold and montgomery at point aux trembles they were about two thousand strong and were making every preparation for attacking quebec  on the following morning january 1st 1776 his army did not amount to ten thousand men and was composed of but halffilled regiments even in raising this inadequate force it had been necessary to indulge many of the men with furloughs that they might visit their families and friends the detachments of militia from the neighboring provinces which replaced the disbanding troops remained but for brief periods so that in despite of every effort the lines were often but feebly manned and might easily have been forced  the anxiety of washington in this critical state of the army may be judged from his correspondence with reed it is easier to conceive than to describe the situation of my mind for some time past and my feelings under our present circumstances writes he on the 4th of january search the volumes of history through and i much question whether a case similar to ours is to be found namely to maintain a post against the power of the british troops for six months together without powder and then to have one army disbanded and another raised within the same distance musket shot of a reinforced enemy what may be the issue of the last manoeuvre time only can unfold i wish this month were well over our head  in the midst of his discouragements washington received letters from knox showing the spirit and energy with which he was executing his mission in quest of cannon and ordnance stores he had struggled manfully and successfully with all kinds of difficulties from the advanced season and head winds in getting them from ticonderoga to the head of lake george three days ago writes he on the 17th of december it was very uncertain whether we could get them over until next spring but now please god they shall go i have made fortytwo exceedingly strong sleds and have provided eighty yoke of oxen to drag them as far as springfield where i shall get fresh cattle to take them to camp  early in the month of january there was a great stir of preparation in boston harbor a fleet of transports were taking in supplies and making arrangements for the embarkation of troops bombketches and flatbottomed boats were getting ready for sea as were two sloopsofwar which were to convey the armament its destination was kept secret but was confidently surmised by washington  in the preceding month of october a letter had been laid before congress written by some person in london of high credibility and revealing a secret plan of operations said to have been sent out by ministers to the commanders in boston the following is the purport possession was to be gained of new york and albany through the assistance of governor tryon on whose influence with the tory part of the population much reliance was placed these cities were to be very strongly garrisoned all who did not join the kings forces were to be declared rebels the hudson river and the east river or sound were to be commanded by a number of small menofwar and cutters stationed in different parts so as wholly to cut off all communication by water between new york and the provinces to the northward of it and between new york and albany except for the kings service and to prevent also all communication between the city of new york and the provinces of new jersey pennsylvania and those to the southward of them by these means said the letter the administration and their friends fancy they shall soon either starve out or retake the garrisons of crown point and ticonderoga and open and maintain a safe intercourse and correspondence between quebec albany and new york and thereby offer the fairest opportunity to their soldiery and the canadians in conjunction with the indians to be procured by guy johnson to make continual irruptions into new hampshire massachusetts and connecticut and so distract and divide the provincial forces as to render it easy for the british army at boston to defeat them break the spirits of the massachusetts people depopulate their country and compel an absolute subjection to great britain  this information had already excited solicitude respecting the hudson and led to measures for its protection it was now surmised that the expedition preparing to sail from boston and which was to be conducted by sir henry clinton might be destined to seize upon new york how was the apprehended blow to be parried general lee who was just returned from his energetic visit to rhode island offered his advice and services in the matter in a letter to washington he urged him to act at once and on his own responsibility without awaiting the tardy and doubtful sanction of congress for which in military matters lee had but small regard  new york must be secured writes he but it will never i am afraid be secured by due order of the congress for obvious reasons they find themselves awkwardly situated on this head you must step in to their relief i am sensible no man can be spared from the lines under present circumstances but i would propose that you should detach me into connecticut and lend your name for collecting a body of volunteers i am assured that i shall find no difficulty in assembling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted this body in conjunction if there should appear occasion to summon them with the jersey regiment under the command of lord stirling now at elizabethtown will effect the security of new york and the expulsion or suppression of that dangerous banditti of tories who have appeared on long island with the professed intention of acting against the authority of congress  washington while he approved of lees military suggestions was cautious in exercising the powers vested in him and fearful of transcending them john adams was at that time in the vicinity of the camp and he asked his opinion as to the practicability and expediency of the plan and whether it might not be regarded as beyond his line adams resolute of spirit thought the enterprise might easily be accomplished by the friends of liberty in new york in connection with the connecticut people who are very ready said he upon such occasions  thus fortified as it were by congressional sanction through one of its most important members who pronounced new york as much within his command as massachusetts he gave lee authority to carry out his plans he was to raise volunteers in connecticut march at their head to new york call in military aid from new jersey put the city and the post on the hudson in a posture of security against surprise disarm all persons on long island and elsewhere inimical to the views of congress or secure them in some other manner if necessary and seize upon all medicines shirts and blankets and send them on for the use of the american army  lee departed on his mission on the 8th of january the people of new york were thrown into a panic on hearing that lee was in connecticut on his way to take military possession of the city they apprehended his appearance there would provoke an attack from the ships in the harbor some who thought the war about to be brought to their own doors packed up their effects and made off into the country with their wives and children others beleaguered the committee of safety with entreaties against the deprecated protection of general lee the committee through pierre van cortlandt their chairman addressed a letter to lee inquiring into the motives of his coming with an army to new york and stating the incapacity of the city to act hostilely against the ships of war in port from deficiency of powder and a want of military works  lee in reply dated stamford january 23d disclaimed all intention of commencing actual hostilities against the menofwar in the harbor his instructions from the commanderinchief being solely to prevent the enemy from taking post in the city or lodging themselves on long island some subordinate purposes were likewise to be executed which were much more proper to be communicated by word of mouth than by writing in compliance with the wishes of the committee he promised to carry with him into the town just troops enough to secure it against any present designs of the enemy leaving his main force on the western border of connecticut how he conducted himself on his arrival in the city we shall relate in a future chapter     chapter xxvi attack on quebecaffairs in new york   from amid surrounding perplexities washington still turned a hopeful eye to canada he expected daily to receive tidings that montgomery and arnold were within the walls of quebec on the 18th of january came dispatches to him from general schuyler containing withering tidings the following is the purport montgomery on the 2d of december the day after his arrival at point aux trembles set off in face of a driving snowstorm for quebec and arrived before it on the 5th the works from their great extent appeared to him incapable of being defended by the actual garrison made up as he said of macleans banditti the sailors from the frigates and other vessels together with the citizens obliged to take up arms  on the day of his arrival he sent a flag with a summons to surrender it was fired upon and obliged to retire exasperated at this outrage montgomery wrote an indignant letter to carleton reiterating the demand magnifying the number of his troops and warning him against the consequences of an assault finding it was rejected from the walls he prepared for an attack the ground was frozen to a great depth and covered with snow by dint of excessive labor a breastwork was thrown up four hundred yards distant from the walls and opposite to the gate of st louis which is nearly in the centre it was formed of gabions ranged side by side and filled with snow over which water was thrown until thoroughly frozen here captain lamb mounted five light pieces and a howitzer several mortars were placed in the suburbs of st roque which extends on the left of the promontory below the heights and nearly on a level with the river  from the ice battery captain lamb opened a wellsustained and welldirected fire upon the walls but his fieldpieces were too light to be effective with his howitzer he threw shells into the town and set it on fire in several places  on the evening of the fifth day montgomery paid a visit to the ice battery the heavy artillery from the wall had repaid its ineffectual fire with ample usury the brittle ramparts had been shivered like glass several of the guns had been rendered useless the general saw the insufficiency of the battery and on retiring gave captain lamb permission to leave it whenever he thought proper the veteran waited until after dark when securing all the guns he abandoned the ruined redoubt  nearly three weeks had been consumed in these futile operations the army illclothed and illprovided was becoming impatient of the rigors of a canadian winter the term for which part of the troops had enlisted would expire with the year and they already talked of returning home montgomery was sadly conscious of the insufficiency of his means still he could not endure the thoughts of retiring from before the place without striking a blow he determined therefore to attempt to carry the place by escalade colonel livingston was to make a false attack on the gate of st johns and set fire to it major brown with another detachment was to menace the bastion of cape diamond arnold with three hundred and fifty of the hardy fellows who had followed him through the wilderness strengthened by captain lamb and forty of his company was to assault the suburbs and batteries of st roque while montgomery with the residue of his forces was to pass below the bastion at cape diamond defile along the river carry the defences at drummonds wharf and thus enter the lower town on one side while arnold forced his way into it on the other these movements were all to be made at the same time on the discharge of signal rockets thus distracting the enemy and calling their attention to four several points  on the 31st of december at two oclock in the morning the troops repaired to their several destinations under cover of a violent snowstorm by some mistake the signal rockets were let off before the lower divisions had time to get to their fighting ground they were descried by one of macleans highland officers who gave the alarm livingston also failed to make the false attack on the gate of st johns which was to have caused a diversion favorable to arnolds attack on the suburb below  the feint by major brown on the bastion of cape diamond was successful and concealed the march of general montgomery that gallant commander descended from the heights to wolfes cove and led his division along the shore of the st lawrence round the beetling promontory of cape diamond the narrow approach to the lower town in that direction was traversed by a picket or stockade defended by canadian militia beyond which was a second defence a kind of blockhouse the aim of montgomery was to come upon these barriers by surprise the pass which they defended is formidable at all times having a swift river on one side and overhanging precipices on the other but at this time was rendered peculiarly difficult by drifting snow and by great masses of ice piled on each other at the foot of the cliffs  the troops made their way painfully in extended and straggling files along the narrow footway and over the slippery piles of ice among the foremost were some of the first new york regiment led on by captain cheeseman montgomery in his eagerness threw himself far in the advance with his pioneers and a few officers and made a dash at the first barrier the canadians stationed there taken by surprise made a few random shots then threw down their muskets and fled montgomery sprang forward aided with his own hand to pluck down the pickets which the pioneers were sawing and having made a breach sufficiently wide to admit three or four men abreast entered sword in hand the canadians had fled from the picket to the battery or blockhouse montgomery again dashed forward but when within forty paces of the battery a discharge of grapeshot from a single cannon made deadly havoc montgomery and mcpherson one of his aides were killed on the spot captain cheeseman received a canister shot through the body with him fell his orderly sergeant and several of his men this fearful slaughter and the death of their general threw everything in confusion colonel campbell quartermaster general took the command and ordered a retreat  while all this was occurring on the side of cape diamond arnold led his division against the opposite side of the lower town along the suburb and street of st roque like montgomery he took the advance at the head of a forlorn hope of twentyfive men captain lamb and his artillery company came next with a fieldpiece mounted on a sledge then came a company with ladders and scaling implements followed by morgan and his riflemen in the rear of all these came the main body a battery on a wharf commanded the narrow pass by which they had to advance this was to be attacked with the fieldpiece and then scaled with ladders by the forlorn hope while captain morgan with his riflemen was to pass round the wharf on the ice  the false attack which was to have been made by livingston on the gate of st johns by way of diversion had not taken place there was nothing therefore to call off the attention of the enemy in this quarter from the detachment the troops as they straggled along in lengthened file through the drifting snow were sadly galled by a flanking fire on the right from walls and pickets the fieldpiece at length became so deeply embedded in a snowdrift that it could not be moved lamb sent word to arnold of the impediment in the meantime he and his artillery company were brought to a halt the company with the scaling ladders would have halted also having been told to keep in the rear of the artillery but they were urged on by morgan with a thundering oath who pushed on after them with his riflemen the artillery company opening to the right and left to let them pass  they arrived in the advance just as arnold was leading on his forlorn hope to attack the barrier before he reached it a severe wound in the right leg with a musket ball completely disabled him and he had to be borne from the field morgan instantly took the command just then lamb came up with his company armed with muskets and bayonets having received orders to abandon the fieldpiece and support the advance oswald joined him with the forlorn hope the battery which commanded the defile mounted two pieces of cannon there was a discharge of grapeshot when the assailants were close under the muzzles of the guns yet but one man was killed before there could be a second discharge the battery was carried by assault some firing in to the embrasures others scaling the walls the captain and thirty of his men were taken prisoners  the day was just dawning as morgan led on to attack the second barrier and his men had to advance under a fire from the town walls on their right which incessantly thinned their ranks the second barrier was reached they applied their scaling ladders to storm it the defence was brave and obstinate but the defenders were at length driven from their guns and the battery was gained at the last moment one of the gunners ran back linstock in hand to give one more shot captain lamb snapped a fusee at him it missed fire the cannon was discharged and a grapeshot wounded lamb in the head carrying away part of the cheekbone he was borne off senseless to a neighboring shed  the two barriers being now taken the way on this side into the lower town seemed open morgan prepared to enter it with the victorious vanguard first stationing captain dearborn and some provincials at palace gate which opened down into the defile from the upper town by this time however the death of montgomery and retreat of campbell had enabled the enemy to turn all their attention in this direction a large detachment sent by general carleton sallied out of palace gate after morgan had passed it surprised and captured dearborn and the guard and completely cut off the advanced party the main body informed of the death of montgomery and giving up the game as lost retreated to the camp leaving behind the fieldpiece which lambs company had abandoned and the mortars in the battery of st roque morgan and his men were now hemmed in on all sides and obliged to take refuge in a stone house from the inveterate fire which assailed them from the windows of this house they kept up a desperate defence until cannon were brought to bear upon it then hearing of the death of montgomery and seeing that there was no prospect of relief morgan and his gallant handful of followers were compelled to surrender themselves prisoners of war  thus foiled at every point the wrecks of the little army abandoned their camp and retreated about three miles from the town where they hastily fortified themselves apprehending a pursuit by the garrison general carleton however contented himself with having secured the safety of the place and remained cautiously passive until he should be properly reinforced  the remains of the gallant montgomery received a soldiers grave within the fortifications of quebec by the care of cramah√© the lieutenantgovernor who had formerly known him  arnold took temporary command of the shattered army until general wooster should arrive from montreal to whom he sent an express urging him to bring on succor on this occasion says a contemporary writer he discovered the utmost vigor of a determined mind and a genius full of resources defeated and wounded as he was he put his troops into such a situation as to keep them still formidable with a mere handful of men at one time not exceeding five hundred he maintained a blockade of the strong fortress from which he had just been repulsed  general schuyler who was now in albany urged the necessity of an immediate reinforcement of three thousand men for the army in canada washington had not a man to spare from the army before boston he applied therefore on his own responsibility to massachusetts new hampshire and connecticut for three regiments which were granted his prompt measure received the approbation of congress and further reinforcements were ordered from the same quarters  solicitude was awakened about the interior of the province of new york arms and ammunition were said to be concealed in tryon county and numbers of the tories in that neighborhood preparing for hostilities sir john johnson had fortified johnson hall gathered about him his scotch highland tenants and indian allies and it was rumored he intended to carry fire and sword along the valley of the mohawk  schuyler in consequence received orders from congress to take measures for securing the military stores disarming the disaffected and apprehending their chiefs he forthwith hastened from albany at the head of a body of soldiers was joined by colonel herkimer with the militia of tryon county marshalled forth on the frozen bosom of the mohawk river and appeared before sir johns stronghold near johnstown on the 19th of january thus beleaguered sir john after much negotiation capitulated he was to surrender all weapons of war and military stores in his possession and to give his parole not to take arms against america  the recent reverses in canada had heightened the solicitude of washington about the province of new york that province was the central and allimportant link in the confederacy but he feared it might prove a brittle one we have already mentioned the adverse influences in operation there a large number of friends to the crown among the official and commercial classes rank tories as they were called in the city and about the neighboring country particularly on long and staten islands kings ships at anchor in the bay and harbor keeping up a suspicious intercourse with the citizens while governor tryon castled as it were on board one of these ships carried on intrigues with those disaffected to the popular cause in all parts of the neighborhood  lee arrived at new york on the 4th of february his caustic humors sharpened by a severe attack of the gout which had rendered it necessary while on the march to carry him for a considerable part of the way in a litter by a singular coincidence on the very day of his arrival sir henry clinton with the squadron which had sailed so mysteriously from boston looked into the harbor though it was sabbath says a letterwriter of the day it threw the whole city into such a convulsion as it never knew before many of the inhabitants hastened to move their effects into the country expecting an immediate conflict  clinton sent for the mayor and expressed much surprise and concern at the distress caused by his arrival which was merely he said on a short visit to his friend tryon and to see how matters stood he professed a juvenile love for the place and desired that the inhabitants might be informed of the purport of his visit and that he would go away as soon as possible for this time the inhabitants of new york were let off for their fears clinton after a brief visit continued his mysterious cruise openly avowing his destination to be north carolinawhich nobody believed simply because he avowed it  the necessity of conferring with committees at every step was a hard restraint upon a man of lees ardent and impatient temper who had a soldierlike contempt for the men of peace around him yet at the outset he bore it better than might have been expected the congress committees a certain number of the committees of safety and your humble servant writes he to washington have had two conferences the result is such as will agreeably surprise you it is in the first place agreed and justly that to fortify the town against shipping is impracticable but we are to fortify lodgements on some commanding part of the city for two thousand men we are to erect enclosed batteries on both sides of the water near hell gate which will answer the double purpose of securing the town against piracies through the sound and secure our communication with long island now become a more important point than ever as it is determined to form a strong fortified camp of three thousand men on the island immediately opposite to new york the pass in the highlands is to be made as respectable as possible and guarded by a battalion in short i think the plan judicious and complete  the pass in the highlands above alluded to is that grand defile of the hudson where for upwards of fifteen miles it wends its deep channel between stern forestclad mountains and rocky promontories two forts about six miles distant from each other and commanding narrow parts of the river at its bends through these highlands had been commenced in the preceding autumn by order of the continental congress but they were said to be insufficient for the security of that important pass and were to be extended and strengthened  washington had charged lee in his instructions to keep a stern eye upon the tories who were active in new york you can seize upon the persons of the principals said he they must be so notoriously known that there will be little danger of committing mistakes lee acted up to the letter of these instructions and weeded out with a vigorous hand some of the rankest of the growth  in the exercise of his military functions lee set governor tryon and the captain of the asia at defiance they had threatened perdition to the town writes he to washington if the cannon were removed from the batteries and wharves but i ever considered their threats as a brutum fulmen and even persuaded the town to be of the same way of thinking we accordingly conveyed them to a place of safety in the middle of the day and no cannonade ensued  lee now proceeded with his plan of defences a strong redoubt capable of holding three hundred men was commenced at horens hook commanding the pass at hell gate so as to block up from the enemys ships the passage between the mainland and long island a regiment was stationed on the island making fascines and preparing other materials for constructing the works for an intrenched camp which lee hoped would render it impossible for the enemy to get a footing there what to do with this city writes he i own puzzles me it is so encircled with deep navigable water that whoever commands the sea must command the town tomorrow i shall begin to dismantle that part of the fort next to the town to prevent its being converted into a citadel i shall barrier the principal streets and at least if i cannot make it a continental garrison it shall be a disputable field of battle batteries were to be erected on an eminence behind trinity church to keep the enemys ships at so great a distance as not to injure the town  kings bridge at the upper end of manhattan or new york island linking it with the mainland was pronounced by lee a most important pass without which the city could have no communication with connecticut it was therefore to be made as strong as possible heavy cannon were to be sent up to the forts in the highlands which were to be enlarged and strengthened  in the midst of his schemes lee received orders from congress to the command in canada vacant by the death of montgomery he bewailed the defenceless condition of the city the continental congress as he said not having as yet taken the least step for its security the instant i leave it said he i conclude the provincial congress and inhabitants in general will relapse into their former hysterics the menofwar and mr tryon will return to their old station at the wharves and the first regiments who arrive from england will take quiet possession of the town and long island     chapter xxvii movements before bostonits evacuation   the siege of boston continued through the winter without any striking incident to enliven its monotony the british remained within their works leaving the beleaguering army slowly to augment its forces the country was dissatisfied with the inaction of the latter even congress was anxious for some successful blow that might revive popular enthusiasm washington shared this anxiety and had repeatedly in councils of war suggested an attack upon the town but had found a majority of his general officers opposed to it he had hoped some favorable opportunity would present itself when the harbor being frozen the troops might approach the town upon the ice the winter however though severe at first proved a mild one and the bay continued open general putnam in the meantime having completed the new works at lechmere point and being desirous of keeping up the spirit of his men resolved to treat them to an exploit accordingly from his impregnable fortress of cobble hill he detached a party of about two hundred under his favorite officer major knowlton to surprise and capture a british guard stationed at charlestown it was a daring enterprise and executed with spirit as charlestown neck was completely protected knowlton led his men across the milldam round the base of the hill and immediately below the fort set fire to the guardhouse and some buildings in its vicinity made several prisoners and retired without loss although thundered upon by the cannon of the fort  meanwhile washington was incessantly goaded by the impatient murmurs of the public as we may judge by his letters to mr reed i know the integrity of my own heart writes he on the 10th of february but to declare it unless to a friend may be an argument of vanity i know the unhappy predicament i stand in i know that much is expected of me i know that without men without arms without ammunition without anything fit for the accommodation of a soldier little is to be done and what is mortifying i know that i cannot stand justified to the world without exposing my own weakness and injuring the cause by declaring my wants which i am determined not to do further than unavoidable necessity brings every man acquainted with them  he still adhered to his opinion in favor of an attempt upon the town he was aware that it would be attended with considerable loss but believed it would be successful if the men should behave well within a few days after the date of this letter the bay became sufficiently frozen for the transportation of troops this writes he to reed i thought knowing the ice would not last a favorable opportunity to make an assault upon the troops in town i proposed it in council but behold though we had been waiting all the year for this favorable event the enterprise was thought too dangerous  at length the camp was rejoiced by the arrival of colonel knox with his long train of sledges drawn by oxen bringing more than fifty cannon mortars howitzers beside supplies of lead and flints the zeal and perseverance which he had displayed in his wintry expedition across frozen lakes and snowy wastes and the intelligence with which he had fulfilled his instructions won him the entire confidence of washington his conduct in this enterprise was but an earnest of that energy and ability which he displayed throughout the war  further ammunition being received from the royal arsenal at new york and other quarters and a reinforcement of ten regiments of militia washington no longer met with opposition to his warlike measures lechmere point which putnam had fortified was immediately to be supplied with mortars and heavy cannon so as to command boston on the north and dorchester heights on the south of the town were forthwith to be taken possession of their possession would enable him to push his works to nooks hill and other points opposite boston whence a cannonade and bombardment must drive the enemy from the city  the council of massachusetts at his request ordered the militia of the towns contiguous to dorchester and roxbury to hold themselves in readiness to repair to the lines at those places with arms ammunition and accoutrements on receiving a preconcerted signal  washington felt painfully aware how much depended upon the success of this attempt there was a cloud of gloom and distrust lowering upon the public mind danger threatened on the north and on the south montgomery had fallen before the walls of quebec the army in canada was shattered tryon and the tories were plotting mischief in new york dunmore was harassing the lower part of virginia and clinton and his fleet were prowling along the coast on a secret errand of mischief  in the general plan it was concerted that should the enemy detach a large force to dislodge our men from dorchester heights as had been done in the affair of bunkers hill an attack upon the opposite side of the town should forthwith be made by general putnam for this purpose he was to have four thousand picked men in readiness in two divisions under generals sullivan and greene at a concerted signal from roxbury they were to embark in boats near the mouth of charles river cross under cover of the fire of three floating batteries land in two places in boston secure its strong posts force the gates and works at the neck and let in the roxbury troops  the evening of monday the 4th of march was fixed upon for the occupation of dorchester heights the ground was frozen too hard to be easily intrenched fascines therefore and gabions and bundles of screwed hay were collected during the two preceding nights with which to form breastworks and redoubts during these two busy nights the enemys batteries were cannonaded and bombarded from opposite points to occupy their attention and prevent their noticing these preparations they replied with spirit and the incessant roar of artillery thus kept up covered completely the rumbling of wagons and ordnance  as soon as the firing commenced the detachment under general thomas set out on its cautious and secret march from the lines of roxbury and dorchester everything was conducted as regularly and quietly as possible a covering party of eight hundred men preceded the carts with the intrenching tools then came general thomas with the working party twelve hundred strong followed by a train of three hundred wagons laden with fascines gabions and hay screwed into bundles of seven or eight hundred weight a great number of such bundles were ranged in a line along dorchester neck on the side next the enemy to protect the troops while passing from being raked by the fire of the enemy fortunately although the moon as washington writes was shining in its full lustre the flash and roar of cannonry from opposite points and the bursting of bombshells high in the air so engaged and diverted the attention of the enemy that the detachment reached the heights about eight oclock without being heard or perceived the covering party then divided one half proceeded to the point nearest boston the other to the one nearest to castle williams the working party commenced to fortify under the directions of gridley the veteran engineer who had planned the works on bunkers hill it was severe labor for the earth was frozen eighteen inches deep but the men worked with more than their usual spirit for the eye of the commanderinchief was upon them though not called there by his duties washington could not be absent from this eventful operation  the labors of the night were carried on with activity and address when a relief party arrived at four oclock in the morning two forts were in sufficient forwardness to furnish protection against smallarms and grapeshot and such use was made of the fascines and bundles of screwed hay that at dawn a formidablelooking fortress frowned along the height howe gazed at the mushroom fortress with astonishment as it loomed indistinctly but grandly through a morning fog the rebels exclaimed he have done more work in one night than my whole army would have done in one month  washington had watched with intense anxiety the effect of the revelation at daybreak an american who was on dorchester heights gives a picture of the scene a tremendous cannonade was commenced from the forts in boston and the shipping in the harbor cannon shot writes he are continually rolling and rebounding over the hill and it is astonishing to observe how little our soldiers are terrified by them the royal troops are perceived to be in motion as if embarking to pass the harbor and land on dorchester shore to attack our works the hills and elevations in this vicinity are covered with spectators to witness deeds of horror in the expected conflict  general thomas was reinforced with two thousand men old putnam stood ready to make a descent upon the north side of the town with his four thousand picked men as soon as the heights on the south should be assailed as washington rode about the heights he reminded the troops that it was the 5th of march the anniversary of the boston massacre and called on them to revenge the slaughter of their brethren they answered him with shouts  howe in the meantime was perplexed between his pride and the hazards of his position in his letters to the ministry he had scouted the idea of being in danger from the rebels he had hoped they would attack him apparently they were about to fulfil his hopes and with formidable advantages of position he must dislodge them from dorchester heights or evacuate boston the latter was an alternative too mortifying to be readily adopted he resolved on an attack but it was to be a night one  in the evening the british began to move lord percy was to lead the attack twentyfive hundred men were embarked in transports which were to convey them to the rendezvous at castle william a violent storm set in from the east the transports could not reach their place of destination the menofwar could not cover and support them a furious surf beat on the shore where the boats would have to land the attack was consequently postponed until the following day that day was equally unpropitious the storm continued with torrents of rain the attack was again postponed in the meantime the americans went on strengthening their works by the time the storm subsided general howe deemed them too strong to be easily carried the attempt therefore was relinquished altogether  what was to be done the shells thrown from the heights into the town proved that it was no longer tenable the fleet was equally exposed admiral shuldham the successor to graves assured howe that if the americans maintained possession of the heights his ships could not remain in the harbor it was determined therefore in a council of war to evacuate the place as soon as possible but now came on a humiliating perplexity the troops in embarking would be exposed to a destructive fire how was this to be prevented general howes pride would not suffer him to make capitulations he endeavored to work on the fears of the bostonians by hinting that if his troops were molested while embarking he might be obliged to cover their retreat by setting fire to the town  the hint had its effect several of the principal inhabitants communicated with him through the medium of general robertson the result of the negotiation was that a paper was concocted and signed by several of the select men of boston stating the fears they had entertained of the destruction of the place but that those fears had been quieted by general howes declaration that it should remain uninjured provided his troops were unmolested while embarking the select men therefore begged some assurance that so dreadful a calamity might not be brought on by any measures from without  this paper was sent out from boston on the evening of the 8th with a flag of truce which bore it to the american lines at roxbury there it was received by colonel learned and carried by him to headquarters washington consulted with such of the general officers as he could immediately assemble the paper was not addressed to him nor to any one else it was not authenticated by the signature of general howe nor was there any other act obliging that commander to fulfil the promise asserted to have been made by him it was deemed proper therefore that washington should give no answer to the paper but that colonel learned should signify in a letter his having laid it before the commanderinchief and the reasons assigned for not answering it with this uncompromising letter the flag returned to boston the americans suspended their fire but continued to fortify their positions  daily preparations were now made by the enemy for departure by proclamation the inhabitants were ordered to deliver up all linen and woollen goods and all other goods that in possession of the rebels would aid them in carrying on the war for some days the embarkation of the troops was delayed by adverse winds washington who was imperfectly informed of affairs in boston feared that the movements there might be a feint determined to bring things to a crisis he detached a force to nooks hill on saturday the 16th which threw up a breastwork in the night regardless of the cannonading of the enemy this commanded boston neck and the south part of the town and a deserter brought a false report to the british that a general assault was intended the embarkation so long delayed began with hurry and confusion at four oclock in the morning the harbor of boston soon presented a striking and tumultuous scene there were seventyeight ships and transports casting loose for sea and eleven or twelve thousand men soldiers sailors and refugees hurrying to embark many especially of the latter with their families and personal effects the refugees in fact labored under greater disadvantages than the kings troops being obliged to man their own vessels as sufficient seamen could not be spared from the kings transports  while this tumultuous embarkation was going on the americans looked on in silence from their batteries on dorchester heights without firing a shot at an early hour of the morning the troops stationed at cambridge and roxbury had paraded and several regiments under putnam had embarked in boats and dropped down charles river to sewalls point to watch the movements of the enemy by land and water about nine oclock a large body of troops was seen marching down bunkers hill while boats full of soldiers were putting off for the shipping two scouts were sent from the camp to reconnoitre the works appeared still to be occupied for sentries were posted about them with shouldered muskets observing them to be motionless the scouts made nearer scrutiny and discovered them to be mere effigies set up to delay the advance of the americans pushing on they found the works deserted and gave signal of the fact whereupon a detachment was sent from the camp to take possession  part of putnams troops were now sent back to cambridge a part were ordered forward to occupy boston general ward too with five hundred men made his way from roxbury across the neck about which the enemy had scattered caltrops or crows feet1 to impede invasion the gates were unbarred and thrown open and the americans entered in triumph with drums beating and colors flying  footnote 1 iron balls with four sharp points to wound the feet of men or horses  by ten oclock the enemy were all embarked and under way putnam had taken command of the city and occupied the important points and the flag of thirteen stripes the standard of the union floated above all the forts on the following day washington himself entered the town where he was joyfully welcomed  the eminent services of washington throughout this arduous siege his admirable management by which in the course of a few months an undisciplined band of husbandmen became soldiers and were enabled to invest for nearly a year and finally to expel a brave army of veterans commanded by the most experienced generals drew forth the enthusiastic applause of the nation on motion of john adams who had first moved his nomination as commanderinchief a unanimous vote of thanks to him was passed in congress and it was ordered that a gold medal be struck commemorating the evacuation of boston bearing the effigy of washington as its deliverer  the british fleet bearing the army from boston had disappeared from the coast whither they are bound and where they next will pitch their tents writes washington i know not he conjectured their destination to be new york and made his arrangements accordingly but he was mistaken general howe had steered for halifax there to await the arrival of strong reinforcements from england and the fleet of his brother admiral lord howe who was to be commanderinchief of the naval forces on the north american station  it was presumed the enemy in the ensuing campaign would direct their operations against the middle and southern colonies congress divided the colonies into two departments one comprehending new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware and maryland was to be under the command of a majorgeneral and two brigadiergenerals the other comprising virginia the carolinas and georgia to be under the command of a majorgeneral and four brigadiers in this new arrangement the orders destining general lee to canada were superseded and he was appointed to the command of the southern department where he was to keep watch upon the movements of sir henry clinton the command in canada was given to general thomas who had distinguished himself at roxbury and was promoted to the rank of majorgeneral it would have been given to schuyler but for the infirm state of his health still congress expressed a reliance on his efforts to complete the work so conspicuously begun and well conducted under his orders in the last campaign and as not merely the success but the very existence of the army in canada would depend on supplies sent from these colonies across the lakes he was required until further orders to fix his headquarters at albany where without being exposed to the fatigue of the camp until his health was perfectly restored he would be in a situation to forward supplies to superintend the operations necessary for the defence of new york and the hudson river and the affairs of the whole middle department  lee set out for the south on the 7th of march carrying with him his bold spirit his shrewd sagacity and his whimsical and splenetic humors brigadiergeneral lord stirling remained in temporary command at new york washington presuming that the british fleet had steered for that port with the force which had evacuated boston hastened detachments thither under generals heath and sullivan and wrote for three thousand additional men to be furnished by connecticut the command of the whole he gave to general putnam who was ordered to fortify the city and the passes of the hudson according to the plans of general lee in the meantime washington delayed to come on himself until he should have pushed forward the main body of his army by divisions  lees anticipations that laxity and confusion would prevail after his departure were not realized the veteran putnam on taking command put the city under rigorous military rule all communication between the ministerial fleet and shore was stopped the ships were no longer to be furnished with provisions any person taken in the act of holding communication with them would be considered an enemy and treated accordingly  washington came on by the way of providence norwich and new london expediting the embarkation of troops from these posts and arrived at new york on the 13th of april many of the works which lee had commenced were by this time finished others were in progress it was apprehended the principal operations of the enemy would be on long island the high grounds of which in the neighborhood of brooklyn commanded the city washington saw that an able and efficient officer was needed at that place greene was accordingly stationed there with a division of the army he immediately proceeded to complete the fortifications of that important post and to make himself acquainted with the topography and the defensive points of the surrounding country  the aggregate force distributed at several extensive posts in new york and its environs and on long island staten island and elsewhere amounted to little more than ten thousand men some of those were on the sick list others absent on command or on furlough there were but about eight thousand available and fit for duty these too were without pay those recently enlisted without arms and no one could say where arms were to be procured washington saw the inadequacy of the force to the purposes required and was full of solicitude about the security of a place the central point of the confederacy and the grand deposit of ordnance and military stores the process of fortifying the place had induced the ships of war to fall down into the outer bay within the hook upwards of twenty miles from the city but governor tryon was still on board of one of them keeping up an active correspondence with the tories on staten and long islands and in other parts of the neighborhood  in addition to his cares about the security of new york washington had to provide for the perilous exigencies of the army in canada since his arrival in the city four regiments of troops a company of riflemen and another of artificers had been detached under the command of brigadiergeneral thompson and a further corps of six regiments under brigadiergeneral sullivan with orders to join general thomas as soon as possible  still congress inquired of him whether further reinforcements to the army in canada would not be necessary and whether they could be spared from the army in new york his reply shows the peculiar perplexities of his situation and the tormenting uncertainty in which he was kept as to where the next storm of war would break with respect to sending more troops to that country i am really at a loss what to advise as it is impossible at present to know the designs of the enemy should they send the whole force under general howe up the river st lawrence to relieve quebec and recover canada the troops gone and now going will be insufficient to stop their progress and should they think proper to send that or an equal force this way from great britain for the purpose of possessing this city and securing the navigation of hudsons river the troops left here will not be sufficient to oppose them and yet for anything we know i think it not improbable they may attempt both both being of the greatest importance to them if they have men i could wish indeed that the army in canada should be more powerfully reinforced at the same time i am conscious that the trusting of this important post which is now become the grand magazine of america to the handful of men remaining here is running too great a risk  washington at that time was not aware of the extraordinary expedients england had recently resorted to against the next campaign the duke of brunswick the landgrave of hesse cassel and the hereditary prince of cassel count of hanau had been subsidized to furnish troops to assist in the subjugation of her colonies four thousand three hundred brunswick troops and nearly thirteen thousand hessians had entered the british service beside the subsidy exacted by the german princes they were to be paid seven pounds four shillings and four pence sterling for every soldier furnished by them and as much more for every one slain     chapter xxviii reverses in canadathe highlandsclose of the invasion of canada   we left arnold before the walls of quebec wounded crippled almost disabled yet not disheartened blockading that proud town with a force inferior by half in number to that of the garrison for his gallant services congress promoted him in january to the rank of brigadiergeneral throughout the winter he kept up the blockade with his shattered army though had carleton ventured upon a sortie he might have been forced to decamp  arnold had difficulties of all kinds to contend with his military chest was exhausted his troops were in want of necessaries sickness thinned his ranks at one time his force was reduced to five hundred men and for two months with all his recruitments of raw militia did not exceed seven hundred the failure of the attack on quebec had weakened the cause among the canadians the peasantry had been displeased by the conduct of the american troops they had once welcomed them as deliverers they now began to regard them as intruders  notwithstanding all these discouragements arnold still kept up a bold face cut off supplies occasionally and harassed the place with alarms having repaired his batteries he opened a fire upon the town but with little effect the best part of the artillerists with lamb their capable commander were prisoners within the walls on the 1st day of april general wooster arrived from montreal with reinforcements and took the command the day after his arrival arnold by the falling of his horse again received an injury on the leg recently wounded and was disabled for upwards of a week considering himself slighted by general wooster who did not consult him in military affairs he obtained leave of absence until he should be recovered from his lameness and repaired to montreal where he took command  general thomas arrived at the camp in the course of april and found the army in a forlorn condition scattered at different posts and on the island of orleans it was numerically increased to upwards of two thousand men but several hundred were unfit for service the smallpox had made great ravages they had inoculated each other in their sick and debilitated state they were without barracks and almost without medicine a portion whose term of enlistment had expired refused to do duty and clamored for their discharge the winter was over the river was breaking up reinforcements to the garrison might immediately be expected and then the case would be desperate observing that the river about quebec was clear of ice general thomas determined on a bold effort it was to send up a fireship with the flood and while the ships in the harbor were in flames and the town in confusion to scale the walls  accordingly on the 3d of may the troops turned out with scaling ladders the fireship came up the river under easy sail and arrived near the shipping before it was discovered it was fired into the crew applied a slow match to the train and pulled off the ship was soon in a blaze but the flames caught and consumed the sails her way was checked and she drifted off harmlessly with the ebbing tide the rest of the plan was of course abandoned  nothing now remained but to retreat before the enemy should be reinforced preparations were made in all haste to embark the sick and the military stores while this was taking place five ships made their way into the harbor on the 6th of may and began to land troops thus reinforced general carleton sallied forth with eight hundred or a thousand men the americans were in no condition to withstand the attack they had no intrenchments and could not muster three hundred men at any point a precipitate retreat was the consequence in which baggage artillery everything was abandoned even the sick were left behind many of whom crawled away from the camp hospitals and took refuge in the woods or among the canadian peasantry  general thomas came to a halt at point deschambault about sixty miles above quebec and called a council of war to consider what was to be done the enemys ships were hastening up the st lawrence some were already but two or three leagues distant the camp was without cannon powder forwarded by general schuyler had fallen into the enemys hands there were not provisions enough to subsist the army for more than two or three days the menofwar too might run up the river intercept all their resources and reduce them to the same extremity they had experienced before quebec it was resolved therefore to ascend the river still further general thomas however determined to send forward the invalids but to remain at point deschambault with about five hundred men until he should receive orders from montreal and learn whether such supplies could be forwarded immediately as would enable him to defend his position  the despatches of general thomas setting forth the disastrous state of affairs had a disheartening effect on schuyler who feared the army would be obliged to abandon canada washington on the contrary spoke cheeringly on the subject he regretted that the troops had not been able to make a stand at point deschambault but hoped they would maintain a post as far down the river as possible  the reverses in canada which spread consternation through the new england frontier now laid open to invasion strengthened the illwill and prejudice that prevailed in the eastern states against general schuyler he was stigmatized as the cause of the late reverses and was even accused of being untrue to his country committees which the alarming state of affairs had caused to be organized in various counties addressed washington on the subject which reviling schuyler he at once demanded a court of inquiry it is proper to add that the committees in question after investigating the evidence acknowledged to washington that their suspicions had been wholly groundless  as the reverses in canada would affect the fortunes of the revolution elsewhere washington sent general gates to lay the despatches concerning them before congress scarce had gates departed on his mission may 19th when washington himself received a summons to philadelphia to advise with congress concerning the opening campaign he was informed also that gates on the 16th of may had been promoted to the rank of majorgeneral and mifflen to that of brigadiergeneral and a wish was intimated that they might take the command of boston  washington prepared to proceed to philadelphia in his parting instructions to putnam who as the oldest majorgeneral in the city would have the command during his absence washington informed him of the intention of the provincial congress of new york to seize the principal tories and disaffected persons in the city and the surrounding country especially on long island and authorized him to afford military aid if required to carry the same into execution he was also to send lord stirling colonel putnam the engineer and colonel knox if he could be spared up to the highlands to examine the state of the forts and garrisons and report what was necessary to put them in a posture of defence  the general accompanied by mrs washington departed from new york on the 21st of may and they were invited by mr hancock the president of congress to be his guests during their sojourn at philadelphia  washington in his conferences with congress roundly expressed his conviction that no accommodation could be effected with great britain on acceptable terms ministerialists had declared in parliament that the sword being drawn the most coercive measures would be persevered in until there was complete submission the recent subsidizing of foreign troops was a part of this policy and indicated unsparing hostility a protracted war therefore was inevitable but it would be impossible to carry it on successfully with the scanty force actually embodied and with transient enlistments of militia  in consequence of his representations resolutions were passed in congress that soldiers should be enlisted for three years with a bounty of ten dollars for each recruit that the army at new york should be reinforced until the 1st of december with thirteen thousand eight hundred militia that gondolas and firerafts should be built to prevent the menofwar and enemys ships from coming into new york bay or the narrows and that a flying camp of ten thousand militia furnished by pennsylvania delaware and maryland and likewise engaged until the 1st of december should be stationed in the jerseys for the defence of the middle colonies washington was moreover empowered in case of emergency to call on the neighboring colonies for temporary aid with their militia  another important result of his conferences with congress was the establishment of a war office military affairs had hitherto been referred in congress to committees casually appointed and had consequently been subject to great irregularity and neglect henceforth a permanent committee entitled the board of war and ordnance was to take cognizance of them the first board was composed of five membersjohn adams colonel benjamin harrison roger sherman james wilson and edward rutledge with richard peters as secretary it went into operation on the 12th of june  while at philadelphia washington had frequent consultations with george clinton one of the delegates from new york concerning the interior defences of that province especially those connected with the security of the highlands of the hudson where part of the regiment of colonel james clinton the brother of the delegate was stationed he was gratified also by procuring the appointment of his late secretary joseph reed to the post of adjutantgeneral vacated by the promotion of general gates thus placing him once more by his side  despatches from canada continued to be disastrous a post stationed at the cedars forty miles above montreal consisting of about four hundred men had been intimidated into a surrender by a body of canadians and indians a force of one hundred men sent to the relief of the post was also captured the enemy was pursued by arnold and overtaken near st anns above the rapids of the st lawrence the prisoners captured at the cedars were threatened with massacre if arnold should attack and this led to negotiations which resulted in their exchange while these events were occurring mischief was brewing in another quarter  colonel guy johnson with brant and the butlers had been holding councils with the indians and were threatening a maraud on the mohawk country a correspondence was carried on between guy johnson and his cousin sir john johnson who was said to be preparing to cooperate with his scotch dependents schuyler considered this a breach of sir johns parole and sent colonel dayton to apprehend him sir john with a number of his tenants retreated for refuge among the indians shortly after this came intelligence that sir john with his scotch warriors and indian allies was actually coming down the valley of the mohawk bent on revenge and prepared to lay everything to waste schuyler immediately collected a force at albany to oppose him letters from washington directed schuyler to detach colonel dayton with his regiment on that service with instructions for him to secure a post upon the old site of fort stanwix washington also authorized schuyler to hold a conference with the six nations and secure their active services without waiting further directions from congressthat body having recently resolved to employ indian allies  lord stirling who by washingtons orders had visited and inspected the defences in the highlands rendered a report of their condition of which we give the purport fort montgomery at the lower part of the highlands was on the west bank of the river north of dunderberg or thunder hill it was situated on a bank one hundred feet high the river at that place was about half a mile wide opposite the fort was the promontory of anthonys nose many hundred feet high accessible only to goats or men expert in climbing a body of riflemen stationed here might command the decks of vessels fort montgomery appeared to lord stirling the proper place for a guard post fort constitution was about six miles higher up the river on a rocky island of the same name at a narrow strait where the hudson shouldered by precipices makes a sudden bend round west point a redoubt in the opinion of lord stirling would be needed on the point not only for the preservation of fort constitution but for its own importance  the garrison of that fort consisted of two companies of colonel james clintons regiment and captain wisners company of minute men in all one hundred and sixty rank and file fort montgomery was garrisoned by three companies of the same regiment about two hundred rank and file both garrisons were miserably armed the direction of the works of both forts was in the hands of commissioners appointed by the provincial congress of new york the general command of the posts required to be adjusted  in view of all these circumstances washington on the 14th of june ordered colonel james clinton to take command of both posts and of all the troops stationed at them he seemed a fit custodian for them having been a soldier from his youth brought up on a frontier subject to indian alarms and incursions and acquainted with the strong points and fastnesses of the highlands  kings bridge and the heights adjacent considered by general lee of the utmost importance to the communication between new york and the mainland and to the security of the hudson were reconnoitred by washington on horseback about the middle of the month ordering where works should be laid out breastworks were to be thrown up for the defence of the bridge and an advanced work subsequently called fort independence was to be built beyond it on a hill commanding spyt den duivel creek as that inlet of the hudson is called which links it with the harlem river a strong work intended as a kind of citadel was to crown a rocky height between two and three miles south of the bridge commanding the channel of the hudson and below it were to be redoubts on the banks of the river at jeffreys point in honor of the general the citadel received the name of fort washington while these preparations were made for the protection of the hudson the works about brooklyn on long island were carried on with great activity under the superintendence of general greene in a word the utmost exertions were made at every point to put the city its environs and the hudson river in a state of defence before the arrival of another hostile armament  operations in canada were now drawing to a disastrous close general thomas finding it impossible to make a stand at point deschambault had continued his retreat to the mouth of the sorel where he found general thompson with part of the troops detached by washington from new york who were making some preparations for defence shortly after his arrival he was taken ill with the smallpox and removed to chamblee he had prohibited inoculation among his troops because it put too many of their scanty number on the sick list he probably fell a victim to his own prohibition as he died of that malady on the 2d of june  on his death general sullivan who had recently arrived with the main detachment of troops from new york succeeded to the command general wooster having been recalled he advanced immediately with his brigade to the mouth of the sorel where he found general thompson with but very few troops to defend that post having detached colonel st clair with six or seven hundred men to three rivers about fifty miles down the st lawrence to give check to an advanced corps of the enemy of about eight hundred regulars and canadians under the veteran scot colonel maclean sullivan proceeded forthwith to complete the works on the sorel in the meantime he detached general thompson with additional troops to overtake st clair and assume command of the whole party which would then amount to two thousand men he was by no means to attack the encampment at three rivers unless there was great prospect of success as his defeat might prove the total loss of canada  sullivan was aiming at the command in canada and washington soberly weighed his merits for the appointment in a letter to the president of congress he is active spirited and zealously attached to the cause he has his wants and he has his foibles he wants experience to move upon a grand scale for the limited and contracted knowledge which any of us have in military matters stands in very little stead scarce had washington despatched this letter when he received one from the president of congress dated the 18th of june informing him that majorgeneral gates had been appointed to command the forces in canada and requesting him to expedite his departure as soon as possible the appointment of gates has been attributed to the influence of the eastern delegates with whom he was a favorite indeed during his station at boston he had been highly successful in cultivating the good graces of the new england people he departed for his command on the 26th of june vested with extraordinary powers for the regulation of affairs in that distant dangerous and shifting scene  the actual force of the enemy in canada had recently been augmented to about 13000 men several regiments having arrived from ireland one from england another from general howe and a body of brunswick troops under the baron reidesel of these the greater part were on the way up from quebec in divisions by land and water with generals carleton burgoyne philips and reidesel while a considerable number under general frazer had arrived at three rivers and others under general nesbit lay near them on board of transports  general thompson coasted in bateaux along the right bank of the river at that expanse called lake st pierre and arrived at nicolete where he found st clair and his detachment he crossed the river in the night and landed a few miles above three rivers intending to surprise the enemy before daylight he was not aware at the time that additional troops had arrived under general burgoyne after landing he marched with rapidity toward three rivers but was led by treacherous guides into a morass and obliged to return back nearly two miles day broke and he was discovered from the ships a cannonade was opened upon his men as they made their way slowly for an hour and a half through a swamp at length they arrived in sight of three rivers but it was to find a large force drawn up in battle array under general frazer by whom they were warmly attacked and after a brief stand thrown in confusion thompson attempted to rally his troops and partly succeeded until a fire was opened upon them in rear by nesbit who had landed from his ships their rout now was complete general thompson colonel irvine and about two hundred men were captured twentyfive were slain and the rest pursued for several miles through a deep swamp after great fatigues and sufferings they were able to get on board of their boats which had been kept from falling into the hands of the enemy in these they made their way back to the sorel bringing general sullivan the alarming intelligence of the overpowering force that was coming up the river  sullivan made the desperate resolve to defend the mouth of the sorel but was induced to abandon it by the unanimous opinion of his officers and the evident unwillingness of his troops dismantling his batteries therefore he retreated with his artillery and stores just before the arrival of the enemy and was followed step by step along the sorel by a strong column under general burgoyne on the 18th of june he was joined by general arnold with three hundred men the garrison of montreal who had crossed at longueil just in time to escape a large detachment of the enemy thus reinforced and the evacuation of canada being determined on in a council of war sullivan succeeded in destroying everything at chamblee and st johns that he could not carry away breaking down bridges and leaving forts and vessels in flames and continued his retreat to the isle aux noix where he made a halt for some days until he should receive positive orders from washington or general schuyler the low unhealthy situation of the isle aux noix obliged him soon to remove his camp to the isle la motte whence on receiving orders to that effect from general schuyler he ultimately embarked with his forces sick and well for crown point  thus ended this famous invasion an enterprise bold in its conceptions daring and hardy in its execution full of ingenious expedients and hazardous exploits and which had not unforeseen circumstances counteracted its welldevised plans might have added all canada to the american confederacy     chapter xxix the army in new york   the great aim of the british at present was to get possession of new york and the hudson and make them the basis of military operations this they hoped to effect on the arrival of a powerful armament hourly expected and designed for operations on the seaboard  at this critical juncture there was an alarm of a conspiracy among the tories in the city and on long island suddenly to take up arms and cooperate with the british troops on their arrival the wildest reports were in circulation concerning it some of the tories were to break down kings bridge others were to blow up the magazines spike the guns and massacre all the fieldofficers washington was to be killed or delivered up to the enemy some of his own bodyguard were said to be in the plot several publicans of the city were pointed out as having aided or abetted it  one of the most noted was corbie whose tavern was said to be to the southeast of general washingtons house to the westward of bayards woods and north of lispenards meadows from which it would appear that at that time the general was quartered at what was formerly called richmond hill a mansion surrounded by trees at a short distance from the city in rather an isolated situation  illustration washingtons headquarters richmond hill house 1776 vol ii  a committee of the new york congress traced the plot up to governor tryon who from his safe retreat on shipboard acted through agents on shore the most important of these was david matthews the tory mayor of the city he was accused of disbursing money to enlist men purchase arms and corrupt the soldiery washington was authorized and requested by the committee to cause the mayor to be apprehended and all his papers secured matthews was at that time residing at flatbush on long island at no great distance from general greenes encampment washington transmitted the warrant of the committee to the general on the 21st with directions that it should be executed with precision and exactly by one oclock of the ensuing morning by a careful officer precisely at the hour of one a detachment from greenes brigade surrounded the house of the mayor and secured his person but no papers were found though diligent search was made  numerous other arrests took place and among the number some of washingtons bodyguard a great dismay fell upon the tories some of those on long island who had proceeded to arm themselves finding the plot discovered sought refuge in woods and morasses washington directed that those arrested who belonged to the army should be tried by a courtmartial and the rest handed over to the secular power  according to statements made before the committee five guineas bounty was offered by governor tryon to each man who should enter the kings service with a promise of two hundred acres of land for himself one hundred for his wife and fifty for each child the men thus recruited were to act on shore in cooperation with the kings troops when they came corbies tavern near washingtons quarters was a kind of rendezvous of the conspirators from this house a correspondence was kept up with governor tryon on shipboard through a mulatto at this tavern it was supposed washingtons bodyguards were tampered with thomas hickey one of the guards was said not only to be enlisted but to have aided in corrupting his comrades  much of the evidence given was of a dubious kind it was certain that persons had secretly been enlisted and sworn to hostile operations but washington did not think that any regular plan had been digested by the conspirators according to the mayors admission before the committee he had been cognizant of attempts to enlist tories and corrupt washingtons guards though he declared that he had discountenanced them he with a number of others were detained in prison to await a trial thomas hickey the individual of washingtons guard was tried before a courtmartial he was an irishman and had been a deserter from the british army the courtmartial found him guilty of mutiny and sedition and treacherous correspondence with the enemy and sentenced him to be hanged the sentence was approved by washington and was carried promptly into effect june 28th  while the city was still brooding over this event four shipsofwar portentous visitants appeared off the hook stood quietly in at the narrows and dropped anchor in the bay on the 29th of june an express from the lookout on staten island announced that forty sail were in sight they were in fact ships from halifax bringing between nine and ten thousand of the troops recently expelled from boston together with six transports filled with highland troops which had joined the fleet at sea at sight of this formidable armament standing into the harbor washington instantly sent notice of its arrival to colonel james clinton who had command of the posts in the highlands and urged all possible preparations to give the enemy a warm reception should they push their frigates up the river other arrivals swelled the number of ships in the bay of new york to one hundred and thirty menofwar and transports they made no movement to ascend the hudson but anchored off staten island where they landed their troops and the hill sides were soon whitened with their tents  washington beheld the gathering storm with an anxious eye aware that general howe only awaited the arrival of his brother the admiral to commence hostile operations he wrote to the president of congress urging a call on the massachusetts government for its quota of continental troops and the formation of a flying camp of ten thousand men to be stationed in the jerseys as a central force ready to act in any direction as circumstances might require on the 2d of july he issued a general order calling upon the troops to prepare for a momentous conflict which was to decide their liberties and fortunes those who should signalize themselves by acts of bravery would be noticed and rewarded those who proved craven would be exposed and punished  about this time we have the first appearance in the military ranks of the revolution of one destined to take an active and distinguished part in public affairs and to leave the impress of his genius on the institutions of the country as general greene one day on his way to washingtons headquarters was passing through a fieldthen on the outskirts of the city now in the heart of its busiest quarter and known as the parkhe paused to notice a provincial company of artillery and was struck with its able performances and with the tact and talent of its commander he was a mere youth apparently about twenty years of age small in person and stature but remarkable for his alert and manly bearing it was alexander hamilton1  footnote 1 hamilton was a native of the island of nevis in the west indies at an early age he was put in a counting house but his nature was aspiring and he devoted his leisure hours to study some early achievements of his pen gave such proof of talent that it was determined to give him the advantage of a regular education and he was sent to kings now columbia college at new york  greene was an able tactician and quick to appreciate any display of military science a little conversation sufficed to convince him that the youth before him had a mind of no ordinary grasp and quickness he invited him to his quarters and from that time cultivated his friendship further acquaintance heightened the generals opinion of his extraordinary merits and he took an early occasion to introduce him to the commanderinchief by whom we shall soon find him properly appreciated  a valuable accession to the army at this anxious time was washingtons neighbor and former companion in arms hugh mercer his military spirit was alert as ever the talent he had shown in organizing the virginia militia and his zeal and efficiency as a member of the committee of safety had been properly appreciated by congress and on the 5th of june he had received the commission of brigadiergeneral he was greeted by washington with the right hand of fellowship the flying camp was about forming washington had the nomination of some continental officer to the command he gave it to mercer and sent him over to paulus hook in the jerseys to make arrangements for the militia as they should come in recommending him to brigadiergeneral william livingston as an officer on whose experience and judgment great confidence might be reposed livingston was a man inexperienced in arms but of education talent sagacity and ready wit mercer and he were to consult together and concert plans to repel invasions the new jersey militia however were distinct from the flying camp and only called out for local defence  while danger was gathering round new york the general congress at philadelphia was discussing with closed doors what john adams pronouncedthe greatest question ever debated in america and as great as ever was or will be debated among men the result was a resolution passed unanimously on the 2d of july that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states the 2d of july adds the same patriotic statesman will be the most memorable epoch in the history of america i am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival it ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to almighty god it ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade with shows games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forth for evermore  the glorious event has indeed given rise to an annual jubilee but not on the day designated by adams the 4th of july is the day of national rejoicing for on that day the declaration of independence that solemn and sublime document was adopted washington hailed the declaration with joy it is true it was but a formal recognition of a state of things which had long existed but it put an end to all those temporizing hopes of reconciliation which had clogged the military action of the country  on the 9th of july he caused it to be read at six oclock in the evening at the head of each brigade of the army the general hopes said he in his orders that this important event will serve as a fresh incentive to every officer and soldier to act with fidelity and courage as knowing that now the peace and safety of his country depend under god solely on the success of our arms and that he is now in the service of a state possessed of sufficient power to reward his merit and advance him to the highest honors of a free country  the excitable populace of new york were not content with the ringing of bells to proclaim their joy there was a leaden statue of george iii in the bowling green in front of the fort since kingly rule is at an end why retain its effigy on the same evening therefore the statue was pulled down amid the shouts of the multitude and broken up to be run into bullets to be used in the cause of independence  the exultation of the patriots of new york caused by the declaration of independence was soon overclouded on the 12th of july several ships stood in from sea and joined the naval force below every nautical movement was now a matter of speculation and alarm two shipsofwar were observed getting under way and standing toward the city one was the phoenix of forty guns the other the rose of twenty guns commanded by captain wallace the troops were immediately at their alarm posts it was about halfpast three oclock in the afternoon as the ships and three tenders came sweeping up the bay with the advantage of wind and tide and shaped their course up the hudson the batteries of the city and of paulus hook on the opposite jersey shore opened a fire upon them they answered it with broadsides but continued their course up the hudson they had merely fired upon the batteries as they passed and on their own part had sustained but little damage their decks having ramparts of sandbags the ships below remained in sullen quiet at their anchors and showed no intention of following them the firing ceased the fear of a general attack upon the city died away and the agitated citizens breathed more freely  washington however apprehended this movement of the ships might be with a different object they might be sent to land troops and seize upon the passes of the highlands forts montgomery and constitution were far from complete and were scantily manned a small force might be sufficient to surprise them thus thinking he sent off an express to put general mifflin on the alert who was stationed with his philadelphia troops at fort washington and kings bridge the same express carried a letter from him to the new york convention at that time holding its sessions at white plains in westchester county apprising it of the impending danger  fortunately george clinton the patriotic legislator had recently been appointed brigadiergeneral of the militia of ulster and orange counties called to his native state by his military duties in this time of danger he had only remained in congress to vote for the declaration of independence and then hastened home he was now at new windsor in ulster county just above the highlands washington wrote to him on the afternoon of the 12th urging him to collect as great a force as possible of the new york militia for the protection of the highlands against this hostile irruption long before the receipt of washingtons letter clinton had been put on the alert about nine oclock in the morning of the 13th two river sloops came to anchor above the highlands before the generals residence their captains informed him that new york had been attacked on the preceding afternoon they had seen the cannonade from a distance and judged from the subsequent firing that the enemys ships were up the river as far as kings bridge clinton was as prompt a soldier as he had been an intrepid legislator the neighboring militia were forthwith put in motion three regiments were ordered out one was to repair to fort montgomery another to fort constitution the third to rendezvous at newburgh just above the highlands ready to hasten to the assistance of fort constitution should another signal be given  another of his sagacious measures was to send expresses to all the owners of sloops and boats twenty miles up the west side of the river to haul them off so as to prevent their grounding part of them were to be ready to carry over the militia to the forts the rest were ordered down to fort constitution where a chain of them might be drawn across the narrowest part of the river to be set on fire should the enemys ships attempt to pass having made these prompt arrangements he proceeded to fort montgomery where he fixed his headquarters here on the following day july 14th he received washingtons letter written two days previously but by this time he had anticipated its orders and stirred up the whole country  while the vigilant clinton was preparing to defend the passes of the highlands danger was growing more imminent at the mouth of the hudson the agitation into which new york was thrown on the afternoon of the 12th of july by the broadsides of the phoenix and the rose was almost immediately followed by another on the same evening there was a great booming of cannon with clouds of smoke from the shipping at anchor at staten island every spyglass was again in requisition the british fleet were saluting a ship of the line just arrived from sea she advanced grandly every manofwar thundering a salute as she passed at her foretop masthead she bore st georges flag it is the admirals ship cried the nautical men on the lookout at the battery it is the admirals ship was echoed from mouth to mouth and the word soon flew throughout the city lord howe is come     chapter xxx proceedings of lord howegates and schuyler   lord howe was indeed come and affairs now appeared to be approaching a crisis in consequence of the recent conspiracy the convention of new york seated at white plains in westchester county had a secret committee stationed in new york for the purpose of taking cognizance of traitorous machinations to this committee washington addressed a letter the day after his lordships arrival suggesting the policy of removing from the city and its environs all persons of known disaffection and enmity to the cause of america especially those confined in jail for treasonable offences who might become extremely dangerous in case of an attack and alarm he took this step with great reluctance but felt compelled to it by circumstances in consequence of his suggestion thirteen persons in confinement for traitorous offences were removed to the jail of litchfield in connecticut among the number was the late mayor but as his offence was not of so deep a dye as those whereof the rest stood charged it was recommended by the president of the convention that he should be treated with indulgence  the proceedings of lord howe soon showed the policy of these precautions his lordship had prepared a declaration addressed to the people at large informing them of the powers vested in his brother and himself as commissioners for restoring peace he sent a flag on shore bearing a circular letter written in his civil and military capacity to the colonial governor requesting him to publish his address to the people as widely as possible  the british officers considering the americans in arms rebels without valid commissions were in the habit of denying them all military title washingtons general officers had urged him not to submit to this tacit indignity but to reject all letters directed to him without a specification of his official rank an occasion now presented itself for the adjustment of this matter within a day or two an officer of the british navy lieutenant brown came with a flag from lord howe seeking a conference with washington colonel reed the adjutantgeneral embarked in a barge and met him half way between governors and staten islands the lieutenant informed him that he was the bearer of a letter from lord howe to mr washington colonel reed replied that he knew no such person in the american army the lieutenant produced and offered the letter it was addressed to george washington esquire he was informed that it could not be received with such a direction the lieutenant expressed much concern while reed maintained his coolness politely declining to receive the letter as inconsistent with his duty  on the 19th an aidedecamp of general howe came with a flag and requested to know as there appeared to be an obstacle to a correspondence between the two generals whether colonel patterson the british adjutantgeneral could be admitted to an interview with general washington colonel reed who met the flag consented in the name of the general and pledged his honor for the safety of the adjutantgeneral during the interview which was fixed for the following morning  at the appointed time colonel reed and colonel webb one of washingtons aides met the flag in the harbor took colonel patterson into their barge and escorted him to town passing in front of the grand battery washington received the adjutantgeneral at headquarters with much form and ceremony in full military array with his officers and guards about him colonel patterson addressing him by the title of your excellency produced but did not offer a letter addressed to george washington esquire etc etc hoping that the et ceteras which implied everything would remove all impediments washington replied that it was true the et ceteras implied everything but they also implied anything a letter he added addressed to a person acting in a public character should have some inscriptions to designate it from a mere private letter and he should absolutely decline any letter addressed to himself as a private person when it related to his public station  colonel patterson finding the letter would not be received endeavored as far as he could recollect to communicate the scope of it in the course of a somewhat desultory conversation what he chiefly dwelt upon was that lord howe and his brother had been specially nominated commissioners for the promotion of peace which was esteemed a mark of favor and regard to america that they had great powers and would derive the highest pleasure from effecting an accommodation and he concluded by adding that he wished his visit to be considered as making the first advance toward that desirable object washington replied that by what had appeared alluding no doubt to lord howes circular their powers it would seem were only to grant pardons now those who had committed no fault needed no pardon and such was the case with the americans who were only defending what they considered their indisputable rights  colonel patterson avoided a discussion of this matter which he observed would open a very wide field so here the conference which had been conducted on both sides with great courtesy terminated washington received the applause of congress and of the public for sustaining the dignity of his station his conduct in this particular was recommended as a model to all american officers in corresponding with the enemy  in the meantime the irruption of the phoenix and the rose into the waters of the hudson had roused a belligerent spirit along its borders the lower part of that noble river is commanded on the eastern side by the bold woody heights of manhattan island and westchester county and on the western side by the rocky cliffs of the palisades beyond those cliffs the river expands into a succession of what may almost be termed lakes first the tappan sea then haverstraw bay then the bay of peekskill separated from each other by long stretching points or high beetling promontories but affording ample sea room and safe anchorage then come the redoubtable highlands that strait fifteen miles in length where the river bends its course narrow and deep between rocky forestclad mountains  the new york convention aware of the impending danger despatched military envoys to stir up the yeomanry along the river and order out militia powder and ball were sent to tarrytown before which the hostile ships were anchored and yeoman troops were stationed there and along the neighboring shores of the tappan sea in a little while the militia of dutchess county and cortlandts manor were hastening rudely armed to protect the public stores at peekskill and mount guard at the entrance of the highlands  the shipsofwar which caused this alarm and turmoil lay quietly anchored in the broad expanses of the tappan sea and haverstraw bay shifting their ground occasionally while their boats were out taking soundings quite up to the highlands evidently preparing for further operations at night too their barges were heard rowing up and down the river on mysterious errands  the ships now acquainted with the channel moved up within six miles of fort montgomery general clinton apprehended they might mean to take advantage of a dark night and slip by him in the deep shadows of the mountains to prevent this he stationed a guard at night on the furthest point in view about two miles and a half below the fort prepared to kindle a blazing fire should the ships appear in sight large piles of dry brushwood mixed with combustibles were prepared at various places up and down the shore opposite to the fort and men stationed to set fire to them as soon as a signal should be given from the lower point the fort therefore while it remained in darkness would have a fair chance with its batteries as the ships passed between it and these conflagrations  a private committee sent up by the new york convention had a conference with the general to devise further means of obstructing the passage of ships up the river fire rafts were to be brought from poughkeepsie and kept at hand ready for action these were to be lashed two together with chains between old sloops filled with combustibles and sent down with a strong wind and tide to drive upon the ships an iron chain also was to be stretched obliquely across the river from fort montgomery to the foot of anthonys nose thus as it were chaining up the gate of the highlands for a protection below the highlands it was proposed to station whaleboats about the coves and promontories of tappan sea and haverstraw bay to reconnoitre the enemy cruise about at night carry intelligence from post to post seize any river craft that might bring the ships supplies and cut off their boats when attempting to land galleys also were prepared with ninepounders mounted at the bows  while the security of the hudson from invading ships was claiming the attention of washington he was equally anxious to prevent an irruption of the enemy from canada he was grieved therefore to find there was a clashing of authorities between the generals who had charge of the northern frontier gates on his way to take command of the army in canada had heard with surprise in albany of its retreat across the new york frontier he still considered it under his orders and was proceeding to act accordingly when general schuyler observed that the resolution of congress and the instructions of washington applied to the army only while in canada the moment it retreated within the limits of new york it came within his schuylers command  that there might be no delay in the service at this critical juncture the two generals agreed to refer the question of command to congress and in the meantime to act in concert they accordingly departed together for lake champlain to prepare against an anticipated invasion by sir guy carleton they arrived at crown point on the 6th of july and found there the wrecks of the army recently driven out of canada they had been harassed in their retreat by land their transportation on the lake had been in leaky boats without awnings where the sick suffering from smallpox lay on straw exposed to a burning july sun no food but salt pork often rancid hard biscuit or unbaked flour and scarcely any medicine not more than six thousand men had reached crown point and half of those were on the sick list the shattered remains of twelve or fifteen very fine battalions in a council of war it was determined that under present circumstances the post of crown point was not tenable and that therefore it was expedient to fall back and take a strong position at ticonderoga  general sullivan had been deeply hurt that gates his former inferior in rank should have been appointed over him to the command of the army in canada considering it a tacit intimation that congress did not esteem him competent to the trust which had devolved upon him he now therefore requested leave of absence in order to wait on the commanderinchief it was granted with reluctance  on the 9th of july schuyler and gates returned to ticonderoga accompanied by arnold instant arrangements were made to encamp the troops and land the artillery and stores as fast as they should arrive great exertions also were made to strengthen the defences of the place colonel john trumbull who was to have accompanied gates to canada as adjutantgeneral had been reconnoitring the neighborhood of ticonderoga and had pitched upon a place for a fortification on the eastern side of the lake directly opposite the east point of ticonderoga where fort independence was subsequently built he also advised the erection of a work on a lofty eminence the termination of a mountain ridge which separates lake george from lake champlain his advice was unfortunately disregarded preparations were made also to augment the naval force on the lakes ship carpenters from the eastern states were employed at skenesborough to build the hulls of galleys and boats which when launched were to be sent down to ticonderoga for equipment and armament under the superintendence of general arnold  schuyler soon returned to albany to superintend the general concerns of the northern department he was indefatigable in procuring and forwarding the necessary materials and artillery for the fortification of ticonderoga the question of command between him and gates was apparently at rest a letter from the president of congress dated july 8th informed general gates that according to the resolution of that body under which he had been appointed his command was totally independent of general schuyler while the army was in canada but no longer gates professed himself entirely satisfied with the explanation he had received and perfectly disposed to obey the commands of schuyler  as to general sullivan who repaired to philadelphia and tendered his resignation the question of rank which had aggrieved him was explained in a manner that induced him to continue in service it was universally allowed that his retreat had been ably conducted through all kinds of difficulties and disasters  a greater source of solicitude to washington than this jealousy between commanders was the sectional jealousy springing up among the troops in a letter to schuyler july 17th he says i must entreat your attention to do away the unhappy and pernicious distinctions and jealousies between the troops of different governments enjoin this upon the officers and let them inculcate and press home to the soldiery the necessity of order and harmony among those who are embarked in one common cause and mutually contending for all that freemen hold dear nowhere were these sectional jealousies more prevalent than in the motley army assembled from distant quarters under washingtons own command reed the adjutantgeneral speaking on this subject observes the southern troops comprising the regiments south of the delaware looked with very unkind feelings on those of new england especially those from connecticut whose peculiarities of deportment made them the objects of illdisguised derision among their fellow soldiers  among the troops thus designated as southern were some from virginia under a major leitch others from maryland under colonel smallwood others from delaware led by colonel haslet there were four continental battalions from pennsylvania commanded by colonels shee st clair wayne and magaw and provincial battalions two of which were severally commanded by colonels miles and atlee the continental battalion under colonel shee was chiefly from the city of philadelphia especially the officers among whom were lambert cadwalader and william allen members of two of the principal and most aristocratic families and alexander graydon to whose memoirs we are indebted for some graphic pictures of the times these pennsylvania troops were under the command of brigadiergeneral mifflin who in the preceding year had acted as washingtons aidedecamp and afterwards as quartermastergeneral  smallwoods maryland battalion was one of the brightest in point of equipment the scarlet and buff uniforms of those southerners contrasted vividly with the rustic attire of the yeoman battalions from the east their officers too looked down upon their connecticut compeers who could only be distinguished from their men by wearing a cockade there were none says graydon by whom an unofficerlike appearance and deportment could be tolerated less than by a citybred marylander who at this time was distinguished by the most fashionable cut coat the most macaroni cockedhat and hottest blood in the union in the same sectional spirit he speaks of the connecticut lighthorse oldfashioned men truly irregulars whether their clothing equipments or caparisons were regarded it would have been difficult to have discovered any circumstance of uniformity instead of carbines and sabres they generally carried fowlingpieces some of them very long such as in pennsylvania are used for shooting ducks here and there one appeared in a dingy regimental of scarlet with a triangular tarnished laced hat these singular dragoons were volunteers who came to make a tender of their services to the commanderinchief  the troops thus satirized were a body of between four and five hundred connecticut lighthorse under colonel thomas seymour on an appeal for aid to the governor of their state they had voluntarily hastened on in advance of the militia to render the most speedy succor washington speaks of them as being for the most part if not all men of reputation and property they were in fact mostly farmers the connecticut infantry which had been furnished by governor trumbull in the present emergency likewise were substantial farmers whose business would require their return when the necessity of their further stay in the army should be over they were all men of simple rural manners from an agricultural state where great equality of condition prevailed the officers were elected by the men out of their own ranks they were their own neighbors and every way their equals all this as yet was but little understood or appreciated by the troops from the south among whom military rank was more defined and tenaciously observed and where the officers were men of the cities and of more aristocratic habits     chapter xxxi the war in the southaffairs in the highlands   letters from general lee gave washington intelligence of the fate of sir henry clintons expedition to the south that expedition which had been the subject of so much surmise and perplexity  within a year past charleston had been fortified at various points fort johnson on james island three miles from the city and commanding the breadth of the channel was garrisoned by a regiment of south carolina regulars under colonel gadsden a strong fort had recently been constructed nearly opposite on the southwest point of sullivans island about six miles below the city it was mounted with twentysix guns and garrisoned by three hundred and seventyfive regulars and a few militia and commanded by colonel william moultrie of south carolina who had constructed it this fort in connection with that on james island was considered the key of the harbor cannon had also been mounted on haddrells point on the mainland to the northwest of sullivans island and along the bay in front of the town  the arrival of general lee gave great joy to the people of charleston from his high reputation for military skill and experience according to his own account in a letter to washington the town on his arrival was utterly defenceless he was rejoiced therefore when the enemy instead of immediately attacking it directed his whole force against the fort on sullivans island  the british ships in fact having passed the bar with some difficulty landed their troops on long island situated to the east of sullivans island and separated from it by a small creek called the breach sir henry clinton meditated a combined attack with his land and naval forces on the fort commanded by moultrie the capture of which he thought would insure the reduction of charleston the americans immediately threw up works on the northeastern extremity of sullivans island to prevent the passage of the enemy over the breach stationing a force of regulars and militia there under colonel thompson general lee encamped on haddrells point on the mainland to the north of the island whence he intended to keep up a communication by a bridge of boats so as to be ready at any moment to aid either moultrie or thompson  sir henry clinton on the other hand had to construct batteries on long island to oppose those of thompson and cover the passage of his troops by boats or by the ford thus time was consumed and the enemy were from the 1st to the 28th of june preparing for the attack  at length on the 28th of june the thunder bomb commenced the attack throwing shells at the fort as the fleet under sir peter parker advanced about eleven oclock the ships dropped their anchors directly before the front battery they commenced says lee the most furious fire i ever saw the garrison however according to british authority stuck with the greatest constancy and firmness to their guns fired deliberately and slow and took a cool effective aim the ships suffered accordingly they were torn almost to pieces and the slaughter was dreadful the fire from the ships did not produce the expected effect the fortifications were low composed of earth and palmetto wood which is soft and makes no splinters and the merlons were extremely thick at one time there was a considerable pause in the american fire and the enemy thought the fort was abandoned it was only because the powder was exhausted as soon as a supply could be forwarded from the mainland by general lee the fort resumed its fire with still more deadly effect through unskilful pilotage several of the ships ran aground where one the frigate act√¶on remained the rest were extricated with difficulty those which bore the brunt of the action were much cut up one hundred and seventyfive men were killed and nearly as many wounded sir henry clinton with two thousand troops and five or six hundred seamen attempted repeatedly to cross from long island and cooperate in the attack upon the fort but was as often foiled by colonel thompson with his battery of two cannons and a body of south carolina rangers and north carolina regulars  the combat slackened before sunset and ceased before ten oclock sir peter parker who had received a severe contusion in the engagement then slipped his cables and drew off his shattered ships to five fathom hole the act√¶on remained aground on the following morning sir henry clinton made another attempt to cross from long island to sullivans island but was again repulsed and obliged to take shelter behind his breastworks sir peter parker too giving up all hope of reducing the fort in the shattered condition of his ships ordered that the act√¶on should be set on fire and abandoned within a few days the troops were reembarked from long island the attempt upon charleston was for the present abandoned and the fleet once more put to sea  in this action one of the severest in the whole course of the war the loss of the americans in killed and wounded was but thirtyfive men colonel moultrie derived the greatest glory from the defence of sullivans island though the thanks of congress were voted as well to general lee colonel thompson and those under their command  the tidings of this signal repulse of the enemy came most opportunely to washington when he was apprehending an attack upon new york                                       general putnam beside his bravery in the field was somewhat of a mechanical projector the batteries at fort washington had proved ineffectual in opposing the passage of hostile ships up the hudson he was now engaged on a plan for obstructing the channel opposite the fort so as to prevent the passing of any more ships a letter from him to general gales july 26th explains his project we are preparing chevauxdefrise at which we make great despatch by the help of ships which are to be sunk the two ships sterns lie towards each other about seventy feet apart three large logs which reach from ship to ship are fastened to them the two ships and logs stop the river two hundred and eighty feet the ships are to be sunk and when hauled down on one side the pricks will be raised to a proper height and they must inevitably stop the river if the enemy will let us sink them  it so happened that one ephraim anderson adjutant to the second jersey battalion had recently submitted a project to congress for destroying the enemys fleet in the harbor of new york he had attempted an enterprise of the kind against the british ships in the harbor of quebec during the siege and according to his own account would have succeeded had not the enemy discovered his intentions and stretched a cable across the mouth of the harbor and had he not accidentally been much burnt his scheme was favorably entertained by congress and washington by a letter dated july 10th was instructed to aid him in carrying it into effect anderson accordingly was soon at work at new york constructing fireships with which the fleet was to be attacked simultaneous with the attack a descent was to be made on the british camp on staten island from the nearest point of the jersey shore by troops from mercers flying camp and by others stationed at bergen under major knowlton putnams favorite officer for daring enterprises projectors are subject to disappointments it was impossible to construct a sufficient number of fireships and galleys in time the flying camp too recruited but slowly and scarcely exceeded three thousand men the combined attack by fire and sword had therefore to be given up  in the course of a few days arrived a hundred sail with large reinforcements among which were one thousand hessians and as many more were reported to be on the way the troops were disembarked on staten island and fortifications thrown up on some of the most commanding hills all projects of attack upon the enemy were now out of the question indeed some of washingtons ablest advisers questioned the policy of remaining in new york where they might be entrapped as the british had been in boston  during the latter part of july and the early part of august ships of war with their tenders continued to arrive and scotch highlanders hessians and other troops to be landed on staten island at the beginning of august the squadron with sir henry clinton recently repulsed at charleston anchored in the bay  in the meantime putnams contrivances for obstructing the channel had reached their destined place a letter dated fort washington august 3d says four ships chained and boomed with a number of amazing large chevauxdefrise were sunk close by the fort under command of general mifflin which fort mounts thirtytwo pieces of heavy cannon we are thoroughly sanguine that they the ships up the river never will be able to join the british fleet nor assistance from the fleet be afforded to them another letter written at the same date from tarrytown on the borders of the tappan sea gives an account of an attack made by six row galleys upon the phoenix and the rose they fought bravely for two hours hulling the ships repeatedly but sustaining great damage in return until their commodore colonel tupper gave the signal to draw off  the force of the enemy collected in the neighborhood of new york was about thirty thousand men that of the americans a little more than seventeen thousand but was subsequently increased to twenty thousand for the most part raw and undisciplined onefourth were on the sick list with bilious and putrid fevers and dysentery others were absent on furlough or command the rest had to be distributed over posts and stations fifteen miles apart  washington kept the most watchful eye upon the movements of the enemy beside their great superiority in point of numbers as well as discipline to his own crude and scanty legions they possessed a vast advantage in their fleet they would not be half the enemy they are observed colonel reed if they were once separated from their ships every arrival and departure of these therefore was a subject of speculation and conjecture aaron burr at that time in new york aidedecamp to general putnam speaks in a letter to an uncle of thirty transports which under convoy of three frigates had put to sea on the 7th of august with the intention of sailing round long island and coming through the sound and thus investing the city by the north and east rivers they are then to land on both sides of the island writes he join their forces and draw a line across which will hem us in and totally cut off all communication after which they will have their own fun  in this emergency washington wrote to general mercer for 2000 men from the flying camp colonel smallwoods battalion was immediately furnished as a part of them the convention of the state ordered out hasty levies of country militia to form temporary camps on the shore of the sound and on that of the hudson above kings bridge to annoy the enemy should they attempt to land from their ships on either of these waters others were sent to reinforce the posts on long island many of the yeomen of the country thus hastily summoned from the plough were destitute of arms in lieu of which they were ordered to bring with them a shovel spade or pickaxe or a scythe straightened and fastened to a pole this rustic array may have provoked the thoughtless sneers of city scoffers such as those cited by graydon but it was in truth one of the glorious features of the revolution to be thus aided in its emergencies by hasty levies of husbandmen  by the authority of the new york convention washington had appointed general george clinton to the command of the levies on both sides of the hudson he now ordered him to hasten down with them to the fort just erected on the north side of kings bridge leaving two hundred men under the command of a brave and alert officer to throw up works at the pass of anthonys nose where the main road to albany crosses that mountain troops of horse also were to be posted by him along the river to watch the motions of the enemy  accounts of deserters and other intelligence informed washington on the 17th that a great many of the enemys troops had gone on board of the transports that three days provisions had been cooked and other steps taken indicating an intention of leaving staten island putnam also came up from below with word that at least onefourth of the fleet had sailed there were many conjectures at headquarters as to whither they were bound or whether they had not merely shifted their station everything indicated however that affairs were tending to a crisis  a gallant little exploit at this juncture gave a fillip to the spirits of the community two of the fireships recently constructed went up the hudson to attempt the destruction of the ships which had so long been domineering over its waters one succeeded in grappling the phoenix and would soon have set her in flames but in the darkness got to leeward and was cast loose without effecting any damage the other in making for the rose fell foul of one of the tenders grappled and burnt her the enterprise was conducted with spirit and though it failed of its main object had an important effect the commanders of the ships determined to abandon those waters where their boats were fired upon by the very yeomanry whenever they attempted to land and where their ships were in danger from midnight incendiaries while riding at anchor taking advantage of a brisk wind and favoring tide they made all sail early on the morning of the 18th of august and stood down the river keeping close under the eastern shore where they supposed the guns from mount washington could not be brought to bear upon them notwithstanding this precaution the phoenix was thrice hulled by shots from the fort and one of the tenders once the rose also was hulled once by a shot from burdetts ferry the men on board were kept close to avoid being picked off by a party of riflemen posted on the river bank the ships fired grapeshot as they passed but without effecting any injury unfortunately a passage had been left open in the obstructions on which general putnam had calculated so sanguinely it was to have been closed in the course of a day or two through this they made their way guided by a deserter     chapter xxxii battle of long islandretreat   the movements of the british fleet and of the camp on staten island gave signs of a meditated attack but as the nature of that attack was uncertain washington was obliged to retain the greater part of his troops in the city for its defence holding them ready however to be transferred to any point in the vicinity general mifflin with about five hundred of the pennsylvania troops of colonels shee and magaws regiments were at kings bridge ready to aid at a moments notice general george clinton was at that post with about fourteen hundred of his yeomanry of the hudson  reports from different quarters gave washington reason to apprehend that the design of the enemy might be to land part of their force on long island and endeavor to get possession of the heights of brooklyn which overlooked new york while another part should land above the city thus various disconnected points distant from each other and a great extent of intervening country had to be defended by raw troops against a superior force well disciplined and possessed of every facility for operating by land and water  general greene with a considerable force was stationed at brooklyn he had acquainted himself with all the localities of the island from hell gate to the narrows and made his plan of defence accordingly his troops were diligently occupied in works which he laid out about a mile beyond the village of brooklyn and facing the interior of the island whence a land attack might be attempted brooklyn was immediately opposite to new york the sound commonly called the east river in that place about three quarters of a mile in width swept its rapid tides between them the village stood on a kind of peninsula formed by the deep inlets of wallabout bay on the north and gowanus cove on the south a line of intrenchments and strong redoubts extended across the neck of the peninsula from the bay to a swamp and creek emptying into the cove to protect the rear of the works from the enemys ships a battery was erected at red hook the southwest corner of the peninsula and a fort on governors island nearly opposite  about two miles and a half in front of the line of intrenchments and redoubts a range of hills densely wooded extended from southwest to northeast forming a natural barrier across the island it was traversed by three roads one on the left of the works stretched eastwardly to bedford and then by a pass through the bedford hills to the village of jamaica another central and direct led through the woody heights to flatbush a third on the right of the lines passed by gowanus cove to the narrows and gravesend bay the occupation of this range of hills and the protection of its passes had been designed by general greene but unfortunately in the midst of his arduous toils he was taken down by a raging fever which confined him to his bed and general sullivan just returned from lake champlain had the temporary command  on the 21st came a letter written in all haste by brigadiergeneral william livingston of new jersey movements of the enemy on staten island had been seen from his camp he had sent over a spy at midnight who brought back the following intelligence twenty thousand men had embarked to make an attack on long island and up the hudson fifteen thousand remained on staten island to attack bergen point elizabethtown point and amboy  washington sent a copy of the letter to the new york convention on the following morning august 22d the enemy appeared to be carrying their plans into execution the reports of cannon and musketry were heard from long island and columns of smoke were descried rising above the groves and orchards at a distance the city as usual was alarmed and had reason to be so for word soon came that several thousand men with artillery and lighthorse were landed at gravesend and that colonel hand stationed there with the pennsylvania rifle regiment had retreated to the lines setting fire to stacks of wheat and other articles to keep them from falling into the enemys hands washington apprehended an attempt of the foe by a forced march to surprise the lines at brooklyn he immediately sent over a reinforcement of six battalions it was all that he could spare as with the next tide the ships might bring up the residue of the army and attack the city five battalions more however were ordered to be ready as a reinforcement if required  nine thousand of the enemy had landed with forty pieces of cannon sir henry clinton had the chief command and led the first division his associate officers were the earls of cornwallis and percy general grant and general sir william erskine as their boats approached the shore colonel hand stationed as has been said in the neighborhood with his rifle regiment retreated to the chain of wooded hills and took post on a height commanding the central road leading from flatbush the enemy having landed without opposition lord cornwallis was detached with the reserve to flatbush while the rest of the army extended itself from the ferry at the narrows through utrecht and gravesend to the village of flatland cornwallis with two battalions of lightinfantry colonel donops corps of hessians and six fieldpieces advanced rapidly to seize upon the central pass through the hills he found hand and his riflemen ready to make a vigorous defence this brought him to a halt having been ordered not to risk an attack should the pass be occupied he took post for the night therefore in the village of flatbush  on the 24th washington crossed over to brooklyn to inspect the lines and reconnoitre the neighborhood in this visit he felt sensibly the want of general greenes presence to explain his plans and point out the localities the american advanced posts were in the wooded hills colonel hand with his riflemen kept watch over the central road and a strong redoubt had been thrown up in front of the pass to check any advance of the enemy from flatbush another road leading from flatbush to bedford by which the enemy might get round to the left of the works at brooklyn was guarded by two regiments one under colonel williams posted on the north side of the ridge the other by a pennsylvanian rifle regiment under colonel miles posted on the south side the enemy were stretched along the country beyond the chain of hills  as yet nothing had taken place but skirmishing and irregular firing between the outposts it was with deep concern washington noticed a prevalent disorder and confusion in the camp there was a want of system among the officers and cooperation among the troops each corps seeming to act independently of the rest few of the men had any military experience except perchance in bushfighting with the indians unaccustomed to discipline and the restraint of camps they sallied forth whenever they pleased singly or in squads prowling about and firing upon the enemy like hunters after game much of this was no doubt owing to the protracted illness of general greene on returning to the city therefore washington gave the command on long island to general putnam warning him however in his letter of instructions to summon the officers together and enjoin them to put a stop to the irregularities which he had observed among the troops in the meantime the enemy were augmenting their forces on the island two brigades of hessians under lieutenantgeneral de heister were transferred from the camp on staten island on the 25th this movement did not escape the vigilant eye of washington he now concluded that the enemy were about to make a push with their main force for the possession of brooklyn heights he accordingly sent over additional reinforcements and among them colonel john haslets well equipped and well disciplined delaware regiment which was joined to lord stirlings brigade chiefly composed of southern troops and stationed outside of the lines  on the 26th he crossed over to brooklyn accompanied by reed the adjutantgeneral there was much movement among the enemys troops and their number was evidently augmented in fact general de heister had reached flatbush with his hessians and taken command of the centre whereupon sir henry clinton with the right wing drew off to flatlands in a diagonal line to the right of de heister while the left wing commanded by general grant extended to the place of landing on gravesend bay  washington remained all day aiding general putnam with his counsels who new to the command had not been able to make himself well acquainted with the fortified posts beyond the lines in the evening washington returned to the city full of anxious thought a general attack was evidently at hand where would it be made how would his inexperienced troops stand the encounter what would be the defence of the city if assailed by the ships it was a night of intense solicitude and well might it be for during that night a plan was carried into effect fraught with disaster to the americans  the plan to which we allude was concerted by general howe the commanderinchief sir henry clinton with the vanguard composed of the choicest troops was by a circuitous march in the night to throw himself into the road leading from jamaica to bedford seize upon a pass through the bedford hills within three miles of that village and thus turn the left of the american advanced posts to divert the attention of the americans from this stealthy march on their left general grant was to menace their right flank toward gravesend before daybreak and general de heister to cannonade their centre where colonel hand was stationed neither however was to press an attack until the guns of sir henry clinton should give notice that he had effected his purpose and turned the left flank of the americans then the latter were to be assailed at all points with the utmost vigor  about nine oclock in the evening of the 26th sir henry clinton began his march from flatlands with the vanguard composed of light infantry lord percy followed with the grenadiers artillery and light dragoons forming the centre lord cornwallis brought up the rearguard with the heavy ordnance general howe accompanied this division it was a silent march without beat of drum or sound of trumpet under guidance of a long island tory along byroads traversing a swamp by a narrow causeway and so across the country to the jamaica road about two hours before daybreak they arrived within half a mile of the pass through the bedford hills and halted to prepare for an attack at this juncture they captured an american patrol and learnt to their surprise that the bedford pass was unoccupied in fact the whole road beyond bedford leading to jamaica had been left unguarded excepting by some light volunteer troops colonels williams and miles who were stationed to the left of colonel hand among the wooded hills had been instructed to send out parties occasionally to patrol the road but no troops had been stationed at the bedford pass the road and pass may not have been included in general greenes plan of defence or may have been thought too far out of the way to need special precaution the neglect of them however proved fatal  sir henry clinton immediately detached a battalion of light infantry to secure the pass and advancing with his corps at the first break of day possessed himself of the heights he was now within three miles of bedford and his march had been undiscovered having passed the heights therefore he halted his division for the soldiers to take some refreshment preparatory to the mornings hostilities there we will leave them while we note how the other divisions performed their part of the plan  about midnight general grant moved from gravesend bay with the left wing composed of two brigades and a regiment of regulars a battalion of new york loyalists and ten fieldpieces he proceeded along the road leading past the narrows and gowanus cove toward the right of the american works a picket guard of pennsylvanian and new york militia under colonel atlee retired before him fighting to a position on the skirts of the wooded hills in the meantime scouts had brought in word to the american lines that the enemy were approaching in force upon the right general putnam instantly ordered lord stirling to hasten with the two regiments nearest at hand and hold them in check these were haslets delaware and smallwoods maryland regiments the latter the macaronis in scarlet and buff who had outshone in camp their yeoman fellowsoldiers in homespun they turned out with great alacrity and stirling pushed forward with them on the road to the narrows by the time he had passed gowanus cove daylight began to appear here on a rising ground he met colonel atlee with his pennsylvania provincials and learned that the enemy were near indeed their front began to appear in the uncertain twilight stirling ordered atlee to place himself in ambush in an orchard on the left of the road and await their coming up while he formed the delaware and maryland regiments along a ridge from the road up to a piece of woods on the top of the hill  atlee gave the enemy two or three volleys as they approached and then retreated and formed in the wood on lord stirlings left by this time his lordship was reinforced by kichlines riflemen part of whom he placed along a hedge at the foot of the hill and part in front of the wood general grant threw his light troops in the advance and posted them in an orchard and behind hedges extending in front of the americans and about one hundred and fifty yards distant  it was now broad daylight a rattling fire commenced between the british light troops and the american riflemen which continued for about two hours when the former retired to their main body in the meantime stirlings position had been strengthened by the arrival of captain carpenter with two fieldpieces these were placed on the side of the hill so as to command the road and the approach for some hundred yards general grant likewise brought up his artillery within three hundred yards and formed his brigades on opposite hills about six hundred yards distant there was occasional cannonading on both sides but neither party sought a general action lord stirlings object was merely to hold the enemy in check and the instructions of general grant as we have shown were not to press an attack until aware that sir henry clinton was on the left flank of the americans  during this time de heister had commenced his part of the plan by opening a cannonade from his camp at flatbush upon the redoubt at the pass of the wooded hills where hand and his riflemen were stationed on hearing this general sullivan who was within the lines rode forth to colonel hands post to reconnoitre de heister however according to the plan of operations did not advance from flatbush but kept up a brisk fire from his artillery on the redoubt in front of the pass which replied as briskly at the same time a cannonade from a british ship upon the battery at red hook contributed to distract the attention of the americans  in the meantime terror reigned in new york the volleying of musketry and the booming of cannon at early dawn had told of the fighting that had commenced as the morning advanced and platoon firing and the occasional discharge of a fieldpiece were heard in different directions the terror increased washington was still in doubt whether this was but a part of a general attack in which the city was to be included five ships of the line were endeavoring to beat up the bay were they to cannonade the city or to land troops above it fortunately a strong headwind baffled their efforts but one vessel of inferior force got up far enough to open the fire already mentioned upon the fort at red hook seeing no likelihood of an immediate attack upon the city washington hastened over to brooklyn in his barge and galloped up to the works he arrived there in time to witness the catastrophe for which all the movements of the enemy had been concerted  the thundering of artillery in the direction of bedford had given notice that sir henry had turned the left of the americans de heister immediately ordered colonel count donop to advance with his hessian regiment and storm the redoubt while he followed with his whole division sullivan did not remain to defend the redoubt sir henrys cannon had apprised him of the fatal truth that his flank was turned and he in danger of being surrounded he ordered a retreat to the lines but it was already too late scarce had he descended from the height and emerged into the plain when he was met by the british light infantry and dragoons and driven back into the woods by this time de heister and his hessians had come up and now commenced a scene of confusion consternation and slaughter in which the troops under williams and miles were involved hemmed in and entrapped between the british and hessians and driven from one to the other the americans fought for a time bravely or rather desperately some were cut down and trampled by the cavalry others bayoneted without mercy by the hessians some rallied in groups and made a brief stand with their rifles from rocks or behind trees the whole pass was a scene of carnage resounding with the clash of arms the tramp of horses the volleying of firearms and the cries of the combatants with now and then the dreary braying of the trumpet at length some of the americans by a desperate effort cut their way through the host of foes and effected a retreat to the lines fighting as they went others took refuge among the woods and fastnesses of the hills but a great part were either killed or taken prisoners among the latter was general sullivan  washington as we have observed arrived in time to witness this catastrophe but was unable to prevent it he had heard the din of the battle in the woods and seen the smoke rising from among the trees but a deep column of the enemy was descending from the hills on the left his choicest troops were all in action and he had none but militia to man the works his solicitude was now awakened for the safety of lord stirling and his corps who had been all the morning exchanging cannonades with general grant he saw the danger to which these brave fellows were exposed though they could not stationed on a hill within the lines he commanded with his telescope a view of the whole field and saw the enemys reserve under cornwallis marching down by a crossroad to get in their rear and thus place them between two fires with breathless anxiety he watched the result  the sound of sir henry clintons cannon apprised stirling that the enemy was between him and the lines general grant too aware that the time had come for earnest action was closing up and had already taken colonel atlee prisoner his lordship now thought to effect a circuitous retreat to the lines by crossing the creek which empties into gowanus cove near what was called the yellow mills there was a bridge and milldam and the creek might be forded at low water but no time was to be lost for the tide was rising leaving part of his men to keep face toward general grant he advanced with the rest to pass the creek but was suddenly checked by the appearance of cornwallis and his grenadiers  washington and some of his officers on the hill who watched every movement had supposed that stirling and his troops finding the case desperate would surrender in a body without firing on the contrary his lordship boldly attacked cornwallis with half of smallwoods battalion while the rest of his troops retreated across the creek washington wrung his hands in agony at the sight good god cried he what brave fellows i must this day lose  it was indeed a desperate fight and now smallwoods macaronis showed their game spirit they were repeatedly broken but as often rallied and renewed the fight we were on the point of driving lord cornwallis from his station writes lord stirling but large reinforcements arriving rendered it impossible to do more than provide for safety being thus surrounded and no probability of a reinforcement writes a maryland officer his lordship ordered me to retreat with the remaining part of our men and force our way to our camp  only five companies of smallwoods battalion were now in action there was a warm and close engagement for nearly ten minutes the struggle became desperate on the part of the americans broken and disordered they rallied in a piece of woods and made a second attack they were again overpowered with numbers some were surrounded and bayoneted in a field of indian corn others joined their comrades who were retreating across the marsh lord stirling had encouraged and animated his young soldiers by his voice and example but when all was lost he sought out general de heister and surrendered himself as his prisoner more than two hundred and fifty brave fellows perished in this deadly struggle within sight of the lines of brooklyn that part of the delaware troops who had first crossed the creek and swamp made good their retreat to the lines with a trifling loss  the enemy now concentrated their forces within a few hundred yards of the redoubts the grenadiers were within musket shot washington expected they would storm the works and prepared for a desperate defence the discharge of a cannon and volleys of musketry from the part of the lines nearest to them seemed to bring them to a pause it was in truth the forbearance of the british commander that prevented a bloody conflict his troops heated with action and flushed with success were eager to storm the works but he was unwilling to risk the loss of life that must attend an assault when the object might be attained at a cheaper rate by regular approaches checking the ardor of his men therefore though with some difficulty he drew them off to a hollow way in front of the lines but out of reach of the musketry and encamped there for the night  the loss of the americans in this disastrous battle has been variously stated but is thought in killed wounded and prisoners to have been nearly two thousand a large number considering that not above five thousand were engaged the enemy acknowledged a loss of 380 killed and wounded the success of the enemy was attributed in some measure to the doubt in which washington was kept as to the nature of the intended attack and at what point it would chiefly be made this obliged him to keep a great part of his forces in new york and to distribute those at brooklyn over a wide extent of country and at widely distant places much of the days disaster has been attributed also to a confusion in the command caused by the illness of general greene putnam who had supplied his place in the emergency after the enemy had landed had not time to make himself acquainted with the post and the surrounding country the fatal error however and one probably arising from all these causes consisted in leaving the passes through the wooded hills too weakly fortified and guarded and especially in neglecting the eastern road by which sir henry clinton got in the rear of the advanced troops cut them off from the lines and subjected them to a cross fire of his own men and de heisters hessians  the night after the battle was a weary yet almost sleepless one to the americans fatigued dispirited many of them sick and wounded yet they were for the most part without tent or other shelter to washington it was a night of anxious vigil everything boded a close and deadly conflict the enemy had pitched a number of tents about a mile distant their sentries were but a quarter of a mile off and close to the american sentries the morning broke lowering and dreary large encampments were gradually descried to appearance the enemy were twenty thousand strong as the day advanced their ordnance began to play upon the works they were proceeding to intrench themselves but were driven into their tents by a drenching rain  early in the morning general mifflin arrived in camp with part of the troops which had been stationed at fort washington and kings bridge he brought with him shees prime philadelphia regiment and magaws pennsylvania regiment both well disciplined and officered and accustomed to act together they were so much reduced in number however by sickness that they did not amount in the whole to more than eight hundred men with mifflin came also colonel glovers massachusetts regiment composed chiefly of marblehead fishermen and sailors hardy adroit and weatherproof trimly clad in blue jackets and trousers the detachment numbered in the whole about thirteen hundred men all fresh and full of spirits they were posted at the left extremity of the intrenchments towards the wallabout  there were skirmishes throughout the day between the riflemen on the advanced posts and the british irregulars which at times were quite severe but no decided attack was attempted the main body of the enemy kept within their tents until the latter part of the day when they began to break ground at about five hundred yards distance from the works as if preparing to carry them by regular approaches  on the 29th there was a dense fog over the island that wrapped everything in mystery in the course of the morning general mifflin with adjutantgeneral reed and colonel grayson of virginia one of washingtons aidesdecamp rode to the western outposts in the neighborhood of red hook while they were there a light breeze lifted the fog from a part of the new york bay and revealed the british ships at their anchorage opposite staten island there appeared to be an unusual bustle among them boats were passing to and from the admirals ship as if seeking or carrying orders some movement was apparently in agitation the idea occurred to the reconnoitring party that the fleet was preparing should the wind hold and the fog clear away to come up the bay at the turn of the tide silence the feeble batteries at red hook and the city and anchor in the east river in that case the army on long island would be completely surrounded and entrapped  alarmed at this perilous probability they spurred back to headquarters to urge the immediate withdrawal of the army as this might not be acceptable advice reed emboldened by his intimacy with the commanderinchief undertook to give it washington instantly summoned a council of war the difficulty was already apparent of guarding such extensive works with troops fatigued and dispirited and exposed to the inclemencies of the weather other dangers now presented themselves their communication with new york might be cut off by the fleet from below other ships had passed round long island and were at flushing bay on the sound these might land troops on the east side of harlem river and make themselves masters of kings bridge that key of manhattan island taking all these things into consideration it was resolved to cross with the troops to the city that very night  never did retreat require greater secrecy and circumspection nine thousand men with all the munitions of war were to be withdrawn from before a victorious army encamped so near that every stroke of spade and pickaxe from their trenches could be heard the retreating troops moreover were to be embarked and conveyed across a strait threequarters of a mile wide swept by rapid tides the least alarm of their movement would bring the enemy upon them and produce a terrible scene of confusion and carnage at the place of embarkation washington made the preparatory arrangements with great alertness yet profound secrecy verbal orders were sent to colonel hughes who acted as quartermastergeneral to impress all water craft largo and small from spyt den duivel on the hudson round to hell gate on the sound and have them on the east side of the city by evening the order was issued at noon and so promptly executed that although some of the vessels had to be brought a distance of fifteen miles they were all at brooklyn at eight oclock in the evening and put under the management of colonel glovers amphibious marblehead regiment  to prepare the army for a general movement without betraying the object orders were issued for the troops to hold themselves in readiness for a night attack upon the enemy to keep the enemy from discovering the withdrawal of the americans until their main body should have embarked in the boats and pushed off from the shore general mifflin was to remain at the lines with his pennsylvania troops and the gallant remains of haslet smallwood and hands regiments with guards posted and sentinels alert as if nothing extraordinary was taking place when the main embarkation was effected they were themselves to move off quietly march briskly to the ferry and embark  it was late in the evening when the troops began to retire from the breastworks as one regiment quietly withdrew from their station on guard the troops on the right and left moved up and filled the vacancy there was a stifled murmur in the camp unavoidable in a movement of the kind but it gradually died away in the direction of the river as the main body moved on in silence and order the youthful hamilton whose military merits had won the favor of general greene and who had lost his baggage and a fieldpiece in the battle brought up the rear of the retreating party  the embarkation went on with all possible despatch under the vigilant eye of washington who stationed himself at the ferry superintending every movement in his anxiety for despatch he sent back colonel scammel one of his aidesdecamp to hasten forward all the troops that were on the march scammel blundered in executing his errand and gave the order to mifflin likewise the general instantly called in his pickets and sentinels and set off for the ferry  by this time the tide had turned there was a strong wind from the northeast the boats with oars were insufficient to convey the troops those with sails could not make headway against wind and tide there was some confusion at the ferry and in the midst of it general mifflin came down with the whole covering party adding to the embarrassment and uproar good god general mifflin cried washington i am afraid you have ruined us by so unseasonably withdrawing the troops from the lines i did so by your order replied mifflin with some warmth it cannot be exclaimed washington by g i did was the blunt rejoinder did scammel act as aidedecamp for the day or did he not he did then said mifflin i had orders through him it is a dreadful mistake rejoined washington and unless the troops can regain the lines before their absence is discovered by the enemy the most disastrous consequences are to be apprehended mifflin led back his men to the lines which had been completely deserted for threequarters of an hour fortunately the dense fog had prevented the enemy from discovering that they were unoccupied the men resumed their former posts and remained at them until called off to cross the ferry  the fog which prevailed all this time seemed almost providential while it hung over long island and concealed the movements of the americans the atmosphere was clear on the new york side of the river the adverse wind too died away the river became so smooth that the rowboats could be laden almost to the gunwale and a favoring breeze sprang up for the sailboats the whole embarkation of troops artillery ammunition provisions cattle horses and carts was happily effected and by daybreak the greater part had safely reached the city thanks to the aid of glovers marblehead men scarce anything was abandoned to the enemy excepting a few heavy pieces of artillery at a proper time mifflin with his covering party left the lines and effected a silent retreat to the ferry washington though repeatedly entreated refused to enter a boat until all the troops were embarked and crossed the river with the last  this extraordinary retreat which in its silence and celerity equalled the midnight fortifying of bunkers hill was one of the most signal achievements of the war and redounded greatly to the reputation of washington who we are told for fortyeight hours preceding the safe extricating of his army from their perilous situation scarce closed his eyes and was the greater part of the time on horseback     chapter xxxiii retreat from new york island   the enemy had now possession of long island british and hessian troops garrisoned the works at brooklyn or were distributed at bushwick newtown hell gate and flushing admiral howe came up with the main body of the fleet and anchored close to governors island within cannon shot of the city  our situation is truly distressing writes washington to the president of congress on the 2d of september the check our detachment sustained on the 27th ultimo has dispirited too great a proportion of our troops and filled their minds with apprehension and despair the militia instead of calling forth their utmost efforts to a brave and manly opposition in order to repair our losses are dismayed intractable and impatient to return great numbers of them have gone off in some instances almost by whole regiments by half ones and by companies at a time with the deepest concern i am obliged to confess my want of confidence in the generality of the troops our number of men at present fit for duty is under twenty thousand i have ordered general mercer to send the men intended for the flying camp to this place about a thousand in number and to try with the militia if practicable to make a diversion upon staten island till of late i had no doubt in my own mind of defending this place nor should i have yet if the men would do their duty but this i despair of if we should be obliged to abandon the town ought it to stand as winter quarters for the enemy they would derive great conveniences from it on the one hand and much property would be destroyed on the other it is an important question but will admit of but little time for deliberation at present i daresay the enemy mean to preserve it if they can if congress therefore should resolve upon the destruction of it the resolution should be a profound secret as the knowledge will make a capital change in their plans  on the night of monday sept 2d a forty gun ship taking advantage of a favorable wind and tide passed between governors island and long island swept unharmed by the batteries which opened upon her and anchored in turtle bay above the city in the morning washington despatched major crane of the artillery with two twelve pounders and a howitzer to annoy her from the new york shore they hulled her several times and obliged her to take shelter behind blackwells island several other shipsofwar with transports and storeships had made their appearance in the upper part of the sound having gone round long island  as the city might speedily be attacked washington caused all the sick and wounded to be conveyed to orangetown in the jerseys and such military stores and baggage as were not immediately needed to be removed as fast as conveyances could be procured to a post partially fortified at dobbs ferry on the eastern bank of the hudson about twentytwo miles above the city  the thousand men ordered from the flying camp were furnished by general mercer they were maryland troops under colonels griffith and richardson and were a seasonable addition to the effective forces but the ammunition carried off by the disbanding militia was a serious loss at this critical juncture  a work had been commenced on the jersey shore opposite fort washington to aid in protecting putnams chevauxdefrise which had sunk between them this work had received the name of fort constitution a name already borne by one of the forts in the highlands troops were drawn from the flying camp to make a strong encampment in the vicinity of the fort with an able officer to command it and a skilful engineer to strengthen the works it was hoped by the cooperation of these opposite forts and the chevauxdefrise to command the hudson and prevent the passing and repassing of hostile ships  the british in the meantime forbore to press further hostilities lord howe was really desirous of a peaceful adjustment of the strife between the colonies and the mother country and supposed this a propitious moment for a new attempt at pacification he accordingly sent off general sullivan on parole charged with an overture to congress in this he declared himself empowered and disposed to compromise the dispute between great britain and america on the most favorable terms and though he could not treat with congress as a legally organized body he was desirous of a conference with some of its members these for the time he should consider only as private gentlemen but if in the conference any probable scheme of accommodation should be agreed upon the authority of congress would afterwards be acknowledged to render the compact complete  the message caused some embarrassment in congress to accede to the interview might seem to waive the question of independence to decline it was to shut the door on all hope of conciliation and might alienate the cooperation of some worthy whigs who still clung to that hope after much debate congress on the 5th september replied that being the representatives of the free and independent states of america they could not send any members to confer with his lordship in their private characters but that ever desirous of establishing peace on reasonable terms they would send a committee of their body to ascertain what authority he had to treat with persons authorized by congress and what propositions he had to offer a committee was chosen on the 6th of september composed of john adams edward rutledge and doctor franklin  the proposed conference was to take place on the 11th at a house on staten island opposite to amboy at which latter place the veteran mercer was stationed with his flying camp at amboy the committee found lord howes barge waiting to receive them the admiral met them on their landing and conducted them through his guards to his house  on opening the conference his lordship again intimated that he could not treat with them as a committee of congress but only confer with them as private gentlemen of influence in the colonies on the means of restoring peace between the two countries the commissioners replied that as their business was to hear he might consider them in what light he pleased but that they should consider themselves in no other character than that in which they were placed by order of congress lord howe then entered into a discourse of considerable length but made no explicit proposition of peace nor promise of redress of grievances excepting on condition that the colonies should return to their allegiance this the commissioners replied was not now to be expected their repeated humble petitions to the king and parliament having been treated with contempt and answered by additional injuries and war having been declared against them the colonies had declared their independence and it was not in the power of congress to agree for them that they should return to their former dependent state his lordship expressed his sorrow that no accommodation was likely to take place and the conference broke up  the result of this conference had a beneficial effect it showed that his lordship had no power but what was given by the act of parliament and put an end to the popular notion that he was vested with secret powers to negotiate an adjustment of grievances  since the retreat from brooklyn washington had narrowly watched the movements of the enemy to discover their further plans their whole force excepting about four thousand men had been transferred from staten to long island a great part was encamped on the peninsula between newtown inlet and flushing bay a battery had been thrown up near the extremity of the peninsula to check an american battery at horens hook opposite and to command the mouth of harlem river troops were subsequently stationed on the islands about hell gate it is evident writes washington the enemy mean to enclose us on the island of new york by taking post in our rear while the shipping secures the front and thus by cutting off our communication with the country oblige us to fight them on their own terms or surrender at discretion  the question was how could their plans be most successfully opposed on every side he saw a choice of difficulties every measure was to be formed with some apprehension that all the troops would not do their duty in a council of war held on the 7th of september the question was discussed whether the city should be defended or evacuated all admitted that it would not be tenable should it be cannonaded and bombarded several of the council among whom was general putnam were for a total and immediate removal from the city urging that one part of the army might be cut off before the other could support it the extremities being at least sixteen miles apart and the whole when collected being inferior to the enemy by removing they would deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ships they would keep them at bay put nothing at hazard keep the army together to be recruited another year and preserve the unspent stores and the heavy artillery washington himself inclined to this opinion others however were unwilling to abandon a place which had been fortified with great cost and labor and seemed defensible and which by some had been considered the key to the northern country  after much discussion a middle course was adopted putnam with five thousand men was to be stationed in the city heath with nine thousand was to keep guard on the upper part of the island and oppose any attempt of the enemy to land his troops among whom were magaws shees hands and miless pennsylvanian battalions and haslets delaware regiment were posted about kings bridge and its vicinity  the third division composed principally of militia was under the command of generals greene and spencer the former of whom however was still unwell it was stationed about the centre of the island chiefly along turtle bay and kips bay where strong works had been thrown up to guard against any landing of troops from the ships or from the encampments on long island it was also to hold itself ready to support either of the other divisions washington himself had his headquarters at a short distance from the city a resolution of congress passed the 10th of september left the occupation or abandonment of the city entirely at washingtons discretion  convinced of the propriety of evacuation washington prepared for it by ordering the removal of all stores excepting such as were indispensable for the subsistence of the troops while they remained a letter from a rhode island officer on a visit to new york gives an idea of its agitations on the 13th of september just after dinner three frigates and a fortygun ship sailed up the east river with a gentle breeze toward hell gate and kept up an incessant fire assisted by the cannon at governors island  on the 14th washingtons baggage was removed to kings bridge whither headquarters were to be transferred the same evening it being clear that the enemy were preparing to encompass him on the island about sunset of the same day six more ships two of them menofwar passed up the sound and joined those above within half an hour came expresses spurring to headquarters one from mifflin at kings bridge the other from colonel sargent at horens hook three or four thousand of the enemy were crossing at hell gate to the islands at the mouth of harlem river where numbers were already encamped an immediate landing at harlem or morrisania was apprehended washington was instantly in the saddle spurring to harlem heights the night however passed away quietly in the morning the enemy commenced operations three ships of war stood up the hudson and anchored opposite bloomingdale a few miles above the city and put a stop to the removal by water of stores and provisions to dobbs ferry about eleven oclock the ships in the east river commenced a heavy cannonade upon the breastworks between turtle bay and the city at the same time two divisions of the troops encamped on long island one british under sir henry clinton the other hessian under colonel donop emerged in boats from the deep woody recesses of newtown inlet and under cover of the fire from the ships began to land at two points between turtle and kips bays the breastworks were manned by militia who had recently served at brooklyn disheartened by their late defeat they fled at the first advance of the enemy two brigades of putnams connecticut troops which had been sent that morning to support them caught the panic and regardless of the commands and entreaties of their officers joined in the general scamper  at this moment washington who had mounted his horse at the first sound of the cannonade came galloping to the scene of confusion riding in among the fugitives he endeavored to rally and restore them to order all in vain at the first appearance of sixty or seventy redcoats they broke again without firing a shot and fled in headlong terror losing all selfcommand at the sight of such dastardly conduct he dashed his hat upon the ground in a transport of rage are these the men exclaimed he with whom i am to defend america in a paroxysm of passion and despair he snapped his pistols at some of them threatened others with his sword and was so heedless of his own danger that he might have fallen into the hands of the enemy who were not eighty yards distant had not an aidedecamp seized the bridle of his horse and absolutely hurried him away  it was one of the rare moments of his life when the vehement element of his nature was stirred up from its deep recesses he soon recovered his selfpossession and took measures against the general peril the enemy might land another force about hell gate seize upon harlem heights the strong central portion of the island cut off all retreat of the lower divisions and effectually sever his army in all haste therefore he sent off an express to the forces encamped above directing them to secure that position immediately while another express to putnam ordered an immediate retreat from the city to those heights  it was indeed a perilous moment had the enemy followed up their advantage and seized upon the heights before thus occupied or had they extended themselves across the island from the place where they had effected a landing the result might have been most disastrous to the americans fortunately they contented themselves for the present with sending a strong detachment down the road along the east river leading to the city while the main body british and hessians rested on their arms  in the meantime putnam on receiving washingtons express called in his pickets and guards and abandoned the city in all haste leaving behind him a large quantity of provisions and military stores and most of the heavy cannon to avoid the enemy he took the bloomingdale road though this exposed him to be raked by the enemys ships anchored in the hudson it was a forced march on a sultry day under a burning sun and amid clouds of dust his army was encumbered with women and children and all kinds of baggage many were overcome by fatigue and thirst some perished by hastily drinking cold water but putnam rode backward and forward hurrying every one on all the loss sustained by him in his perilous retreat was fifteen killed and about three hundred taken prisoners  the fortified camp where the main body of the army was now assembled was upon that neck of land several miles long and for the most part not above a mile wide which forms the upper part of manhattan or new york island it forms a chain of rocky heights and is separated from the mainland by harlem river a narrow strait extending from hell gate on the sound to spyt den duivel a creek or inlet of the hudson fort washington occupied the crest of one of the rocky heights above mentioned overlooking the hudson and about two miles north of it was kings bridge crossing spyt den duivel creek and forming at that time the only pass from manhattan island to the mainland about a mile and a half south of the fort a double row of lines extended across the neck from harlem river to the hudson they faced south towards new york were about a quarter of a mile apart and were defended by batteries  there were strong advanced posts about two miles south of the outer line one on the left of harlem commanded by general spencer the other on the right at what was called mcgowans pass commanded by general putnam about a mile and a half beyond these posts the british lines extended across the island from horens hook to the hudson being a continuous encampment two miles in length with both flanks covered by shipping an open plain intervened between the hostile camps  while thus posted washington was incessantly occupied in fortifying the approaches to his camp by redoubts abatis and deep intrenchments in the course of his rounds of inspection he was struck with the skill and science displayed in the construction of some of the works which were thrown up under the direction of a youthful captain of artillery it proved to be the same young officer alexander hamilton whom greene had recommended to his notice after some conversation with him washington invited him to his marquee and thus commenced that intercourse which has indissolubly linked their memories together  on the morning of the 16th word was brought to headquarters that the enemy were advancing in three large columns there had been so many false reports that reed the adjutantgeneral obtained leave to sally out and ascertain the truth washington himself soon mounted his horse and rode towards the advanced posts on arriving there he heard a brisk firing it was kept up for a time with great spirit there was evidently a sharp conflict at length reed came galloping back with information a strong detachment of the enemy had attacked the most advanced post which was situated on a hill skirted by a wood it had been bravely defended by lieutenantcolonel knowlton after skirmishing for a time the party had been overpowered by numbers and driven in and the outpost was taken possession of by the enemy  reed urged that troops should be sent to support the brave fellows who had behaved so well while he was talking with washington the enemy he says appeared in open view and sounded their bugles in the most insulting manner as usual after a foxchase i never adds he felt such a sensation before it seemed to crown our disgrace  washington too was stung by the taunting note of derision it recalled the easy triumph of the enemy at kips bay resolved that something should be done to wipe out that disgrace and rouse the spirits of the army he ordered out three companies from colonel weedons regiment just arrived from virginia and sent them under major leitch to join knowltons rangers the troops thus united were to get in the rear of the enemy while a feigned attack was made upon them in front  the plan was partially successful as the force advanced to make the false attack the enemy ran down the hill and took what they considered an advantageous position behind some fences and bushes which skirted it a firing commenced between them and the advancing party but at too great distance to do much harm on either side in the meantime knowlton and leitch ignorant of this change in the enemys position having made a circuit came upon them in flank instead of in rear they were sharply received a vivid contest took place in which connecticut vied with virginia in bravery in a little while major leitch received three bullets in his side and was borne off the field shortly afterward a wound in the head from a musket ball brought knowlton to the ground colonel reed placed him on his horse and conveyed him to a distant redoubt the men undismayed by the fall of their leaders fought with unflinching resolution under the command of their captains the enemy were reinforced by a battalion of hessians and a company of chasseurs washington likewise sent reinforcements of new england and maryland troops the action waxed hotter and hotter the enemy were driven from the wood into the plain and pushed for some distance the americans were pursuing them with ardor when washington having effected the object of this casual encounter and being unwilling to risk a general action ordered a retreat to be sounded  colonel knowlton did not long survive the action when gasping in the agonies of death says colonel reed all his inquiry was whether he had driven in the enemy the brave leitch died of his wounds on the 1st of october  in the dead of the night on the 20th september a great light was beheld by the picket guards looming up from behind the hills in the direction of the city it continued throughout the night and was at times so strong that the heavens in that direction appeared to them they said as if in flames at daybreak huge columns of smoke were still rising it was evident there had been a great conflagration in new york in the course of the morning captain montresor aidedecamp to general howe came out with a flag bearing a letter to washington on the subject of an exchange of prisoners according to montresors account a great part of the city had been burnt down and as the night was extremely windy the whole might have been so but for the exertions of the officers and men of the british army the enemy were now bringing up their heavy cannon preparatory to an attack upon the american camp by the troops and by the ships what was the state of washingtons army the terms of engagement of many of his men would soon be at an end most of them would terminate with the year nor did congress hold out offers to encourage reenlistments we are now as it were upon the eve of another dissolution of the army writes he and unless some speedy and effectual measures are adopted by congress our cause will be lost under these gloomy apprehensions he borrowed as he said a few moments from the hours allotted to sleep and on the night of the 24th of september penned an admirable letter to the president of congress setting forth the total inefficiency of the existing military system the total insubordination waste confusion and discontent produced by it among the men and the harassing cares and vexations to which it subjected the commanders nor did he content himself with complaining but in his full clear and sagacious manner pointed out the remedies to the achievements of his indefatigable pen we may trace the most fortunate turns in the current of our revolutionary affairs in the present instance his representations illustrated by sad experience produced at length a reorganization of the army and the establishment of it on a permanent footing it was decreed that eightyeight battalions should be furnished in quotas by the different states according to their abilities the pay of the officers was raised the troops which engaged to serve throughout the war were to receive a bounty of twenty dollars and one hundred acres of land besides a yearly suit of clothes while in service those who enlisted but for three years received no bounty in land the bounty to officers was on a higher ratio the states were to send commissioners to the army to arrange with the commanderinchief as to the appointment of officers in their quotas but as they might occasionally be slow in complying with this regulation washington was empowered to fill up all vacancies  all this was a great relief to his mind he was gratified also by effecting after a long correspondence with the british commander an exchange of prisoners in which those captured in canada were included among those restored to the service were lord stirling and captain daniel morgan the latter in reward of his good conduct in the expedition with arnold and of his intrepid behavior in the assault upon quebec where the brave montgomery fell was recommended to congress by washington for the command of a rifle regiment about to be raised we shall see how eminently he proved himself worthy of this recommendation  nothing perplexed washington at this juncture more than the conduct of the enemy he beheld before him a hostile army armed and equipped at all points superior in numbers thoroughly disciplined flushed with success and abounding in the means of pushing a vigorous campaign yet suffering day after day to elapse unimproved what could be the reason of this supineness on the part of sir william howe he must know the depressed and disorganized state of the american camp the absolute chaos that reigned there did he meditate an irruption into the jerseys a movement towards philadelphia did he intend to detach a part of his forces for a winters campaign against the south  in this uncertainty washington wrote to general mercer of the flying camp to keep a vigilant watch from the jersey shore on the movements of the enemy by sea and land and to station videttes on the neversink heights to give immediate intelligence should any of the british fleet put to sea at the same time he himself practised unceasing vigilance visiting the different parts of his camp on horseback occasionally he crossed over to fort constitution on the jersey shore of which general greene had charge and accompanied by him extended his reconnoitrings down to paulus hook to observe what was going on in the city and among the enemys ships greene had recently been promoted to the rank of majorgeneral and now had command of all the troops in the jerseys he had liberty to shift his quarters to baskingridge or bergen as circumstances might require but was enjoined to keep up a communication with the main army east of the hudson so as to secure a retreat in case of necessity  the security of the hudson was at this time an object of great solicitude with congress and much reliance was placed on putnams obstructions at fort washington four galleys mounted with heavy guns and swivels were stationed at the chevauxdefrise and two new ships were at hand which filled with stones were to be sunk where they would block up the channel a sloop was also at anchor having on board a machine invented by a mr bushnell for submarine explosion with which to blow up the menofwar a favorite scheme with general putnam the obstructions were so commanded by batteries on each shore that it was thought no hostile ship would be able to pass on the 9th of october however the roebuck and phoenix each of fortyfour guns and the tartar of twenty guns which had been lying for some time opposite bloomingdale got under way with their three tenders at eight oclock in the morning and came standing up the river with an easy southern breeze at their approach the galleys and the two ships intended to be sunk got under way with all haste as did a schooner laden with rum sugar and other supplies for the american army and the sloop with bushnells submarine machine  the roebuck phoenix and tartar broke through the vaunted barriers as through a cobweb seven batteries kept up a constant fire upon them yet a gentleman was observed walking the deck of the second ship as coolly as if nothing were the matter the hostile ships kept on their course the american vessels scudding before them the schooner was overhauled and captured a wellaimed shot sent the sloop and bushnells submarine engine to the bottom of the river the two new ships would have taken refuge in spyt den duivel creek but fearing there might not be water enough they kept on and drove ashore at philips mills at yonkers two of the galleys got into a place of safety where they were protected from the shore the other two trusted to outsail their pursuers the breeze freshened and the frigates gained on them fast at eleven oclock began to fire on them with their bowchasers and at twelve oclock overreached them which caused them to bear in shore at halfpast one the galleys ran aground just above dobbs ferry and lay exposed to a shower of grapeshot the crews without stopping to burn or bilge them swam on shore and the enemy took possession of the two galleys  one express after another brought washington word of these occurrences first he sent off a party of rifle and artillery men with two twelvepounders to secure the new ships which had run aground at yonkers next he ordered colonel sargent to march up along the eastern shore with five hundred infantry a troop of lighthorse and a detachment of artillery to prevent the landing of the enemy before the troops arrived at dobbs ferry the ships boats had plundered a store there and set it on fire  to prevent if possible the menofwar already up the river from coming down or others from below joining them washington gave orders to complete the obstructions two hulks which lay in spyt den duivel creek were hastily ballasted by men from general heaths division and men were sent up to get off the ships which had run aground at philips mills that they might be brought down and sunk immediately  this new irruption of hostile ships caused great excitement and alarm it was rumored that bodies of disaffected citizens were organizing in order to assist the enemy and it was feared that these ships were carrying arms and ammunition for these bodies of men and also concealed troops to cooperate with them in overpowering the wellaffected and in seizing upon such passes as would cut off the communication between the army and the upper counties  fugitive river crafts carried the news up to the highlands that the frigates were already before tarrytown in the tappan sea word was instantly despatched to peter r livingston president of the provincial congress and startled that deliberative body which was then seated at fishkill just above the highlands washington ordered up part of the militia from massachusetts under general lincoln as a further precaution an express was sent off to colonel tash who with a regiment of new hampshire militia was on his way from hartford to the camp ordering him to repair with all possible dispatch to fishkill and there hold himself at the disposition of the committee of safety  james clinton also who had charge of the posts in the highlands was put on the alert that trusty officer was now a brigadiergeneral having been promoted by congress on the 8th of august he was charged to have all boats passing up and down the river rigidly searched and the passengers examined beside the usual sentries a barge well manned was to patrol the river opposite to each fort every night all barges rowboats and other small craft between the forts in the highlands and the army were to be secured in a place of safety to prevent their falling into the enemys hands and giving intelligence moreover a french engineer was sent up to aid in strengthening and securing the passes     chapter xxxiv retreat through westchester countybattle of white plains   on the morning of the 12th of october washington received intelligence by express from general heath stationed above kings bridge that the enemy were landing with artillery on throgs neck in the sound about nine miles from the camp washington surmised that howe was pursuing his original plan of getting into the rear of the american army cutting off its supplies which were chiefly derived from the east and interrupting its communication with the main country officers were ordered to their alarm posts and the troops to be ready under arms to act as occasion might require word at the same time was sent to general heath to dispose of the troops on his side of kings bridge and of two militia regiments posted on the banks of harlem river opposite the camp in such manner as he should think necessary having made all his arrangements as promptly as possible washington mounted his horse and rode over towards throgs neck to reconnoitre  throgs neck is a peninsula in westchester county stretching upwards of two miles into the sound it was separated from the mainland by a narrow creek and a marsh and was surrounded by water every high tide a bridge across a creek connecting with a ruined causeway across the marsh led to the mainland and the upper end of the creek was fordable at low water early in the morning eighty or ninety boats full of men had stood up the sound from montresors island and long island and had landed troops to the number of four thousand on throgs point the extremity of the neck thence their advance pushed forward toward the causeway and bridge to secure that pass to the mainland general heath had been too rapid for them colonel hand and his philadelphia riflemen had taken up the planks of the bridge and posted themselves opposite the end of the causeway whence they commenced firing with their rifles they were soon reinforced by colonel prescott of bunkers hill renown with his regiment and lieutenant bryant of the artillery with a threepounder checked at this pass the british moved toward the head of the creek here they found the americans in possession of the ford where they were reinforced by colonel graham of the new york line with his regiment and lieutenant jackson of the artillery with a sixpounder these skilful dispositions of his troops by general heath had brought the enemy to a stand  having surveyed the ground washington ordered works to be thrown up at the passes from the neck to the mainland the british also threw up a work at the end of the causeway in the afternoon nine ships with a great number of schooners sloops and flatbottomed boats full of men passed through hell gate towards throgs point and information received from two deserters gave washington reason to believe that the greater part of the enemys forces were gathering in that quarter general mcdougalls brigade in which were colonel smallwood and the independent companies was sent in the evening to strengthen heaths division at kings bridge and to throw up works opposite the ford of harlem river greene who had heard of the landing of the enemy at throgs neck wrote over to washington from fort constitution informing him that he had three brigades ready to join him if required  on the 14th general lee whose return from the south had been anxiously expected arrived in camp the success of lee at the south was contrasted by many with the defeat on long island and evacuation of new york and they began to consider him the main hope of the army his appearance was welcomed as the harbinger of good luck no one gave him a sincerer greeting than the commanderinchief who diffident of his own military knowledge had a high opinion of that of lee he immediately gave him command of the troops above kings bridge now the greatest part of the army but desired that he would not exercise it for a day or two until he had time to acquaint himself with the localities and arrangements of the post heath in the interim held the command  in the meantime congress on the 11th of october having heard of the ingress of the phoenix roebuck and tartar passed a resolution that general washington be desired if it be practicable by every art and at whatever expensive to obstruct effectually the navigation of the north river between fort washington and mount constitution as well to prevent the regress of the enemys vessels lately gone up as to hinder them from receiving succors  washington held a council of war on the 16th at lees headquarters at which all the majorgenerals were present excepting greene and all the brigadiers as well as colonel knox who commanded the artillery letters from the convention and from individual members of it were read concerning the turbulence of the disaffected in the upper parts of the state intelligence gained from deserters was likewise stated showing the intention of the enemy to surround the camp the policy was then discussed of remaining in their present position on manhattan island and awaiting there the menaced attack  after much consideration and debate says the record of the council the following question was stated whether it having appeared that the obstructions in the north river have proved insufficient and that the enemys whole force is now in our rear on frog point it is now deemed possible in our situation to prevent the enemy from cutting off the communication with the country and compelling us to fight them at all disadvantages or surrender prisoners at discretion all agreed with but one dissenting voice1 that it was not possible to prevent the communication from being cut off and that one of the consequences mentioned in the question must follow  footnote 1 that of general george clinton  as the resolve of congress seemed imperative with regard to fort washington that post it was agreed should be retained as long as possible a strong garrison was accordingly placed in it composed chiefly of troops from magaws and shees pennsylvania regiments the latter under lieutenantcolonel lambert cadwalader of philadelphia shee having obtained leave of absence colonel magaw was put in command of the post and solemnly charged by washington to defend it to the last extremity the name of the opposite post on the jersey shore where greene was stationed was changed from fort constitution to fort lee in honor of the general lee in fact was the military idol of the day  previous to decamping from manhattan island washington formed four divisions of the army which were respectively assigned to generals lee heath sullivan recently obtained in exchange for general prescott and lincoln lee was stationed on valentines hill on the mainland immediately opposite kings bridge to cover the transportation across it of the military stores and heavy baggage the other divisions were to form a chain of fortified posts extending about thirteen miles along a ridge of hills on the west side of the bronx from lees camp up to the village of white plains  washingtons headquarters continued to be on harlem heights for several days by his skilful disposition of the army it was protected in its whole length by the bronx a narrow but deep stream fringed with trees which ran along the foot of the ridge at the same time his troops faced and outflanked the enemy and covered the roads along which the stores and baggage had to be transported on the 21st he shifted his headquarters to valentines hill and on the 23d to white plains where he stationed himself in a fortified camp  while he was thus incessantly in action general now sir william howe remained for six days passive in his camp on throgs point awaiting the arrival of supplies and reinforcements instead of pushing across to the hudson and throwing himself between washingtons army and the upper country his inaction lost him a golden opportunity by the time his supplies arrived the americans had broken up the causeway leading to the mainland and taken positions too strong to be easily forced finding himself headed in this direction sir william reembarked part of his troops in flat boats on the 18th crossed eastchester bay and landed on pells point at the mouth of hutchinsons river here he was joined in a few hours by the main body with the baggage and artillery and proceeded through the manor of pelham towards new rochelle still with a view to get above washingtons army  in their march the british were waylaid and harassed by colonel glover of massachusetts with his own reeds and shepards regiments of infantry twice the british advance guard were thrown into confusion and driven back with severe loss by a sharp fire from behind stone fences a third time they advanced in solid columns the americans gave them repeated volleys and then retreated with the loss of eight killed and thirteen wounded among whom was colonel shepard  on the 21st general howe was encamped about two miles north of new rochelle with his outposts extending to mamaroneck on the sound while in this neighborhood he was reinforced by a second division of hessians under general knyphausen and a regiment of waldeckers both of which had recently arrived in new york he was joined also by the whole of the seventeenth lightdragoons and a part of the sixteenth which had arrived on the 3d instant from ireland with lieutenantcolonel afterwards earl harcourt some of their horses had been brought with them across the sea others had been procured since their arrival  the americans at first regarded these troopers with great dread washington therefore took pains to convince them that in a rough broken country like the present full of stone fences no troops were so inefficient as cavalry they could be waylaid and picked off by sharpshooters from behind walls and thickets while they could not leave the road to pursue their covert foe further to inspirit them against this new enemy he proclaimed in general orders a reward of one hundred dollars for every trooper brought in with his horse and accoutrements and so on in proportion to the completeness of the capture  on the 25th about two oclock in the afternoon intelligence was brought to headquarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on the march within four miles of the camp and the main army following in columns the drums beat to arms the men were ordered to their posts an attack was expected the day passed away however without any demonstration of the enemy howe detached none of his force on lateral expeditions evidently meditating a general engagement to prepare for it washington drew all his troops from the posts along the bronx into the fortified camp at white plains here everything remained quiet but expectant throughout the 26th in the morning of the 27th which was sunday the heavy booming of cannon was heard from a distance seemingly in the direction of fort washington scouts galloped off to gain intelligence we will anticipate their report  two of the british frigates at seven oclock in the morning had moved up the hudson and come to anchor near bourdetts ferry below the morris house washingtons old headquarters apparently with the intention of stopping the ferry and cutting off the communication between fort lee and fort washington at the same time troops made their appearance on harlem plains where lord percy held command colonel morgan immediately manned the lines with troops from the garrison of fort washington the ships opened a fire to enfilade and dislodge them a barbette battery on the cliffs of the jersey shore left of the ferry fired down upon the frigate but with little effect colonel magaw got down an eighteenpounder to the lines near the morris house and fired fifty or sixty rounds two balls at a time two eighteenpounders were likewise brought down from fort lee and planted opposite the ships by the fire from both shores they were hulled repeatedly  it was the thundering of these cannonades which had reached washingtons camp at white plains the ships soon hoisted all sail the foremost slipped her cable and appeared to be in the greatest confusion she could make no way though towed by two boats the other ship seeing her distress sent two barges to her assistance and by the four boats she was dragged out of reach of the american fire her pumps going all the time at the time that the fire from the ships began lord percy brought up his fieldpieces and mortars and made an attack upon the lines he was resolutely answered by the troops sent down from fort washington and several hessians were killed an occasional firing was kept up until evening when the ships fell down the river and the troops which had advanced on harlem plains drew within their lines again  while these things were passing at fort washington lee had struck his tents and with the rear division eight thousand strong the baggage and artillery and a train of wagons four miles long laden with stores and ammunition was lumbering along the rough country roads to join the main army it was not until monday morning after being on the road all night that he arrived at white plains  washingtons camp was situated on high ground facing the east the right wing stretched towards the south along a rocky hill at the foot of which the bronx making an elbow protected it in flank and rear the left wing rested on a small deep lake among the hills the camp was strongly intrenched in front about a quarter of a mile to the right of the camp and separated from the height on which it stood by the bronx and a marshy interval was a corresponding height called chattertons hill as this partly commanded the right flank and as the intervening bend of the bronx was easily passable washington had stationed on its summit a militia regiment  the whole encampment was a temporary one to be changed as soon as the military stores collected there could be removed and now that general lee was arrived washington rode out with him and other general officers who were off duty to reconnoitre a height which appeared more eligible when arrived at it lee pointed to another on the north still more commanding yonder said he is the ground we ought to occupy let us go then and view it replied washington they were gently riding in that direction when a trooper came spurring up his panting horse the british are in the camp sir cried he then gentlemen said washington we have other business to attend to than reconnoitring putting spurs to his horse he set off for the camp at full gallop the others spurring after him  arrived at headquarters he was informed by adjutantgeneral reed that the picket guards had all been driven in and the enemy were advancing but that the whole american army was posted in order of battle apprehensive that the enemy might attempt to get possession of chattertons hill he detached colonel haslet with his delaware regiment to reinforce the militia posted there to these he soon added general mcdougalls brigade composed of smallwoods marylanders ritzemas new yorkers and two other regiments general mcdougall had command of the whole force upon the hill which did not exceed 1600 men  these dispositions were scarcely made when the enemy appeared glistening on the high grounds beyond the village of white plains they advanced in two columns the right commanded by sir henry clinton the left by the hessian general de heister there was also a troop of horse so formidable in the inexperienced eyes of the americans for a time they halted in a wheat field behind a rising ground and the general officers rode up in the centre to hold a consultation washington supposed they were preparing to attack him in front and such indeed was their intention but the commanding height of chattertons hill had caught sir williams eye and he determined first to get possession of it colonel rahl was accordingly detached with a brigade of hessians to make a circuit southwardly round a piece of wood cross the bronx about a quarter of a mile below and ascend the south side of the hill while general leslie with a large force british and hessian should advance directly in front throw a bridge across the stream and charge up the hill  a furious cannonade was now opened by the british from fifteen or twenty pieces of artillery placed on high ground opposite the hill under cover of which the troops of general leslie hastened to construct the bridge in so doing they were severely galled by two fieldpieces planted on a ledge of rock on chattertons hill and in charge of alexander hamilton smallwoods maryland battalion also kept up a sharp fire of small arms as soon as the bridge was finished the british and hessians under leslie rushed over it formed and charged up the hill to take hamiltons two fieldpieces three times the two fieldpieces were discharged ploughing the ascending columns from hilltop to river while smallwoods blue and buff marylanders kept up their volleys of musketry  in the meantime rahl and his hessian brigade forded the bronx lower down pushed up the south side of the hill and endeavored to turn mcdougalls right flank the militia gave the general but little support they had been dismayed at the opening of the engagement by a shot from a british cannon which wounded one of them in the thigh and nearly put the whole to flight it was with the utmost difficulty mcdougall had rallied them and posted them behind a stone wall here they did some service until a troop of british cavalry having gained the crest of the hill came on brandishing their sabres at their first charge the militia gave a random scattering fire then broke and fled in complete confusion  a brave stand was made on the summit of the hill by haslet ritzema and smallwood with their troops twice they repulsed horse and foot british and hessians until cramped for room and greatly outnumbered they slowly and sullenly retreated down the north side of the hill where there was a bridge across the bronx the loss on both sides in this short but severe action was nearly equal that of the americans was between three and four hundred men killed wounded and taken prisoners  the british army now rested with their left wing on the hill they had just taken and which they were busy intrenching they were extending their right wing to the left of the american lines so that their two wings and centre formed nearly a semicircle it was evidently their design to outflank the american camp and get in the rear of it the day however being far advanced was suffered to pass without any further attack but the morrow was looked forward to for a deadly conflict  during this anxious night washington was assiduously occupied throwing back his right wing to stronger ground doubling his intrenchments and constructing three redoubts with a line in front on the summit of his post these works were principally intended for defence against small arms and were thrown up with a rapidity that to the enemy must have savored of magic they were in fact made of the stalks of indian corn or maize taken from a neighboring cornfield and pulled up with the earth clinging in masses to the large roots the roots of the stalks says heath and earth on them placed in the face of the works answered the purpose of sods and fascines the tops being placed inwards as the loose earth was thrown upon them became as so many trees to the work which was carried up with a despatch scarcely conceivable  on the morning of the 29th when howe beheld how greatly washington had improved his position and strengthened it by what appeared to be solidly constructed works he postponed his meditated assault ordered up lord percy from harlem with the fourth brigade and two battalions of the sixth and proceeded to throw up lines and redoubts in front of the american camp as if preparing to cannonade it as the enemy were endeavoring to outflank him especially on his right wing washington apprehended one of their objects might be to advance a part of their force and seize on pines bridge over croton river which would cut off his communication with the upper country general beall with three maryland regiments was sent off with all expedition to secure that pass it was washingtons idea that having possession of croton river and the passes in the highlands his army would be safe from further pursuit and have time to repose after its late excessive fatigue and would be fresh and ready to harass the enemy should they think fit to winter up the country  on the night of the 31st washington shifted his whole position set fire to the barns and outhouses containing forage and stores which there was no time to remove and leaving a strong rearguard on the heights and in the neighboring woods retired with his main army a distance of five miles among the high rocky hills about northcastle here he immediately set to work to intrench and fortify himself general howe did not attempt to dislodge him from this fastness he at one time ordered an attack on the rearguard but a violent rain prevented it and for two or three days he remained seemingly inactive during the night of the 4th this quiet was interrupted a mysterious sound was heard in the direction of the british camp like the rumbling of wagons and artillery at daybreak the meaning of it was discovered the enemy were decamping long trains were observed defiling across the hilly country along the roads leading to dobbs ferry on the hudson the movement continued for three successive days until their whole force british and hessians disappeared from white plains     chapter xxxv washington at peekskillthe northern army   various were the speculations at headquarters on the sudden movement of the enemy washington writes to general william livingston now governor of the jerseys they have gone towards the north river and kings bridge some suppose they are going into winter quarters and will sit down in new york without doing more than investing fort washington i cannot subscribe wholly to this opinion myself that they will invest fort washington is a matter of which there can be no doubt and i think there is a strong probability that general howe will detach a part of his force to make an incursion into the jerseys provided he is going to new york he must attempt something on account of his reputation for what has he done as yet with his great army  in the same letter he expressed his determination as soon as it should appear that the present manoeuvre was a real retreat and not a feint to throw over a body of troops into the jerseys to assist in checking howes progress in a letter of the same date he charged general greene should howe invest fort washington with part of his force to give the garrison all possible assistance on the following day nov 8 colonel tilghman writes to general greene from headquarters the enemy are at dobbs ferry with a great number of boats ready to go into jersey or proceed up the river greene doubted any intention of the enemy to cross the river it might only be a feint to mislead still as a precaution he had ordered troops up from the flying camp and was posting them opposite dobbs ferry and at other passes where a landing might be attempted the whole being under the command of general mercer  affairs at fort washington soon settled the question of the enemys intention with regard to it lord percy took his station with a body of troops before the lines to the south knyphausen advanced on the north the americans had previously abandoned fort independence burnt its barracks and removed the stores and cannon crossing kings bridge knyphausen took a position between it and fort washington the approach to the fort on this side was exceedingly steep and rocky as indeed were all its approaches excepting that on the south where the country was more open and the ascent gradual the fort could not hold within its walls above one thousand men the rest of the troops were distributed about the lines and outworks while the fort was thus menaced the chevauxdefrise had again proved inefficient on the night of the 5th a frigate and two transports bound up to dobbs ferry with supplies for howes army had broken through though according to greenes account not without being considerably shattered by the batteries  informed of these facts washington wrote to greene on the 8th if we cannot prevent vessels from passing up the river and the enemy are possessed of all the surrounding country what valuable purpose can it answer to hold a post from which the expected benefit cannot be had i am therefore inclined to think that it will not be prudent to hazard the men and stores at mount washington but as you are on the spot i leave it to you to give such orders as to evacuating mount washington as you may judge best and so far revoking the orders given to colonel magaw to defend it to the last  accounts had been received at headquarters of a considerable movement on the preceding evening nov 7th among the enemys boats at dobbs ferry with the intention it was said of penetrating the jerseys and falling down upon fort lee washington therefore in the same letter directed greene to have all the stores not necessary to the defence removed immediately greene in reply nov 9th adhered with tenacity to the policy of maintaining fort washington the enemy said he must invest it with double the number of men required for its defence they must keep troops at kings bridge to cut off all communication with the country and in considerable force for fear of an attack  it is doubtful when or where washington received this letter as he left the camp at northcastle at eleven oclock on the following morning there being still considerable uncertainty as to the intentions of the enemy all his arrangements were made accordingly all the troops belonging to the states west of the hudson were to be stationed in the jerseys under command of general putnam lord stirling had already been sent forward with the maryland and virginia troops to peekskill to cross the river at kings ferry another division composed of connecticut and massachusetts troops under general heath was to cooperate with the brigade of new york militia under general george clinton in securing the highland posts on both sides of the river the troops which would remain at northcastle after the departure of heath and his division were to be commanded by lee  on the 10th of november washington left the camp at northcastle at 11 oclock and arrived at peekskill at sunset whither general heath with his division had preceded him by a few hours lord stirling was there likewise having effected the transportation of the maryland and virginia troops across the river and landed them at the ferry south of stony point though a better landing was subsequently found north of the point his lordship had thrown out a scouting party in the advance and a hundred men to take possession of a gap in the mountain through which a road passed toward the jerseys washington was now at the entrance of the highlands that grand defile of the hudson the object of so much precaution and solicitude on the following morning accompanied by generals heath stirling james and george clinton mifflin and others he made a military visit in boats to the highland posts fort montgomery was in a considerable state of forwardness and a work in the vicinity was projected to cooperate with it fort constitution commanded a sudden bend of the river but lord stirling in his report of inspection had intimated that the fort itself was commanded by west point opposite a glance of the eye without going on shore was sufficient to convince washington of the fact a fortress subsequently erected on that point has been considered the key of the highlands  on the morning of the 12th at an early hour washington rode out with general heath to reconnoitre the east side of the hudson at the gorge of the highlands henry wisner in a report to the new york convention had mentioned a hill to the north of peekskill so situated with the road winding along the side of it that ten men on the top by rolling down stones might prevent ten thousand from passing near robinsons bridge in this vicinity about two miles from peekskill washington chose a place where troops should be stationed to cover the south entrance into the mountains and here afterwards was established an important military depot called continental village having made all these surveys and arrangements he placed heath in the general command of the highlands with written instructions to fortify the passes with all possible despatch and directions how the troops were to be distributed on both sides of the river  during his brief and busy sojourn at peekskill washington received important intelligence from the northern army especially that part of it on lake champlain under the command of general gates the preparations for the defence of ticonderoga and the nautical service on the lake had met with difficulties at every step at length by the middle of august a small flotilla was completed and the command given by gates to arnold in compliance with the advice of washington  sir guy carleton in the meantime was straining every nerve for the approaching conflict vessels were brought from england in pieces and put together at st johns boats of various kinds and sizes were transported over land or dragged up the rapids of the sorel in despite of every exertion three months elapsed before his armament was completed by the month of october between twenty and thirty sail were afloat and ready for action the flagship the inflexible mounted eighteen twelvepounders the rest were gunboats a gondola and a flatbottomed vessel called a radeau and named the thunderer carrying a battery of six twentyfour and twelve sixpounders besides howitzers the gunboats mounted brass fieldpieces and howitzers captain pringle conducted the armament but sir guy carleton was too full of zeal and too anxious for the event not to head the enterprise he accordingly took his station on the deck of the flagship they made sail early in october in quest of the american squadron which was said to be abroad upon the lake arnold had taken his post under cover of valcour island in the channel between that island and the mainland the british discovered arnolds flotilla on the morning of the 11th and attempted to beat up into the channel the wind did not permit the largest of them to enter about twelve oclock a brisk fire was opened on the american vessels and the action soon became severe and sanguinary the enemy landed indians on the island who kept up a galling fire upon the americans the congress on board of which was arnold was hulled several times and many of her crew were killed or wounded the ardor of arnold increased with the danger he cheered on his men by voice and example often pointing the guns with his own hands at night the contest was still undecided and the enemy drew off anchoring their whole squadron in a line to prevent the escape of the americans but arnold aware that with his crippled and inferior force further resistance could not be maintained took advantage of a dark cloudy night and a strong north wind to slip silently through the enemys line without being discovered the next day arnolds galley the congress the washington galley and four gondolas which had suffered severely in the fight fell astern and on the following morning as a fog which had covered the lake lifted the enemy were discerned within a few miles of them in full chase by noon the washington was overtaken and captured arnold meanwhile maintained a desperate running fight with the advanced vessels of the enemys fleet until finding resistance in vain the crippled vessels were run on shore fired and the crews set off through the woods to crown point two schooners two galleys one sloop and one gondola the remnant which had escaped of this squadron were at anchor at the point and general waterbury and most of his men who had been captured in the washington galley arrived there the next day on parole seeing that the place must soon fall into the hands of the enemy they set fire to the houses destroyed everything they could not carry away and embarking in the vessels made sail for ticonderoga the loss of the americans in these two actions is said to have been between eighty and ninety men that of the british about forty the conduct of arnold in these naval affairs gained him new laurels  sir guy carleton took possession of the ruined works at crown point where he was soon joined by the army he made several movements by land and water as if meditating an attack upon ticonderoga general gates in the meantime strengthened his works with incessant assiduity and made every preparation for an obstinate defence a strong easterly wind prevented the enemys ships from advancing to attack the lines and gave time for the arrival of reinforcements of militia to the garrison it also afforded time for sir guy carleton to cool in ardor and calculate the chances and the value of success the post from its strength could not be taken without great loss of life if taken the season was now too far advanced to think of passing lake george and exposing the army to the perils of a winter campaign in the inhospitable and impracticable wilds to the southward ticonderoga too could not be kept during the winter so that the only result of the capture would be the reduction of the works and the taking of some cannon all which damage the americans could remedy before the opening of the summer campaign if however the defence should be obstinate the british army even if successful might sustain a loss sufficient to cripple its operations in the coming year these and other prudential reasons induced carleton to give up all attempt upon the fortress at present wherefore reembarking his troops he returned to st johns and cantoned them in canada for the winter     chapter xxxvi capture of fort washington and garrisonretreat through new jersey   on the morning of the 12th of november washington crossed the hudson to the ferry below stony point with the residue of the troops destined for the jerseys far below were to be descried the phoenix the roebuck and the tartar at anchor in the broad waters of haverstraw bay and the tappan sea guarding the lower ferries the army thus shut out from the nearer passes was slowly winding its way by a circuitous route through the gap in the mountains which lord stirling had secured leaving the troops which had just landed to pursue the same route to the hackensack washington accompanied by colonel reed struck a direct course for fort lee being anxious about affairs at fort washington he arrived there on the following day and found to his disappointment that general greene had taken no measures for the evacuation of that fortress but on the contrary had reinforced it with a part of colonel durkees regiment and the regiment of colonel rawlings so that its garrison now numbered upwards of two thousand men a great part however were militia washingtons orders for its evacuation had in fact been discretionary leaving the execution of them to greenes judgment as being on the spot the latter had differed in opinion as to the policy of such a measure and colonel magaw who had charge of the fortress was likewise confident it might be maintained the fort was now invested on all sides but one and the troops under howe which had been encamped at dobbs ferry were said to be moving down toward it  illustration view from the site of fort washington vol ii  washington was much perplexed the main object of howe was still a matter of doubt with him he could not think that sir william was moving his whole force upon that fortress to invest which a part would be sufficient he suspected an ulterior object probably a southern expedition as he was told a large number of ships were taking in wood and water at new york he resolved therefore to continue a few days in this neighborhood during which he trusted the designs of the enemy would be more apparent in the meantime he would distribute troops at brunswick amboy elizabethtown and fort lee so as to be ready at these various points to check any incursions into the jerseys  washington was mistaken in his conjecture as to sir william howes design the capture of fort washington was at present his main object and he was encamped on fordham heights not far from kings bridge until preliminary steps should be taken in the night of the 14th thirty flatbottomed boats stole quietly up the hudson passed the american forts undiscovered and made their way through spyt den duivel creek into harlem river the means were thus provided for crossing that river and landing before unprotected parts of the american works  apprised by colonel magaw of his peril general greene sent over reinforcements with an exhortation to him to persist in his defence and despatched an express to washington who was at hackensack where the troops which had crossed from peekskill were encamped it was nightfall when washington arrived at fort lee greene and putnam were over at the besieged fortress he threw himself into a boat and had partly crossed the river when he met those generals returning they informed him of the garrisons having been reinforced and assured him that it was in high spirits and capable of making a good defence it was with difficulty however they could prevail on him to return with them to the jersey shore for he was excessively excited  early the next morning 16th magaw made his dispositions for the expected attack his forces with the recent addition amounted to nearly three thousand men as the fort could not contain above a third of that number most of them were stationed about the outworks colonel lambert cadwalader with eight hundred pennsylvanians was posted in the outer lines about two miles and a half south of the fort the side menaced by lord percy with sixteen hundred men colonel rawlings of maryland with a body of troops many of them riflemen was stationed by a threegun battery on a rocky precipitous hill north of the fort and between it and spyt den duivel creek colonel baxter of bucks county pennsylvania with his regiment of militia was posted east of the fort on rough woody heights bordering the harlem river to watch the motions of the enemy who had thrown up redoubts on high and commanding ground on the opposite side of the river apparently to cover the crossing and landing of troops  sir william howe had planned four simultaneous attacks one on the north by knyphausen who was encamped on the york side of kings bridge within cannon shot of fort washington but separated from it by high and rough hills covered with almost impenetrable woods he was to advance in two columns formed by detachments made from the hessians of his corps the brigade of rahl and the regiment of waldeckers the second attack was to be by two battalions of light infantry and two battalions of guards under brigadiergeneral mathew who was to cross harlem river in flatboats under cover of the redoubts above mentioned and to land on the right of the fort this attack was to be supported by the first and second grenadiers and a regiment of light infantry under command of lord cornwallis the third attack intended as a feint to distract the attention of the americans was to be by colonel sterling with the 42d regiment who was to drop down the harlem river in bateaux to the left of the american lines facing new york the fourth attack was to be on the south by lord percy with the english and hessian troops under his command on the right flank of the american intrenchments  about noon a heavy cannonade thundering along the rocky hills and sharp volleys of musketry proclaimed that the action was commenced knyphausens division was pushing on from the north in two columns as had been arranged the right was led by colonel rahl the left by himself rahl essayed to mount a steep broken height called cock hill which rises from spyt den duivel creek and was covered with woods knyphausen undertook a hill rising from the kings bridge road but soon found himself entangled in a woody defile difficult to penetrate and where his hessians were exposed to the fire of the threegun battery and rawlings riflemen  while this was going on at the north of the fort general mathew with his light infantry and guards crossed the harlem river in the flatboats under cover of a heavy fire from the redoubts he made good his landing after being severely handled by baxter and his men from behind rocks and trees and the breastworks thrown up on the steep river bank a short contest ensued baxter while bravely encouraging his men was killed by a british officer his troops overpowered by numbers retreated to the fort general mathew now pushed on with his guards and light infantry to cut off cadwalader that officer had gallantly defended the lines against the attack of lord percy until informed that colonel sterling was dropping down harlem river in bateaux to flank the lines and take him in the rear he sent off a detachment to oppose his landing they did it manfully about ninety of sterlings men were killed or wounded in their boats but he persevered landed and forced his way up a steep height which was well defended gained the summit forced a redoubt and took nearly two hundred prisoners thus doubly assailed cadwalader was obliged to retreat to the fort he was closely pursued by percy with his english troops and hessians but turned repeatedly on his pursuers thus he fought his way to the fort with the loss of several killed and more taken prisoners but marking his track by the number of hessians slain  the defence on the north side of the fort was equally obstinate and unsuccessful rawlings with his maryland riflemen and the aid of the threegun battery had for some time kept the left column of hessians and waldeckers under knyphausen at bay at length colonel rahl with the right column of the division having forced his way directly up the north side of the steep hill at spyt den duivel creek came upon rawlings men whose rifles from frequent discharges had become foul and almost useless drove them from their strong post and followed them until within a hundred yards of the fort where he was joined by knyphausen who had slowly made his way through dense forest and over felled trees here they took post behind a large stone house and sent in a flag with a summons to surrender  washington had been an anxious spectator of the battle from the opposite side of the hudson the action about the lines to the south lay open to him when he saw cadwalader assailed in flank the line broken and his troops overpowered by numbers he gave up the game as lost seeing the flag from knyphausens division go into the fort he wrote a note to magaw telling him that if he could hold out until evening and the place could not be maintained he would endeavor to bring off the garrison captain gooch offered to be the bearer of the note he crossed in a small boat landed on the bank ran up to the fort and delivered the message it came too late the fort was so crowded by the garrison and the troops which had retreated into it that it was difficult to move about the enemy too were in possession of the little redoubts around and could have poured in showers of shells and ricochet balls that would have made dreadful slaughter it was no longer possible for magaw to get his troops to man the lines he was compelled therefore to yield himself and his garrison prisoners of war the only terms granted them were that the men should retain their baggage and the officers their swords  the sight of the american flag hauled down and the british flag waving in its place told washington of the surrender his instant care was for the safety of the upper country now that the lower defences of the hudson were at an end before he knew anything about the terms of capitulation he wrote to general lee informing him of the surrender and calling his attention to the passes of the highlands and those which lay east of the river begging him to have such measures adopted for their defence as his judgment should suggest to be necessary lee in reply objected to removing from his actual encampment at northcastle it would give us said he the air of being frightened it would expose a fine fertile country to their ravages and i must add that we are as secure as we could be in any position whatever after stating that he should deposit his stores etc in a place fully as safe and more central than peekskill he adds as to ourselves light as we are several retreats present themselves in short if we keep a good lookout we are in no danger but i must entreat your excellency to enjoin the officers posted at fort lee to give us the quickest intelligence if they observe any embarkation on the north river as to the affair of fort washington all that lee observed on the subject was oh general why would you be overpersuaded by men of inferior judgment to your own it was a cursed affair1  footnote 1 colonel reed in a letter to general lee at this juncture had allowed himself notwithstanding the devotion he had hitherto manifested for the commanderinchief to express himself with great critical freedom on the loss of fort lee after alluding to the fact that washingtons own judgment was averse to the attempt of holding the fort but that greenes advice to the contrary had kept his mind in a state of suspense he exclaims oh general an indecisive mind is one of the greatest misfortunes that can befall an army how often have i lamented it this campaign some days later a letter from general lee came to headquarters addressed to colonel reed who at the time was absent washington supposing it to be on official business opened it as he was in the habit of doing on like occasions to his surprise he discovered it to be a private note the tenor of which indicated that he was the subject of critical correspondence between a member of his military family and one of his generals he immediately enclosed the letter to colonel reed explaining how it had been opened but without further comment reed endeavored to explain away the remarks in lees letter but washingtons affectionate confidence in him as a sympathizing friend had received a severe wound reed deeply grieved over the error he had committed and his earnest appeals to washington at a later date restored in a great measure their relations of friendly confidence  with the capture of fort washington the project of obstructing the navigation of the hudson at that point was at an end fort lee consequently became useless and washington ordered all the ammunition and stores to be removed preparatory to its abandonment this was effected with the whole of the ammunition and a part of the stores and every exertion was making to hurry off the remainder when early in the morning of the 20th intelligence was brought that the enemy with two hundred boats had crossed the river and landed a few miles above general greene immediately ordered the garrison under arms sent out troops to hold the enemy in check and sent off an express to washington at hackensack  the enemy had crossed the hudson on a very rainy night in two divisions one diagonally upward from kings bridge landing on the west side about eight oclock the other marched up the east bank three or four miles and then crossed to the opposite shore the whole corps six thousand strong and under the command of lord cornwallis were landed with their cannon by ten oclock at a place called closter dock five or six miles above fort lee and under that line of lofty and perpendicular cliffs known as the palisades the seamen says sir william howe distinguished themselves remarkably on this occasion by their readiness to drag the cannon up a very narrow road for nearly half a mile to the top of a precipice which bounds the shore for some miles on the west side  washington arrived at the fort in three quarters of an hour being told that the enemy were extending themselves across the country he at once saw that they intended to form a line from the hudson to the hackensack and hem the whole garrison in between the two rivers nothing would save it but a prompt retreat to secure the bridge over the hackensack no time was to be lost the troops sent out to check the enemy were recalled the retreat commenced in all haste there was a want of horses and wagons a great quantity of baggage stores and provisions therefore was abandoned so was all the artillery excepting two twelvepounders even the tents were left standing and campkettles on the fire with all their speed they did not reach the hackensack river before the vanguard of the enemy was close upon them expecting a brush the greater part hurried over the bridge others crossed at the ferry and some higher up the enemy however did not dispute the passage of the river  from hackensack colonel grayson one of washingtons aidesdecamp wrote instantly by his orders to general lee informing him that the enemy had crossed into the jerseys and as was reported in great numbers his excellency adds grayson thinks it would be advisable in you to remove the troops under your command on this side of the north river and there wait for further commands  at hackensack the army did not exceed three thousand men and they were dispirited by ill success and the loss of tents and baggage they were without intrenching tools in a flat country where there were no natural fastnesses washington resolved therefore to avoid any attack from the enemy though by so doing he must leave a fine and fertile region open to their ravages or a plentiful storehouse from which they would draw voluntary supplies a second move was necessary again to avoid the danger of being enclosed between two rivers leaving three regiments therefore to guard the passes of the hackensack and serve as covering parties he again decamped and threw himself on the west bank of the passaic in the neighborhood of newark  his army small as it was would soon be less the term of enlistment of those under general mercer from the flying camp was nearly expired and it was not probable that disheartened as they were by defeats and losses exposed to inclement weather and unaccustomed to military hardships they would longer forego the comforts of their homes to drag out the residue of a ruinous campaign in addition too to the superiority of the force that was following him the rivers gave the enemy facilities by means of their shipping to throw troops in his rear in this extremity he cast about in every direction for assistance colonel reed was despatched to burlington with a letter to governor william livingston describing his hazardous situation and entreating him to call out a portion of the new jersey militia and general mifflin was sent to philadelphia to implore immediate aid from congress and the local authorities  his main reliance for prompt assistance however was upon lee on the 24th came a letter from that general addressed to colonel reed washington opened it as he was accustomed to do in the absence of that officer with letters addressed to him on the business of the army lee was at his old encampment at northcastle he had no means he said of crossing at dobbs ferry and the round by kings ferry would be so great that he could not get there in time to answer any purpose i have therefore added he ordered general heath who is close to the only ferry which can be passed to detach two thousand men to apprise his excellency and await his further orders a mode which i flatter myself will answer better what i conceive to be the spirit of the orders than should i move the corps from hence withdrawing our troops from hence would be attended with some very serious consequences which at present would be tedious to enumerate as to myself adds he i hope to set out tomorrow  on the following day he writes to washington i have received your orders and shall endeavor to put them in execution but question whether i shall be able to carry with me any considerable number not so much from a want of zeal in the men as from their wretched condition with respect to shoes stockings and blankets which the present bad weather renders more intolerable i sent heath orders to transport two thousand men across the river apprise the general and wait for further orders but that great man as i might have expected intrenched himself within the letter of his instructions and refused to part with a single file though i undertook to replace them with a part of my own  scarce had lee sent this letter when he received one from washington informing him that he had mistaken his views in regard to the troops required to cross the hudson it was his lees division that he wanted to have over the force under heath must remain to guard the posts and passes through the highlands the importance of which was so infinitely great that there should not be the least possible risk of losing them lees reply explained that his idea of detaching troops from heaths division was merely for expeditions sake intending to replace them from his own the want of carriages and other causes had delayed him from the force of the enemy remaining in westchester county he did not conceive the number of them in the jerseys to be near so great as washington was taught to believe he had been making a sweep of the country to clear it of the tories part of his army had now moved on and he would set out on the following day  the situation of the little army was daily becoming more perilous in a council of war several of the members urged a move to morristown to form a junction with the troops expected from the northern army washington however still cherished the idea of making a stand at brunswick on the raritan or at all events of disputing the passage of the delaware and in this intrepid resolution he was warmly seconded by greene breaking up his camp once more therefore he continued his retreat towards new brunswick but so close was cornwallis upon him that his advance entered one end of newark just as the american rearguard had left the other  from brunswick washington wrote on the 29th to william livingston governor of the jerseys requesting him to have all boats and river craft for seventy miles along the delaware removed to the western bank out of the reach of the enemy and put under guard he was disappointed in his hope of making a stand on the banks of the raritan all the force he could muster at brunswick including the new jersey militia did not exceed four thousand men colonel reed had failed in procuring aid from the new jersey legislature that body shifting from place to place was on the eve of dissolution the term of the maryland and new jersey troops in the flying camp had expired general mercer endeavored to detain them representing the disgrace of turning their back upon the cause when the enemy was at hand his remonstrances were fruitless as to the pennsylvania levies they deserted in such numbers that guards were stationed on the roads and ferries to intercept them  washington lingered at brunswick until the 1st of december in the vain hope of being reinforced the enemy in the meantime advanced through the country impressing wagons and horses and collecting cattle and sheep as if for a distant march at length their vanguard appeared on the opposite side of the raritan washington immediately broke down the end of the bridge next the village and after nightfall resumed his retreat at princeton washington left twelve hundred men in two brigades under lord stirling and general adam stephen to cover the country and watch the motions of the enemy stephen was the same officer that had served as a colonel under washington in the french war as second in command of the virginia troops and had charge of fort cumberland  the harassed army reached trenton on the 2d of december washington immediately proceeded to remove his baggage and stores across the delaware in his letters from this place to the president of congress he gives his reasons for his continued retreat nothing but necessity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave so much of the jerseys unprotected sorry am i to observe that the frequent calls upon the militia of this state the want of exertion in the principal gentlemen of the country and a fatal supineness and insensibility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreseen but foretold have been the causes of our late disgraces  in excuse for the people of new jersey it may be observed that they inhabited an open agricultural country where the sound of war had never been heard many of them looked upon the revolution as rebellion others thought it a ruined enterprise the armies engaged in it had been defeated and broken up they beheld the commanderinchief retreating through their country with a handful of men weary wayworn and dispirited without tents without clothing many of them barefooted exposed to wintry weather and driven from post to post by a wellclad wellfed triumphant force tricked out in all the glittering bravery of war could it be wondered at that peaceful husbandmen seeing their quiet fields thus suddenly overrun by adverse hosts and their very hearthstones threatened with outrage should instead of flying to arms seek for the safety of their wives and little ones and the protection of their humble means from the desolation which too often marks the course even of friendly armies  lord howe and his brother sought to profit by this dismay and despondency a proclamation dated 30th of november commanded all persons in arms against his majestys government to disband and return home and all congresses to desist from treasonable acts offering a free pardon to all who should comply within fifty days many who had been prominent in the cause hastened to take advantage of this proclamation those who had most property to lose were the first to submit the middle ranks remained generally steadfast in this time of trial  in this dark day of peril to the cause and to himself washington remained firm and undaunted in casting about for some stronghold where he might make a desperate stand for the liberties of his country his thoughts reverted to the mountain regions of his early campaigns general mercer was at hand who had shared his perils among these mountains and his presence may have contributed to bring them to his mind what think you said washington if we should retreat to the back parts of pennsylvania would the pennsylvanians support us if the lower counties give up the back counties will do the same was the discouraging reply  we must then retire to augusta county in virginia said washington numbers will repair to us for safety and we will try a predatory war if overpowered we must cross the alleghanies such was the indomitable spirit rising under difficulties and buoyant in the darkest moment that kept our tempesttost cause from foundering     chapter xxxvii retreat across the delawarebattle of trenton   notwithstanding the repeated and pressing orders and entreaties of the commanderinchief lee did not reach peekskill until the 30th of november in a letter of that date to washington who had complained of his delay he simply alleged difficulties which he would explain when both had leisure it was not until the 4th of december that lee crossed the hudson and began a laggard march though aware of the imminent peril of washington and his armyhow different from the celerity of his movements in his expedition to the south lee evidently considered washingtons star in the decline and his own in the ascendant the loss of fort washington had been made a text by him to comment in his letters about the indecision of the commanderinchief instead now of heartily cooperating with washington he was devising sideplans of his own and meditating no doubt on his chances of promotion to the head of the american armies  in the meantime washington who was at trenton had profited by a delay of the enemy at brunswick and removed most of the stores and baggage of the army across the delaware and being reinforced by fifteen hundred of the pennsylvania militia procured by mifflin prepared to face about and march back to princeton with such of his troops as were fit for service there to be governed by circumstances and the movements of general lee accordingly on the 5th of december he sent about twelve hundred men in the advance to reinforce lord stirling and the next day set off himself with the residue while on the march washington received a letter from greene who was at princeton informing him of a report that lee was at the heels of the enemy i should think adds greene he had better keep on the flanks than the rear unless it were possible to concert an attack at the same instant of time in front and rear i think general lee must be confined within the lines of some general plan or else his operations will be independent of yours lee had no idea of conforming to a general plan he had an independent plan of his own and was at that moment at pompton indulging speculations on military greatness and the lamentable want of it in his american contemporaries  while lee was thus loitering and speculating cornwallis knowing how far he was in the rear and how weak was the situation of washingtons army and being himself strongly reinforced made a forced march from brunswick and was within two miles from princeton stirling to avoid being surrounded immediately set out with two brigades for trenton washington too receiving intelligence by express of these movements hastened back to that place and caused boats to be collected from all quarters and the stores and troops transported across the delaware he himself crossed with the rearguard on sunday morning and took up his quarters about a mile from the river causing the boats to be destroyed and troops to be posted opposite the fords  the rearguard says an american account had barely crossed the river when lord cornwallis came marching down with all the pomp of war in great expectation of getting boats and immediately pursuing not one was to be had there or elsewhere for washington had caused the boats for an extent of seventy miles up and down the river to be secured on the right bank his lordship was effectually brought to a stand he made some moves with two columns as if he would cross the delaware above and below either to push on to philadelphia or to entrap washington in the acute angle made by the bend of the river opposite bordentown an able disposition of american troops along the upper part of the river and of a number of galleys below discouraged any attempt of the kind cornwallis therefore gave up the pursuit distributed the german troops in cantonments along the left bank of the river and stationed his main force at brunswick trusting to be able before long to cross the delaware on the ice  on the 8th washington wrote to the president of congress there is not a moments time to be lost in assembling such a force as can be collected as the object of the enemy cannot now be doubted in the smallest degree indeed i shall be out in my conjecture for it is only conjecture if the late embarkation at new york is not for delaware river to cooperate with the army under general howe who i am informed from good authority is with the british troops and his whole force upon this route  in further letters to lee washington urged the peril of philadelphia do come on writes he your arrival may be fortunate and if it can be effected without delay it may be the means of preserving a city whose loss must prove of the most fatal consequence to the cause of america putnam was now detached to take command of philadelphia and put it in a state of defence and general mifflin to have charge of the munitions of war deposited there by their advice congress hastily adjourned on the 12th of december to meet again on the 20th at baltimore  washingtons whole force at this time was about five thousand five hundred men gates however he was informed was coming on with seven regiments detached by schuyler from the northern department reinforced by these and the troops under lee he hoped to be able to attempt a stroke upon the enemys forces which lay a good deal scattered and to all appearances in a state of security  while cheering himself with these hopes and trusting to speedy aid from lee that wayward commander though nearly three weeks had elapsed since he had received washingtons orders and entreaties to join him with all possible despatch was no farther on his march than morristown in the jerseys where with militia recruits his force was about four thousand men lee was secretly planning an independent attack on the enemy hearing that three regiments detached under gates from the northern army had arrived at peekskill he sent orders for them to join him at morristown i am in hopes he writes to reconquer the jerseys in the meantime washington wrote urging his speedy junction with him boats were gathered at tinicum to facilitate his passage across the delaware i have so frequently wrote washington mentioned our situation and the necessity of your aid that it is painful for me to add a word on the subject on the 12th lee moved from morristown but marched no further than vealtown eight miles distant there he left sullivan with his troops while he took up his quarters three miles off at a tavern at baskingridge intelligence of his exposed and insecure position reached the enemy a body of dragoons were detached and guided by a tory came upon lee in his quarters without warning the few guards about the house were soon dispersed and lee bareheaded and in his slippers was compelled in haste to mount a horse and accompany his captors this capture gave great exultation to the enemy for they considered lee the most scientific and experienced of the rebel generals general sullivan now being in command immediately pressed forward with the troops to join the commanderinchief  the loss of lee was a severe shock to the americans many of whom as we have shown looked to him as the man who was to rescue them from their critical and wellnigh desperate situation general wilkinson in his memoirs who was at that time brigademajor under general gates points out what he considers the true secret of lees conduct his military reputation originally very high had been enhanced of late by its being generally known that he had been opposed to the occupation of fort washington while the fall of that fortress and other misfortunes of the campaign though beyond the control of the commanderinchief had quickened the discontent which according to wilkinson had been generated against him at cambridge and raised a party against him in congress it was confidently asserted at the time adds he but is not worthy of credit that a motion had been made in that body tending to supersede him in the command of the army in this temper of the times if general lee had anticipated general washington in cutting the cordon of the enemy between new york and the delaware the commanderinchief would probably have been superseded in this case lee would have succeeded him  what an unfortunate change would it have been for the country lee was undoubtedly a man of brilliant talents shrewd sagacity and much knowledge and experience in the art of war but he was wilful and uncertain in his temper selfindulgent in his habits and an egoist in warfare boldly dashing for a soldiers glory rather than warily acting for a countrys good he wanted those great moral qualities which in addition to military capacity inspired such universal confidence in the wisdom rectitude and patriotism of washington enabling him to direct and control legislative bodies as well as armies to harmonize the jarring passions and jealousies of a wide and imperfect confederacy and to cope with the varied exigencies of the revolution  congress prior to their adjournment had resolved that until they should otherwise order general washington should be possessed of all power to order and direct all things relative to the department and to the operations of war thus empowered he proceeded immediately to recruit three battalions of artillery to those whose terms were expiring he promised an augmentation of twentyfive per cent upon their pay and a bounty of ten dollars to the men for six weeks service it was no time he said to stand upon expense nor in matters of selfevident exigency to refer to congress at the distance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles if any good officers will offer to raise men upon continental pay and establishment in this quarter i shall encourage them to do so and regiment them when they have done it  the promise of increased pay and bounties had kept together for a time the dissolving army the local militia began to turn out freely colonel john cadwalader a gentleman of gallant spirit and cultivated mind and manners brought a large volunteer detachment well equipped and composed principally of philadelphia troops washington who held cadwalader in high esteem assigned him an important station at bristol with colonel reed who was his intimate friend as an associate they had it in charge to keep a watchful eye upon count donops hessians who were cantoned along the opposite shore from bordentown to the black horse  on the 20th of december arrived general sullivan in camp with the troops recently commanded by the unlucky lee they were in a miserable plight destitute of almost everything many of them fit only for the hospital and those whose terms were nearly out thinking of nothing but their discharge on the same day arrived general gates with the remnants of four regiments from the northern army  the time seemed now propitious for the coup de main which washington had of late been meditating everything showed careless confidence on the part of the enemy howe was in winter quarters at new york his troops were loosely cantoned about the jerseys from the delaware to brunswick so that they could not readily be brought to act in concert on a sudden alarm the hessians were in the advance stationed along the delaware facing the american lines which were along the west bank cornwallis thinking his work accomplished had obtained leave of absence and was likewise at new york preparing to embark for england washington had now between five and six thousand men fit for service with these he meditated to cross the river at night at different points and make simultaneous attacks upon the hessian advance posts  he calculated upon the eager support of his troops who were burning to revenge the outrages on their homes and families committed by these foreign mercenaries they considered the hessians mere hirelings slaves to a petty despot fighting for sordid pay and actuated by no sentiment of patriotism or honor they had rendered themselves the horror of the jerseys by rapine brutality and heartlessness at first their military discipline had inspired awe but of late they had become careless and unguarded knowing the broken and dispirited state of the americans and considering them incapable of any offensive enterprise a brigade of three hessian regiments those of rahl lossberg and knyphausen was stationed at trenton colonel rahl had the command of the post at his own solicitation and in consequence of the laurels he had gained at white plains and fort washington we have before us journals of two hessian lieutenants and a corporal which give graphic particulars of the colonel and his post according to their representations he with all his bravery was little fitted for such an important command he lacked the necessary vigilance and forecast one of the lieutenants speaks of him in a sarcastic vein and evidently with some degree of prejudice according to his account there was more bustle than business at the post he was a boon companion made merry until a late hour in the night and then lay in bed until nine oclock in the morning and then he took no precautions against the possibility of being attacked a veteran officer major von dechow proposed that some works should be thrown up where the cannon might be placed ready against any assault the colonel made merry with the very idea an assault by the rebels let them come well at them with the bayonet  such was the posture of affairs at trenton at the time the coup de main was meditated whatever was to be done however must be done quickly before the river was frozen an intercepted letter had convinced washington of what he had before suspected that howe was only waiting for that event to resume active operations cross the river on the ice and push on triumphantly to philadelphia he communicated his project to gates and wished him to go to bristol take command there and cooperate from that quarter gates however pleaded ill health and requested leave to proceed to philadelphia  the request may have surprised washington considering the spirited enterprise that was on foot but gates as has before been observed had a disinclination to serve immediately under the commanderinchief like lee he had a disparaging opinion of him or rather an impatience of his supremacy he had moreover an ulterior object in view having been disappointed and chagrined in finding himself subordinate to general schuyler in the northern campaign he was now intent on making interest among the members of congress for an independent command washington urged that on his way to philadelphia he would at least stop for a day or two at bristol to concert a plan of operations with reed and cadwalader and adjust any little questions of etiquette and command that might arise between the continental colonels who had gone thither with lees troops and the volunteer officers stationed there he does not appear to have complied even with this request according to wilkinsons account he took quarters at newtown and set out thence for baltimore on the 24th of december the very day before that of the intended coup de main the projected attack upon the hessian posts was to be threefold 1st washington was to cross the delaware with a considerable force at mckonkeys ferry now taylorsville about nine miles above trenton and march down upon that place where rahls cantonment comprised a brigade of fifteen hundred hessians a troop of british lighthorse and a number of chasseurs 2d general ewing with a body of pennsylvania militia was to cross at a ferry about a mile below trenton secure the bridge over the assunpink creek a stream flowing along the south side of the town and cut off any retreat of the enemy in that direction 3d general putnam with the troops occupied in fortifying philadelphia and those under general cadwalader was to cross below burlington and attack the lower posts under count donop the several divisions were to cross the delaware at night so as to be ready for simultaneous action by five oclock in the morning  seldom is a combined plan carried into full operation symptoms of an insurrection in philadelphia obliged putnam to remain with some force in that city but he detached five or six hundred of the pennsylvania militia under colonel griffin his adjutantgeneral who threw himself into the jerseys to be at hand to cooperate with cadwalader  early on the eventful evening dec 25th the troops destined for washingtons part of the attack about two thousand four hundred strong with a train of twenty small pieces were paraded near mckonkeys ferry ready to pass as soon as it grew dark in the hope of being all on the other side by twelve oclock washington repaired to the ground accompanied by generals greene sullivan mercer stephen and lord stirling greene was full of ardor for the enterprise eager no doubt to wipe out the recollection of fort washington it was indeed an anxious moment for all  boats being in readiness the troops began to cross about sunset the weather was intensely cold the wind was high the current strong and the river full of floating ice colonel glover with his amphibious regiment of marblehead fishermen was in advance they were men accustomed to battle with the elements yet with all their skill and experience the crossing was difficult and perilous the night was dark and tempestuous the drifting ice drove the boats out of their course and threatened them with destruction it was three oclock before the artillery was landed and nearly four before the troops took up their line of march trenton was nine miles distant and not to be reached before daylight to surprise it therefore was out of the question there was no making a retreat without being discovered and harassed in repassing the river beside the troops from the other points might have crossed and cooperation was essential to their safety washington resolved to push forward and trust to providence he formed the troops into two columns the first he led himself accompanied by greene stirling mercer and stephen it was to make a circuit by the upper or pennington road to the north of trenton the other led by sullivan and including the brigade of st clair was to take the lower river leading to the west end of the town sullivans column was to halt a few moments at a crossroad leading to howlands ferry to give washingtons column time to effect its circuit so that the attack might be simultaneous on arriving at trenton they were to force the outer guards and push directly into the town before the enemy had time to form  it began to hail and snow as the troops commenced their march and increased in violence as they advanced the storm driving the sleet in their faces so bitter was the cold that two of the men were frozen to death that night the day dawned by the time sullivan halted at the crossroad it was discovered that the storm had rendered many of the muskets wet and useless what is to be done inquired sullivan of st clair you have nothing for it but to push on and use the bayonet was the reply while some of the soldiers were endeavoring to clear their muskets and squibbing off priming sullivan despatched an officer to apprise the commanderinchief of the condition of their arms he came back half dismayed by an indignant burst of washington who ordered him to return instantly and tell general sullivan to advance and charge  it was about eight oclock when washingtons column arrived in the vicinity of the village the storm which had rendered the march intolerable had kept every one within doors and the snow had deadened the tread of the troops and the rumbling of the artillery as they approached the village washington who was in front came to a man that was chopping wood by the roadside and inquired which way is the hessian picket i dont know was the surly reply you may tell said captain forest of the artillery for that is general washington the aspect of the man changed in an instant raising his hands to heaven god bless and prosper you cried he the picket is in that house and the sentry stands near that tree  the advance guard was led by a brave young officer captain william a washington seconded by lieutenant james monroe in after years president of the united states they received orders to dislodge the picket here happened to be stationed the very lieutenant whose censures of the negligence of colonel rahl we have referred to by his own account he was very near being entrapped in the guardhouse his sentries he says were not alert enough and had he not stepped out of the pickethouse himself and discovered the enemy they would have been upon him before his men could scramble to their arms der feind der feind heraus heraus the enemy the enemy turn out turn out was now the cry by this time the american artillery was unlimbered washington kept beside it and the column proceeded the report of firearms told that sullivan was at the lower end of the town colonel stark led his advance guard and did it in gallant style the attacks as concerted were simultaneous the outposts were driven in they retreated firing from behind houses the hessian drums beat to arms the trumpets of the lighthorse sounded the alarm the whole place was in an uproar some of the enemy made a wild and undirected fire from the windows of their quarters others rushed forth in disorder and attempted to form in the main street while dragoons hastily mounted and galloping about added to the confusion washington advanced with his column to the head of king street riding beside captain forest of the artillery when forests battery of six guns was opened the general kept on the left and advanced with it giving directions to the fire his position was an exposed one and he was repeatedly entreated to fall back but all such entreaties were useless when once he became heated in action  the enemy were training a couple of cannon in the main street to form a battery which might have given the americans a serious check but captain washington and lieutenant monroe with a part of the advance guard rushed forward drove the artillerists from their guns and took the two pieces when on the point of being fired both of these officers were wounded the captain in the wrist the lieutenant in the shoulder  while washington advanced on the north of the town sullivan approached on the west and detached stark to press on the lower or south end of the town the british lighthorse and about five hundred hessians and chasseurs had been quartered in the lower part of the town seeing washingtons column pressing in front and hearing stark thundering in their rear they took headlong flight by the bridge across the assunpink and so along the banks of the delaware towards count donops encampment at bordentown had washingtons plan been carried into full effect their retreat would have been cut off by general ewing but that officer had been prevented from crossing the river by the ice  colonel rahl according to the account of the lieutenant who had commanded the picket completely lost his head in the confusion of the surprise the latter when driven in by the american advance found the colonel on horseback endeavoring to rally his panicstricken and disordered men but himself sorely bewildered with some difficulty he succeeded in extricating his troops from the town and leading them into an adjacent orchard a rapid retreat by the princeton road was apparently in his thoughts but he lacked decision the idea of flying before the rebels was intolerable some one too exclaimed at the ruinous loss of leaving all their baggage to be plundered by the enemy changing his mind he made a rash resolve all who are my grenadiers forward cried he and led his grenadiers bravely but rashly on when in the midst of his career he received a fatal wound from a musket ball and fell from his horse his men left without their chief were struck with dismay heedless of the orders of the second in command they retreated by the right up the banks of the assunpink intending to escape to princeton washington saw their design and threw colonel hands corps of pennsylvania riflemen in their way while a body of virginia troops gained their left brought to a stand and perfectly bewildered they grounded their arms and surrendered at discretion  the number of prisoners taken in this affair was nearly one thousand of which thirtytwo were officers washingtons triumph however was impaired by the failure of the two simultaneous attacks general ewing who was to have crossed before day at trenton ferry and taken possession of the bridge leading out of the town over which the lighthorse and hessians retreated was prevented by the quantity of ice in the river cadwalader was hindered by the same obstacle he got part of his troops over but found it impossible to embark his cannon and was obliged therefore to return to the pennsylvania side of the river had he and ewing crossed donops quarters would have been beaten up and the fugitives from trenton intercepted  by the failure of this part of his plan washington had been exposed to the most imminent hazard the force with which he had crossed twentyfour hundred men raw troops was not enough to cope with the veteran garrison had it been properly on its guard and then there were the troops under donop at hand to cooperate with it nothing saved him but the utter panic of the enemy their want of proper alarm places and their exaggerated idea of his forces even now that the place was in his possession he dared not linger in it there was a superior force under donop below him and a strong battalion of infantry at princeton his own troops were exhausted by the operations of the night and morning in cold rain snow and storm they had to guard about a thousand prisoners taken in action or found concealed in houses there was little prospect of succor owing to the season and the state of the river washington gave up therefore all idea of immediately pursuing the enemy or keeping possession of trenton and determined to recross the delaware with his prisoners and captured artillery     chapter xxxviii washington recrosses the delawarebattle of princeton   there was a kind of episode in the affair at trenton colonel griffin who had thrown himself previously into the jerseys with his detachment of pennsylvania militia found himself through indisposition and the scanty number of his troops unable to render efficient service in the proposed attack he sent word to cadwalader therefore that he should probably render him more real aid by making a demonstration in front of donop and drawing him off so far into the interior as to be out of the way of rendering support to colonel rahl he accordingly presented himself in sight of donops cantonment on the 25th of december and succeeded in drawing him out with nearly his whole force of two thousand men he then retired slowly before him skirmishing but avoiding anything like an action until he had lured him as far as mount holly when he left him to find his way back to his post at his leisure  the cannonade of washingtons attack in trenton on the morning of the 26th was distinctly heard at cadwaladers camp at bristol imperfect tidings of the result reached there about eleven oclock and produced the highest exultation and excitement cadwalader made another attempt to cross the river and join washington whom he supposed to be still in the jerseys following up the blow he had struck he could not effect the passage of the river with the most of the troops until midday of the 27th when he received from washington a detailed account of his success and of his having recrossed into pennsylvania  cadwalader was now in a dilemma donop he presumed was still at mount holly whither griffin had decoyed him but he might soon march back his forces were equal if not superior in number to his own and veterans instead of raw militia but then there was the glory of rivalling the exploit at trenton and the importance of following out the effort for the relief of the jerseys and the salvation of philadelphia beside washington in all probability after disposing of his prisoners had again crossed into the jerseys and might be acting offensively reed relieved cadwalader from his dilemma by proposing that they should push on to burlington and there determine according to intelligence whether to proceed to bordentown or mount holly the plan was adopted and cadwalader took up his line of march  reed and two companions spurred on to reconnoitre the enemys outposts about four miles from burlington but pulled up at the place where the picket was usually stationed there was no smoke nor any sign of a human being they rode up and found the place deserted from the country people in the neighborhood they received an explanation count donop had returned to his post from the pursuit of griffin only in time to hear of the disaster at trenton he immediately began a retreat in the utmost panic and confusion calling in his guards and parties as he hurried forward the troops in the neighborhood of burlington had decamped precipitately the preceding evening  colonel reed sent back intelligence of this to cadwalader and still pushed on with his companions arrived at bordentown not an enemy was to be seen the fugitives from trenton had spread a panic on the 26th and the hessians and their refugee adherents had fled in confusion leaving their sick behind them one of reeds companions returned to cadwalader who had halted at burlington and advised him to proceed cadwalader wrote in the night to washington informing him of his whereabouts and that he should march for bordentown in the morning if you should think proper to cross over added he it may easily be effected at the place where we passed a pursuit would keep up the panic they went off with great precipitation and pressed all the wagons in their reach i am told many of them are gone to south amboy  washington needed no prompting of the kind bent upon following up his blow he had barely allowed his troops a day or two to recover from recent exposure and fatigue that they might have strength and spirit to pursue the retreating enemy beat up other of their quarters and entirely reverse affairs in the jerseys in this spirit he had written to generals mcdougall and maxwell at morristown to collect as large a body of militia as possible and harass the enemy in flank and rear men of influence also were despatched by him into different parts of the jerseys to spirit up the militia to revenge the oppression the ravage and insults they had experienced from the enemy especially from the hessians  on the 29th his troops began to cross the river it would be a slow and difficult operation owing to the ice two parties of light troops therefore were detached in advance whom colonel reed was to send in pursuit of the enemy they marched into trenton about two oclock and were immediately put on the traces of donop to hang on his rear and harass him until other troops should come up cadwalader also detached a party of riflemen from bordentown with like orders donop in retreating had divided his force sending one part by a cross road to princeton and hurrying on with the remainder to brunswick while this was going on washington was effecting the passage of his main force to trenton he himself had crossed on the 29th of december but it took two days more to get the troops and artillery over the icy river and that with great labor and difficulty  at this critical moment washington received a letter from a committee of congress transmitting him resolves of that body dated the 27th of december investing him with military powers quite dictatorial happy is it for this country write the committee that the general of their forces can safely be intrusted with the most unlimited power and neither personal security liberty or property be in the least degree endangered thereby washingtons acknowledgement of this great mark of confidence was noble and characteristic i find congress have done me the honor to intrust me with powers in my military capacity of the highest nature and almost unlimited extent instead of thinking myself freed from all civil obligations by this mark of their confidence i shall constantly bear in mind that as the sword was the last resort for the preservation of our liberties so it ought to be the first thing laid aside when those liberties are firmly established  general howe was taking his ease in winter quarters at new york waiting for the freezing of the delaware to pursue his triumphant march to philadelphia when tidings were brought him of the surprise and capture of the hessians at trenton he instantly stopped lord cornwallis who was on the point of embarking for england and sent him back in all haste to resume the command in the jerseys  the ice in the delaware impeded the crossing of the american troops and gave the british time to draw in their scattered cantonments and assemble their whole force at princeton information was obtained that lord cornwallis had joined general grant with a reinforcement of chosen troops they had now seven or eight thousand men and were pressing wagons for a march upon trenton word too was brought that general howe was on the march with a thousand light troops with which he had landed at amboy  the situation of washington was growing critical the enemy were beginning to advance their large pickets towards trenton everything indicated an approaching attack the force with him was small to retreat across the river would destroy the dawn of hope awakened in the bosoms of the jersey militia by the late exploit but to make a stand without reinforcements was impossible in this emergency he called to his aid general cadwalader from crosswicks and general mifflin from bordentown with their collective forces amounting to about three thousand six hundred men they promptly answered to his call and marching in the night joined him on the 1st of january  washington chose a position for his main body on the east side of the assunpink there was a narrow stone bridge across it where the water was very deep the same bridge over which part of rahls brigade had escaped in the recent affair he planted his artillery so as to command the bridge and the fords his advance guard was stationed about three miles off in a wood having in front a stream called shabbakong creek early on the morning of the 2d came certain word that cornwallis was approaching with all his force strong parties were sent out under general greene who skirmished with the enemy and harassed them in their advance by twelve oclock they reached shabbakong and halted for a time on its northern bank then crossing it and moving forward with rapidity they drove the advance guard out of the woods and pushed on until they reached a high ground near the town here hands corps of several battalions was drawn up and held them for a time in check all the parties in advance ultimately retreated to the main body on the east side of the assunpink  from all these checks and delays it was nearly sunset before cornwallis with the head of his army entered trenton his rearguard under general leslie rested at maiden head about six miles distant and nearly half way between trenton and princeton forming his troops into columns he now made repeated attempts to cross the assunpink at the bridge and the fords but was as often repulsed by the artillery for a part of the time washington mounted on a white horse stationed himself at the south end of the bridge issuing his orders each time the enemy was repulsed there was a shout along the american lines at length they drew off came to a halt and lighted their camp fires the americans did the same using the neighboring fences for the purpose  a cannonade was kept up on both sides until dark but with little damage to the americans when night closed in the two camps lay in sight of each others fires ruminating the bloody action of the following day it was the most gloomy and anxious night that had yet closed in on the american army throughout its series of perils and disasters for there was no concealing the impending danger but what must have been the feelings of the commanderinchief as he anxiously patrolled his camp and considered his desperate position a small stream fordable in several places was all that separated his raw inexperienced army from an enemy vastly superior in numbers and discipline and stung to action by the mortification of a late defeat in this darkest of moments a gleam of hope flashed upon his mind a bold expedient suggested itself almost the whole of the enemys force must by this time be drawn out of princeton and advancing by detachments toward trenton while their baggage and principal stores must remain weakly guarded at brunswick was it not possible by a rapid nightmarch along the quaker road a different road from that on which general leslie with the rearguard was resting to get past that force undiscovered come by surprise upon those left at princeton capture or destroy what stores were left there and then push on to brunswick this would save the army from being cut off would avoid the appearance of a defeat and might draw the enemy away from trenton while some fortunate stroke might give additional reputation to the american arms  such was the plan which washington revolved in his mind on the gloomy banks of the assunpink and which he laid before his officers in a council of war held after nightfall at the quarters of general mercer it met with instant concurrence one formidable difficulty presented itself the weather was unusually mild there was a thaw by which the roads might be rendered deep and miry and almost impassable fortunately the wind veered to the north in the course of the evening the weather became intensely cold and in two hours the roads were once more hard and frostbound in the meantime the baggage of the army was silently removed to burlington and every other preparation was made for a rapid march to deceive the enemy men were employed to dig trenches near the bridge within hearing of the british sentries with orders to continue noisily at work until daybreak others were to go the rounds relieve guards at the bridge and fords keep up the camp fires and maintain all the appearance of a regular encampment at daybreak they were to hasten after the army  in the dead of the night the army drew quietly out of the encampment and began its march general mercer was in the advance with the remnant of his flying camp now but about three hundred and fifty men the quaker road was a complete roundabout joining the main road about two miles from princeton where washington expected to arrive before daybreak the road however was new and rugged cut through woods where the stumps of trees broke the wheels of some of the baggage trains and retarded the march of the troops so that it was near sunrise of a bright frosty morning when washington reached the bridge over stony brook about three miles from princeton after crossing the bridge he led his troops along the bank of the brook to the edge of a wood where a byroad led off on the right through low grounds and was said by the guides to be a short cut to princeton and less exposed to view by this road washington defiled with the main body ordering mercer to continue along the brook with his brigade until he should arrive at the main road where he was to secure and if possible destroy a bridge over which it passes so as to intercept any fugitives from princeton and check any retrograde movements of the british troops which might have advanced towards trenton  hitherto the movements of the americans had been undiscovered by the enemy three regiments of the latter the 17th 40th and 55th with three troops of dragoons had been quartered all night in princeton under marching orders to join lord cornwallis in the morning the 17th regiment under colonel mawhood was already on the march the 55th regiment was preparing to follow mawhood had crossed the bridge by which the old or main road to trenton passes over stony brook and was proceeding through a wood beyond when as he attained the summit of a hill about sunrise the glittering of arms betrayed to him the movement of mercers troops to the left who were filing along the quaker road to secure the bridge as they had been ordered the woods prevented him from seeing their number he supposed them to be some broken portion of the american army flying before lord cornwallis with this idea he faced about and made a retrograde movement to intercept them or hold them in check while messengers spurred off at all speed to hasten forward the regiments still lingering at princeton so as completely to surround them  the woods concealed him until he had recrossed the bridge of stony brook when he came in full sight of the van of mercers brigade both parties pushed to get possession of a rising ground on the right near the house of a mr clark the americans being nearest reached it first and formed behind a hedge fence which extended along a slope in front of the house whence being chiefly armed with rifles they opened a destructive fire it was returned with great spirit by the enemy at the first discharge mercer was dismounted one of his colonels also was mortally wounded and carried to the rear availing themselves of the confusion thus occasioned the british charged with the bayonet the american riflemen having no weapon of the kind were thrown into disorder and retreated mercer who was on foot endeavored to rally them when a blow from the butt end of a musket felled him to the ground he rose and defended himself with his sword but was surrounded bayoneted repeatedly and left for dead mawhood pursued the broken and retreating troops to the brow of the rising ground on which clarks house was situated when he beheld a large force emerging from a wood and advancing to the rescue it was a body of pennsylvania militia which washington on hearing the firing had detached to the support of mercer mawhood instantly ceased pursuit drew up his artillery and by a heavy discharge brought the militia to a stand  at this moment washington himself arrived at the scene of action having galloped from the byroad in advance of his troops from a rising ground he beheld mercers troops retreating in confusion and the detachment of militia checked by mawhoods artillery everything was at peril putting spurs to his horse he dashed past the hesitating militia waving his hat and cheering them on his commanding figure and white horse made him a conspicuous object for the enemys marksmen but he heeded it not galloping forward under the fire of mawhoods battery he called upon mercers broken brigade the pennsylvanians rallied at the sound of his voice and caught fire from his example at the same time the 7th virginia regiment emerged from the wood and moved forward with loud cheers while a fire of grapeshot was opened by captain moulder of the american artillery from the brow of a ridge to the south  colonel mawhood who a moment before had thought his triumph secure found himself assailed on every side and separated from the other british regiments he fought however with great bravery and for a short time the action was desperate washington was in the midst of it equally endangered by the random fire of his own men and the artillery and musketry of the enemy mawhood by this time had forced his way at the point of the bayonet through gathering foes though with heavy loss back to the main road and was in full retreat towards trenton to join cornwallis washington detached major kelly with a party of pennsylvania troops to destroy the bridge at stony brook over which mawhood had retreated so as to impede the advance of general leslie from maiden head  in the meantime the 55th regiment which had been on the left and nearer princeton had been encountered by the american advanceguard under general st clair and after some sharp fighting in a ravine had given way and was retreating across fields and along a byroad to brunswick the remaining regiment the 40th had not been able to come up in time for the action a part of it fled toward brunswick the residue took refuge in the college at princeton recently occupied by them as barracks artillery was now brought to bear on the college and a few shot compelled those within to surrender  in this brief but brilliant action about one hundred of the british were left dead on the field and nearly three hundred taken prisoners fourteen of whom were officers the loss of the americans was about twentyfive or thirty men and several officers among the latter was colonel haslet who had distinguished himself throughout the campaign by being among the foremost in services of danger a greater loss was that of general mercer he was said to be either dead or dying in the house of mr clark whither he had been conveyed by his aidedecamp major armstrong washington would have ridden back from princeton to visit him and have him conveyed to a place of greater security but was assured that if alive he was too desperately wounded to bear removal  under these circumstances washington felt compelled to leave his old companion in arms to his fate indeed he was called away by the exigencies of his command having to pursue the routed regiments which were making a headlong retreat to brunswick in this pursuit he took the lead at the head of a detachment of cavalry at kingston however three miles to the northeast of princeton he pulled up restrained his ardor and held a council of war on horseback should he keep on to brunswick or not the capture of the british stores and baggage would make his triumph complete but on the other hand his troops were excessively fatigued by their rapid march all night and hard fight in the morning all of them had been one night without sleep and some of them two and many were halfstarved they were without blankets thinly clad some of them barefooted and this in freezing weather cornwallis would be upon them before they could reach brunswick his rearguard under general leslie had been quartered but six miles from princeton and the retreating troops must have roused them under these considerations it was determined to discontinue the pursuit and push for morristown there they would be in a mountainous country heavily wooded in an abundant neighborhood and on the flank of the enemy with various defiles by which they might change their position according to his movements filing off to the left therefore from kingston and breaking down the bridges behind him washington took the narrow road by rocky hill to pluckamin  his lordship had retired to rest at trenton with the sportsmans vaunt that he would bag the fox in the morning nothing could surpass his surprise and chagrin when at daybreak the expiring watchfires and deserted camp of the americans told him that the prize had once more evaded his grasp that the general whose military skill he had decried had outgeneralled him for a time he could not learn whither the army which had stolen away so silently had directed its stealthy march by sunrise however there was the booming of cannon like the rumbling of distant thunder in the direction of princeton the idea flashed upon him that washington had not merely escaped but was about to make a dash at the british magazines at brunswick alarmed for the safety of his military stores his lordship forthwith broke up his camp and made a rapid march towards princeton as he arrived in sight of the bridge over stony brook he beheld major kelly and his party busy in its destruction a distant discharge of round shot from his fieldpieces drove them away but the bridge was already broken it would take time to repair it for the passage of the artillery so cornwallis in his impatience urged his troops breasthigh through the turbulent and icy stream and again pushed forward  without further delay he hurried forward eager to save his magazines crossing the bridge at kingston he kept on along the brunswick road supposing washington still before him the latter had got far in the advance during the delays caused by the broken bridge at stony brook and the alteration of his course at kingston had carried him completely out of the way of cornwallis his lordship reached brunswick towards evening and endeavored to console himself by the safety of the military stores for being so completely foiled and outmanoeuvred  washington in the meantime was all on the alert the lion part of his nature was aroused and while his weary troops were resting at pluckamin he was despatching missives and calling out aid to enable him to follow up his successes in a letter to putnam he says the enemy appear to be panicstruck i am in hopes of driving them out of the jerseys march the troops under your command to crosswicks and keep a strict watch upon the enemy in this quarter to general heath also who was stationed in the highlands of the hudson he wrote at the same harried moment the enemy are in great consternation and as the panic affords us a favorable opportunity to drive them out of the jerseys it has been determined in council that you should move down towards new york with a considerable force as if you had a design upon the city that being an object of great importance the enemy will be reduced to the necessity of withdrawing a considerable part of their force from the jerseys if not the whole to secure the city  these letters despatched he continued forward to morristown where at length he came to a halt from his incessant and harassing marchings there he learnt that general mercer was still alive he immediately sent his nephew major george lewis under the protection of a flag to attend upon him lewis found him languishing in great pain he had been treated with respect by the enemy and great tenderness by the benevolent family who had sheltered him he expired on the 12th of january in the fiftysixth year of his age  from morristown washington again wrote to general heath repeating his former orders to majorgeneral lincoln also who was just arrived at peekskill and had command of the massachusetts militia he writes on the 7th general heath will communicate mine of this date to you by which you will find that the greater part of your troops are to move down towards new york to draw the attention of the enemy to that quarter colonel reed was ordered to send out rangers and bodies of militia to scour the country waylay foraging parties cut off supplies and keep the cantonments of the enemy in a state of siege  the expedition under general heath towards new york from which much had been anticipated by washington proved a failure it moved in three divisions by different routes but all arriving nearly at the same time at the enemys outposts at kings bridge there was some skirmishing but the great feature of the expedition was a pompous and peremptory summons of fort independence to surrender twenty minutes only can be allowed said heath for the garrison to give their answer and should it be in the negative they must abide the consequences the garrison made no answer but an occasional cannonade heath failed to follow up his summons by corresponding deeds he hovered and skirmished for some days about the outposts and spyt den duivel creek and then retired before a threatened snowstorm and the report of an enemys fleet from rhode island with troops under lord percy who might land in westchester and take the besieging force in rear  but though disappointed in this part of his plan washington having received reinforcements of militia continued with his scanty army to carry on his system of annoyance the situation of cornwallis who but a short time before traversed the jerseys so triumphantly became daily more and more irksome spies were in his camp to give notice of every movement and foes without to take advantage of it so that not a foraging party could sally forth without being waylaid by degrees he drew in his troops which were posted about the country and collected them at new brunswick and amboy so as to have a communication by water with new york whence he was now compelled to draw nearly all his supplies in fact the recent operations in the jerseys had suddenly changed the whole aspect of the war and given a triumphant close to what had been a disastrous campaign the troops which for months had been driven from post to post apparently an undisciplined rabble had all at once turned upon their pursuers and astounded them by brilliant stratagems and daring exploits the commander whose cautious policy had been sneered at by enemies and regarded with impatience by misjudging friends had all at once shown that he possessed enterprise as well as circumspection energy as well as endurance and that beneath his wary coldness lurked a fire to break forth at the proper moment this years campaign the most critical one of the war and especially the part of it which occurred in the jerseys was the ordeal that made his great qualities fully appreciated by his countrymen and gained for him from the statesmen and generals of europe the appellation of the american fabius     chapter xxxix the army at morristownattack on peekskill   the howes learned to their mortification that the mere running through a province is not subduing it the british commanders had been outgeneralled attacked and defeated they had nearly been driven out of the jerseys and were now hemmed in and held in check by washington and his handful of men castled among the heights of morristown so far from holding possession of the territory they had so recently overrun they were fain to ask safe conduct across it for a convoy to their soldiers captured in battle it must have been a severe trial to the pride of cornwallis when he had to inquire by letter of washington whether money and stores could be sent to the hessians captured at trenton and a surgeon and medicines to the wounded at princeton and washingtons reply must have conveyed a reproof still more mortifying no molestation he assured his lordship would be offered to the convoy by any part of the regular army under his command but he could not answer for the militia who were resorting to arms in most parts of the state and were excessively exasperated at the treatment they had met with from both hessian and british troops  in fact the conduct of the enemy had roused the whole country against them the proclamations and printed protections of the british commanders on the faith of which the inhabitants in general had stayed at home and forbore to take up arms had proved of no avail the hessians could not or would not understand them but plundered friend and foe alike the british soldiery often followed their example and the plunderings of both were at times attended by those brutal outrages on the weaker sex which inflame the dullest spirits to revenge the whole state was thus roused against its invaders in washingtons retreat of more than a hundred miles through the jerseys he had never been joined by more than one hundred of its inhabitants now sufferers of both parties rose as one man to avenge their personal injuries the late quiet yeomanry armed themselves and scoured the country in small parties to seize on stragglers and the militia began to signalize themselves in voluntary skirmishes with regular troops  morristown where the main army was encamped had not been chosen by washington as a permanent post but merely as a haltingplace where his troops might repose after their excessive fatigues and their sufferings from the inclement season further considerations persuaded him that it was well situated for the system of petty warfare which he meditated and induced him to remain there it was protected by forests and rugged heights it was nearly equidistant from amboy newark and brunswick the principal posts of the enemy so that any movement made from them could be met by a counter movement on his part while the forays and skirmishes by which he might harass them would school and season his own troops he had three faithful generals with him greene sullivan and knox  washingtons military family at this time was composed of his aidesdecamp colonels meade and tench tilghman of philadelphia and his secretary colonel robert h harrison of maryland his headquarters at first were in what was called the freemasons tavern on the north side of the village green his troops were encamped about the vicinity of the village at first in tents until they could build log huts for shelter against the winters cold the main encampment was near bottle hill in a sheltered valley which was thickly wooded and had abundant springs  the enemy being now concentrated at new brunswick and amboy general putnam was ordered by washington to move from crosswicks to princeton with the troops under his command he was instructed to draw his forage as much as possible from the neighborhood of brunswick about eighteen miles off thereby contributing to distress the enemy to have good scouting parties continually on the lookout to keep nothing with him but what could be moved off at a moments warning and if compelled to leave princeton to retreat towards the mountains so as to form a junction with the forces at morristown putnam had with him but a few hundred men you will give out your strength to be twice as great as it is writes washington a common expedient with him in those times of scanty means  cantonments were gradually formed between princeton and the highlands of the hudson which made the left flank of washingtons position and where general heath had command general philemon dickinson who commanded the new jersey militia was stationed on the west side of millstone river near somerset courthouse one of the nearest posts to the enemys camp at brunswick a british foraging party of five or six hundred strong sent out by cornwallis with forty wagons and upward of a hundred draught horses mostly of the english breed having collected sheep and cattle about the country were sacking a mill on the opposite side of the river where a large quantity of flour was deposited while thus employed dickinson set upon them with a force equal in number but composed of raw militia and fifty philadelphia riflemen he dashed through the river waist deep with his men and charged the enemy so suddenly and vigorously that though supported by three fieldpieces they gave way left their convoy and retreated so precipitately that he made only nine prisoners a number of killed and wounded were carried off by the fugitives on light wagons  illustration col morris house vol ii  to counteract the proclamation of the british commissioners promising amnesty to all in rebellion who should in a given time return to their allegiance washington now issued a counter proclamation jan 25th commanding every person who had subscribed a declaration of fidelity to great britain or taken an oath of allegiance to repair within thirty days to headquarters or the quarters of the nearest general officer of the continental army or of the militia and there take the oath of allegiance to the united states of america and give up any protection certificate or passport he might have received from the enemy at the same time granting full liberty to all such as preferred the interest and protection of great britain to the freedom and happiness of their country forthwith to withdraw themselves and families within the enemys lines all who should neglect or refuse to comply with this order were to be considered adherents to the crown and treated as common enemies  a cartel for the exchange of prisoners had been a subject of negotiation previous to the affair of trenton without being adjusted the british commanders were slow to recognize the claims to equality of those they considered rebels washington was tenacious in holding them up as patriots ennobled by their cause among the cases which came up for attention was that of ethan allen the brave but eccentric captor of ticonderoga his daring attempts in the path of renown had cost him a world of hardshipsthrown into irons as a felon threatened with a halter carried to england to be tried for treason confined in pendennis castle retransported to halifax and now a prisoner in new york washington had been instructed considering his long imprisonment to urge his exchange this had scarce been urged when tidings of the capture of general lee presented a case of still greater importance to be provided for lee was reported to be in rigorous confinement in new york and treated with harshness and indignity the british professed to consider him a deserter he having been a lieutenantcolonel in their service although he alleged that he had resigned his commission before joining the american army  on the 13th of january washington addressed the following letter to sir william howe i am directed by congress to propose an exchange of five of the hessian fieldofficers taken at trenton for majorgeneral lee or if this proposal should not be accepted to demand his liberty upon parole within certain bounds as has ever been granted to your officers in our custody i am informed upon good authority that your reason for keeping him hitherto in stricter confinement than usual is that you do not look upon him in the light of a common prisoner of war but as a deserter from the british service as his resignation has never been accepted and that you intend to try him as such by a courtmartial i will not undertake to determine how far this doctrine may be justifiable among yourselves but i must give you warning that majorgeneral lee is looked upon as an officer belonging to and under the protection of the united independent states of america and that any violence you may commit upon his life and liberty will be severely retaliated upon the lives or liberties of the british officers or those of their foreign allies in our hands  in this letter he likewise adverted to the treatment of american prisoners in new york several who had recently been released having given the most shocking account of the barbarities they had experienced  sir william in reply proposed to send an officer of rank to washington to confer upon a mode of exchange and subsistence of prisoners this proposal led to the appointment of two officers for the purpose colonel walcott by general howe and colonel harrison the old secretary by washington  lees actual treatment was not so harsh as had been represented he was in close confinement it is true but three rooms had been fitted up for his reception in the old city hall of new york having nothing of the look of a prison excepting that they were secured by bolts and bars congress in the meantime had resorted to their threatened measure of retaliation on the 20th of february they had resolved that the board of war be directed immediately to order the five hessian fieldofficers and lieutenantcolonel campbell into safe and close custody it being the unalterable resolution of congress to retaliate on them the same punishment as may be inflicted on the person of general lee  in a letter to the president of congress washington gives his moderating counsels on the whole subject of retaliation though i sincerely commiserate writes he the misfortunes of general lee and feel much for his present unhappy situation yet with all possible deference to the opinion of congress i fear that these resolutions will not have the desired effect are founded on impolicy and will if adhered to produce consequences of an extensive and melancholy nature the balance of prisoners is greatly against us and a general regard to the happiness of the whole should mark our conduct can we imagine that our enemies will not mete the same punishments the same indignities the same cruelties to those belonging to us in their possession that we impose on theirs in our power why should we suppose them to possess more humanity than we have ourselves or why should an ineffectual attempt to relieve the distresses of one brave unfortunate man involve many more in the same calamities  washington was not always successful in instilling his wise moderation into public councils congress adhered to their vindictive policy merely directing that no other hardships should be inflicted on the captive officers than such confinement as was necessary to carry their resolve into effect there were other circumstances besides the treatment of general lee to produce this indignant sensibility on the part of congress accounts were rife at this juncture of the cruelties and indignities almost invariably experienced by american prisoners at new york and an active correspondence on the subject was going on between washington and the british commanders at the same time with that regarding general lee  the captive americans who had been in the naval service were said to be confined officers and men in prisonships which from their loathsome condition and the horrors and sufferings of all kinds experienced on board of them had acquired the appellation of floating hells those who had been in the land service were crowded into jails and dungeons like the vilest malefactors and were represented as pining in cold in filth in hunger and nakedness in the correspondence between lord howe and washington on this subject the british commander denied the charges of undue severity in the treatment of prisoners and pronounced the tales current on the subject as idle and unnatural reports but the evidence of the truth of that statement is too complete to admit of doubt the jersey prisonship is proverbial in our revolutionary history and the bones of the unfortunate patriots who perished on board form a monument on the long island shore the horrors of the sugar house converted into a prison are traditional in new york and the brutal tyranny of cunningham the provost marshal over men of worth confined in the common jail for the sin of patriotism has been handed down from generation to generation that lord howe and sir william were ignorant of the extent of these atrocities we really believe but it was their duty to be well informed  the difficulties arising out of the case of general lee interrupted the operations with regard to the exchange of prisoners and gallant men on both sides suffered prolonged detention in consequence and among the number the brave but illstarred ethan allen  the early part of the year brought the annual embarrassments caused by short enlistments the brief terms of service for which the continental soldiery had enlisted a few months perhaps at most a year were expiring and the men glad to be released from camp duty were hastening to their rustic homes militia had to be the dependence until a new army could be raised and organized and washington called on the council of safety of pennsylvania speedily to furnish temporary reinforcements of the kind all his officers that could be spared were ordered away some to recruit some to collect the scattered men of the different regiments who were dispersed he said almost over the continent general knox was sent off to massachusetts to expedite the raising of a battalion of artillery different states were urged to levy and equip their quotas for the continental army  while anxiously exerting himself to strengthen his own precarious army the security of the northern department was urged upon his attention schuyler represented it as in need of reinforcements and supplies of all kinds he apprehended that carleton might make an attack upon ticonderoga as soon as he could cross lake champlain on the ice that important fortress was under the command of a brave officer colonel anthony wayne but its garrison had dwindled down to six or seven hundred men chiefly new england militia in the present destitute situation of his department as to troops schuyler feared that carleton might not only succeed in an attempt on ticonderoga but might push his way to albany although washington considered a winter attack of the kind specified by schuyler too difficult and dangerous to be very probable he urged reinforcements from massachusetts and new hampshire whence they could be furnished most speedily massachusetts in fact had already determined to send four regiments to schuylers aid as soon as possible  notwithstanding all washingtons exertions in behalf of the army under his immediate command it continued to be deplorably in want of reinforcements and it was necessary to maintain the utmost vigilance at all his posts to prevent his camp from being surprised the operations of the enemy might be delayed by the bad condition of the roads and the want of horses to move their artillery but he anticipated an attack as soon as the roads were passable and apprehended a disastrous result unless speedily reinforced  the designs of the enemy being mere matter of conjecture measures varied accordingly as the season advanced washington was led to believe that philadelphia would be their first object at the opening of the campaign and that they would bring round all their troops from canada by water to aid in the enterprise under this persuasion he wrote to general heath ordering him to send eight massachusetts battalions to peekskill at peekskill he observed they would be well placed to give support to any of the eastern or middle states or to oppose the enemy should they design to penetrate the country up the hudson or to cover new england should they invade it  on the 18th of march he despatched general greene to philadelphia to lay before congress such matters as he could not venture to communicate by letter greene had scarce departed when the enemy began to give signs of life the delay in the arrival of artillery more than his natural indolence had kept general howe from formally taking the field he now made preparations for the next campaign by detaching troops to destroy the american deposits of military stores one of the chief of these was at peekskill the very place whither washington had directed heath to send troops from massachusetts and which he thought of making a central point of assemblage brigadiergeneral mcdougall had the command of it in the absence of general heath but his force did not exceed two hundred and fifty men  as soon as the hudson was clear of ice a squadron of vessels of war and transports with five hundred troops under colonel bird ascended the river mcdougall had intelligence of the intended attack and while the ships were making their way across the tappan sea and haverstraw bay exerted himself to remove as much as possible of the provisions and stores to forts montgomery and constitution in the highlands on the morning of the 23d the whole squadron came to anchor in peekskill bay and five hundred men landed in lents cove on the south side of the bay whence they pushed forward with four light fieldpieces drawn by sailors on their approach mcdougall set fire to the barracks and principal storehouses and retreated about two miles to a strong post commanding the entrance to the highlands and the road to continental village the place of the deposits it was the post which had been noted by washington in the preceding year where a small force could make a stand and hurl down masses of rock on their assailants hence mcdougall sent an express to lieutenantcolonel marinus willet who had charge of fort constitution to hasten to his assistance  the british finding the wharf in flames where they had intended to embark their spoils completed the conflagration besides destroying several small craft laden with provisions they kept possession of the place until the following day when a scouting party which had advanced towards the entrance of the highlands was encountered by colonel marinus willet with a detachment from fort constitution and driven back to the main body after a sharp skirmish in which nine of the marauders were killed four more were slain on the banks of canopas creek as they were setting fire to some boats the enemy were disappointed in the hope of carrying off a great deal of booty and finding the country around was getting under arms they contented themselves with the mischief they had done and reembarked in the evening by moonlight when the whole squadron swept down the hudson     chapter xl the northern armybritish expedition to connecticut   we have now to enter upon a tissue of circumstances connected with the northern department which will be found materially to influence the course of affairs in that quarter throughout the current year and ultimately to be fruitful of annoyance to washington himself to make these more clear to the reader it is necessary to revert to events in the preceding year  the question of command between schuyler and gates when settled as we have shown by congress had caused no interruption to the harmony of intercourse between these generals schuyler directed the affairs of the department with energy and activity from his headquarters at albany where they had been fixed by congress while gates subordinate to him commanded the post of ticonderoga  the disappointment of an independent command however still rankled in the mind of the latter and was kept alive by the officious suggestions of meddling friends in the course of the autumn his hopes in this respect revived schuyler was again disgusted with the service in the discharge of his various and harassing duties he had been annoyed by sectional jealousies and ill will his motives and measures had been maligned the failures in canada had been attributed to him and he had repeatedly entreated congress to order an inquiry into the many charges made against him that he might not any longer be insulted  on the 14th of september he actually offered his resignation of his commission as majorgeneral and of every other office and appointment still claiming a court of inquiry on his conduct and expressing his determination to fulfil the duties of a good citizen and promote the weal of his native country but in some other capacity the hopes of gates inspired by this proffered resignation were doomed to be overclouded schuyler was informed by president hancock that congress during the present state of affairs could not consent to accept of his resignation  that they would at an early day appoint a committee to inquire fully into his conduct which they trusted would establish his reputation in the opinion of all good men  schuyler received the resolve of congress with grim acquiescence but showed in his reply that he was but half soothed at this very critical juncture writes he october 16 i shall continue to act some time longer but congress must prepare to put the care of this department into other hands he had remained at his post therefore discharging the various duties of his department with his usual zeal and activity and gates at the end of the campaign had repaired as we have shown to the vicinity of congress to attend the fluctuation of events  circumstances in the course of the winter had put the worthy schuyler again on points of punctilio with congress among some letters intercepted by the enemy and retaken by the americans was one from colonel joseph trumbull the commissarygeneral insinuating that general schuyler had secreted or suppressed a commission sent for his brother colonel john trumbull as deputy adjutantgeneral the purport of the letter was reported to schuyler he spurned at the insinuation if it be true that he has asserted such a thing writes he to the president i shall expect from congress that justice which is due to me until mr trumbull and i are upon a footing i cannot do what the laws of honor and a regard to my own reputation render indispensably necessary congress can put us on a par by dismissing one or the other from the service  congress failed to comply with the generals request they added also to his chagrin by dismissing from the service an army physician in whose appointment he had particularly interested himself schuyler was a proudspirited man and at times somewhat irascible in a letter to congress on the 8th of february he observed as dr stringer had my recommendation to the office he has sustained perhaps it was a compliment due to me that i should have been advised of the reason of his dismission and again i was in hopes some notice would have been taken of the odious suspicion contained in mr commissary trumbulls intercepted letter i really feel myself deeply chagrined on the occasion i am incapable of the meanness he suspects me of and i confidently expected that congress would have done me that justice which it was in their power to give and which i humbly conceive they ought to have done this letter gave great umbrage to congress but no immediate answer was made to it  about this time the office of adjutantgeneral which had remained vacant ever since the resignation of colonel reed to the great detriment of the service especially now when a new army was to be formed was offered to general gates who had formerly filled it with ability and president hancock informed him by letter of the earnest desire of congress that he should resume it retaining his present rank and pay gates almost resented the proposal he had a higher object in view a letter from schuyler to congress had informed that body that he should set out for philadelphia about the 21st of march and should immediately on his arrival require the promised inquiry into his conduct gates of course was acquainted with this circumstance he knew schuyler had given offence to congress he knew that he had been offended on his own part and had repeatedly talked of resigning he had active friends in congress ready to push his interests on the 15th of march the letter of general schuyler of the 3d of february which had given such offence was brought before the house and it was resolved that his suggestion concerning the dismission of dr stringer was highly derogatory to the honor of congress and that it was expected his letters in future would be written in a style suitable to the dignity of the representative body of these free and independent states and to his own character as their officer his expressions too respecting the intercepted letter that he had expected congress would have done him all the justice in their power were pronounced to say the least illadvised and highly indecent  while schuyler was thus in partial eclipse the house proceeded to appoint a general officer for the northern department of which he had stated it to be in need on the 25th of march gates received the following note from president hancock i have it in charge to direct that you repair to ticonderoga immediately and take command of the army stationed in that department gates obeyed with alacrity again the vision of an independent command floated before his mind and he was on his way to albany at the time that schuyler ignorant of this new arrangement was journeying to philadelphia he arrived in the second week in april and found himself superseded in effect by general gates in the northern department he enclosed to the committee of albany the recent resolutions of congress passed before his arrival by these writes he you will readily perceive that i shall not return a general under what influence it has been brought about i am not at liberty now to mention on my return to albany i shall give the committee the fullest information  taking his seat in congress as a delegate from new york he demanded the promised investigation of his conduct during the time he had held a command in the army it was his intention when the scrutiny had taken place to resign his commission and retire from the service on the 18th a committee of inquiry was appointed as at his request composed of a member from each state in the meantime as second majorgeneral of the united states lee being the first he held active command at philadelphia forming a camp on the western side of the delaware completing the works on fort island throwing up works on red bank and accelerating the despatch of troops and provisions to the commanderinchief during his sojourn at philadelphia also he contributed essentially to reorganize the commissary department digesting rules for its regulation which were mainly adopted by congress  the fame of the american struggle for independence was bringing foreign officers as candidates for admission into the patriot army and causing great embarrassment to the commanderinchief congress determined that no foreign officers should receive commissions who were not well acquainted with the english language and did not bring strong testimonials of their abilities still there was embarrassment some came with brevet commissions from the french government and had been assured by mr deane american commissioner at paris that they would have the same rank in the american army this would put them above american officers of merit and hard service whose commissions were of more recent date one monsieur ducoudray on the strength of an agreement with mr deane expected to have the rank of majorgeneral and to be put at the head of the artillery washington deprecated the idea of intrusting a department on which the very salvation of the army might depend to a foreigner who had no other tie to bind him to the interests of the country than honor  among the foreign candidates for appointments was one colonel conway a native of ireland but who according to his own account had been thirty years in the service of france and claimed to be a chevalier of the order of st louis of which he wore the decoration mr deane had recommended him to washington as an officer of merit and had written to congress that he considered him well qualified for the office of adjutant or brigadiergeneral colonel conway pushed for that of brigadiergeneral it had been conferred some time before by congress on two french officers de fermois and deborre who he had observed had been inferior to him in the french service and it would be mortifying now to hold rank below them conway accordingly received the rank of brigadiergeneral of which he subsequently proved himself unworthy he was boastful and presumptuous and became noted for his intrigues and for a despicable cabal against the commanderinchief which went by his name and of which we shall have to speak hereafter  a candidate of a different stamp had presented himself in the preceding year the gallant generousspirited thaddeus kosciuszko he was a pole of an ancient and noble family of lithuania and had been educated for the profession of arms at the military school at warsaw and subsequently in france disappointed in a love affair with a beautiful lady of rank with whom he had attempted to elope he had emigrated to this country and came provided with a letter of introduction from dr franklin to washington  what do you seek here inquired the commanderinchief to fight for american independence what can you do try me  washington was pleased with the curt yet comprehensive reply and with his chivalrous air and spirit and at once received him into his family as an aidedecamp congress shortly afterwards appointed him an engineer with the rank of colonel he proved a valuable officer throughout the revolution and won an honorable and lasting name in our country  questions of rank among his generals were as we have repeatedly shown perpetual sources of perplexity to washington and too often caused by what the sarcastic lee termed the stumblings of congress such was the case at present in recent army promotions congress had advanced stirling mifflin st clair stephen and lincoln to the rank of majorgeneral while arnold their senior in service and distinguished by so many brilliant exploits was passed over and left to remain a brigadier washington was surprised at not seeing his name on the list but supposing it might have been omitted through mistake he wrote to arnold who was at providence in rhode island advising him not to take any hasty step in consequence but to allow time for recollection promising his own endeavors to remedy any error that might have been made he wrote also to henry lee in congress inquiring whether the omission was owing to accident or design  arnold was in truth deeply wounded by the omission but intimated that he should avoid any hasty step and should remain at his post until he could leave it without any damage to the public interest the principle upon which congress had proceeded in their recent promotions was explained to washington the number of general officers promoted from each state was proportioned to the number of men furnished by it connecticut arnolds state had already two majorgenerals which was its full share an opportunity occurred before long for arnold again to signalize himself  the amount of stores destroyed at peekskill had fallen far short of general howes expectations something more must be done to cripple the americans before the opening of the campaign accordingly another expedition was set on foot against a still larger deposit at danbury within the borders of connecticut and between twenty and thirty miles from peekskill exgovernor tryon recently commissioned majorgeneral of provincials conducted it accompanied by brigadiergeneral agnew and sir william erskine he had a force two thousand strong and made his appearance on the sound in the latter part of april with a fleet of twentysix sail on the 25th towards evening he landed his troops on the beach at the foot of canepo hill near the mouth of the saugatuck river and set off for danbury about twentythree miles distant they were in a patriotic neighborhood general silliman of the connecticut militia who resided at fairfield a few miles distant sent out expresses to rouse the country it so happened that general arnold was at new haven between twenty and thirty miles off on his way to philadelphia for the purpose of settling his accounts at the alarm of a british inroad he forgot his injuries and irritation mounted his horse and accompanied by general wooster hastened to join general silliman as they spurred forward every farm house sent out its warrior until upwards of a hundred were pressing on with them full of the fighting spirit lieutenant oswald arnolds secretary in the canada campaign was at this time at new haven enlisting men for lambs regiment of artillery he too heard the note of alarm and mustering his recruits marched off with three fieldpieces for the scene of action  in the meanwhile the british marching all night with short haltings reached danbury about two oclock in the afternoon of the 26th there were but fifty continental soldiers and one hundred militia in the place these retreated as did most of the inhabitants excepting such as remained to take care of the sick and aged four men intoxicated as it was said fired upon the troops from the windows of a large house the soldiers rushed in drove them into the cellar set fire to the house and left them to perish in the flames there was a great quantity of stores of all kinds in the village and no vehicles to convey them to the ships the work of destruction commenced the soldiers made free with the liquors found in abundance and throughout the greater part of the night there was revel drunkenness blasphemy and devastation tryon full of anxiety and aware that the country was rising ordered a retreat before daylight setting fire to the magazines to complete the destruction of the stores the flames spread to the other edifices and almost the whole village was soon in a blaze  while these scenes had been transacted at danbury the connecticut yeomanry had been gathering fairfield and the adjacent counties had poured out their minute men general silliman had advanced at the head of five hundred generals wooster and arnold joined him with their chance followers as did a few more militia a heavy rain retarded their march it was near midnight when they reached bethel within four miles of danbury here they halted to take a little repose and put their arms in order rendered almost unserviceable by the rain they were now about six hundred strong wooster took the command as first majorgeneral of the militia of the state though in the sixtyeighth year of his age he was full of ardor with almost youthful fire and daring at dawn of day wooster detached arnold with four hundred men to push across the country and take post at ridgefield by which the british must pass while he with two hundred remained to hang on and harass them in flank and rear  the british began their retreat early in the morning conducting it in regular style with flanking parties and a rearguard well furnished with artillery as soon as they had passed his position wooster attacked the rearguard with great spirit and effect there was sharp skirmishing until within two miles of ridgefield when as the veteran was cheering on his men who began to waver a musket ball brought him down from his horse and finished his gallant career on his fall his men retreated in disorder  the delay which his attack had occasioned to the enemy had given arnold time to throw up a kind of breastwork or barricade across the road at the north end of ridgefield where he took his stand with his little force now increased to about five hundred men about eleven oclock the enemy advanced in column with artillery and flanking parties they were kept at bay for a time and received several volleys from the barricade until it was outflanked and carried arnold ordered a retreat and was bringing off the rear guard when his horse was shot under him and came down upon his knees arnold remained seated in the saddle with one foot entangled in the stirrups a tory soldier seeing his plight rushed towards him with fixed bayonet he had just time to draw a pistol from the holster youre my prisoner cried the tory not yet exclaimed arnold and shot him dead then extricating his foot from the stirrup he threw himself into the thickets of a neighboring swamp and escaped unharmed by the bullets that whistled after him and joined his retreating troops  general tryon intrenched for the night in ridgefield his troops having suffered greatly in their harassed retreat the next morning after having set fire to four houses he continued his march for the ships the militia hung on the rear of the enemy as soon as they were in motion arnold was again in the field with his rallied forces strengthened by lieutenantcolonel oswald with two companies of lambs artillery regiment and three fieldpieces with these he again posted himself on the enemys route difficulties and annoyances had multiplied upon the latter at every step when they came in sight of the position where arnold was waiting for them they changed their route wheeled to the left and made for a ford of saugatuck river arnold hastened to cross the bridge and take them in flank but they were too quick for him colonel lamb had now reached the scene of action as had about two hundred volunteers leaving to oswald the charge of the artillery he put himself at the head of the volunteers and led them up to arnolds assistance the enemy finding themselves hard pressed pushed for canepo hill they reached it in the evening without a round of ammunition in their cartridgeboxes as they were now within cannon shot of their ships the americans ceased the pursuit  in this inroad the enemy destroyed a considerable amount of military stores and seventeen hundred tents prepared for the use of washingtons army in the ensuing campaign the loss of general wooster was deeply deplored as to arnold his gallantry in this affair gained him fresh laurels and congress to remedy their late error promoted him to the rank of majorgeneral still this promotion did not restore him to his proper position he was at the bottom of the list of majorgenerals with four officers above him his juniors in service as an additional balm to his wounded pride congress a few days afterwards voted that a horse properly caparisoned should be presented to him in their name as a token of their approbation of his gallant conduct in the late action  the destructive expeditions against the american depots of military stores were retaliated in kind by colonel meigs a spirited officer who had accompanied arnold in his expedition through the wilderness against quebec having received intelligence that the british commissaries had collected a great amount of grain forage and other supplies at sag harbor a small port in the deep bay which forks the east end of long island he crossed the sound on the 23d of may from guilford in connecticut with about one hundred and seventy men in whaleboats convoyed by two armed sloops landed on the island near southold carried the boats a distance of fifteen miles across the north fork of the bay launched them into the latter crossed it landed within four miles of sag harbor and before daybreak carried the place which was guarded by a company of foot a furious fire of round and grape shot was opened upon the americans from an armed schooner anchored about one hundred and fifty yards from shore and stout defence was made by the crews of a dozen brigs and sloops lying at the wharf to take in freight but meigs succeeded in burning these vessels destroying everything on shore and carrying off ninety prisoners among whom were the officers of the company of foot the commissaries and the captains of most of the small vessels washington was so highly pleased with the spirit and success of this enterprise that he publicly returned thanks to colonel meigs and the officers and men engaged in it  the committee of inquiry on general schuylers conduct had now made their report to congress in which they placed the character of that officer higher than ever as an able and active commander and a zealous and disinterested patriot schuyler made a memorial to congress explaining away or apologizing for the expressions in his letter of the 4th of february which had given offence to the house which was so far satisfactory that congress informed him that their sentiments concerning him were now the same as those entertained before the reception of his objectionable letter some warm discussions now ensued in congress relative to the northern command in which it was stated that general gates misapprehended his position and that in sending him to ticonderoga it was not the intention of congress to give him the same command formerly held by schuyler the friends of gates on the other hand pronounced it an absurdity that an officer holding so important a post as ticonderoga should be under the order of another a hundred miles distant the discussion terminated by declaring ticonderoga fort stanwix and their defenders to be the northern department over which schuyler was to have supreme command  schuyler was received with open arms at albany on the 3d of june i had the satisfaction writes he to experience the finest feelings which my country expressed on my arrival and reappointment the day after my arrival the whole county committee did me the honor in form to congratulate me gates was still in albany delaying to proceed with general fermois to ticonderoga until the garrison should be sufficiently strengthened although the resolve of congress did but define his position which had been misunderstood he persisted in considering himself degraded declined serving under general schuyler who would have given him the post at ticonderoga in his absence and obtaining permission to leave the department set out on the 9th for philadelphia to demand redress of congress  general st clair was sent to take command of the troops at ticonderoga accompanied by general de fermois as the whole force in the northern department would not be sufficient to command the extensive works there on both sides of the lake st clair was instructed to bestow his first attention in fortifying mount independence on the east side schuyler considering it much the most defensible and that it might be made capable of sustaining a long and vigorous siege it would be imprudent he thought to station the greater part of the forces at fort ticonderoga as should the enemy be able to invest it and cut off the communication with the country on the east side it might experience a disaster similar to that at fort washington  while schuyler was thus providing for the security of ticonderoga gates was wending his way to philadelphia his bosom swelling with imaginary wrongs he arrived there on the 18th the next day at noon mr roger sherman an eastern delegate informed congress that general gates was waiting at the door and wished admittance gates was accordingly ushered in took his seat and proceeded to give some news concerning the indians he then opened upon the real object of his visit stating in a flurried and disjointed manner how that some time in march he had been appointed to a command in the northern department but that a few days ago without having given any cause of offence without accusation without trial without hearing without notice he had received a resolution by which he was in a most disgraceful manner superseded in his command here his irritated feelings got the better of his judgment and he indulged in angry reproaches of congress his conduct was pronounced disrespectful and it was moved and seconded that he be requested to withdraw it was then determined that he should not again be admitted on the floor but should be informed that congress were ready and willing to hear by way of memorial any grievances of which he might have to complain     chapter xli the highlandsmovements of the army   the highland passes of the hudson always objects of anxious thought to washington were especially so at this juncture general mcdougall still commanded at peekskill and general george clinton who resided at new windsor had command of the highland forts the latter at the earnest request of the new york convention had received from congress the command of brigadiergeneral in the continental army when the unhappy affair of peekskill had alarmed the convention of new york for the safety of the forts on the highlands clinton authorized by that body had ordered out part of the militia of orange dutchess and westchester counties without waiting for washingtons approbation of the measure he had strengthened also with anchors and cables the chain drawn across the river at fort montgomery a few days later came word that several transports were anchored at dobbs ferry in the tappan sea it might be intended to divert attention from a movement towards the delaware or to make incursions into the country back of morristown seize on the passes through the mountains and cut off the communication between the army and the hudson to frustrate such a design washington ordered clinton to post as good a number of troops from his garrison as he could spare on the mountains west of the river  on the 12th of may general greene received instructions from washington to proceed to the highlands and examine the state and condition of the forts especially fort montgomery the probability of an attack by water the practicability of an approach by land where and how this could be effected and the eminences whence the forts could be annoyed this done and the opinions of the general officers present having been consulted he was to give such orders and make such disposition of the troops as might appear necessary for the greater security of the passes by land and water when reconnoitring the highlands in the preceding year washington had remarked a wild and rugged pass on the western side of the hudson round bull hill a rocky forestclad mountain forming an advance rampart at the entrance to peekskill bay this pass he observed should also be attended to lest the enemy by a coup de main should possess themselves of it before a sufficient force could be assembled to oppose them subsequent events will illustrate though unfortunately the sagacity and foresight of this particular instruction  general knox was associated with general greene in this visit of inspection they examined the river and the passes of the highlands in company with generals mcdougall george clinton and anthony wayne the latter recently promoted to the rank of brigadier had just returned from ticonderoga the five generals made a joint report to washington in which they recommended the completion of the obstructions in the river already commenced these consisted of a boom or heavy iron chain across the river from fort montgomery to anthonys nose with cables stretched in front to break the force of any ship under way before she could strike it the boom was to be protected by the guns of two ships and two row galleys stationed just above it and by batteries on shore this it was deemed would be sufficient to prevent the enemys ships from ascending the river if these obstructions could be rendered effective they did not think the enemy would attempt to operate by land the passes through the highlands being so exceedingly difficult  illustration view from fort montgomery vol i  the general command of the hudson was offered by washington to arnold intending thus publicly to manifest his opinion of his deserts and hoping by giving him so important a post to appease his irritated feelings arnold however declined to accept it in an interview with washington at morristown he alleged his anxiety to proceed to philadelphia and settle his public accounts which were of considerable amount especially as reports had been circulated injurious to his character as a man of integrity he intended therefore to wait on congress and request a committee of inquiry into his conduct beside he did not consider the promotion conferred on him by congress sufficient to obviate their previous neglect with these considerations he proceeded to philadelphia bearing a letter from washington to the president of congress countenancing his complaints and testifying to the excellence of his military character we may here add that the accusations against him were pronounced false and slanderous by the board of war  the important command of the hudson being declined by arnold was now given to putnam who repaired forthwith to peekskill he set about promptly to carry into effect the measures of security which greene and knox had recommended especially the boom and chain at fort montgomery about which general george clinton had busied himself a large part of the new york and new england troops were stationed at this post not merely to guard the hudson but to render aid either to the eastern or middle states in case of exigency  about this time washington had the satisfaction of drawing near to him his old friend and travelling companion dr james craik the same who had served with him in braddocks campaign and had voyaged with him down the ohio for whom he now procured the appointment of assistant directorgeneral of the hospital department of the middle district which included the states between the hudson and the potomac  towards the end of may washington broke up his cantonments at morristown and shifted his camp to middlebrook within ten miles of brunswick his whole force fit for duty was now about seven thousand three hundred men all from the states south of the hudson there were fortythree regiments forming ten brigades commanded by brigadiers muhlenberg weedon woodford scott smallwood deborre wayne dehaas conway and maxwell these were apportioned into five divisions of two brigades each under majorgenerals greene stephen sullivan lincoln and stirling the artillery was commanded by knox sullivan with his division was stationed on the right at princeton with the rest of his force washington fortified himself in a position naturally strong among hills in the rear of the village of middlebrook his camp was on all sides difficult of approach and he rendered it still more so by intrenchments the high grounds about it commanded a wide view of the country around brunswick the road to philadelphia and the course of the raritan so that the enemy could make no important movement on land without his perceiving it  on the 31st of may reports were brought to camp that a fleet of a hundred sail had left new york and stood out to sea whither bound and how freighted was unknown if they carried troops their destination might be delaware bay eighteen transports also had arrived at new york with troops in foreign uniforms which proved to be anspachers and other german mercenaries there were british reinforcements also and what was particularly needed a supply of tents and camp equipage sir william howe had been waiting for the latter and likewise until the ground should be covered with grass the country was now in full verdure affording green forage in abundance and all things seemed to sir william propitious for the opening of the campaign early in june therefore he gave up ease and gayety and luxurious life at new york and crossing into the jerseys set up his headquarters at brunswick  as soon as washington ascertained that sir williams attention was completely turned to this quarter he determined to strengthen his position with all the force that could be spared from other parts so as to be able in case a favorable opportunity presented to make an attack upon the enemy in the meantime he would harass them with his light militia troops aided by a few continentals so as to weaken their numbers by continual skirmishes with this view he ordered general putnam to send down most of the continental troops from peekskill leaving only a number sufficient in conjunction with the militia to guard that post against surprise  arnold in this critical juncture had been put in command of philadelphia a post which he had been induced to accept although the question of rank had not been adjusted to his satisfaction his command embraced the western bank of the delaware with all its fords and passes and he took up his station there with a strong body of militia supported by a few continentals to oppose any attempt of the enemy to cross the river he was instructed by washington to give him notice by expresses posted on the road if any fleet should appear in delaware bay and to endeavor to concert signals with the camp of sullivan at princeton by alarm fires upon the hills  on the night of the 13th of june general howe sallied forth in great force from brunswick as if pushing directly for the delaware but his advanced guard halted at somerset courthouse about eight or nine miles distant apprised of this movement washington at daybreak reconnoitred the enemy from the heights before the camp he observed their front halting at the courthouse but a few miles distant while troops and artillery were grouped here and there along the road and the rearguard was still at brunswick it was a question with washington and his generals as they reconnoitred the enemy with their glasses whether this was a real move toward philadelphia or merely a lure to tempt them down from their strong position in this uncertainty washington drew out his army in battle array along the heights but kept quiet in the present state of his forces it was his plan not to risk a general action but should the enemy really march toward the delaware to hang heavily upon their rear  the british took up a strong position having millstone creek on their left the raritan all along their front and their right resting on brunswick and proceeded to fortify themselves with bastions  the american and british armies strongly posted remained four days grimly regarding each other both waiting to be attacked the jersey militia which now turned out with alacrity repaired some to washingtons camp others to that of sullivan the latter had fallen back from princeton and taken a position behind the sourland hills  howe pushed out detachments and made several feints as if to pass by the american camp and march to the delaware but washington was not to be deceived baffled in these attempts to draw his cautious adversary into a general action howe on the 19th suddenly broke up his camp and pretended to return with some precipitation to brunswick burning as he went several valuable dwelling houses washingtons light troops hovered round the enemy as far as the raritan and millstone which secured their flanks would permit but the main army kept to its stronghold on the heights  on the next day came warlike news from the north amesbury a british spy had been seized and examined by schuyler burgoyne was stated as being arrived at quebec to command the forces in an invasion from canada while he advanced with his main force by lake champlain a detachment of british troops canadians and indians led by sir john johnson was to penetrate by oswego to the mohawk river and place itself between fort stanwix and fort edward if this information was correct ticonderoga would soon be attacked the force there might be sufficient for its defence but schuyler would have no troops to oppose the inroad of sir john johnson and he urged a reinforcement washington forthwith sent orders to putnam to procure sloops and hold four massachusetts regiments in readiness to go up the river at a moments warning  on the 22d sir william again marched out of brunswick but this time proceeded towards amboy again burning several houses on the way hoping perhaps that the sight of columns of smoke rising from a ravaged country would irritate the americans and provoke an attack washington sent out three brigades under general greene to fall upon the rear of the enemy while morgan hung upon their skirts with his riflemen at the same time the army remained paraded on the heights ready to yield support if necessary finding that howe had actually sent his heavy baggage and part of his troops over to staten island washington on the 24th left the heights and descended to quibbletown now new market six or seven miles on the road to amboy to be nearer at hand for the protection of his advanced parties  general howe now thought he had gained his point recalling those who had crossed he formed his troops into two columns the right led by cornwallis the left by himself and marched back rapidly by different routes from amboy he had three objects in view to cut off the principal advanced parties of the americans to come up with and bring the main body into an engagement near quibbletown or that lord cornwallis making a considerable circuit to the right should turn the left of washingtons position get to the heights take possession of the passes and oblige him to abandon that stronghold where he had hitherto been so secure washington however had timely notice of his movements and penetrating his design regained his fortified camp at middlebrook and secured the passes of the mountains he then detached a body of light troops under brigadiergeneral scott together with morgans riflemen to hang on the flank of the enemy and watch their motions  cornwallis in his circuitous march dispersed the light parties of the advance but fell in with lord stirlings division strongly posted in a woody country and well covered by artillery judiciously disposed a sharp skirmish ensued when the americans gave way and retreated to the hills with the loss of a few men and three fieldpieces while the british halted at westfield disappointed in the main objects of their enterprise  perceiving that every scheme of bringing the americans to a general action or at least of withdrawing them from their strongholds was rendered abortive by the caution and prudence of washington and aware of the madness of attempting to march to the delaware through a hostile country with such a force in his rear sir william howe broke up his headquarters at amboy on the last of june and crossed over to staten island on the floating bridge and it was soon apparent that at length the enemy had really evacuated the jerseys  the question now was what would be their next move a great stir among the shipping seemed to indicate an expedition by water but whither circumstances occurred to perplex the question  scarce had the last tent been struck and the last transport disappeared from before amboy when intelligence arrived from general st clair announcing the appearance of a hostile fleet on lake champlain and that general burgoyne with the whole canada army was approaching ticonderoga the judgment and circumspection of washington were never more severely put to the proof was this merely a diversion with a small force of light troops and indians intended to occupy the attention of the american forces in that quarter while the main body of the army in canada should come round by sea and form a junction with the army under howe but general burgoyne in washingtons opinion was a man of too much spirit and enterprise to return from england merely to execute a plan from which no honor was to be derived did he really intend to break through by the way of ticonderoga in that case it must be howes plan to cooperate with him his next move in such case would be to ascend the hudson seize on the highland passes before washington could form a union with the troops stationed there and thus open the way for the junction with burgoyne should washington however on such a presumption hasten with his troops to peekskill leaving general howe on staten island what would prevent the latter from pushing to philadelphia by south amboy or any other route  such were the perplexities and difficulties presenting themselves under every aspect of the case in this dilemma washington sent generals parsons and varnum with a couple of brigades in all haste to peekskill and wrote to generals george clinton and putnamthe former to call out the new york militia from orange and ulster counties the latter to summon the militia from connecticut and as soon as such reinforcements should be at hand to despatch four of the strongest massachusetts regiments to the aid of ticonderoga general sullivan moreover was ordered to advance with his division towards the highlands as far as pompton while washington moved his own camp back to morristown to be ready either to push on to the highlands or fall back upon his recent position at middlebrook according to the movements of the enemy  deserters from staten island and new york soon brought word to the camp that transports were being fitted up with berths for horses and taking in three weeks supply of water and provender all this indicated some other destination than that of the hudson lest an attempt on the eastern states should be intended washington sent a circular to their governors to put them on their guard  in the midst of his various cares his yeoman soldiery the jersey militia were not forgotten it was their harvest time and the state being evacuated there was no immediate call for their services he dismissed therefore almost the whole of them to their homes     chapter xlii invasion from canada   the armament advancing against ticonderoga of which general st clair had given intelligence was not a mere diversion but a regular invasion the plan of which had been devised by the king lord george germain and general burgoyne the latter having returned to england from canada in the preceding year the junction of the two armiesthat in canada and that under general howe in new yorkwas considered the speediest mode of quelling the rebellion and as the security and good government of canada required the presence of governor sir guy carleton three thousand men were to remain there with him the residue of the army was to be employed upon two expeditionsthe one under general burgoyne who was to force his way to albany the other under lieutenantcolonel st leger who was to make a diversion on the mohawk river  the invading army was composed of three thousand seven hundred and twentyfour british rank and file three thousand sixteen germans mostly brunswickers two hundred and fifty canadians and four hundred indians beside these there were four hundred and seventythree artillery men in all nearly eight thousand men the army was admirably appointed its brass train of artillery was extolled as perhaps the finest ever allotted to an army of the size general phillips who commanded the artillery had gained great reputation in the wars in germany brigadiersgeneral fraser powel and hamilton were also officers of distinguished merit so was majorgeneral the baron riedesel a brunswicker who commanded the german troops  while burgoyne with the main force proceeded from st johns colonel st leger with a detachment of regulars and canadians about seven hundred strong was to land at oswego and guided by sir john johnson at the head of his loyalist volunteers tory refugees from his former neighborhood and a body of indians was to enter the mohawk country draw the attention of general schuyler in that direction attack fort stanwix and having ravaged the valley of the mohawk rejoin burgoyne at albany where it was expected they would make a triumphant junction with the army of sir william howe  schuyler was uncertain as to the plans and force of the enemy if information gathered from scouts and a captured spy might be relied on ticonderoga would soon be attacked this information he transmitted to washington from fort edward on the 16th the very day that burgoyne embarked at st johns on the following day schuyler was at ticonderoga the works were not in such a state of forwardness as he had anticipated owing to the tardy arrival of troops and the want of a sufficient number of artificers the works in question related chiefly to mount independence a high circular hill on the east side of the lake immediately opposite to the old fort and considered the most defensible a star fort with pickets crowned the summit of the hill which was table land half way down the side of a hill was a battery and at its foot were strongly intrenched works well mounted with cannon here the french general de fermois who had charge of this fort was posted  as this part of lake champlain is narrow a connection was kept up between the two forts by a floating bridge supported on twentytwo sunken piers in caissons formed of very strong timber between the piers were separate floats fifty feet long and twelve feet wide strongly connected by iron chains and rivets on the north side of the bridge was a boom composed of large pieces of timber secured by riveted bolts and beside this was a double iron chain with links an inch and a half square the bridge boom and chain were four hundred yards in length this immense work the labor of months on which no expense had been spared was intended while it afforded a communication between the two forts to protect the upper part of the lake presenting under cover of their guns a barrier which it was presumed no hostile ship would be able to break through  illustration ruins of fort ticonderoga vol i  having noted the state of affairs and the wants of the garrison schuyler hastened to fort george whence he sent on provisions for upwards of sixty days and from the banks of the hudson additional carpenters and working cattle in the meantime burgoyne with his amphibious and semibarbarous armament was advancing up the lake by the 24th scouts began to bring in word of the approaching foe bark canoes had been seen filled with white men and savages then three vessels under sail and one at anchor above split rock and behind it the radeau thunderer anon came word of encampments sufficient for a large body of troops on both sides of gillilands creek with bateaux plying about its waters and painted warriors gliding about in canoes st clair wrote word of all this to schuyler and that it was supposed the enemy were waiting the arrival of more force schuyler urged washington for reinforcements as soon as possible and hastened to albany to bring up the militia  while there he received word from st clair that the enemys fleet and army were arrived at crown point and had sent off detachments one up otter creek to cut off the communication by skenesborough and another on the west side of the lake to cut off fort george claims for assistance came hurrying on from other quarters a large force st legers was said to be arrived at oswego and sir john johnson with his myrmidons on his way to attack fort schuyler the garrison of which was weak and poorly supplied with cannon  schuyler bestirs himself with his usual zeal amid the thickening alarms he writes urgent letters to the committee of safety of new york to general putnam at peekskill to the governor of connecticut to the president of massachusetts to the committee of berkshire and lastly to washington stating the impending dangers and imploring reinforcements he exhorts general herkimer to keep the militia of tryon county in readiness to protect the western frontier and to check the inroad of sir john johnson and he assures st clair that he will move to his aid with the militia of new york as soon as he can collect them  dangers accumulate at ticonderoga according to advices from st clair 28th seven of the enemys vessels are lying at crown point the rest of their fleet is probably but a little lower down morning guns are heard distinctly at various places some troops have debarked and encamped at chimney point there is no prospect he says of being able to defend ticonderoga unless militia come in and he has thought of calling in those from berkshire should the enemy invest and blockade us writes he we are infallibly ruined we shall be obliged to abandon this side of the lake and then they will soon force the other from us nor do i see that a retreat will in any shape be practicable  the enemy came advancing up the lake on the 30th their main body under burgoyne on the west side the german reserve under baron riedesel on the east communication being maintained by frigates and gunboats which in a manner kept pace between them on the 1st of july burgoyne encamped four miles north of ticonderoga and began to intrench and to throw a boom across the lake his advanced guard under general fraser took post at three mile point and the ships anchored just out of gunshot of the fort  general st clair was a gallant scotchman who had seen service in the old french war as well as in this and beheld the force arrayed against him without dismay it is true his garrison was not numerous not exceeding three thousand five hundred men of whom nine hundred were militia they were badly equipped also and few had bayonets yet they were in good heart schuyler at this time was at albany sending up reinforcements of continental troops and militia and awaiting the arrival of further reinforcements for which sloops had been sent down to peekskill he was endeavoring also to provide for the security of the department in other quarters the savages had been scalping in the neighborhood of fort schuyler a set of renegade indians were harassing the settlements on the susquehanna and the threatenings of brant the famous indian chief and the prospect of a british inroad by the way of oswego had spread terror through tryon county the inhabitants of which called upon him for support  such was the state of affairs in the north of which washington from time to time had been informed an attack on ticonderoga appeared to be impending but as the garrison was in good heart the commander resolute and troops were on the way to reinforce him a spirited and perhaps successful resistance was anticipated by washington his surprise may therefore be imagined on receiving a letter from schuyler dated july 7th conveying the astounding intelligence that ticonderoga was evacuated  schuyler had just received the news at stillwater on the hudson when on his way with reinforcements for the fortress the first account was so vague that washington hoped it might prove incorrect it was confirmed by another letter from schuyler dated on the 9th at fort edward a part of the garrison had been pursued by a detachment of the enemy as far as fort anne in that neighborhood where the latter had been repulsed as to st clair himself and the main part of his forces they had thrown themselves into the forest and nothing was known what had become of them i am here writes schuyler at the head of a handful of men not above fifteen hundred with little ammunition not above five rounds to a man having neither balls nor lead to make any the country is in the deepest consternation no carriages to remove the stores from fort george which i expect every moment to hear is attacked and what adds to my distress is that a report prevails that i had given orders for the evacuation of ticonderoga  washingtons first attention was to supply the wants of general schuyler an express was sent to springfield for musket cartridges gunpowder lead and cartridge papers ten pieces of artillery with harness and proper officers were to be forwarded from peekskill as well as intrenching tools of tents he had none to furnish neither could heavy cannon be spared from the defence of the highlands six hundred recruits on their march from massachusetts to peekskill were ordered to repair to his aidthis was all the force that washington could venture at this moment to send but this addition to his troops supposing those under st clair should have come in and any number of militia have turned out would probably form an army equal if not superior to that said to be under burgoyne beside it was washingtons idea that the latter would suspend his operations until general howe should make a movement in concert supposing that movement would be an immediate attempt against the highlands he ordered sullivan with his division to peekskill to reinforce general putnam at the same time he advanced with his main army to pompton and thence to the clove a rugged defile through the highlands on the west side of the hudson we will leave washington at his encampment in the clove anxiously watching the movements of the fleet and the lower army while we turn to the north to explain the mysterious retreat of general st clair  in the accounts given of the approach of burgoyne to ticonderoga it was stated that he had encamped four miles north of the fortress and intrenched himself on the 2d of july indian scouts made their appearance in the vicinity of a blockhouse and some outworks about the strait or channel leading to lake george as general st clair did not think the garrison sufficient to defend all the outposts these works with some adjacent sawmills were set on fire and abandoned the extreme left of ticonderoga was weak and might easily be turned a post had therefore been established in the preceding year nearly half a mile in advance of the old french lines on an eminence to the north of them general st clair through singular remissness had neglected to secure it burgoyne soon discovered this neglect and hastened to detach general phillips and fraser with a body of infantry and light artillery to take possession of this post they did so without opposition heavy guns were mounted upon it frasers whole corps was stationed there the post commanded the communication by land and water with lake george so as to cut off all supplies from that quarter in fact such were the advantages expected from this post thus neglected by st clair that the british gave it the significant name of mount hope  the enemy now proceeded gradually to invest ticonderoga a line of troops was drawn from the western part of mount hope round to three mile point where general fraser was posted with the advance guard while general riedesel encamped with the german reserve in a parallel line on the opposite side of lake champlain at the foot of mount independence for two days the enemy occupied themselves in making their advances and securing these positions regardless of a cannonade kept up by the american batteries  with all the pains and expense lavished by the americans to render these works impregnable they had strangely neglected the master key by which they were all commanded this was sugar hill a rugged height the termination of a mountain ridge which separates lake champlain from lake george it stood to the south of ticonderoga beyond the narrow channel which connected the two lakes and rose precipitously from the waters of champlain to the height of six hundred feet it had been pronounced by the americans too distant to be dangerous colonel trumbull some time an aidedecamp to washington had proved the contrary in the preceding year by throwing a shot from a sixpounder in the fort nearly to the summit it was then pronounced inaccessible to an enemy this trumbull had likewise proved to be an error by clambering with arnold and wayne to the top whence they perceived that a practicable road for artillery might easily and readily be made trumbull had insisted that this was the true point for the fort commanding the neighboring heights the narrow parts of both lakes and the communication between his suggestions were disregarded their wisdom was now to be proved  the british general phillips on taking his position had regarded the hill with a practised eye he caused it to be reconnoitred by a skilful engineer the report was that it overlooked and had the entire command of fort ticonderoga and fort independencebeing about fourteen hundred yards from the former and fifteen hundred from the latter that the ground could be levelled for cannon and a road cut up the defiles of the mountain in four and twenty hours measures were instantly taken to plant a battery on that height while the american garrisons were entirely engaged in a different direction cannonading mount hope and the british lines without material effect and without provoking a reply the british troops were busy throughout the day and night cutting a road through rocks and trees and up rugged defiles guns ammunition and stores all were carried up the hill in the night the cannon were hauled up from tree to tree and before morning the ground was levelled for the battery on which they were to be mounted to this work thus achieved by a coup de main they gave the name of fort defiance  on the 5th of july to their astonishment and consternation the garrison beheld a legion of redcoats on the summit of this hill constructing works which must soon lay the fortress at their mercy in this appalling emergency general st clair called a council of war what was to be done the batteries from this new fort would probably be open the next day by that time ticonderoga might be completely invested and the whole garrison exposed to capture they had not force sufficient for one half the works and general schuyler supposed to be at albany could afford them no relief the danger was imminent delay might prove fatal it was unanimously determined to evacuate both ticonderoga and mount independence that very night and to retreat to skenesborough now whitehall at the upper part of the lake about thirty miles distant where there was a stockaded fort the main body of the army led by general st clair were to cross to mount independence and push for skenesborough by land taking a circuitous route through the woods on the east side of the lake by the way of castleton  the cannon stores and provisions together with the wounded and the women were to be embarked on board of two hundred bateaux and conducted to the upper extremity of the lake by colonel long with six hundred men two hundred of whom in five armed galleys were to form a rearguard  it was now three oclock in the afternoon yet all the preparations were to be made for the coming night and that with as little bustle and movement as possible for they were overlooked by fort defiance and their intentions might be suspected everything therefore was done quietly but alertly in the meantime to amuse the enemy a cannonade was kept up every half hour toward the new battery on the hill as soon as the evening closed and their movements could not be discovered they began in all haste to load the boats such of the cannon as could not be taken were ordered to be spiked everything was conducted with such silence and address that although it was a moonlight night the flotilla departed undiscovered and was soon under the shadows of mountains and overhanging forests  the retreat by land was not conducted with equal discretion and mystery general st clair had crossed over the bridge to the vermont side of the lake by three oclock in the morning and set forward with his advance through the woods toward hubbardton but before the rearguard under colonel francis got in motion the house at fort independence which had been occupied by the french general de fermois was set on fireby his orders it is said though we are loth to charge him with such indiscretion such gross and wanton violation of the plan of retreat the consequences were disastrous the british sentries at mount hope were astonished by a conflagration suddenly lighting up mount independence and revealing the american troops in full retreat for the rearguard disconcerted by this sudden exposure pressed forward for the woods in the utmost haste and confusion  the drums beat to arms in the british camp alarm guns were fired from mount hope general fraser dashed into ticonderoga with his pickets giving orders for his brigade to arm in all haste and follow by daybreak he had hoisted the british flag over the deserted fortress before sunrise he had passed the bridge and was in full pursuit of the american rearguard  burgoynes measures were prompt general riedesel was ordered to follow and support fraser with a part of the german troops garrisons were thrown into ticonderoga and mount independence the main part of the army was embarked on board of the frigates and gunboats the floating bridge with its boom and chain which had cost months to construct was broken through by nine oclock when burgoyne set out with his squadron in pursuit of the flotilla  we left the latter making its retreat on the preceding evening towards skenesborough the lake above ticonderoga becomes so narrow that in those times it was frequently called south river the bateaux deeply laden made their way slowly in a lengthened line the rearguard of armed galleys followed at wary distance no immediate pursuit however was apprehended the floating bridge was considered an effectual impediment to the enemys fleet  about three oclock in the afternoon of the succeeding day the heavily laden bateaux arrived at skenesborough the disembarkation had scarcely commenced when the thundering of artillery was heard from below could the enemy be at hand it was even so the british gunboats having pushed on in advance of the frigates had overtaken and were firing upon the galleys the latter defended themselves for a while but at length two struck and three were blown up the fugitives from them brought word that the british ships not being able to come up troops and indians were landing from them and scrambling up the hills intending to get in the rear of the fort and cut off all retreat  all now was consternation and confusion the bateaux the storehouses the fort the mill were all set on fire and a general flight took place toward fort anne about twelve miles distant some made their way in boats up wood creek a winding stream the main body under colonel long retreated by a narrow defile cut through the woods harassed all night by alarms that the indians were close in pursuit both parties reached fort anne by daybreak it was a small picketed fort near the junction of wood creek and east creek about sixteen miles from fort edward general schuyler arrived at the latter place on the following day the number of troops with him was inconsiderable but hearing of colonel longs situation he immediately sent him a small reinforcement with provisions and ammunition and urged him to maintain his post resolutely on the same day colonel longs scouts brought in word that there were british redcoats approaching they were in fact a regiment under lieutenantcolonel hill detached from skenesborough by burgoyne in pursuit of the fugitives long sallied forth to meet them posting himself at a rocky defile as the enemy advanced he opened a heavy fire upon them in front the british took post upon a high hill to their right where they were warmly besieged for nearly two hours and would certainly have been forced had not some of their indian allies arrived this changed the fortune of the day the americans had nearly expended their ammunition and had not enough left to cope with this new enemy they retreated therefore to fort anne carrying with them a number of prisoners supposing the troops under colonel hill an advance guard of burgoynes army they set fire to the fort and pushed on to fort edward  st clairs retreat through the woods from mount independence continued the first day until night when he arrived at castleton thirty miles from ticonderoga his rearguard halted about six miles short at hubbardton to await the arrival of stragglers it was composed of three regiments under colonels seth warner francis and hale in all about thirteen hundred men early the next morning a sultry morning of july while they were taking their breakfast they were startled by the report of firearms their sentries had discharged their muskets and came running in with word that the enemy were at hand  it was general fraser with his advance of eight hundred and fifty men who had pressed forward in the latter part of the night and now attacked the americans with great spirit notwithstanding their superiority in numbers in fact he expected to be promptly reinforced by riedesel and his germans the americans met the british with great spirit but at the very commencement of the action colonel hale with a detachment placed under his command to protect the rear gave way leaving warner and francis with but seven hundred men to bear the brunt of the battle these posted themselves behind logs and trees in backwood style whence they kept up a destructive fire and were evidently gaining the advantage when general riedesel came pressing into the action with his german troops drums beating and colors flying there was now an impetuous charge with the bayonet colonel francis was among the first who fell gallantly fighting at the head of his men the americans thinking the whole german force upon them gave way and fled leaving the ground covered with their dead and wounded many others who had been wounded perished in the woods where they had taken refuge their whole loss in killed wounded and taken was upwards of three hundred that of the enemy one hundred and eightythree  the noise of the firing when the action commenced had reached general st clair at castleton he immediately sent orders to two militia regiments which were in his rear and within two miles of the battleground to hasten to the assistance of his rearguard they refused to obey and hurried forward to castleton at this juncture st clair received information of burgoynes arrival at skenesborough and the destruction of the american works there fearing to be intercepted at fort anne he immediately changed his route struck into the woods on his left and directed his march to rutland leaving word for warner to follow him the latter overtook him two days afterwards with his shattered force reduced to ninety men as to colonel hale who had pressed towards castleton at the beginning of the action he and his men were overtaken the same day by the enemy and the whole party captured without making any fight it has been alleged in his excuse with apparent justice that he and a large portion of his men were in feeble health and unfit for action for his own part he died while yet a prisoner and never had the opportunity which he sought to vindicate himself before a courtmartial  on the 12th st clair reached fort edward his troops haggard and exhausted by their long retreat through the woods such is the story of the catastrophe at fort ticonderoga which caused so much surprise and concern to washington and of the seven days mysterious disappearance of st clair which kept every one in the most painful suspense the loss of artillery ammunition provisions and stores in consequence of the evacuation of these northern posts was prodigious but the worst effect was the consternation spread throughout the country a panic prevailed at albany the people running about as if distracted sending off their goods and furniture the great barriers of the north it was said were broken through and there was nothing to check the triumphant career of the enemy     chapter xliii exploits and movementshowe in the chesapeake   a spirited exploit to the eastward was performed during the prevalence of adverse news from the north general prescott had command of the british forces in rhode island his harsh treatment of colonel ethan allen and his haughty and arrogant conduct on various occasions had rendered him peculiarly odious to the americans lieutenantcolonel barton who was stationed with a force of rhode island militia on the mainland received word that prescott was quartered at a country house near the western shore of the island about four miles from newport totally unconscious of danger though in a very exposed situation he determined if possible to surprise and capture him forty resolute men joined him in the enterprise embarking at night in two boats at warwick neck they pulled quietly across the bay with muffled oars undiscovered by the ships of war and guardboats landed in silence eluded the vigilance of the guard stationed near the house captured the sentry at the door and surprised the general in his bed his aidedecamp leaped from the window but was likewise taken colonel barton returned with equal silence and address and arrived safe at warwick with his prisoners a sword was voted to him by congress and he received a colonels commission in the regular army  washington hailed the capture of prescott as a peculiarly fortunate circumstance furnishing him with an equivalent for general lee he accordingly wrote to sir william howe proposing the exchange no immediate reply was received to this letter sir william howe being at sea in the meantime prescott remained in durance  washington continued his anxious exertions to counteract the operations of the enemy forwarding artillery and ammunition to schuyler with all the camp furniture that could be spared from his own encampment and from peekskill a part of nixons brigade was all the reinforcement he could afford in his present situation schuyler had earnestly desired the assistance of an active officer well acquainted with the country washington sent him arnold the question of rank about which arnold was so tenacious was yet unsettled and though had his promotion been regular he would have been superior in command to general st clair he assured washington that on the present occasion his claim should create no dispute  schuyler in the meantime aided by kosciuszko the pole who was engineer in his department had selected two positions on moses creek four miles below fort edward where the troops which had retreated from ticonderoga and part of the militia were throwing up works to impede the advance of the enemy he had caused trees to be felled into wood creek so as to render it unnavigable and the roads between fort edward and fort anne to be broken up the cattle in that direction to be brought away and the forage destroyed he had drawn off the garrison from fort george and left the buildings in flames  washington cheered on his faithful coadjutor his letters to schuyler were full of that confident hope founded on sagacious forecast with which he was prone to animate his generals in times of doubt and difficulty though our affairs for some days past have worn a dark and gloomy aspect i yet look forward to a fortunate and happy change i trust general burgoynes army will meet sooner or later an effectual check and as i suggested before that the success he has had will precipitate his ruin he pointed out that burgoyne in acting in detachment was pursuing the plan most favorable to the american cause if some of his detachments could be cut off it would have he said a most inspiriting effect he also addressed circulars to the brigadiergenerals of militia in the western portions of the eastern states urging reinforcements for schuyler the evacuation of ticonderoga he showed them had opened the door for the invasion of their district and that burgoyne if not vigorously opposed would be enabled to form a junction with general howe and thereby sever the communication between the eastern and northern states  washington now ordered that all the vessels and river craft not required at albany should be sent down to new windsor and fishkill and kept in readiness for he knew not how soon the movements of general howe might render it suddenly necessary to transport part of his forces up the hudson  further letters from schuyler urged the increasing exigencies of his situation it was harvest time the militia impatient at being detained from their rural labors were leaving him in great numbers in a council of general officers it had been thought advisable to give leave of absence to half lest the whole should depart he feared those who remained would do so but a few days the enemy were steadily employed cutting a road toward him from skenesborough in this position of affairs he urged to be reinforced as speedily as possible washington in reply informed him that he had ordered a further reinforcement of general glovers brigade which was all he could possibly furnish in his own exigencies he trusted affairs with schuyler would soon wear a more smiling aspect that the eastern states who were so deeply concerned in the matter would exert themselves by effectual succors to enable him to check the progress of the enemy and repel a danger by which they were immediately threatened i have directed general lincoln to repair to you as speedily as the state of his health which is not very perfect will permit this gentleman has always supported the character of a judicious brave active officer and he is exceedingly popular in the state of massachusetts to which he belongs he will have a degree of influence over the militia which cannot fail of being highly advantageous  washington highly approved of a measure suggested by schuyler of stationing a body of troops somewhere about the hampshire grants vermont so as to be in the rear or on the flank of burgoyne should he advance it would make the latter he said very circumspect in his advances if it did not entirely prevent them it would keep him in continual anxiety for his rear and oblige him to leave the posts behind him much stronger than he would otherwise do he advised that general lincoln should have the command of the corps thus posted as no person could be more proper for it  but now the attention of the commanderinchief is called to the seaboard on the 23d of july the fleet so long the object of watchful solicitude actually put to sea its destination was still a matter of conjecture just after it had sailed a young man presented himself at one of general putnams outposts he had been a prisoner in new york he said but had received his liberty and a large reward on undertaking to be the bearer of a letter from general howe to burgoyne this letter his feelings of patriotism prompted him to deliver up to general putnam the letter was immediately transmitted by the general to washington it was in the handwriting of howe and bore his signature in it he informed burgoyne that instead of any designs up the hudson he was bound to the east against boston washington at once pronounced the letter a feint no stronger proof could be given said he that howe is not going to the eastward the letter was evidently intended to fall into our hands i am persuaded more than ever that philadelphia is the place of destination  he now set out with his army for the delaware ordering sullivan and stirling with their divisions to cross the hudson from peekskill and proceed towards philadelphia on the 30th he writes from coryells ferry about thirty miles from philadelphia to general gates who was in that city as we are yet uncertain as to the real destination of the enemy though the delaware seems the most probable i have thought it prudent to halt the army at this place howells ferry and trenton at least till the fleet actually enters the bay and puts the matter beyond a doubt from hence we can be on the proper ground to oppose them before they can possibly make their arrangements and dispositions for an attack as i shall pay no regard to any flying reports of the appearance of the fleet i shall expect an account of it from you the moment you have ascertained it to your satisfaction  on the 31st he was informed that the enemys fleet of two hundred and twentyeight sail had arrived the day previous at the capes of delaware he instantly wrote to putnam to hurry on two brigades which had crossed the river and to let schuyler and the commanders in the eastern states know that they had nothing to fear from howe and might bend all their forces continental and militia against burgoyne in the meantime he moved his camp to germantown about six miles from philadelphia to be at hand for the defence of that city the very next day came word by express that the fleet had again sailed out of the capes and apparently shaped its course eastward this surprising event gives me the greatest anxiety writes he to putnam aug 1 the probability of his howe going to the eastward is exceedingly small and the ill effects that might attend such a step inconsiderable in comparison with those that would inevitably attend a successful stroke on the highlands  under this impression washington sent orders to sullivan to hasten back with his division and the two brigades which had recently left peekskill and to recross the hudson to that post as speedily as possible intending to forward the rest of the army with all the expedition in his power he wrote also to general george clinton to reinforce putnam with as many of the new york militia as could be collected clinton be it observed had just been installed governor of the state of new york the first person elevated to that office under the constitution he still continued in actual command of the militia of the state washington moreover requested putnam to send an express to governor trumbull urging assistance from the militia of his state without a moments loss of time  we have cited in a preceding page a letter from washington to gates at philadelphia requiring his vigilant attention to the movements of the enemys fleet that ambitious officer however was engrossed at the time by matters more important to his individual interests the command of the northern department seemed again within his reach the evacuation of ticonderoga had been imputed by many either to cowardice or treachery on the part of general st clair and the enemies of schuyler had for some time past been endeavoring to involve him in the disgrace of the transaction in the eagerness to excite popular feeling against him old slanders were revived and the failure of the invasion of canada and all the subsequent disasters in that quarter were again laid to his charge as commandinggeneral of the northern department  these charges which for some time existed merely in popular clamor had recently been taken up in congress and a strong demonstration had been made against him by some of the new england delegates your enemies in this quarter writes his friend the hon william duer july 29th are leaving no means unessayed to blast your character be not surprised if you should be desired to attend congress to give an account of the loss of ticonderoga with respect to the result of the inquiry i am under no apprehensions like gold tried in the fire i trust that you my dear friend will be found more pure and bright than ever  schuyler in reply expressed his eagerness to have his conduct subjected to official investigation but hoped the scrutiny would be postponed until after the engagement with the enemy which was now imminent schuylers enemies were determined however that he should be deprived of this chance of distinguishing himself and pushed the business so urgently in congress that a resolution was passed summoning both schuyler and st clair to headquarters to account for the misfortunes in the north schuylers unpopularity with the eastern troops was used as a powerful argument for this step it being asserted that the eastern militia were refusing to serve under him the nomination of his successor was left to washington who excused himself from the duty the appointment therefore was made by congress the eastern influence prevailed and gates received the command  about this time took effect a measure of congress making a complete change in the commissariat this important and complicated department had hitherto been under the management of one commissarygeneral colonel joseph trumbull of connecticut by the new arrangement there were to be two commissariesgeneral one of purchases the other of issues each to be appointed by congress they were to have several deputy commissaries under them but accountable to congress and to be appointed and removed by that body these and many subordinate arrangements had been adopted in opposition to the opinion of washington and most unfortunately were brought into operation in the midst of this perplexed and critical campaign their first effect was to cause the resignation of colonel trumbull who had been nominated commissary of purchases and the entrance into office of a number of inexperienced men the ultimate effect was to paralyze the organization of this vital department to cause delay and confusion in furnishing and forwarding supplies and to retard and embarrass the operations of the different armies throughout the year washington had many dangers and difficulties to harass and perplex him throughout this complicated campaign and not among the least may be classed the stumblings of congress  for several days washington remained at germantown in painful uncertainty about the british fleet whether gone to the south or to the east the intense heat of the weather made him unwilling again to move his army already excessively harassed by marchings and countermarchings concluding at length that the fleet had actually gone to the east he was once more on the way to recross the delaware when an express overtook him on the 10th of august with tidings that three days before it had been seen off sinepuxent inlet about sixteen leagues south of the capes of delaware  again he came to a halt and waited for further intelligence danger suggested itself from a different quarter might it not be howes plan by thus appearing with his ships at different places to lure the army after him and thereby leave the country open for sir henry clinton with the troops at new york to form a junction with burgoyne with this idea washington wrote forthwith to the veteran putnam to be on the alert collect all the force he could to strengthen his post at peekskill and send down spies to ascertain whether sir henry clinton was actually at new york and what troops he had there  the old general whose boast it was that he never slept but with one eye was already on the alert a circumstance had given him proof positive that sir henry was in new york and had roused his military ire a spy sent by that commander had been detected furtively collecting information of the force and condition of the post at peekskill and had undergone a military trial a vessel of war came up the hudson in all haste and landed a flag of truce at verplancks point by which a message was transmitted to putnam from sir henry clinton claiming edmund palmer as a lieutenant in the british service the reply of the old general was brief but emphatic  headquarters 7th aug 1777  edmund palmer an officer in the enemys service was taken as a spy lurking within our lines he has been tried as a spy condemned as a spy and shall be executed as a spy and the flag is ordered to depart immediately  israel putnam  p she has accordingly been executed  governor clinton the other guardian of the highlands and actually at his post at fort montgomery was equally on the alert he had faithfully followed washingtons directions in ordering out militia from different counties to reinforce his own garrison and the army under schuyler  one measure more was taken by washington during this interval in aid of the northern department the indians who accompanied burgoyne were objects of great dread to the american troops especially the militia as a counterpoise to them he now sent up colonel morgan with five hundred riflemen to fight them in their own way they are all chosen men said he selected from the army at large and well acquainted with the use of rifles and with that mode of fighting i expect the most eminent services from them and i shall be mistaken if their presence does not go far towards producing a general desertion among the savages  during his encampment in the neighborhood of philadelphia washington was repeatedly at that city making himself acquainted with the military capabilities of the place and its surrounding country and directing the construction of fortifications on the river in one of these visits he became acquainted with the young marquis de lafayette who had recently arrived from france in company with a number of french polish and german officers among whom was the baron de kalb the marquis was not quite twenty years of age yet had already been married nearly three years to a lady of rank and fortune full of the romance of liberty he had torn himself from his youthful bride turned his back upon the gayeties and splendors of a court and in defiance of impediments and difficulties multiplied in his path had made his way to america to join its hazardous fortunes  it was at a public dinner where a number of members of congress were present that lafayette first saw washington he immediately knew him he said from the officers who surrounded him by his commanding air and person when the party was breaking up washington took him aside complimented him in a gracious manner on his disinterested zeal and the generosity of his conduct and invited him to make headquarters his home  many days had now elapsed without further tidings of the fleet when the tormenting uncertainties concerning it were brought to an end by intelligence that it had actually entered the chesapeake and anchored at swan point at least two hundred miles within the capes by general howes coming so far up the chesapeake writes washington he must mean to reach philadelphia by that route though to be sure it is a strange one the mystery of these various appearances and vanishings which had caused so much wonder and perplexity is easily explained shortly before putting to sea with the ships of war howe had sent a number of transports and a ship cut down as a floating battery up the hudson which had induced washington to despatch troops to the highlands after putting to sea the fleet was a week in reaching the capes of delaware when there the commanders were deterred from entering the river by reports of measures taken to obstruct its navigation it was then determined to make for chesapeake bay and approach in that way as near as possible to philadelphia contrary winds however kept them for a long time from getting into the bay  lafayette in his memoirs describes a review of washingtons army which he witnessed about this time eleven thousand men but tolerably armed and still worse clad presented he said a singular spectacle in this particolored and often naked state the best dresses were hunting shirts of brown linen their tactics were equally irregular they were arranged without regard to size excepting that the smallest men were the front rank with all this there were goodlooking soldiers conducted by zealous officers the several divisions of the army had been summoned to the immediate neighborhood of philadelphia and the militia of pennsylvania delaware and the northern parts of virginia were called out many of the militia with colonel proctors corps of artillery had been ordered to rendezvous at chester on the delaware about twelve miles below philadelphia and by washingtons orders general wayne left his brigade under the next in command and repaired to chester to arrange the troops assembling there  as there had been much disaffection to the cause evinced in philadelphia washington in order to encourage its friends and dishearten its enemies marched with the whole army through the city down front and up chestnut street great pains were taken to make the display as imposing as possible all were charged to keep to their ranks carry their arms well and step in time to the music of the drums and fifes collected in the centre of each brigade washington rode at the head of the troops attended by his numerous staff with the marquis lafayette by his side the long column of the army broken into divisions and brigades the pioneers with their axes the squadrons of horse the extended trains of artillery the tramp of steed the bray of trumpet and the spiritstirring sound of drum and fife all had an imposing effect on a peaceful city unused to the sight of marshalled armies having marched through philadelphia the army continued on to wilmington at the confluence of christiana creek and the brandywine where washington set up his headquarters his troops being encamped on the neighboring heights     chapter xliv advance of burgoynebattle of oriskanybattle of bennington   in a preceding chapter we left burgoyne early in july at skenesborough of which he had just gained possession he remained there nearly three weeks awaiting the arrival of the residue of his troops with tents baggage and provisions and preparing for his grand move towards the hudson river the progress of the army towards the hudson was slow and difficult in consequence of the impediments which schuyler had multiplied in his way during his long halt at skenesborough bridges broken down had to be rebuilt great trees to be removed which had been felled across the roads and into wood creek which stream was completely choked it was not until the latter part of july that burgoyne reached fort anne at his approach general schuyler retired from fort edward and took post at fort miller a few miles lower down the hudson  the indian allies who had hitherto accompanied the british army had been more troublesome than useful they were of the tribes of lower canada corrupted and debased by intercourse with white men it had been found difficult to draw them from the plunder of ticonderoga or to restrain their murderous propensities a party had recently arrived of a different stampbraves of the ottawa and other tribes from the upper country painted and decorated with savage magnificence and bearing trophies of former triumphs they were under the conduct of two french leaders one named langlade the other named st luc is described by burgoyne as a canadian gentleman of honor and abilities and one of the best partisans of the french in the war of 1756 burgoyne trusted to his newlyarrived indians to give a check to the operations of schuyler knowing the terror they inspired throughout the country he was naturally a humane man and disliked indian allies but these had hitherto served in company with civilized troops and he trusted to the influence possessed over them by st luc and langlade to keep them within the usages of war a circumstance occurred however which showed how little the wild honor of these warriors of the tomahawk is to be depended upon  in general frasers division was a young officer lieutenant david jones an american loyalist his family had their home in the vicinity of fort edward before the revolution a mutual attachment had taken place between the youth and a beautiful girl named jane mccrea who resided with her brother on the banks of the hudson a few miles below fort edward the lovers were engaged to be married when the breaking out of the war severed families and disturbed all the relations of life the joneses were royalists the brother of miss mccrea was a stanch whig the former removed to canada where he joined the royal standard and received a lieutenants commission the attachment between the lovers continued and it is probable that a correspondence was kept up between them lieutenant jones was now in frasers camp in his old neighborhood miss mccrea was on a visit to a widow lady mrs oniel residing at fort edward the approach of burgoynes army had spread an alarm through the country the inhabitants were flying from their homes the brother of miss mccrea determined to remove to albany and sent for his sister to return home and make ready to accompany him she prepared reluctantly to obey and was to embark in a large bateaux which was to convey several families down the river the very morning when the embarkation was to take place the neighborhood was a scene of terror a marauding party of indians sent out by burgoyne to annoy general schuyler were harassing the country several of them burst into the house of mrs oniel sacked and plundered it and carried off her and miss mccrea prisoners in her fright the latter promised the savages a large reward if they would spare her life and take her in safety to the british camp it was a fatal promise halting at a spring a quarrel arose among the savages inflamed most probably with drink as to whose prize she was and who was entitled to the reward the dispute became furious and one in a paroxysm of rage killed her on the spot he completed the savage act by bearing off her scalp as a trophy  general burgoyne was struck with horror when he heard of this bloody deed he summoned a council of the indian chiefs in which he insisted that the murderer of miss mccrea should be given up to receive the reward of his crime the demand produced a violent agitation the culprit was a great warrior a chief and the wild honor of his brother sachems was roused in his behalf st luc took burgoyne aside and entreated him not to push the matter to extremities assuring him that from what was passing among the chiefs he was sure they and their warriors would all abandon the army should the delinquent be executed burgoyne was thus reluctantly brought to spare the offender but thenceforth made it a rule that no party of indians should be permitted to go forth on a foray unless under the conduct of a british officer or some other competent person who should be responsible for their behavior1  footnote 1 these restrictions led to illhumor among the indians who soon announced their intention of returning home unless the restraints imposed by burgoyne were withdrawn burgoyne was greatly embarrassed the indian force was valuable and obtained at an immense expense but to his great credit he refused their demands and the result was that the greater part of his indian allies deserted him  the mischief to the british cause however had been effected the murder of miss mccrea resounded throughout the land counteracting all the benefit anticipated from the terror of indian hostilities those people of the frontiers who had hitherto remained quiet now flew to arms to defend their families and firesides in their exasperation they looked beyond the savages to their employers they abhorred an army which professing to be civilized could league itself with such barbarians and they execrated a government which pretending to reclaim them as subjects could let loose such fiends to desolate their homes the blood of this unfortunate girl therefore was not shed in vain armies sprang up from it her name passed as a note of alarm along the banks of the hudson it was a rallying word among the green mountains of vermont and brought down all their hardy yeomanry  as burgoyne advanced to fort edward schuyler fell still further back and took post at saratoga or rather stillwater about thirty miles from albany he had been joined by majorgeneral lincoln who according to washingtons directions had hastened to his assistance in pursuance of washingtons plans lincoln proceeded to manchester in vermont to take command of the militia forces collecting at that point his presence inspired new confidence in the country people who were abandoning their homes leaving their crops ungathered and taking refuge with their families in the lower towns he found about five hundred militia assembled at manchester under colonel seth warner others were coming on from new hampshire and massachusetts to protect their uncovered frontier  burgoyne was now at fort edward where new difficulties beset him the horses which had been contracted for in canada for draught burthen and saddle arrived slowly and scantily artillery and munitions too of all kinds had to be brought from ticonderoga by the way of lake george these with a vast number of boats for freight or to form bridges it was necessary to transport over the carrying places between the lakes and by land from fort george to fort edward unfortunately the army had not the requisite supply of horses and oxen so far from being able to bring forward provisions for a march it was with difficulty enough could be furnished to feed the army from day to day  while thus situated burgoyne received intelligence that the part of his army which he had detached from canada under colonel st leger to proceed by lake ontario and oswego and make a diversion on the mohawk had penetrated to that river and were actually investing fort stanwix the stronghold of that part of the country  to carry out the original plan of his campaign it now behooved him to make a rapid move down the hudson so as to be at hand to cooperate with st leger on his approach to albany but how was he to do this deficient as he was in horses and vehicles for transportation in this dilemma he was informed that at bennington about twentyfour miles east of the hudson the americans had a great depot of horses carriages and supplies of all kind intended for their northern army which might easily be surprised being guarded by only a small militia force an expedition was immediately set on foot not only to surprise this place but to scour the country and bring off all horses fit for the dragoons or for battalion service with as many saddles and bridles as could be found  before relating the events of this expedition we will turn to notice those of the detachment under st leger with which it was intended to cooperate and which was investing fort schuyler this fort built in 1756 on the site of an old french fortification and formerly called fort stanwix from a british general of that name was situated on the right bank of the mohawk river at the head of its navigation and commanded the carryingplace between it and wood creek whence the boats passed to the oneida lake the oswego river and lake ontario it was thus a key to the intercourse between upper canada and the valley of the mohawk the fort was square with four bastions and was originally a place of strengthhaving bombproof magazines a deep moat and drawbridge a sally port and covered way in the long interval of peace subsequent to the french war it had fallen to decay recently it had been repaired by order of general schuyler and had received his name it was garrisoned by seven hundred and fifty continental troops from new york and massachusetts and was under the command of colonel gansevoort of the new york line  it was a motley force which appeared before it british hessian royalist canadian and indian about seventeen hundred in all among them were st legers rangers and sir john johnsons royalist corps called his greens the indians were led by the famous brant on the 3d of august st leger sent in a flag with a summons to surrender it was disregarded he now set his troops to work to fortify his camp and clear obstructions from wood creek and the roads for the transportation of artillery and provisions and sent out scouting parties of indians in all directions to cut off all communication of the garrison with the surrounding country  on the 6th of august three men made their way into the fort through a swamp which the enemy had deemed impassable they brought the cheering intelligence that general herkimer the veteran commander of the militia of tryon county was at oriskany about eight miles distant with upwards of eight hundred men herkimer requested colonel gansevoort through his two messengers to fire three signalguns on receiving word of his vicinage upon hearing which he would endeavor to force his way to the fort depending upon the cooperation of the garrison  the messengers had been despatched by herkimer on the evening of the 5th and he had calculated that they would reach the fort at a very early hour in the morning through some delay they did not reach it until between ten and eleven oclock gansevoort instantly complied with the message three signalguns were fired and colonel willet of the new york continentals with two hundred and fifty men and an iron threepounder was detached to make a diversion by attacking that part of the enemys camp occupied by johnson and his royalists the delay of the messengers in the night however disconcerted the plan of herkimer he marshalled his troops by daybreak and waited for the signalguns hour after hour elapsed but no gun was heard his officers became impatient of delay and urged an immediate march colonels cox and paris were particularly urgent for an advance paris was a prominent man in tryon county and member of the committee of safety and in compliance with the wishes of that committee accompanied herkimer as his volunteer aide losing his temper in the dispute he accused the latter of being either a tory or a coward no replied the brave old man i feel toward you all as a father and will not lead you into a scrape from which i cannot extricate you his discretion however was overpowered by repeated taunts and he at length about nine oclock gave the word to march  the march was rather dogged and irregular there was illhumor between the general and his officers about ten oclock they came to a place where the road was carried on a causeway of logs across a deep marshy ravine between high level banks the main division descended into the ravine followed by the baggagewagons they had scarcely crossed it when the enemies suddenly sprang up in front and on each side with deadly volleys of musketry and deafening yells and warwhoops in fact st leger apprised by his scouts of their intended approach had sent a force of johnsons greens rangers and indians to waylay them the rearguard which had not entered the ravine retreated the main body though thrown into confusion defended themselves bravely one of those severe conflicts ensued common in indian warfare where the combatants take post with their rifles behind rock and tree or come to deadly struggle with knife and tomahawk  the veteran herkimer was wounded early in the action a musket ball shattered his leg just below the knee killing his horse at the same time he made his men place him on his saddle at the foot of a large beech tree against the trunk of which he leaned continuing to give his orders the regulars attempted to charge with the bayonet but the americans formed themselves in circles back to back and repelled them a heavy storm of thunder and rain caused a temporary lull to the fight during which the patriots changed their ground some of them stationed themselves in pairs behind trees so that when one had fired the other could cover him until he had reloaded for the savages were apt to rush up with knife and tomahawk the moment a man had discharged his piece  a confusion reigns over the accounts of this fight in which every one saw little but what occurred in his immediate vicinity the indians at length having lost many of their bravest warriors gave the retreating cry oonah oonah and fled to the woods the greens and rangers hearing a firing in the direction of the fort feared an attack upon their camp and hastened to its defence carrying off with them many prisoners the americans did not pursue them but placing their wounded on litters made of branches of trees returned to oriskany both parties have claimed the victory but it does not appear that either was entitled to it the americans had two hundred killed and a number wounded several of these were officers the loss of the enemy is thought to have been equally great as to numbers we may add that those who had been most urgent with general herkimer for this movement were among the first to suffer from it colonel cox was shot down at the first fire so was a son of colonel paris the colonel himself was taken prisoner and fell beneath the tomahawk of the famous red jacket as to general herkimer he was conveyed to his residence on the mohawk river and died nine days after the battle not so much from his wound as from bad surgery sinking gradually through loss of blood from an unskilful amputation  the sortie of colonel willett had been spirited and successful he attacked the encampments of sir john johnson and the indians which were contiguous and strong detachments of which were absent on the ambuscade sir john and his men were driven to the river the indians fled to the woods willett sacked their camps loaded wagons with camp equipage clothing blankets and stores of all kinds seized the baggage and papers of sir john and of several of his officers and retreated safely to the fort just as st leger was up with a powerful reinforcement five colors which he had brought away with him as trophies were displayed under the flag of the fort while his men gave three cheers from the ramparts  st leger now endeavored to operate on the fears of the garrison his prisoners it is said were compelled to write a letter giving dismal accounts of the affair of oriskany and of the impossibility of getting any succor to the garrison of the probability that burgoyne and his army were then before albany and advising surrender to prevent inevitable destruction  st leger accompanied the letter with warnings that should the garrison persist in resistance he would not be able to restrain the fury of the savages who threatened if further provoked to revenge the deaths of their warriors and chiefs by slaughtering the garrison and laying waste the whole valley of the mohawk all this failing to shake the resolution of gansevoort st leger began to lose heart the fort proved more capable of defence than he had anticipated his artillery was too light and the ramparts being of sod were not easily battered he was obliged reluctantly to resort to the slow process of sapping and mining and began to make regular approaches  gansevoort seeing the siege was likely to be protracted resolved to send to general schuyler for succor colonel willett volunteered to undertake the perilous errand he was accompanied by lieutenant stockwell an excellent woodsman who served as a guide they left the fort on the 10th after dark by a sally port passed by the british sentinels and close by the indian camp without being discovered and made their way through bog and morass and pathless forests and all kinds of risks and hardships until they reached the german flats on the mohawk here willett procured a couple of horses and by dint of hoof arrived at the camp of general schuyler at stillwater  schuyler was in albany in the early part of august making stirring appeals in every direction for reinforcements burgoyne was advancing upon him he had received news of the disastrous affair of oriskany and the death of general herkimer and tryon county was crying to him for assistance one of his appeals was to the veteran john stark he had his farm in the hampshire grants and his name was a tower of strength among the green mountain boys but stark was soured with government and had retired from service his name having been omitted in the list of promotions hearing that he was on a visit to lincolns camp at manchester schuyler wrote to that general assure general stark that i have acquainted congress of his situation and that i trust and entreat he will in the present alarming crisis waive his right the greater the sacrifice he makes to his feelings the greater will be the honor due to him for not having suffered any consideration whatever to come in competition with the weal of his country  schuyler had instant call to practise the very virtue he was inculcating he was about to mount his horse on the 10th to return to the camp at stillwater when a despatch from congress was put into his hand containing the resolves which recalled him to attend a court of inquiry about the affair of ticonderoga  schuyler felt deeply the indignity of being thus recalled at a time when an engagement was apparently at hand but endeavored to console himself with the certainty that a thorough investigation of his conduct would prove how much he was entitled to the thanks of his country he intimated the same in his reply to congress in the meantime he considered it his duty to remain at his post until his successor should arrive or some officer in the department be nominated to the command his first care was to send relief to gansevoort and his beleaguered garrison eight hundred men were all that he could spare from his army in its present threatened state a spirited and effective officer was wanted to lead them arnold was in camp recently sent on as an efficient coadjutor by washington he stepped promptly forward and volunteered to lead the enterprise  after the departure of this detachment it was unanimously determined in a council of war of schuyler and his general officers that the post at stillwater was altogether untenable with their actual force part of the army therefore retired to the islands at the fords on the mouth of the mohawk river where it empties into the hudson and a brigade was posted above the falls of the mohawk called the cohoes to prevent the enemy from crossing there it was considered a strong position where they could not be attacked without great disadvantage to the assailant  we will now take a view of occurrences on the right and left of burgoyne and show the effect of schuylers measures poorly seconded as they were in crippling and straitening the invading army and first we will treat of the expedition against bennington generals phillips and riedesel demurred strongly to the expedition but their counsels were outweighed by those of colonel skene an influential and worthy royalist the founder of skenesborough he knew he said all the country thereabout the inhabitants were as five to one in favor of the royal cause and would be prompt to turn out on the first appearance of a protecting army he was to accompany the expedition and much was expected from his personal influence and authority lieutenantcolonel baum was to command the detachment he had under him according to burgoyne two hundred dismounted dragoons of the regiment of riedesel captain frasers marksmen which were the only british all the canadian volunteers a party of the provincials who perfectly knew the country one hundred indians and two light pieces of cannon the whole detachment amounted to about five hundred men  to be nearer at hand in case assistance should be required burgoyne encamped on the east side of the hudson nearly opposite saratoga throwing over a bridge of boats by which general fraser with the advanced guard crossed to that place colonel baum set out from camp at break of day on the 13th of august he was too slow a man to take a place by surprise the people of bennington heard of his approach and were on the alert the veteran stark was there with eight or nine hundred troops during the late alarms the militia of the state had been formed into two brigades one to be commanded by general william whipple stark had with difficulty been prevailed upon to accept the command of the other upon the express condition that he should not be obliged to join the main army but should be left to his own discretion to make war in his own partisan style hovering about the enemy in their march through the country and accountable to none but the authorities of new hampshire  having heard that indians had appeared at cambridge twelve miles to the north of bennington on the 13th he sent out two hundred men under colonel gregg in quest of them in the course of the night he learnt that they were mere scouts in advance of a force marching upon bennington he immediately rallied his brigade called out the militia of the neighborhood and sent off for colonel seth warner and his regiment of militia who were with general lincoln at manchester lincoln instantly detached them and warner and his men marched all night through drenching rain arriving at starks camp in the morning dripping wet  stark left them at bennington to dry and rest themselves and then to follow on in the meantime he pushed forward with his men to support the party sent out the preceding day under gregg in quest of the indians he met them about five miles off in full retreat baum and his force a mile in their rear he halted and prepared for action baum also halted posted himself on a high ground at a bend of the little river walloomscoick and began to intrench himself stark fell back a mile to wait for reinforcements and draw down baum from his strong position a skirmish took place between the advance guards thirty of baums men were killed and two indian chiefs an incessant rain on the 15th prevented an attack on baums camp but there was continual skirmishing the colonel strengthened his intrenchments and finding he had a larger force to contend with than he had anticipated sent off in all haste to burgoyne for reinforcements colonel breyman marched off immediately with five hundred hessian grenadiers and infantry and two sixpounders leaving behind him his tents baggage and standards  in the meantime the americans had been mustering from all quarters to starks assistance with such weapons as they had at hand during the night of the 15th colonel symonds arrived with a body of berkshire militia on the following morning the sun shone bright and stark prepared to attack baum in his intrenchments though he had no artillery and his men for the most part had only their ordinary brown firelocks without bayonets two hundred of his men under colonel nichols were detached to the rear of the enemys left three hundred under colonel herrick to the rear of his right they were to join their forces and attack him in the rear while colonels hubbard and stickney with two hundred men diverted his attention in front  at the first sound of firearms stark who had remained with the main body in camp mounted his horse and gave the word forward he had promised his men the plunder of the british camp the homely speech made by him when in sight of the enemy has often been cited now my men there are the red coats before night they must be ours or molly stark will be a widow  baum soon found himself assailed on every side but he defended his works bravely his two pieces of artillery advantageously planted were very effective and his troops if slow in march were steady in action stark inspired his men with his own impetuosity they drove the royalist troops upon the hessians and pressing after them stormed the works with irresistible fury a hessian eyewitness declares that this time the rebels fought with desperation pressing within eight paces of the loaded cannon to take surer aim at the artillerists the latter were slain the cannon captured the royalists and canadians took to flight and escaped to the woods the germans still kept their ground and fought bravely until there was not a cartridge left baum and his dragoons then took to their broadswords and the infantry to their bayonets and endeavored to cut their way to a road in the woods but in vain many were killed more wounded baum among the number and all who survived were taken prisoners  the victors now dispersed some to collect booty some to attend to the wounded some to guard the prisoners and some to seek refreshment being exhausted by hunger and fatigue at this critical juncture breymans tardy reinforcement came making its way heavily and slowly to the scene of action joined by many of the enemy who had fled attempts were made to rally the militia but they were in complete confusion nothing would have saved them from defeat had not colonel seth warners corps fortunately arrived from bennington fresh from repose and advanced to meet the enemy while the others regained their ranks it was four oclock in the afternoon when this second action commenced it was fought from wood to wood and hill to hill for several miles until sunset the last stand of the enemy was at van schaicks mill where having expended all their ammunition of which each man had forty rounds they gave way and retreated under favor of the night leaving two fieldpieces and all their baggage in the hands of the americans  four brass fieldpieces nine hundred dragoon swords a thousand stand of arms and four ammunition wagons were the spoils of this victory thirtytwo officers five hundred and sixtyfour privates including canadians and loyalists were taken prisoners the number of slain was very considerable but could not be ascertained many having fallen in the woods the brave but unfortunate baum did not long survive the americans had one hundred killed and wounded  arnolds march to the relief of fort stanwix was slower than suited his ardent and impatient spirit he was detained in the valley of the mohawk by bad roads by the necessity of waiting for baggage and ammunition wagons and for militia recruits who turned out reluctantly conscious of the smallness of his force he had resorted to stratagem sending emissaries ahead to spread exaggerated reports of the number of his troops so as to work on the fears of the enemys indian allies and induce them to desert the most important of these emissaries was one yan yost cuyler an eccentric halfwitted fellow known throughout the country as a rank tory he had been convicted as a spy and only spared from the halter on the condition that he would go into st legers camp and spread alarming reports among the indians by whom he was well known to insure a faithful discharge of his mission arnold detained his brother as a hostage  on his way up the mohawk valley arnold was joined by a new york regiment under colonel james livingston sent by gates to reinforce him on arriving at the german flats he received an express from colonel gansevoort informing him that he was still besieged but in high spirits and under no apprehensions  all this while st leger was advancing his parallels and pressing the siege while provisions and ammunition were rapidly decreasing within the fort st legers indian allies however were growing sullen and intractable this slow kind of warfare this war with the spade they were unaccustomed to and they by no means relished it at this juncture scouts brought word that a force one thousand strong was marching to the relief of the fort eager to put his savages in action st leger in a council of war offered to their chiefs to place himself at their head with three hundred of his best troops and meet the enemy as they advanced it was agreed and they sallied forth together to choose a fighting ground by this time rumors stole into the camp doubling the number of the approaching enemy burgoynes whole army were said to have been defeated lastly came yan yost cuyler with his coat full of bulletholes giving out that he had escaped from the hands of the americans and had been fired upon by them his story was believed for he was known to be a royalist mingling among his old acquaintances the indians he assured them that the americans were close at hand and numerous as the leaves on the trees  arnolds stratagem succeeded the indians fickle as the winds began to desert sir john johnson and colonels claus and butler endeavored in vain to reassure and retain them in a little while two hundred had decamped and the rest threatened to do so likewise unless st leger retreated the unfortunate colonel found too late what little reliance was to be placed upon indian allies he determined on the 22d to send off his sick his wounded and his artillery by wood creek that very night and to protect them by the line of march the indians however goaded on by arnolds emissaries insisted on instant retreat st leger still refused to depart before nightfall the savages now became ungovernable they seized upon liquor of the officers about to be embarked and getting intoxicated behaved like very fiends in a word st leger was obliged to decamp about noon in such hurry and confusion that he left his tents standing and his artillery with most of his baggage ammunition and stores fell into the hands of the americans  a detachment from the garrison pursued and harassed him for a time but his greatest annoyance was from his indian allies who plundered the boats which conveyed such baggage as had been brought off murdered all stragglers who lagged in the rear and amused themselves by giving false alarms to keep up the panic of the soldiery who would throw away muskets knapsacks and everything that impeded their flight it was not until he reached onondaga falls that st leger discovered by a letter from burgoyne and floating reports brought by the bearer that he had been the dupe of a ruse de guerre and that at the time the advancing foe were reported to be close upon his haunches they were not within forty miles of him  such was the second blow to burgoynes invading army but before the news of it reached that doomed commander he had already been half paralyzed by the disaster at bennington  means were now augmenting in schuylers hands colonels livingston and pierre van cortlandt forwarded by putnam were arrived governor clinton was daily expected with new york militia from the highlands the arrival of arnold was anticipated with troops and artillery and lincoln with the new england militia at this propitious moment when everything was ready for the sickle to be put into the harvest general gates arrived in the camp schuyler received him with the noble courtesy to which he pledged himself after acquainting him with all the affairs of the department the measures he had taken and those he had projected he informed him of his having signified to congress his intention to remain in that quarter for the present and render every service in his power and he entreated gates to call upon him for council and assistance whenever he thought proper  gates was in high spirits his letters to washington show how completely he was aware that an easy path of victory had been opened to him but so far was he from responding to schuylers magnanimity and profiting by his nobly offered counsel and assistance that he did not even ask him to be present at his first council of war although he invited up general ten broeck of the militia from albany to attend it     chapter xlv battle of the brandywinefall of philadelphia   on the 25th of august the british army under general howe began to land from the fleet in elk river at the bottom of chesapeake bay the place where they landed was about six miles below the head of elk now elkton a small town the capital of cecil county this was seventy miles from philadelphia early in the evening washington received intelligence that the enemy were landing there was a quantity of public and private stores at the head of elk which he feared would fall into their hands if they moved quickly every attempt was to be made to check them the divisions of generals greene and stephen were within a few miles of wilmington orders were sent for them to march thither immediately the two other divisions which had halted at chester to refresh were to hurry forward majorgeneral armstrong who now commanded the pennsylvania militia was urged to send down in the cool of the night all the men he could muster properly armed general rodney who commanded the delaware militia was ordered to throw out scouts and patrols toward the enemy to watch their motions and to move near them with his troops as soon as he should be reinforced by the maryland militia light troops were sent out early in the morning to hover about and harass the invaders  the country was in a great state of alarm the inhabitants were hurrying off their most valuable effects so that it was difficult to procure cattle and vehicles to remove the public stores the want of horses and the annoyances given by the american light troops however kept howe from advancing promptly and gave time for the greater part of the stores to be saved to allay the public alarm howe issued a proclamation on the 27th promising the strictest regularity and order on the part of his army with security of person and property to all who remained quietly at home and pardon to those under arms who should promptly return to their obedience  the divisions of generals greene and stephen were now stationed several miles in advance of wilmington behind white clay creek about ten miles from the head of elk general smallwood and colonel gist had been directed by congress to take command of the militia of maryland who were gathering on the western shore and washington sent them orders to cooperate with general rodney and get in the rear of the enemy  washington now felt the want of morgan and his riflemen whom he had sent to assist the northern army to supply their place he formed a corps of light troops by drafting a hundred men from each brigade the command was given to majorgeneral maxwell who was to hover about the enemy and give them continual annoyance  the army about this time was increased by the arrival of general sullivan and his division of three thousand men he had recently while encamped at hanover in jersey made a gallant attempt to surprise and capture a corps of one thousand provincials stationed on staten island at a distance from the fortified camp and opposite the jersey shore the attempt was partially successful a number of the provincials were captured but the regulars came to the rescue sullivan had not brought sufficient boats to secure a retreat his rearguard was captured while waiting for the return of the boats yet not without a sharp resistance there was loss on both sides but the americans suffered most congress had directed washington to appoint a court of inquiry to investigate the matter in the meantime sullivan whose gallantry remained undoubted continued in command  there were now in camp several of those officers and gentlemen from various parts of europe who had recently pressed into the service and the suitable employment of whom had been a source of much perplexity to washington general deborre the french veteran of thirty years service commanded a brigade in sullivans division brigadiergeneral conway the gallicized hibernian was in the division of lord stirling beside these there was louis fleury a french gentleman of noble descent who had been educated as an engineer and had come out at the opening of the revolution to offer his services washington had obtained for him a captains commission another officer of distinguished merit was the count pulaski a pole recommended by dr franklin as an officer famous throughout europe for his bravery and conduct in defence of the liberties of his country against russia austria and prussia  at this time henry lee of virginia of military renown makes his first appearance he was in the twentysecond year of his age and in the preceding year had commanded a company of virginia volunteers he had recently signalized himself in scouting parties harassing the enemys pickets his adventurous exploits soon won him notoriety and the popular appellation of lighthorse harry he was favorably noticed by washington throughout the war  several days were now passed by the commanderinchief almost continually in the saddle reconnoitring the roads and passes and making himself acquainted with the surrounding country which was very much intersected by rivers and small streams running chiefly from northwest to southeast he had now made up his mind to risk a battle in the open field it is true his troops were inferior to those of the enemy in number equipments and discipline many of them were militia or raw recruits yet the divisions of the army had acquired a facility at moving in large masses and were considerably improved in military tactics at any rate it would never do to let philadelphia at that time the capital of the states fall without a blow public impatience called for a battle it was expected even by europe his own valiant spirit required it though hitherto he had been held in check by superior considerations of expediency and by the controlling interference of congress  the british army having effected a landing it was formed into two divisions one under sir william howe was stationed at elkton with its advanced guard at grays hill about two miles off the other division under general knyphausen was on the opposite side of the ferry at cecil court house on the 3d of september the enemy advanced in considerable force with three fieldpieces moving with great caution as the country was difficult woody and not well known to them about three miles in front of white clay creek their vanguard was encountered by general maxwell and his light troops and a severe skirmish took place the fire of the american sharpshooters and riflemen as usual was very effective but being inferior in number and having no artillery maxwell was compelled to retreat across white clay creek with the loss of about forty killed and wounded the loss of the enemy was supposed to be much greater  the main body of the american army was now encamped on the east side of red clay creek on the road leading from elkton to philadelphia the lightinfantry were in the advance at white clay creek the armies were from eight to ten miles apart in this position washington determined to await the threatened attack his numerical force at this time was about fifteen thousand men but from sickness and other causes the effective force militia included did not exceed eleven thousand and most of these indifferently armed and equipped the strength of the british was computed at eighteen thousand men but it is thought not more than fifteen thousand were brought into action  on the 8th the enemy advanced in two columnsone appeared preparing to attack the americans in front while the other extended its left up the west side of the creek halting at milltown somewhat to the right of the american position washington now suspected an intention on the part of sir william howe to march by his right suddenly pass the brandywine gain the heights north of that stream and cut him off from philadelphia he summoned a council of war therefore that evening in which it was determined immediately to change their position and move to the river in question by two oclock in the morning the army was under march and by the next evening was encamped on the high grounds in the rear of the brandywine the enemy on the same evening moved to kennet square about seven miles from the american position  illustration headquarters at brandywine vol iii  the brandywine creek as it is called commences with two branches called the east and west branches which unite in one stream flowing from west to east about twentytwo miles and emptying itself into the delaware about twentyfive miles below philadelphia it has several fords one called chadds ford was at that time the most practicable and in the direct route from the enemys camp to philadelphia as the principal attack was expected here washington made it the centre of his position where he stationed the main body of his army composed of waynes weedons and muhlenbergs brigades with the lightinfantry under maxwell an eminence immediately above the ford had been intrenched in the night and was occupied by wayne and proctors artillery weedons and muhlenbergs brigades which were virginian troops and formed general greenes division were posted in the rear on the heights as a reserve to aid either wing of the army with these washington took his stand maxwells lightinfantry were thrown in the advance south of the brandywine and posted on high ground each side of the road leading to the ford  the right wing of the army commanded by sullivan and composed of his division and those of stephen and stirling extended up the brandywine two miles beyond washingtons position its light troops and videttes were distributed quite up to the forks the left wing composed of the pennsylvania militia under majorgeneral armstrong was stationed about a mile and a half below the main body to protect the lower fords where the least danger was apprehended  early on the morning of the 11th a great column of troops was descried advancing on the road leading to chadds ford a skirt of the woods concealed its force but it was supposed to be the main body of the enemy if so a general conflict was at hand the americans were immediately drawn out in order of battle washington rode along the front of the ranks and was everywhere received with acclamations a sharp firing of small arms soon told that maxwells lightinfantry were engaged with the vanguard of the enemy the skirmishing was kept up for some time with spirit when maxwell was driven across the brandywine below the ford the enemy who had advanced but slowly did not attempt to follow but halted on commanding ground and appeared to reconnoitre the american position with a view to an attack a heavy cannonading commenced on both sides about ten oclock the enemy made repeated dispositions to force the ford which brought on as frequent skirmishes on both sides of the river for detachments of the light troops occasionally crossed over  towards noon came an express from sullivan with a note received from a scouting party reporting that general howe with a large body of troops and a park of artillery was pushing up the lancaster road doubtless to cross at the upper fords and turn the right flank of the american position  startled by the information washington instantly sent off colonel theodoric bland with a party of horse to reconnoitre above the forks and ascertain the truth of the report in the meantime he resolved to cross the ford attack the division in front of him with his whole force and rout it before the other could arrive he gave orders for both wings to cooperate when as sullivan was preparing to cross major spicer of the militia rode up just from the forks and assured him there was no enemy in that quarter sullivan instantly transmitted the intelligence to washington whereupon the movement was suspended until positive information could be obtained after a time came a man of the neighborhood thomas cheyney by name spurring in all haste the mare he rode in foam and himself out of breath dashing up to the commanderinchief he informed him that he must instantly move or he would be surrounded he had come upon the enemy unawares had been pursued and fired upon but the fleetness of his mare had saved him the main body of the british was coming down on the east side of the stream and was near at hand another despatch from sullivan corroborated the story colonel bland whom washington had sent to reconnoitre above the forks had seen the enemy two miles in the rear of sullivans right marching down at a rapid rate while a cloud of dust showed that there were more troops behind them  in fact knyphausen with a small division had engrossed the attention of the americans by a feigned attack at chadds ford kept up with great noise and prolonged by skirmishes while the main body of the army under cornwallis led by experienced guides had made a circuit of seventeen miles crossed the two forks of the brandywine and arrived in the neighborhood of birmingham meetinghouse two miles to the right of sullivan it was a capital stratagem secretly and successfully conducted  finding that cornwallis had thus gained the rear of the army washington sent orders to sullivan to oppose him with the whole right wing each brigade attacking as soon as it arrived upon the ground wayne in the meantime was to keep knyphausen at bay at the ford and greene with the reserve to hold himself ready to give aid wherever required lafayette as a volunteer had hitherto accompanied the commanderinchief but now seeing there was likely to be warm work with the right wing he obtained permission to join sullivan and spurred off with his aidedecamp to the scene of action  illustration maps of the battle of brandywine  sullivan on receiving washingtons orders advanced with his own stephens and stirlings divisions and began to form a line in front of an open piece of wood the time which had been expended in transmitting intelligence receiving orders and marching had enabled cornwallis to choose his ground and prepare for action still more time was given him from the apprehension of the three generals upon consultation of being outflanked upon the right and that the gap between sullivans and stephens divisions was too wide and should be closed up orders were accordingly given for the whole line to move to the right and while in execution cornwallis advanced rapidly with his troops in the finest order and opened a brisk fire of musketry and artillery the americans made an obstinate resistance but being taken at a disadvantage the right and left wings were broken and driven into the woods the centre stood firm for a while but being exposed to the whole fire of the enemy gave way at length also the british in following up their advantage got entangled in the wood lafayette had thrown himself from his horse and was endeavoring to rally the troops when he was shot through the leg with a musket ball and had to be assisted into the saddle by his aidedecamp  the americans rallied on a height to the north of dilworth and made a still more spirited resistance than at first but were again dislodged and obliged to retreat with a heavy loss  while this was occurring with the right wing knyphausen as soon as he learnt from the heavy firing that cornwallis was engaged made a push to force his way across chadds ford in earnest he was vigorously opposed by wayne with proctors artillery aided by maxwell and his infantry greene was preparing to second him with the reserve when he was summoned by washington to the support of the right wing which the commanderinchief had found in imminent peril  greene advanced to the relief with such celerity that it is said on good authority his division accomplished the march or rather run of five miles in less than fifty minutes he arrived too late to save the battle but in time to protect the broken masses of the left wing which he met in full flight opening his ranks from time to time for the fugitives and closing them the moment they had passed he covered their retreat by a sharp and welldirected fire from his fieldpieces his grand stand was made at a place about a mile beyond dilworth which in reconnoitring the neighborhood washington had pointed out to him as well calculated for a second position should the army be driven out of the first weedons brigade was drawn up in a narrow defile flanked on both sides by woods and perfectly commanding the road while greene with muhlenbergs brigade passing to the right took his station on the road the british came on impetuously expecting but faint opposition they met with a desperate resistance and were repeatedly driven back weedons brigade on the left maintained its stand also with great obstinacy and the check given to the enemy by these two brigades allowed time for the broken troops to retreat weedon was at length compelled by superior numbers to seek the protection of the other brigade which he did in good order and greene gradually drew off the whole division in face of the enemy who checked by this vigorous resistance and seeing the day far spent gave up all further pursuit  the brave stand made by these brigades had likewise been a great protection to wayne he had for a long time withstood the attacks of the enemy at chadds ford until the approach on the right of some of the enemys troops who had been entangled in the woods showed him that the right wing had been routed he now gave up the defence of his post and retreated by the chester road knyphausens troops were too fatigued to pursue him and the others had been kept back as we have shown by greenes division so ended the varied conflict of the day  lafayette gives an animated picture of the general retreat in which he became entangled all around him was headlong terror and confusion chester road the common retreat of the broken fragments of the army from every quarter was crowded with fugitives with cannon with baggage cars all hurrying forward pellmell and obstructing each other at chester twelve miles from the field of battle there was a deep stream with a bridge over which the fugitives would have to pass here lafayette set a guard to prevent their further flight the commanderinchief arriving soon after with greene and his gallant division some degree of order was restored and the whole army took its post behind chester for the night  the scene of this battle which decided the fate of philadelphia was within six and twenty miles of that city and each discharge of cannon could be heard there the two parties of the inhabitants whig and tory were to be seen in separate groups in the squares and public places waiting the event in anxious silence at length a courier arrived his tidings spread consternation among the friends of liberty many left their homes entire families abandoned everything in terror and despair and took refuge in the mountains congress that same evening determined to quit the city and repair to lancaster whence they subsequently removed to yorktown  notwithstanding the rout and precipitate retreat of the american army sir william howe did not press the pursuit but passed the night on the field of battle and remained the two following days at dilworth sending out detachments to take post at concord and chester and seize on wilmington whither the sick and wounded were conveyed  washington as usual profited by the inactivity of howe quietly retreating through derby on the 12th across the schuylkill to germantown within a short distance of philadelphia where he gave his troops a days repose finding them in good spirits and in nowise disheartened by the recent affair which they seemed to consider a check rather than a defeat he resolved to seek the enemy again and give him battle as preliminary measures he left some of the pennsylvania militia in philadelphia to guard the city others under general armstrong were posted at the various passes of the schuylkill with orders to throw up works the floating bridge on the lower road was to be unmoored and the boats collected and taken across the river  having taken these precautions against any hostile movement by the lower road washington recrossed the schuylkill on the 14th and advanced along the lancaster road with the intention of turning the left flank of the enemy howe apprised of his intention made a similar disposition to outflank him the two armies came in sight of each other near the warren tavern twentythree miles from philadelphia and were on the point of engaging but were prevented by a violent storm of rain which lasted for four and twenty hours  this inclement weather was particularly distressing to the americans who were scantily clothed most of them destitute of blankets and separated from their tents and baggage the rain penetrated their cartridgeboxes and the illfitted locks of their muskets rendering the latter useless being deficient in bayonets in this plight washington gave up for the present all thought of attacking the enemy as their discipline in the use of the bayonet with which they were universally furnished would give them a great superiority in action  the only aim at present was to get to some dry and secure place where the army might repose and refit all day and for a great part of the night they marched under a cold and pelting rain and through deep and miry roads to the yellow springs thence to warwick on french creek at warwick furnace ammunition and a few muskets were obtained to aid in disputing the passage of the schuylkill and the advance of the enemy on philadelphia from french creek wayne was detached with his division to get in the rear of the enemy form a junction with general smallwood and the maryland militia and keeping themselves concealed watch for an opportunity to cut off howes baggage and hospital train in the meantime washington crossed the schuylkill at parkers ford and took a position to defend that pass of the river  wayne set off in the night and by a circuitous march got within three miles of the left wing of the british encamped at trydraffin and concealing himself in a wood waited the arrival of smallwood and his militia at daybreak he reconnoitred the camp where howe checked by the severity of the weather had contented himself with uniting his columns and remained under shelter all day wayne hovered about the camp there were no signs of marching all kept quiet but lay too compact to be attacked with prudence he sent repeated messages to washington describing the situation of the enemy i believe he knows nothing of my situation as i have taken every precaution to prevent any intelligence getting to him  his motions however had not been so secret as he imagined he was in a part of the country full of the disaffected and sir william had received accurate information of his force and where he was encamped general gray with a strong detachment was sent to surprise him at night in his lair late in the evening when wayne had set his pickets and sentinels and thrown out his patrols a countryman brought him word of the meditated attack he doubted the intelligence but strengthened his pickets and patrols and ordered his troops to sleep upon their arms at eleven oclock the pickets were driven in at the point of the bayonetthe enemy were advancing in column wayne instantly took post on the right of his position to cover the retreat of the left led by colonel hampton the second in command the latter was tardy and incautiously paraded his troops in front of their fires so as to be in full relief the enemy rushed on without firing a gun all was the silent but deadly work of the bayonet and cutlass nearly three hundred of hamptons men were killed or wounded and the rest put to flight wayne gave the enemy some welldirected volleys and then retreating to a small distance rallied his troops and prepared for further defence the british however contented themselves with the blow they had given and retired with very little loss taking with them between seventy and eighty prisoners several of them officers and eight baggage wagons heavily laden  general smallwood who was to have cooperated with wayne was within a mile of him at the time of his attack and would have hastened to his assistance with his wellknown intrepidity but he had not the corps under his command with which he had formerly distinguished himself and his raw militia fled in a panic at the first sight of a return party of the enemy wayne was deeply mortified by the result of this affair and finding it severely criticised in the army demanded a courtmartial which pronounced his conduct everything that was to be expected from an active brave and vigilant officer whatever blame there was in the matter fell upon his second in command  on the 21st sir william howe made a rapid march high up the schuylkill on the road leading to reading as if he intended either to capture the military stores deposited there or to turn the right of the american army washington kept pace with him on the opposite side of the river up to potts grove about thirty miles from philadelphia  the movement on the part of howe was a mere feint no sooner had he drawn washington so far up the river than by a rapid countermarch on the night of the 22d he got to the ford below threw his troops across on the next morning and pushed forward for philadelphia by the time washington was apprised of this countermovement howe was too far on his way to be overtaken by harassed barefooted troops worn out by constant marching feeling the necessity of immediate reinforcements he wrote on the same day to putnam at peekskill i desire that without a moments loss of time you will detach as many effective rank and file under proper generals and officers as will make the whole number including those with general mcdougall amount to twentyfive hundred privates and noncommissioned fit for duty i must urge you by every motive to send this detachment without the least possible delay  on the next day 24th he wrote also to general gates i request if circumstances will admit that you will order colonel morgan to join me again with his corps i sent him up when i thought you materially wanted him and if his services can be dispensed with now you will direct his immediate return  having called a council of officers and taken their opinions which concurred with his own washington determined to remain some days at potts grove to give repose to his troops and await the arrival of reinforcements  sir william howe halted at germantown within a short distance of philadelphia and encamped the main body of his army in and about that village detaching lord cornwallis with a large force and a number of officers of distinction to take formal possession of the city that general marched into philadelphia on the 26th with a brilliant staff and escort and followed by splendid legions of british and hessian grenadiers long trains of artillery and squadrons of lightdragoons the finest troops in the army all in their best array     chapter xlvi the northern invasionfall of the highland fortsdefeat and surrender of burgoyne   the checks which burgoyne had received on right and left and in a great measure through the spontaneous rising of the country had opened his eyes to the difficulties of his situation and the errors as to public feeling into which he had been led by his tory counsellors he declared that had he any latitude in his orders he would remain where he was or perhaps fall back to fort edward where his communication with lake george would be secure and wait for some event that might assist his movement forward his orders however were positive to force a junction with sir william howe he did not feel at liberty therefore to remain inactive longer than would be necessary to receive the reinforcements of the additional companies the german drafts and recruits actually on lake champlain and to collect provisions enough for twentyfive days these reinforcements were indispensable because from the hour he should pass the hudson river and proceed towards albany all safety of communication would cease  a feature of peculiar interest is given to this wild and rugged expedition by the presence of two ladies of rank and refinement involved in its perils and hardships one was lady harriet ackland daughter of the earl of ilchester and wife of major ackland of the grenadiers the other was the baroness de riedesel wife of the hessian majorgeneral both of these ladies had been left behind in canada lady harriet however on hearing that her husband was wounded in the affair at hubbardton instantly set out to rejoin him regardless of danger and of her being in a condition before long to become a mother crossing the whole length of lake champlain she found him in a sick bed at skenesborough after his recovery she refused to leave him but had continued with the army ever since her example had been imitated by the baroness de riedesel who had joined the army at fort edward bringing with her her three small children the friendship and sympathy of these two ladies in all scenes of trial and suffering and their devoted attachment to their husbands afford touching episodes in the story of the campaign  the american army had received various reinforcements it was now about ten thousand strong schuyler finding himself and his proffered services slighted by gates had returned to albany his patriotism was superior to personal resentments he still continued to promote the success of the campaign exerting his influence over the indian tribes to win them from the enemy at albany he held talks and war feasts with deputations of oneida tuscarora and onondaga warriors and procured scouting parties of them which he sent to the camp and which proved of great service  the dense forests which covered the country between the hostile armies concealed their movements and as gates threw out no harassing parties his information concerning the enemy was vague burgoyne however was diligently collecting all his forces from skenesborough fort anne and fort george and collecting provisions so stood matters on the 11th of september when a report was circulated in the american camp that burgoyne was in motion and that he had made a speech to his soldiers telling them that the fleet had returned to canada and their only safety was to fight their way to new york  as general gates was to receive an attack it was thought he ought to choose the ground where to receive it arnold therefore in company with kosciuszko the polish engineer reconnoitred the neighborhood in quest of a good campingground and at length fixed upon a ridge of hills called bemiss heights which kosciuszko proceeded to fortify in the meantime colonel colburn was sent off with a small party to ascend the high hills on the east side of the hudson and watch the movements of the enemy with glasses from their summits or from the tops of the trees for three days he kept thus on the lookout sending word from time to time to camp of all that he espied  on the 11th there were the first signs of movement among burgoynes troops on the 13th and 14th they slowly passed over a bridge of boats which they had thrown across the hudson and encamped near fish creek on the 15th both english and hessian camps struck their tents and loaded their baggage wagons by twelve oclock both began to march colburn neglected to notice the route taken by the hessians his attention was absorbed by the british who made their way slowly and laboriously down the western side of the river along a wretched road intersected by brooks and rivulets the bridges over which schuyler had broken down the division had with it eightyfive baggage wagons and a great train of artillery with two unwieldy twentyfourpounders acting like drag anchors having seen the army advance two miles on its march colburn descended from the heights and hastened to the american camp to make his report a british prisoner brought in soon afterwards stated that burgoyne had come to a halt about four miles distant  on the following morning the army was under arms at daylight the enemy however remained encamped repairing bridges in front and sending down guardboats to reconnoitre the americans therefore went on to fortify their position the ridge of hills called bemiss heights rises abruptly from the narrow flat bordering the west side of the river kosciuszko had fortified the camp with intrenchments threequarters of a mile in extent having redoubts and batteries which commanded the valley and even the hills on the opposite side of the river for the hudson in this upper part is comparatively a narrow stream from the foot of the height an intrenchment extended to the river ending with a battery at the water edge commanding a floating bridge  the right wing of the army under the immediate command of gates and composed of glovers nixons and pattersons brigades occupied the brow of the hill nearest to the river with the flats below the left wing commanded by arnold was on the side of the camp farthest from the river and distant from the latter about threequarters of a mile it was composed of the new hampshire brigade of general poor pierre van courtlandts and james livingstons regiments of new york militia the connecticut militia morgans riflemen and dearborns infantry the centre was composed of massachusetts and new york troops  burgoyne gradually drew nearer to the camp throwing out large parties of pioneers and workmen the americans disputed every step a hessian officer observes the enemy bristled up his hair as we attempted to repair more bridges at last we had to do him the honor of sending out whole regiments to protect our workmen  burgoyne now encamped about two miles from general gates disposing his army in two lines the left on the river the right extending at right angles to it about six hundred yards across the low grounds to a range of steep and rocky hills occupied by the √©lite a ravine formed by a rivulet from the hills passed in front of the camp the low ground between the armies was cultivated the hills were covered with woods excepting three or four small openings and deserted farms beside the ravines which fronted each camp there was a third one midway between them also at right angles to the river  on the morning of the 19th general gates received intelligence that the enemy were advancing in great force on his left it was in fact their right wing composed of the british line and led by burgoyne in person it was covered by the grenadiers and lightinfantry under general fraser and colonel breyman who kept along the high grounds on the right while they in turn were covered in front and on the flanks by indians provincial royalists and canadians the left wing and artillery were advancing at the same time under majorgeneral phillips and riedesel along the great road and meadows by the river side but they were retarded by the necessity of repairing broken bridges it was the plan of burgoyne that the canadians and indians should attack the central outposts of the americans and draw their attention in that direction while he and fraser making a circuit through the woods should join forces and fall upon the rear of the american camp as the dense forests hid them from each other signal guns were to regulate their movements three fired in succession were to denote that all was ready and be the signal for an attack in front flank and rear  the american pickets stationed along the ravine of mill creek sent repeated accounts to general gates of the movements of the enemy but he remained quiet in his camp as if determined to await an attack the american officers grew impatient arnold especially impetuous by nature urged repeatedly that a detachment should be sent forth to check the enemy in their advance and drive the indians out of the woods at length he succeeded in getting permission about noon to detach morgan with his riflemen and dearborn with his infantry from his division they soon fell in with the canadians and indians which formed the advance guard of the enemys right and attacking them with spirit drove them in or rather dispersed them morgans riflemen following up their advantage with too much eagerness became likewise scattered and a strong reinforcement of royalists arriving on the scene of action the americans in their turn were obliged to give way  other detachments now arrived from the american camp led by arnold who attacked fraser on his right to check his attempt to get in the rear of the camp finding the position of fraser too strong to be forced he sent to headquarters for reinforcements but they were refused by gates who declared that no more should go the reason he gave was that it might be attacked by the enemys left wing arnold now made a rapid countermarch and his movement being masked by the woods suddenly attempted to turn frasers left here he came in full conflict with the british line and threw himself upon it with a boldness and impetuosity that for a time threatened to break it and cut the wings of the army asunder the grenadiers and breymans riflemen hastened to its support general phillips broke his way through the woods with four pieces of artillery and riedesel came on with his heavy dragoons reinforcements came likewise to arnolds assistance his force however never exceeded three thousand men and with these for nearly four hours he kept up a conflict almost hand to hand with the whole right wing of the british army  night alone put an end to the conflict both parties claimed the victory but though the british remained on the field of battle where they lay all night upon their arms they had failed in their object they had been assailed instead of being the assailants while the american troops had accomplished the purpose for which they had sallied forth had checked the advance of the enemy frustrated their plan of attack and returned exulting to their camp their loss in killed and wounded was between three and four hundred including several officers that of the enemy upwards of five hundred  burgoyne now strengthened his position with intrenchments and batteries part of them across the meadows which bordered the river part on the brow of the heights which commanded them the americans likewise extended and strengthened their line of breastworks on the left of the camp the right was already unassailable the camps were within gunshot but with ravines and woods between them  the situation of burgoyne was growing more and more critical on the 21st he heard shouts in the american camp and in a little while their cannon thundered a feu de joie news had been received from general lincoln that a detachment of new england troops under colonel brown had surprised the carryingplace mills and french lines at ticonderoga captured an armed sloop gunboats and bateaux made three hundred prisoners beside releasing one hundred american captives and were laying siege to fort independence  fortunately for burgoyne while affairs were darkening in the north a ray of hope dawned from the south while the shouts from the american camp were yet ringing in his ears came a letter in cipher from sir henry clinton dated the 12th of september announcing his intention in about ten days to attack the forts in the highlands of the hudson burgoyne sent back the messenger the same night and despatched moreover two officers in disguise by different routes all bearing messages informing sir henry of his perilous situation arnold had been excessively indignant at gates withholding the reinforcements he had asked for in the recent action which he attributed to pique or jealousy gates indeed in the report to congress made no mention of arnold he also withdrew from arnolds division morgans rifle corps and dearborns lightinfantry its main reliance arnold called on gates to remonstrate high words passed between them gates in his heat told arnold that general lincoln would arrive in a day or two and then he would have no further occasion for him arnold returned to his quarters in a rage but he determined to remain in camp and abide the anticipated battle  lincoln in the meantime arrived in advance of his troops which soon followed to the amount of two thousand part of the troops detached by him under colonel brown were besieging ticonderoga and fort independence colonel brown himself with part of his detachment had embarked on lake george in an armed schooner and a squadron of captured gunboats and bateaux and was threatening the enemys deposit of baggage and heavy artillery at diamond island the toils so skilfully spread were encompassing burgoyne more and more the gates of canada were closing behind him  we will now cast a look toward new york and ascertain the cause of sir henrys delay in the anxiously expected operations on the hudson  the expedition of sir henry clinton had awaited the arrival of reinforcements from europe which were slowly crossing the ocean in dutch bottoms at length they arrived after a three months voyage and now there was a stir of warlike preparation at new york  the defences of the highlands on which the security of the hudson depended were at this time weakly garrisoned some of the troops having been sent off to reinforce the armies on the delaware and in the north putnam who had the general command of the highlands had but eleven hundred continental and four hundred militia troops with him at peekskill his headquarters there was a feeble garrison at fort independence in the vicinity of peekskill to guard the public stores and workshops at continental village the highland forts clinton montgomery and constitution situated among the mountains and forming their main defence were no better garrisoned and george clinton who had the command of them and who was in a manner the champion of the highlands was absent from his post attending the state legislature at kingston esopus in ulster county in his capacity of governor  there were patriot eyes in new york to watch the course of events and patriot boats on the river to act as swift messengers general putnam in september received intelligence on which he could depend of the arrival of reinforcements in new york and of preparations by the enemy for a movement surmising his object to be the forts of the highlands he wrote at once to governor clinton conveying his intelligence and asking for reinforcements of militia the governor forthwith hastened to his post in the highlands with such militia force as he could collect we have heretofore spoken of his highland citadel fort montgomery and of the obstructions of chain boom and chevauxdefrise between it and the opposite promontory of anthonys nose with which it had been hoped to barricade the hudson fort clinton had subsequently been erected within rifle shot of fort montgomery to occupy ground which commanded it a deep ravine and stream called peploeps kill intervened between the two forts across which there was a bridge the governor had his headquarters in fort montgomery which was the northern and largest fort but its works were unfinished his brother james had charge of fort clinton which was complete the whole force to garrison the associate forts did not exceed six hundred men chiefly militia but they had the veteran colonel lamb of the artillery with them and a company of his artillerists was distributed in the two forts  the armament of sir henry clinton which had been waiting for a wind set sail in the course of a day or two and stood up the hudson dogged by american swiftrowing whaleboats late at night of the 4th of october came a barge across the river from peekskill to fort montgomery bearing a letter from putnam to the governor this morning writes he we had information from our guardboats that there were two ships of war three tenders and a large number of flatbottomed boats coming up the river they proceeded up as far as tarrytown where they landed their men this evening they were followed by one large manofwar five topsail vessels and a large number of small craft  the landing of troops at tarrytown was a mere feint on the part of sir henry to distract the attention of the americans after marching a few miles into the country they returned and reembarked the armament continued across the tappan sea and haverstraw bay to verplancks point where on the 5th sir henry landed with three thousand men about eight miles below peekskill putnam drew back to the hills in the rear of the village to prepare for the expected attack and sent off to governor clinton for all the troops he could spare so far the manoeuvres of sir henry clinton had been successful it was his plan to threaten an attack on peekskill and fort independence and when he had drawn the attention of the american commanders to that quarter to land troops on the western shore of the hudson below the dunderberg thunder hill make a rapid march through the defiles behind that mountain to the rear of forts montgomery and clinton come down on them by surprise and carry them by a coup de main  accordingly at an early hour of the following morning taking advantage of a thick fog he crossed with two thousand men to stony point on the west shore of the river leaving about a thousand men chiefly royalists at verplancks point to keep up a threatening aspect towards peekskill three frigates also were to stand up what is called the devils horse race into peekskill bay and station themselves within cannon shot of fort independence having accomplished his landing sir henry conducted by a tory guide set out on a forced and circuitous march of several miles by rugged defiles round the western base of the dunderberg at the entrance of the pass he left a small force to guard it and keep up his communication with the ships by eight oclock in the morning he had effected his march round the dunderberg and halted on the northern side in a ravine between it and a conical mount called bear hill the possibility of an enemys approach by this pass had been noticed by washington in reconnoitring the highlands and he had mentioned it in his instructions to generals greene and knox when they were sent to make their military survey but they considered it impracticable from the extreme difficulty of the mountain passes  in this ravine sir henry divided his forces one division nine hundred strong led by lieutenantcolonel campbell was to make a circuit through the forest round the western side of bear hill so as to gain the rear of fort montgomery after sir henry had allowed sufficient time for them to make the circuit he was to proceed with the other division down the ravine towards the river turn to the left along a narrow strip of land between the hudson and a small lake called sinipink pond which lay at the foot of bear hill and advance upon fort clinton both forts were to be attacked at the same time  the detachment under campbell set off in high spirits it was composed partly of royalists led by colonel beverly robinson of new york partly of emericks chasseurs and partly of grenadiers under lord rawdon with him went count gabrouski a polish nobleman aidedecamp to sir henry clinton everything thus far had been conducted with celerity and apparent secrecy and complete surprise of both forts was anticipated sir henry had indeed outwitted one of the guardians of the highlands but the other was aware of his designs governor clinton on receiving intelligence of ships of war coming up the hudson had sent scouts beyond the dunderberg to watch their movements early on the present morning word had been brought him that forty boats were landing a large force at stony point he now in his turn apprehended an attack and sent to putnam for reinforcements preparing in the meantime to make such defence as his scanty means afforded  a lieutenant was sent out with thirty men from fort clinton to proceed along the riverroad and reconnoitre he fell in with the advance guard of sir henry clintons division and retreated skirmishing to the fort a larger detachment was sent out to check the approach of the enemy on this side while sixty men afterwards increased to a hundred took post with a brass fieldpiece in the bear hill defile a narrow and rugged pass bordered by shagged forests as campbell and his division came pressing forward they were checked by the discharge of firearms and of the brass fieldpiece which swept the steep defile the british troops then filed off on each side into the woods to surround the americans the latter finding it impossible to extricate their fieldpiece in the rugged pass spiked it and retreated into the fort  sir henry clinton had met with equally obstinate opposition in his approach to fort clinton the narrow strip of land between lake sinipink and the hudson along which he advanced being fortified by an abatis by four oclock the americans were driven within their works and both forts were assailed the defence was desperate for governor clinton was a hard fighter and he was still in hopes of reinforcements from putnam not knowing that the messenger he sent to him had turned traitor and deserted to the enemy  about five oclock he was summoned to surrender in five minutes to prevent the effusion of blood the reply was a refusal about ten minutes afterwards there was a general attack upon both forts it was resisted with obstinate spirit the action continued until dusk the ships under commodore hotham approached near enough to open an irregular fire upon the forts and upon the vessels anchored above the chevauxdefrise the latter returned the fire and the flash and roar of their cannonry in the gathering darkness and among the echoes of the mountains increased the terrors of the strife the works however were too extensive to be manned by the scanty garrisons they were entered by different places and carried at the point of the bayonet the americans fought desperately from one redoubt to anothersome were slain some taken prisoners and some escaped under cover of the night to the river or the mountains the garrison writes clinton significantly had to fight their way out as many as could as we determined not to surrender  his brother james was saved from a deadly thrust of a bayonet by a garrison orderlybook in his pocket but he received a flesh wound in the thigh he slid down a precipice one hundred feet high into the ravine between the forts and escaped to the woods the governor leaped down the rocks to the river side where a boat was putting off with a number of the fugitives the boat crossed the hudson in safety and before midnight the governor was with putnam at continental village concerting further measures  putnam had been completely outmanoeuvred by sir henry clinton he had continued until late in the morning in the belief that peekskill and fort independence were to be the objects of attack in the course of the morning he sallied forth with brigadiergeneral parsons to reconnoitre the ground near the enemy after their return they were alarmed he says by a very heavy and hot firing both of small arms and cannon at fort montgomery aware of the real point of danger he immediately detached five hundred men to reinforce the garrison they had six miles to march along the eastern shore and then to cross the river before they could do so the fate of the forts was decided  british historians acknowledge that the valor and resolution displayed by the americans in the defence of these forts were in no instance exceeded during the war their loss in killed wounded and missing was stated at two hundred and fifty a large proportion of the number engaged colonel campbell who commanded the enemys detachment major grant of the new york volunteers and count gabrouski sir henrys polish aidedecamp were slain in the assault their fall exasperated the assailants who revenged their loss with considerable slaughter  on the capture of the forts the american frigates and galleys stationed for the protection of the chevauxdefrise slipped their cables made all sail and endeavored to escape up the river the wind however proved adverse there was danger of their falling into the hands of the enemy the crews therefore set them on fire and abandoned them on the following morning the chevauxdefrise and other obstructions between fort montgomery and anthonys nose were cleared away the americans evacuated forts independence and constitution and a free passage up the hudson was open for the british ships sir henry clinton proceeded no further in person but left the rest of the enterprise to be accomplished by sir james wallace and general vaughan with a flying squadron of light frigates and a considerable detachment of troops  putnam had retreated to a pass in the mountains on the east side of the river near fishkill having removed as much of the stores and baggage as possible from the post he had abandoned in a letter to washington oct 8th he writes governor clinton is exerting himself in collecting the militia of this state brigadiergeneral parsons i have sent off to forward in the connecticut militia which are now arriving in great numbers i therefore hope and trust that in the course of a few days i shall be able to oppose the progress of the enemy  he had concerted with governor clinton that they should move to the northward with their forces along the opposite shores of the hudson endeavoring to keep pace with the enemys ships and cover the country from their attacks the enemys lightarmed vessels were now making their way up the river landing marauding parties occasionally to make depredations  as soon as the governor could collect a little force he pressed forward to protect kingston esopus the seat of the state legislature the enemy in the meantime landed from their ships routed about one hundred and fifty militia collected to oppose them marched to the village set fire to it in every part consuming great quantities of stores collected there and then retreated to their ships having laid kingston in ashes the enemy proceeded in their ravages destroying the residences of conspicuous patriots at rhinebeck livingston manor and elsewhere and among others the mansion of the widow of the brave general montgomerytrusting to close their desolating career by a triumphant junction with burgoyne at albany  while sir henry clinton had been thundering in the highlands burgoyne and his army had been wearing out hope within their intrenchments vigilantly watched but unassailed by the americans on the 7th of october burgoyne determined to make a grand movement on the left of the american camp to discover whether he could force a passage should it be necessary to advance or dislodge it from its position should he have to retreat another object was to cover a forage of the army which was suffering from the great scarcity for this purpose fifteen hundred of his best troops with two twelvepounders two howitzers and six sixpounders were to be led by himself seconded by majorgenerals phillips and riedesel and brigadiergeneral fraser on leaving his camp he committed the guard of it on the high grounds to brigadiergenerals hamilton and specht and of the redoubts on the low grounds near the river to brigadiergeneral gall  forming his troops within threequarters of a mile of the left of the americans though covered from their sight by the forest he sent out a corps of rangers provincials and indians to skulk through the woods get in their rear and give them an alarm at the time the attack took place in front the movement though carried on behind the screen of forests was discovered in the afternoon the advanced guard of the american centre beat to arms the alarm was repeated throughout the line gates ordered his officers to their alarm posts and sent forth wilkinson the adjutantgeneral to inquire the cause from a rising ground in an open place he descried the enemy in force returning to the camp he reported the position and movements of the enemy that their front was open their flanks rested on woods under cover of which they might be attacked and their right was skirted by a height that they were reconnoitring the left and he thought offered battle  a plan of attack was soon arranged morgan with his riflemen and a body of infantry was sent to make a circuit through the woods and get possession of the heights on the right of the enemy while general poor with his brigade of new york and new hampshire troops and a part of leonards brigade were to advance against the enemys left morgan was to make an attack on the heights as soon as he should hear the fire opened below  burgoyne now drew out his troops in battle array the grenadiers under major ackland with the artillery under major williams formed his left and were stationed on a rising ground with a rivulet called mill creek in front next to them were the hessians under riedesel and british under phillips forming the centre the lightinfantry under lord balcarras formed the extreme right having in the advance a detachment of five hundred picked men under general fraser ready to flank the americans as soon as they should be attacked in front  he had scarce made these arrangements when he was astonished and confounded by a thundering of artillery on his left and a rattling fire of rifles on the woody heights on his right the troops under poor advanced steadily up the ascent where acklands grenadiers and williams artillery were stationed received their fire and then rushed forward acklands grenadiers received the first brunt but it extended along the line as detachment after detachment arrived and was carried on with inconceivable fury the artillery was repeatedly taken and retaken and at length remained in possession of the americans who turned it upon its former owners major ackland was wounded in both legs and taken prisoner major williams of the artillery was also captured the headlong impetuosity of the attack confounded the regular tacticians much of this has been ascribed to the presence and example of arnold that daring officer who had lingered in the camp in expectation of a fight was exasperated at having no command assigned him on hearing the din of battle he could restrain no longer his warlike impulse but threw himself on his horse and sallied forth putting spurs to his horse he dashed into the scene of action and was received with acclamation being the superior officer in the field his orders were obeyed of course putting himself at the head of the troops of learneds brigade he attacked the hessians in the enemys centre and broke them with repeated charges indeed for a time his actions seemed to partake of frenzy riding hither and thither brandishing his sword and cheering on the men to acts of desperation  morgan in the meantime was harassing the enemys right wing with an incessant fire of smallarms and preventing it from sending any assistance to the centre general fraser with his chosen corps for some time rendered great protection to this wing mounted on an irongray charger his uniform of a field officer made him a conspicuous object for morgans sharpshooters one bullet cut the crupper of his horse another grazed his mane a moment afterwards he was shot down by a marksman posted in a tree two grenadiers bore him to the camp his fall was as a deathblow to his corps the arrival on the field of a large reinforcement of new york troops under general ten broeck completed the confusion burgoyne saw that the field was lost and now only thought of saving his camp the troops nearest to the lines were ordered to throw themselves within them while generals phillips and riedesel covered the retreat of the main body which was in danger of being cut off the artillery was abandoned all the horses and most of the men who had so bravely defended it having been killed the troops though hard pressed retired in good order scarcely had they entered the camp when it was stormed with great fury the americans with arnold at their head rushing to the lines under a severe discharge of grapeshot and smallarms lord balcarras defended the intrenchments bravely the action was fierce and well sustained on both sides after an ineffectual attempt to make his way into the camp in this quarter at the point of the bayonet arnold spurred his horse toward the right flank of the camp occupied by the german reserve where lieutenantcolonel brooks was making a general attack with a massachusetts regiment here with a part of a platoon he forced his way into a sallyport but a shot from the retreating hessians killed his horse and wounded him in the same leg which had received a wound before quebec he was borne off from the field but not until the victory was complete for the germans retreated from the works leaving on the field their brave defender lieutenantcolonel breyman mortally wounded  the night was now closing in the victory of the americans was decisive they had routed the enemy killed and wounded a great number made many prisoners taken their fieldartillery and gained possession of a part of their works which laid open the right and the rear of their camp they lay all night on their arms within half a mile of the scene of action prepared to renew the assault upon the camp in the morning affecting scenes had occurred in the enemys camp during this deadly conflict  in the morning previous to the battle the baroness de riedesel had breakfasted with her husband in the camp generals burgoyne phillips and fraser were to dine with her husband and herself in a house in the neighborhood where she and her children were quartered she observed much movement in the camp but was quieted by the assurance that it was to be a mere reconnaissance on her way home she met a number of indians painted and decorated and armed with guns and shouting war war her fears were awakened and scarce had she reached home when she heard the rattling of firearms and the thundering of artillery about one oclock came one of the generals who were to have dined with herpoor general fraserbrought upon a handbarrow mortally wounded the general said to the surgeon tell me the truth is there no hope there was none prayers were read after which he desired that general burgoyne should be requested to have him buried on the next day at six oclock in the evening on a hill where a breastwork had been constructed  lady harriet ackland was in a tent near by news came to her that her husband was mortally wounded and taken prisoner she was in an agony of distress1 the baroness divided the night between soothing attentions to lady harriet and watchful care of her children who were asleep but who she feared might disturb the poor dying general towards morning thinking his agony approaching she wrapped them in blankets and retired with them into the entrance hall courteous even in death the general sent her several messages to beg her pardon for the trouble he thought he was giving her at eight oclock in the morning he expired  footnote 1 lady ackland afterward applied to general burgoyne for permission to pass to the american camp and obtain general gates consent to join her husband it was granted and the american general according to burgoyne received her with all the humanity and respect that her rank her merits and her fortune deserved  burgoyne had shifted his position during the night to heights about a mile to the north close to the river and covered in front by a ravine early in the morning the americans took possession of the camp which he had abandoned a random fire of artillery and smallarms was kept up on both sides during the day the british sharpshooters stationed in the ravine did some execution and general lincoln was wounded in the leg while reconnoitring gates however did not think it advisable to force a desperate enemy when in a strong position at the expense of a prodigal waste of blood he took all measures to cut off his retreat and insure a surrender general fellows with 1400 men had already been sent to occupy the high ground east of the hudson opposite saratoga ford other detachments were sent higher up the river in the direction of lake george  burgoyne saw that nothing was left for him but a prompt and rapid retreat to saratoga yet in this he was delayed by a melancholy duty of friendship it was to attend the obsequies of the gallant fraser who according to his dying request was to be interred at six oclock in the evening within a redoubt which had been constructed on a hill between sunset and dark his body was borne to the appointed place by grenadiers of his division followed by the generals and their staffs the americans seeing indistinctly what in the twilight appeared to be a movement of troops up the hill and in the redoubt pointed their artillery in that direction general gates protested afterwards that had he known what was going on he would have stopped the fire immediately  preparations had been made to decamp immediately after the funeral and at nine oclock at night the retreat commenced large fires had been lighted and many tents were left standing to conceal the movement it was a dismal retreat the rain fell in torrents the roads were deep and broken and the horses weak and halfstarved from want of forage at daybreak there was a halt to refresh the troops and give time for the bateaux laden with provisions to come abreast in three hours the march was resumed but before long there was another halt to guard against an american reconnoitring party which appeared in sight  it rained terribly through the residue of the 9th and in consequence of repeated halts they did not reach saratoga until evening a detachment of americans had arrived there before them and were throwing up intrenchments on a commanding height at fishkill they abandoned their work forded the hudson and joined a force under general fellows posted on the hills east of the river the bridge over the fishkill had been destroyed the artillery could not cross until the ford was examined exhausted by fatigue the men for the most part had not strength nor inclination to cut wood nor make fire but threw themselves upon the wet ground in their wet clothes and slept under the continuing rain  at daylight on the 10th the artillery and the last of the troops passed the fords of the fishkill and took a position upon the heights and in the redoubts formerly constructed there to protect the troops from being attacked in passing the ford by the americans who were approaching burgoyne ordered fire to be set to the farmhouses and other buildings on the south side of the fishkill amongst the rest the noble mansion of general schuyler with storehouses granaries mills and the other appurtenances of a great rural establishment was entirely consumed the measure was condemned by friend as well as foe but he justified it on the principles of selfpreservation  the force under general fellows posted on the opposite hills of the hudson now opened a fire from a battery commanding the ford of that river thus prevented from crossing burgoyne thought to retreat along the west side as far as fort george on the way to canada and sent out workmen under a strong escort to repair the bridges and open the road toward fort edward the escort was soon recalled and the work abandoned for the americans under gates appeared in great force on the heights south of the fishkill and seemed preparing to cross and bring on an engagement the opposite shores of the hudson were now lined with detachments of americans bateaux laden with provisions which had attended the movements of the army were fired upon many taken some retaken with loss of life it was necessary to land the provisions from such as remained and bring them up the hill into the camp which was done under a heavy fire from the american artillery  burgoyne called now a general council of war in which it was resolved since the bridges could not be repaired to abandon the artillery and baggage let the troops carry a supply of provisions upon their backs push forward in the night and force their way across the fords at or near fort edward before the plan could be put into execution scouts brought word that the americans were intrenched opposite those fords and encamped in force with cannon on the high ground between fort edward and fort george in fact by this time the american army augmented by militia and volunteers from all quarters had posted itself in strong positions on both sides of the hudson so as to extend threefourths of a circle round the enemy  giving up all further attempt at retreat burgoyne now fortified his camp on the heights to the north of fishkill still hoping that succor might arrive from sir henry clinton or that an attack upon his trenches might give him some chance of cutting his way through in this situation his troops lay continually on their arms his camp was subjected to cannonading from fellows batteries on the opposite side of the hudson gates batteries on the south of fishkill and a galling fire from morgans riflemen stationed on heights in the rear  the baroness de riedesel and her helpless little ones were exposed to the dangers and horrors of this long turmoil on the morning when the attack was opened general de riedesel sent them to take refuge in a house in the vicinity the baroness succeeded in getting to the house some women and crippled soldiers had already taken refuge there it was mistaken for headquarters and cannonaded the baroness retreated into the cellar laid herself in a corner near the door with her childrens heads upon her knees and passed a sleepless night of mental anguish in the morning the cannonade began anew cannon balls passed through the house repeatedly with a tremendous noise a poor soldier who was about to have a leg amputated lost the other by one of these balls the day was passed among such horrors for six days she and her children remained in this dismal place of refuge  burgoyne was now reduced to despair his forces were diminished by losses by the desertion of canadians and royalists and the total defection of the indians and on inspection it was found that the provisions on hand even upon short allowance would not suffice for more than three days a council of war therefore was called of all the generals fieldofficers and captains commanding troops the deliberations were brief all concurred in the necessity of opening a treaty with general gates for a surrender on honorable terms  negotiations were accordingly opened on the 13th under sanction of a flag lieutenant kingston burgoynes adjutantgeneral was the bearer of a note proposing a cessation of hostilities until terms could be adjusted the first terms offered by gates were that the enemy should lay down their arms within their intrenchments and surrender themselves prisoners of war these were indignantly rejected with an intimation that if persisted in hostilities must recommence  counter proposals were then made by general burgoyne and finally accepted by general gates according to these the british troops were to march out of the camp with artillery and all the honors of war to a fixed place where they were to pile their arms at a word of command from their own officers they were to be allowed a free passage to europe upon condition of not serving again in america during the present war the officers were to be on parole and to wear their sidearms all private property to be sacred no baggage to be searched or molested the capitulation was signed on the 17th of october  the british army at the time of the surrender was reduced by capture death and desertion from nine thousand to five thousand seven hundred and fiftytwo men that of gates regulars and militia amounted to ten thousand five hundred and fiftyfour men on duty between two and three thousand being on the sick list or absent on furlough by this capitulation the americans gained a fine train of artillery seven thousand stand of arms and a great quantity of clothing tents and military stores of all kinds  when the british troops marched forth to deposit their arms at the appointed place colonel wilkinson the adjutantgeneral was the only american soldier to be seen gates had ordered his troops to keep rigidly within their lines that they might not add by their presence to the humiliation of a brave enemy in fact throughout all his conduct during the campaign british writers and burgoyne himself give him credit for acting with great humanity and forbearance  the surrender of burgoyne was soon followed by the evacuation of ticonderoga and fort independence the garrisons retiring to the isle aux noix and st johns as to the armament on the hudson the commanders whom sir henry clinton had left in charge of it received in the midst of their desolating career the astounding intelligence of the capture of the army with which they had come to cooperate nothing remained for them therefore but to drop down the river and return to new york the fortresses in the highlands could not be maintained and were evacuated and destroyed     chapter xlvii battle of germantownhostilities on the delaware   having given the catastrophe of the british invasion from the north we will revert to that part of the years campaign which was passing under the immediate eye of washington we left him encamped at potts grove towards the end of september giving his troops a few days repose after their severe fatigues being rejoined by wayne and smallwood with their brigades and other troops being arrived from the jerseys his force amounted to about eight thousand continentals and three thousand militia with these he advanced on the 30th of september to skippack creek about fourteen miles from germantown where the main body of the british army lay encamped a detachment under cornwallis occupying philadelphia  immediately after the battle of brandywine admiral lord howe with great exertions had succeeded in getting his ships of war and transports round from the chesapeake into the delaware and had anchored them along the western shore from reedy island to newcastle they were prevented from approaching nearer by obstructions which the americans had placed in the river the lowest of these were at billingsport byllings point where chevauxdefrise in the channel of the river were protected by a strong redoubt on the jersey shore higher up were fort mifflin on mud or fort island and fort mercer on the jersey shore with chevauxdefrise between them washington had exerted himself to throw a garrison into fort mifflin and keep up the obstructions of the river sir william howe had concerted operations with his brother by land and water to reduce the forts and clear away the obstructions of the river with this view he detached a part of his force into the jerseys to proceed in the first instance against the fortifications at billingsport  washington had been for some days anxiously on the lookout for some opportunity to strike a blow of consequence when two intercepted letters gave him intelligence of this movement he immediately determined to make an attack upon the british camp at germantown while weakened by the absence of this detachment to understand the plan of the attack some description of the british place of encampment is necessary  germantown at that time was little more than one continued street extending two miles north and south beyond the village and about a hundred yards east of the road stood a spacious stone edifice the countryseat of benjamin chew chief justice of pennsylvania previous to the revolution four roads approached the village from above that is from the north the skippack which was the main road led over chestnut hill and mount airy down to and through the village towards philadelphia forming the street of which we have just spoken on its right and nearly parallel was the monatawny or ridge road passing near the schuylkill and entering the main road below the village on the left of the skippack or main road was the limekiln road running nearly parallel to it for a time and then turning towards it almost at right angles so as to enter the village at the marketplace still further to the left or east and outside of all was the old york road falling into the main road some distance below the village  the main body of the british forces lay encamped across the lower part of the village divided into almost equal parts by the main street or skippack road the right wing commanded by general grant was to the east of the road the left wing to the west each wing was covered by strong detachments and guarded by cavalry general howe had his headquarters in the rear the advance of the army composed of the 2d battalion of british lightinfantry with a train of artillery was more than two miles from the main body on the west of the road with an outlying picket stationed with two sixpounders at allens house on mount airy about threequarters of a mile in the rear of the lightinfantry lay encamped in a field opposite chews house the 40th regiment of infantry under colonel musgrave  according to washingtons plan for the attack sullivan was to command the right wing composed of his own division principally maryland troops and the division of general wayne he was to be sustained by a corps de reserve under lord stirling composed of nashs north carolina and maxwells virginia brigades and to be flanked by the brigade of general conway he was to march down the skippack road and attack the left wing at the same time general armstrong with the pennsylvania militia was to pass down the monatawny or ridge road and get upon the enemys left and rear greene with the left wing composed of his own division and the division of general stephen and flanked by mcdougalls brigade was to march down the limekiln road so as to enter the village at the markethouse the two divisions were to attack the enemys right wing in front mcdougall with his brigade to attack it in flank while smallwoods division of maryland militia and formans jersey brigade making a circuit by the old york road were to attack it in the rear twothirds of the forces were thus directed against the enemys right wing under the idea that if it could be forced the whole army must be pushed into the schuylkill or compelled to surrender the attack was to begin on all quarters at daybreak  about dusk on the 3d of october the army left its encampment at matuchen hills by its different routes washington accompanied the right wing it had fifteen miles of weary march to make over rough roads so that it was after daybreak when the troops emerged from the woods on chestnut hill the morning was dark with a heavy fog a detachment advanced to attack the enemys outpicket stationed at allens house the patrol was led by captain allen mclane he fell in with double sentries whom he killed with the loss of one man the alarm however was given the distant roll of a drum and the call to arms resounded through the murky air the picket guard after discharging their two sixpounders were routed and retreated down the south side of mount airy to the battalion of lightinfantry who were forming in order of battle as their pursuers descended into the valley the sun rose but was soon obscured wayne led the attack upon the lightinfantry they broke at first but soon formed again when a heavy and welldirected fire took place on both sides they again gave way but being supported by the grenadiers returned to the charge sullivans division and conways brigade formed on the west of the road and joined in the attack the rest of the troops were too far to the north to render any assistance the infantry after fighting bravely for a time broke and ran leaving their artillery behind they were hotly pursued by wayne his troops remembered the bloody 20th of september and the ruthless slaughter of their comrades it was a terrible mel√©e the fog together with the smoke of the cannonry and musketry made it almost as dark as night our people mistaking one another for the enemy frequently exchanged shots before they discovered their error the whole of the enemys advance were driven from their camping ground leaving their tents standing with all their baggage colonel musgrave with six companies of the 40th regiment threw himself into chews house barricaded the doors and lower windows and took post above stairs the main torrent of the retreat passed by pursued by wayne into the village  as the residue of this division of the army came up to join in the pursuit musgrave and his men opened a fire of musketry upon them from the upper windows of his citadel this brought them to a halt some of the officers were for pushing on but general knox stoutly objected insisting on the old military maxim never to leave a garrisoned castle in the rear his objection unluckily prevailed a flag sent with a summons to surrender was fired upon the house was now cannonaded but the artillery was too light to have the desired effect an attempt was made to set fire to the basement he who attempted it was shot dead from a grated cellar window at length a regiment was left to keep guard upon the mansion and hold its garrison in check and the rear division again pressed forward  this half hours delay however of nearly onehalf of the army disconcerted the action the divisions and brigades thus separated from each other by the skirmishing attack upon chews house could not be reunited the fog and smoke rendered all objects indistinct at thirty yards distance the different parts of the army knew nothing of the position or movements of each other and the commanderinchief could take no view nor gain any information of the situation of the whole the original plan of attack was only effectively carried into operation in the centre still the action though disconnected irregular and partial was animated in various quarters sullivan being reinforced by nashs north carolina troops and conways brigade pushed on a mile beyond chews house where the left wing of the enemy gave way before him  greene and stephen with their divisions having had to make a circuit were late in coming into action and became separated from each other part of stephens division being arrested by a heavy fire from chews house and pausing to return it greene however with his division pressed rapidly forward drove an advance regiment of lightinfantry before him took a number of prisoners and made his way quite to the markethouse in the centre of the village where he encountered the right wing of the british drawn up to receive him the impetuosity of his attack had an evident effect upon the enemy who began to waver forman and smallwood with the jersey and maryland militia were just showing themselves on the right flank of the enemy and our troops seemed on the point of carrying the whole encampment at this moment a singular panic seized our army various causes are assigned for it sullivan alleges that his troops had expended all their cartridges and were alarmed by seeing the enemy gathering on their left and by the cry of a lighthorseman that the enemy were getting round them waynes division which had pushed the enemy nearly three miles was alarmed by the approach of a large body of american troops on its left flank which it mistook for foes and fell back in defiance of every effort of its officers to rally it in its retreat it came upon stephens division and threw it into a panic being in its turn mistaken for the enemy thus all fell into confusion and our army fled from their own victory  in the meantime the enemy having recovered from the first effects of the surprise advanced in their turn general grey brought up the left wing and pressed upon the american troops as they receded lord cornwallis with a squadron of lighthorse from philadelphia arrived just in time to join in the pursuit the retreat of the americans was attended with less loss than might have been expected and they carried off all their cannon and wounded the retreat continued through the day to perkiomen creek a distance of twenty miles  the loss of the enemy in this action is stated by them to be seventyone killed four hundred and fifteen wounded and fourteen missing among the killed was brigadiergeneral agnew the american loss was one hundred and fifty killed five hundred and twentyone wounded and about four hundred taken prisoners among the killed was general nash of north carolina among the prisoners was colonel mathews of virginia  the sudden retreat of the army gave washington surprise chagrin and mortification every account said he subsequently in a letter to the president of congress confirms the opinion i at first entertained that our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring herself in our favor the tumult disorder and even despair which it seems had taken place in the british army were scarcely to be paralleled and it is said so strongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail that chester was fixed on for their rendezvous i can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity than the extreme haziness of the weather  the plan of attack was too widely extended for strict concert and too complicated for precise cooperation as it had to be conducted in the night and with a large proportion of undisciplined militia  but although the americans were balked of the victory which seemed within their grasp the impression made by the audacity of this attempt upon germantown was greater we are told than that caused by any single incident of the war after lexington and bunkers hill  washington remained a few days at perkiomen creek to give his army time to rest and recover from the disorder incident to a retreat having been reinforced by the arrival of twelve hundred rhode island troops from peekskill under general varnum and nearly a thousand virginia maryland and pennsylvania troops he gradually drew nearer to philadelphia and took a strong position at white marsh within fourteen miles of that city by a resolution of congress all persons taken within thirty miles of any place occupied by british troops in the act of conveying supplies to them were subjected to martial law acting under the resolution washington detached large bodies of militia to scour the roads above the city and between the schuylkill and chester to intercept all supplies going to the enemy  on the forts and obstructions in the river washington mainly counted to complete the harassment of philadelphia these defences had been materially impaired the works at billingsport had been attacked and destroyed and some of the enemys ships had forced their way through the chevauxdefrise placed there the american frigate delaware stationed in the river between the upper forts and philadelphia had run aground before a british battery and been captured  it was now the great object of the howes to reduce and destroy and of washington to defend and maintain the remaining forts and obstructions fort mifflin which we have already mentioned was erected on a low green reedy island in the delaware a few miles below philadelphia and below the mouth of the schuylkill it consisted of a strong redoubt with extensive outworks and batteries there was but a narrow channel between the island and the pennsylvania shore the main channel practicable for ships was on the other side in this were sunk strong chevauxdefrise difficult either to be weighed or cut through and dangerous to any ships that might run against them subjected as they would be to the batteries of fort mifflin on one side and on the other to those of fort mercer a strong work at red bank on the jersey shore  fort mifflin was garrisoned by troops of the maryland line under lieutenantcolonel samuel smith of baltimore and had kept up a brave defence against batteries erected by the enemy on the pennsylvania shore a reinforcement of virginia troops made the garrison between three and four hundred strong floating batteries galleys and fireships commanded by commodore hazelwood were stationed under the forts and about the river  fort mercer had hitherto been garrisoned by militia but washington now replaced them by four hundred of general varnums rhode island continentals colonel christopher greene was put in command a brave officer who had accompanied arnold in his rough expedition to canada and fought valiantly under the walls of quebec colonel greene was accompanied by captain mauduit duplessis who was to have the direction of the artillery he was a young french engineer of great merit who had volunteered in the american cause and received a commission from congress the chevauxdefrise in the river had been constructed under his superintendence  greene aided by duplessis made all haste to put fort mercer in a state of defence but before the outworks were completed he was surprised october 22 by the appearance of a large force emerging from a wood within cannon shot of the fort their uniforms showed them to be hessians they were in fact four battalions twelve hundred strong of grenadiers picked men beside lightinfantry and chasseurs all commanded by count donop who had figured in the last years campaign colonel greene in nowise dismayed by the superiority of the enemy forming in glistening array before the wood prepared for a stout resistance in a little while an officer was descried riding slowly up with a flag accompanied by a drummer greene ordered his men to keep out of sight that the fort might appear but slightly garrisoned  when within proper distance the drummer sounded a parley and the officer summoned the garrison to surrender with a threat of no quarter in case of resistance greenes reply was that the post would be defended to the last extremity the flag rode back and made a report forthwith the hessians were seen at work throwing up a battery within half a mile of the outworks it was finished by four oclock and opened a heavy cannonade under cover of which the enemy were preparing to approach  as the american outworks were but half finished and were too extensive to be manned by the garrison it was determined by greene and duplessis that the troops should make but a short stand there to gall the enemy in their approach and then retire within the redoubt which was defended by a deep intrenchment boarded and fraised  donop led on his troops in gallant style under cover of a heavy fire from his battery they advanced in two columns to attack the outworks in two places as they advanced they were excessively galled by a flanking fire from the american galleys and batteries and by sharp volleys from the outworks the latter however as had been concerted were quickly abandoned by the garrison the enemy entered at two places and imagining the day their own the two columns pushed on with shouts to storm different parts of the redoubt as yet no troops were to be seen but as one of the columns approached the redoubt on the north side a tremendous discharge of grapeshot and musketry burst forth from the embrasures in front and a halfmasked battery on the left the slaughter was prodigious the column was driven back in confusion count donop with the other column in attempting the south side of the redoubt had passed the abatis when a similar tempest of artillery and musketry burst upon them some were killed on the spot many were wounded and the rest were driven out donop himself received a mortal wound lieutenantcolonel mingerode the second in command was also dangerously wounded several other of the best officers were slain or disabled the troops retreated in confusion hotly pursued and were again cut up in their retreat by the flanking fire from the galleys and floating batteries the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded in this brief but severe action was about four hundred men that of the americans eight killed and twentynine wounded  according to the plan of the enemy fort mifflin opposite to fort mercer was to have been attacked at the same time by water the force employed was the augusta of sixtyfour guns the roebuck of fortyfour two frigates the merlin sloop of eighteen guns and a galley they forced their way through the lower line of chevauxdefrise but the augusta and merlin ran aground below the second line and every effort to get them off proved fruitless to divert attention from their situation the other vessels drew as near to fort mifflin as they could and opened a cannonade they kept up a fire upon the fort throughout the evening and recommenced it early in the morning as did likewise the british batteries on the pennsylvania shore hoping that under cover of it the ships might be got off a strong adverse wind however kept the tide from rising sufficiently to float them  the americans discovered their situation and sent down four fireships to destroy them but without effect a heavy fire was now opened upon them from the galleys and floating batteries it was warmly returned in the course of the action a redhot shot set the augusta on fire it was impossible to check the flames she blew up while the second lieutenant the chaplain the gunner and several of the crew were yet on board most of whom perished the merlin was now set on fire and abandoned the roebuck and the other vessels dropped down the river and the attack on fort mifflin was given up  these signal repulses of the enemy had an animating effect on the public mind and were promptly noticed by congress colonel greene who commanded at fort mercer lieutenantcolonel smith of maryland who commanded at fort mifflin and commodore hazelwood who commanded the galleys received the thanks of that body and subsequently a sword was voted to each as a testimonial of distinguished merit  we have heretofore had occasion to advert to the annoyances and perplexities occasioned to washington by the claims and pretensions of foreign officers who had entered into the service among the officers who came out with lafayette was the baron de kalb a german by birth but who had long been employed in the french service and though a silverhaired veteran sixty years of age was yet fresh and active and vigorous in the month of september congress had given him the commission of majorgeneral to date with that of lafayette  this instantly produced a remonstrance from brigadiergeneral conway who considered himself slighted and forgot in their giving a superior rank to his own to a person who had not rendered the cause the least service and who had been his inferior in france he claimed therefore for himself the rank of majorgeneral and was supported in his pretensions by persons both in and out of congress especially by mifflin the quartermastergeneral  washington had already been disgusted by the overweening presumption of conway and was surprised to hear that his application was likely to be successful he wrote on the 17th of october to richard henry lee then in congress warning him that such an appointment would be as unfortunate a measure as ever was adopted i would ask writes he why the youngest brigadier in the service should be put over the heads of the oldest and thereby take rank and command of gentlemen who but yesterday were his seniors this truth i am well assured of that they will not serve under him i leave you to guess therefore at the situation this army would be in at so important a crisis if this event should take place  this opposition to his presumptuous aspirations at once threw conway into a faction forming under the auspices of general mifflin this gentleman had recently tendered his resignation of the commission of majorgeneral and quartermastergeneral on the plea of ill health but was busily engaged in intrigues against the commanderinchief towards whom he had long cherished a secret hostility conway now joined with him heart and hand and soon became so active and prominent a member of the faction that it acquired the name of conways cabal the object was to depreciate the military character of washington in comparison with that of gates to whom was attributed the whole success of the northern campaign  gates was perfectly ready for such an elevation in fact in the excitement of his vanity he appears to have forgotten that there was a commanderinchief to whom he was accountable he neglected to send him any despatch on the subject of the surrender of burgoyne contenting himself with sending one to congress then sitting at yorktown washington was left to hear of the important event by casual rumor until he received a copy of the capitulation in a letter from general putnam  gates was equally neglectful to inform him of the disposition he intended to make of the army under his command he delayed even to forward morgans rifle corps though their services were no longer needed in his camp and were so much required in the south it was determined therefore in a council of war that one of washingtons staff should be sent to gates to represent the critical state of affairs colonel alexander hamilton his youthful but intelligent aidedecamp was charged with this mission he bore a letter from washington to gates dated october 30th of which the following is an extract by this opportunity i do myself the pleasure to congratulate you on the signal success of the army under your command at the same time i cannot but regret that a matter of such magnitude and so interesting to our general operations should have reached me by report only or through the channel of letters not bearing that authenticity which the importance of it required and which it would have received by a line under your signature stating the simple fact such was the calm and dignified notice of an instance of official disrespect almost amounting to insubordination it is doubtful whether gates in his state of mental effervescence felt the noble severity of the rebuke  a fortuitous circumstance which we shall explain hereafter apprised washington about this time that a correspondence derogatory to his military character and conduct was going on between general conway and general gates washington conducted himself with dignified forbearance contenting himself with letting conway know by the following brief note dated november 9th that his correspondence was detected  sira letter which i received last night contained the following paragraphin a letter from general conway to general gates he says heaven has determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it  i am sir your humble servant  george washington  the brevity of this note rendered it the more astounding it was a handgrenade thrown into the midst of the cabal the effect upon other members we shall show hereafter it seems at first to have prostrated conway he immediately sent in his resignation it was not however accepted by congress on the contrary he was supported by the cabal and was advanced to further honors which we shall specify hereafter in the meantime the cabal went on to make invidious comparisons between the achievements of the two armies deeply derogatory to that under washington publicly he took no notice of them  the nonarrival of reinforcements from the northern army continued to embarrass washingtons operations the enemy were making preparations for further attempts upon forts mercer and mifflin general howe was constructing redoubts and batteries on province island on the west side of the delaware within five hundred yards of fort mifflin and mounting them with heavy cannon washington consulted with his general officers what was to be done had the army received the expected reinforcements from the north it might have detached sufficient force to the west side of the schuylkill to dislodge the enemy from province island but at present it would require almost the whole of the army for the purpose this would leave the public stores at easton bethlehem and allentown uncovered as well as several of the hospitals it would also leave the post at red bank unsupported through which fort mifflin was reinforced and supplied it was determined therefore to await the arrival of the expected reinforcements from the north before making any alteration in the disposition of the army in the meantime the garrisons of forts mercer and mifflin were increased and general varnum was stationed at red bank with his brigade to be at hand to render reinforcements to either of them as occasion might require  on the 10th of november general howe commenced a heavy fire upon fort mifflin from his batteries which mounted eighteen twentyfour and thirtytwo pounders major fleury acquitted himself with intelligence and spirit as engineer but an incessant cannonade and bombardment for several days defied all repairs the blockhouses were demolished the palisades beaten down the guns dismounted the barracks reduced to ruins captain treat a young officer of great merit who commanded the artillery was killed as were several noncommissioned officers and privates and a number were wounded the survivors who were not wounded were exhausted by want of sleep hard duty and constant exposure to the rain colonel smith himself was disabled by severe contusions and obliged to retire to red bank  the fort was in ruins there was danger of its being carried by storm but the gallant fleury thought it might yet be defended with the aid of fresh troops such were furnished from varnums brigade lieutenantcolonel russell of the connecticut line replaced colonel smith he in his turn was obliged to relinquish the command through fatigue and ill health and was succeeded by major thayer of rhode island aided by captain afterwards commodore talbot on the fourth day the enemy brought a large indiaman cut down to a floating battery to bear upon the works but though it opened a terrible fire it was silenced before night the next day several shipsofwar got within gunshot two prepared to attack it in front others brought their guns to bear on fort mercer while two made their way into the narrow channel between mud island and the pennsylvania shore to operate with the british batteries erected there  at a concerted signal a cannonade was opened from all quarters the heroic little garrison stood the fire without flinching the danger however was growing imminent the batteries on province island enfiladed the works the ships in the inner channel approached so near as to throw handgrenades into the fort while marines stationed in the roundtops stood ready to pick off any of the garrison that came in sight the scene now became awful incessant firing from ships forts gondolas and floating batteries with clouds of sulphurous smoke and the deafening thunder of cannon before night there was hardly a fortification to defend palisades were shivered guns dismounted the whole parapet levelled there was terrible slaughter most of the company of artillery were destroyed fleury himself was wounded captain talbot received a wound in the wrist but continued bravely fighting until disabled by another wound in the hip  to hold out longer was impossible colonel thayer made preparations to evacuate the fort in the night everything was removed in the evening that could be conveyed away without too much exposure to the murderous fire from the roundtops the wounded were taken over to red bank accompanied by part of the garrison thayer remained with forty men until eleven oclock when they set fire to what was combustible of the fort they had so nobly defended and crossed to red bank by the light of its flames  the loss of this fort was deeply regretted by washington though he gave high praise to the officers and men of the garrison colonel smith was voted a sword by congress and fleury received the commission of lieutenantcolonel washington still hoped to keep possession of red bank and thereby prevent the enemy from weighing the chevauxdefrise before the frost obliged their ships to quit the river i am anxiously waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward writes he who ought from the time they have had my orders to have been here before this colonel hamilton one of my aides is up the north river doing all he can to push them forward but he writes me word that he finds many unaccountable delays thrown in his way the want of these troops has embarrassed all my measures exceedingly  the delays in question will best be explained by a few particulars concerning the mission of colonel hamilton hamilton had expected to find matters in such a train that he would have little to do but hurry on ample reinforcements already on the march but he soon discovered that it was designed to retain the greater part of the northern army at albany and in the highlands sparing only about four thousand men to the commanderinchief morgan and his riflemen had been tardily detached he having met them on the march near new windsor on the morning of november 2d putnam he found was busy with the project of an attack on new york and gates was full of reasons why more troops should not be despatched southward claiming that there was no certainty that sir henry clinton had gone to join howe and that there was a possibility of his returning up the river if his army were depleted albany would be exposed new england left open to the ravages of the enemy and his own contemplated movement against ticonderoga abandoned it was with the greatest difficulty that hamilton induced gates to detach the brigades of poor and patterson to the aid of the commanderinchief washington would not have received a man he declared if the whole could have been kept at albany with any decency governor clinton hamilton found was the only general officer who appreciated washingtons position and disposed to promote the general good independent of personal considerations putnam who unlike gates was innocent of intrigues against the commanderinchief was still so bent upon his favorite scheme of an attack on new york that only hamiltons positive orders as from washington to send the continental troops under him southward retaining the militia brought the bellicose veteran to a reluctant compliance washington in a letter to putnam reprimanded his tardiness concluding with i could wish that in future my orders may be immediately complied with without arguing upon the propriety of them the intrigues in progress around him made it necessary for washington at this moment to assert his superior command although he acquitted putnam of any part in them  in the meantime sir william howe was following up the reduction of fort mifflin by an expedition against fort mercer which still impeded the navigation of the delaware on the 17th of november lord cornwallis was detached with two thousand men to cross from chester into the jerseys where he would be joined by a force advancing from new york apprised of this movement washington detached general huntington with a brigade to join varnum at red bank general greene was also ordered to repair thither with his division and an express was sent off to general glover who was on his way through the jerseys with his brigade directing him to file off to the left towards the same point these troops with such militia as could be collected washington hoped would be sufficient to save the fort before they could form a junction however and reach their destination cornwallis appeared before it a defence against such superior force was hopeless the works were abandoned they were taken possession of by the enemy who proceeded to destroy them after the destruction had been accomplished the reinforcements from the north so long and so anxiously expected and so shamefully delayed made their appearance had they arrived but ten days sooner writes washington to his brother it would i think have put it in my power to save fort mifflin which defended the chevauxdefrise and consequently have rendered philadelphia a very ineligible situation for the enemy this winter  the evil which washington had so anxiously striven to prevent had now been effected the american vessels stationed in the river had lost all protection some of the galleys escaped past the batteries of philadelphia in a fog and took refuge in the upper part of the delaware the rest were set on fire by their crews and abandoned washington advised the navy board now that the enemy had the command of the river to have all the american frigates scuttled and sunk immediately the board objected to sinking them but said they should be ballasted and plugged ready to be sunk in case of attack washington warned them that an attack would be sudden so as to get possession of them before they could be sunk or destroyedhis advice and warning were unheeded the consequence will hereafter be shown     chapter xlviii the army on the schuylkillat valley forgethe conway cabal   on the evening of the 24th of november washington reconnoitred carefully and thoughtfully the lines and defences about philadelphia from the opposite side of the schuylkill his army was now considerably reinforced the garrison was weakened by the absence of a large body of troops under lord cornwallis in the jerseys some of the general officers thought this an advantageous moment for an attack upon the city such was the opinion of lord stirling and especially of general wayne mad anthony as he was familiarly called always eager for some daring enterprise the recent victory at saratoga had dazzled the public mind and produced a general impatience for something equally striking and effective in this quarter with an anxious eye washington scrutinized the enemys works they appeared to be exceeding strong a chain of redoubts extended along the most commanding ground from the schuylkill to the delaware they were framed planked and of great thickness and were surrounded by a deep ditch enclosed and fraised the intervals were filled with an abatis in constructing which all the apple trees of the neighborhood beside forest trees had been sacrificed  the idea of lord stirling and those in favor of an attack was that it should be at different points at daylight the main body to attack the lines to the north of the city while greene embarking his men in boats at dunks ferry and passing down the delaware and potter with a body of continentals and militia moving down the west side of the schuylkill should attack the eastern and western fronts washington saw that there was an opportunity for a brilliant blow that might satisfy the impatience of the public but he saw that it must be struck at the expense of a fearful loss of life  returning to camp he held a council of war of his principal officers in which the matter was debated at great length and with some warmth but without coming to a decision at breaking up washington requested that each member of the council would give his opinion the next morning in writing and he sent off a messenger in the night for the written opinion of general greene  only four members of the council stirling wayne scott and woodford were in favor of an attack of which lord stirling drew up the plan eleven including greene were against it objecting among other things that the enemys lines were too strong and too well supported and their force too numerous well disciplined and experienced to be assailed without great loss and the hazard of a failure had washington been actuated by mere personal ambition and a passion for military fame he might have disregarded the loss and hazarded the failure but his patriotism was superior to his ambition he shrank from a glory that must be achieved at such a cost and the idea of an attack was abandoned  a letter from general greene received about this time gave washington some gratifying intelligence about his youthful friend the marquis de lafayette though not quite recovered from the wound received at the battle of brandywine he had accompanied general greene as a volunteer in his expedition into the jerseys and had been indulged by him with an opportunity of gratifying his belligerent humor in a brush with cornwallis outposts the marquis writes greene with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps attacked the enemys picket last evening killed about twenty wounded many more and took about twenty prisoners the marquis is charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and rifle corps the marquis is determined to be in the way of danger  washington had repeatedly written to congress in favor of giving the marquis a command equal to his nominal rank he availed himself of the present occasion to support his former recommendations by transmitting to congress an account of lafayettes youthful exploit he received in return an intimation from that body that it was their pleasure he should appoint the marquis to the command of a division in the continental army the division of general stephen at this time was vacant that veteran officer who had formerly won honor for himself in the french war having been dismissed for misconduct at the battle of germantown the result of intemperate habits into which he unfortunately had fallen lafayette was forthwith appointed to the command of that division  at this juncture november 27th a modification took place in the board of war indicative of the influence which was operating in congress it was increased from three to five members general mifflin joseph trumbull richard peters colonel pickering and last though certainly not least general gates mifflins resignation of the commission of quartermastergeneral had recently been accepted but that of majorgeneral was continued to him though without pay general gates was appointed president of the board and the president of congress was instructed to express to him in communicating the intelligence the high sense which that body entertained of his abilities and peculiar fitness to discharge the duties of that important office upon the right execution of which the success of the american cause so eminently depended and to inform him it was their intention to continue his rank as majorgeneral and that he might officiate at the board or in the field as occasion might require furthermore that he should repair to congress with all convenient despatch to enter upon the duties of his appointment it was evidently the idea of the cabal that gates was henceforth to be the masterspirit of the war  while busy faction was at work both in and out of congress to undermine the fame and authority of washington general howe according to his own threat was preparing to drive him beyond the mountains  on the 4th of december captain allen mclane a vigilant officer already mentioned of the maryland line brought word to headquarters that an attack was to be made that very night on the camp at white marsh washington made his dispositions to receive the meditated assault and in the meantime detached mclane with one hundred men to reconnoitre the latter met the van of the enemy about eleven oclock at night on the germantown road attacked it at the three mile run forced it to change its line of march and hovered about and impeded it throughout the night about three oclock in the morning the alarmgun announced the approach of the enemy they appeared at daybreak and encamped on chestnut hill within three miles of washingtons right wing brigadiergeneral james irvine with six hundred of the pennsylvania militia was sent out to skirmish with their light advanced parties he encountered them at the foot of the hill but after a short conflict in which several were killed and wounded his troops gave way and fled in all directions leaving him and four or five of his men wounded on the field who were taken prisoners  general howe passed the day in reconnoitring and at night changed his ground and moved to a hill on the left and within a mile of the american line it was his wish to have a general action but to have it on advantageous terms he had scrutinized washingtons position and pronounced it inaccessible for three days he manoeuvred to draw him from it shifting his own position occasionally but still keeping on advantageous ground washington was not to be decoyed he knew the vast advantages which superior science discipline and experience gave the enemy in open field fight and remained within his lines all his best officers approved of his policy several sharp skirmishes occurred at edge hill and elsewhere in which morgans riflemen and the maryland militia were concerned there was loss on both sides but the americans gave way before a great superiority of numbers  on the 7th there was every appearance that howe meditated an attack on the left wing washingtons heart now beat high and he prepared for a warm and decisive action in the course of the day he rode through every brigade giving directions how the attack was to be met and exhorting his troops to depend mainly on the bayonet the day wore away with nothing but skirmishes in which morgans riflemen and the maryland militia under colonel gist rendered good service an attack was expected in the night or early in the morning but no attack took place the spirit manifested by the americans in their recent contests had rendered the british commanders cautious  the next day in the afternoon the enemy were again in motion but instead of advancing filed off to the left halted and lit up a long string of fires on the heights behind which they retreated silently and precipitately in the night by the time washington received intelligence of their movement they were in full march by two or three routes for philadelphia he immediately detached light parties to fall upon their rear but they were too far on the way for any but lighthorse to overtake them  here then was another occasion of which the enemies of washington availed themselves to deride his cautious policy yet it was clearly dictated by true wisdom his heart yearned for a general encounter with the enemy in his despatch to the president of congress he writes i sincerely wish that they had made an attack as the issue in all probability from the disposition of our troops and the strong situation of our camp would have been fortunate and happy at the same time i must add that reason prudence and every principle of policy forbade us from quitting our post to attack them nothing but success would have justified the measure and this could not be expected from their position  at this time one of the earliest measures recommended by the board of war and adopted by congress showed the increasing influence of the cabal two inspectorsgeneral were to be appointed for the promotion of discipline and reformation of abuses in the army and one of the persons chosen for this important office was conway with the rank too of majorgeneral this was tacitly in defiance of the opinion so fully expressed by washington of the demerits of the man and the ruinous effects to be apprehended from his promotion over the heads of brigadiers of superior claims conway however was the secret colleague of gates and gates was now the rising sun  winter had now set in with all its severity the troops worn down by long and hard service had need of repose poorly clad also and almost destitute of blankets they required a warmer shelter than mere tents against the inclemencies of the season the nearest towns which would afford winterquarters were lancaster york and carlisle but should the army retire to either of these a large and fertile district would be exposed to be foraged by the foe and its inhabitants perhaps to be dragooned into submission the plan adopted by washington after holding a council of war and weighing the discordant opinions of his officers was to hut the army for the winter at valley forge in chester county on the west side of the schuylkill about twenty miles from philadelphia here he would be able to keep a vigilant eye on that city and at the same time protect a great extent of country  sad and dreary was the march to valley forge uncheered by the recollection of any recent triumph as was the march to winterquarters in the preceding year hungry and cold were the poor fellows who had so long been keeping the field for provisions were scant clothing worn out and so badly off were they for shoes that the footsteps of many might be tracked in blood yet at this very time we are told hogsheads of shoes stockings and clothing were lying at different places on the roads and in the woods perishing for want of teams or of money to pay the teamsters  such were the consequences of the derangement of the commissariat washington wrote to the president of congress on the subject i do not know from what cause this alarming deficiency or rather total failure of supplies arises but unless more vigorous exertions and better regulations take place in that line the commissaries department immediately the army must dissolve i have done all in my power by remonstrating by writing by ordering the commissaries on this head from time to time but without any good effect or obtaining more than a present scanty relief  scarce had washington despatched this letter when he learnt that the legislature of pennsylvania had addressed a remonstrance to congress against his going into winterquarters instead of keeping in the open field this letter received in his forlorn situation surrounded by an unhoused scantily clad halfstarved army shivering in the midst of decembers snow and cold put an end to his forbearance and drew from him another letter to the president of congress dated on the 23d which we shall largely quote not only for its manly and truthful eloquence but for the exposition it gives of the difficulties of his situation mainly caused by unwise and intermeddling legislation  and first as to the commissariat  though i have been tender heretofore writes he of giving any opinion or lodging complaints as the change in that department took place contrary to my judgment and the consequences thereof were predicted yet finding that the inactivity of the army whether for want of provisions clothes or other essentials is charged to my account not only by the common vulgar but by those in power it is time to speak plain in exculpation of myself with truth then i can declare that no man in my opinion ever had his measures more impeded than i have by every department of the army since the month of july we have had no assistance from the quartermastergeneral and to want of assistance from this department the commissarygeneral charges great part of his deficiency as a proof of the little benefit received from a clothiergeneral and as a further proof of the inability of an army under the circumstances of this to perform the common duties of soldiers besides a number of men confined to hospitals for want of shoes and others in farmers houses on the same account we have by a field return this day made no less than two thousand eight hundred and ninetyeight men now in camp unfit for duty because they are barefoot and otherwise naked by the same return it appears that our whole strength in continental troops including the eastern brigades which have joined us since the surrender of general burgoyne exclusive of the maryland troops sent to wilmington amounts to no more than eight thousand two hundred in camp fit for duty notwithstanding which and that since the 4th instant our numbers fit for duty from the hardships and exposures they have undergone particularly on account of blankets have decreased near two thousand men  we find gentlemen without knowing whether the army was really going into winterquarters or not for i am sure no resolution of mine could warrant the remonstrance reprobating the measure as much as if they thought the soldiers were made of stocks or stones and equally insensible of frost and snow and moreover as if they conceived it easily practicable for an inferior army under the disadvantages i have described ours to bewhich are by no means exaggeratedto confine a superior one in all respects well appointed and provided for a winters campaign within the city of philadelphia and to cover from depredation and waste the states of pennsylvania and jersey i can assure those gentlemen that it is a much easier and less distressing thing to draw remonstrances in a comfortable room by a good fireside than to occupy a cold bleak hill and sleep under frost and snow without clothes or blankets however although they seem to have little feeling for the naked and distressed soldiers i feel abundantly for them and from my soul i pity those miseries which it is neither in my power to relieve nor prevent  in the present exigency to save his camp from desolation and to relieve his starving soldiery he was compelled to exercise the authority recently given him by congress to forage the country round seize supplies wherever he could find them and pay for them in money or in certificates redeemable by congress he exercised these powers with great reluctance he was apprehensive of irritating the jealousy of military sway prevalent throughout the country and of corrupting the morals of the army  we here close washingtons operations for 1777 one of the most arduous and eventful years of his military life and one of the most trying to his character and fortunes he began it with an empty army chest and a force dwindled down to four thousand halfdisciplined men throughout the year he had had to contend not merely with the enemy but with the parsimony and meddlesome interference of congress in his most critical times that body had left him without funds and without reinforcements it had made promotions contrary to his advice and contrary to military usage thereby wronging and disgusting some of his bravest officers it had changed the commissariat in the very midst of a campaign and thereby thrown the whole service into confusion  among so many crosspurposes and discouragements it was a difficult task for washington to keep the life and soul of the army together yet he had done so marvellous indeed was the manner in which he had soothed the discontents of his aggrieved officers and reconciled them to an illrequiting service and still more marvellous the manner in which he had breathed his own spirit of patience and perseverance in his yeoman soldiery during their sultry marchings and countermarchings through the jerseys under all kinds of privations with no visible object of pursuit to stimulate their ardor hunting as it were the rumored apparitions of an unseen fleet  the same machinations which were so successful in displacing the noblehearted schuyler from the head of the northern department were now at work to undermine the commanderinchief and elevate the putative hero of saratoga on his ruins he was painfully aware of them yet in no part of the war did he more thoroughly evince that magnanimity which was his grand characteristic than in the last scenes of this campaign where he rose above the tauntings of the press the sneerings of the cabal the murmurs of the public the suggestions of some of his friends and the throbbing impulses of his own courageous heart and adhered to that fabian policy which he considered essential to the safety of the cause to dare is often the impulse of selfish ambition or harebrained valor to forbear is at times the proof of real greatness  while censure and detraction had dogged washington throughout his harassing campaign gates was the constant theme of popular eulogium and was held up by the cabal as the only one capable of retrieving the desperate fortunes of the south letters from his friends in congress urged him to hasten on take his seat at the head of the board of war assume the management of military affairs and save the country gates was not a strongminded man is it a wonder then that his brain should be bewildered by the fumes of incense offered up on every side in the midst of his triumph however while feasting on the sweets of adulation came the withering handwriting on the wall it is an epistle from his friend mifflin my dear general writes he an extract from conways letter to you has been procured and sent to headquarters general washington enclosed it to conway without remarks  nothing could surpass the trouble and confusion of mind of gates on the perusal of this letter part of his correspondence with conway had been sent to headquarters but what part what was the purport and extent of the alleged extracts how had they been obtained who had sent them mifflins letter specified nothing and this silence as to particulars left an unbounded field for tormenting conjecture in fact mifflin knew nothing in particular when he wrote nor did any of the cabal the laconic nature of washingtons note to conway had thrown them all in confusion none knew the extent of the correspondence discovered nor how far they might be individually compromised  gates in his perplexity suspected that his portfolio had been stealthily opened and his letters copied but which of themand by whom he wrote to conway and mifflin anxiously inquiring what part of their correspondence had been thus surreptitiously obtained and made rigid inquiries among the gentlemen of his staff all disavowed any knowledge of the matter in this state of mental trepidation gates wrote on the 8th of december a letter to washington in which after speaking of his disagreeable situation in discovering his confidential letters exposed to public inspection he urged washington to give him his aid in tracing the author of the infidelity and asserting that it was in washingtons power to do him and the united states an important service by detecting a wretch who may betray me and capitally injure the very operations under your immediate directions he concluded by announcing his intention of forwarding a copy of his letter to the president that the congress may in concert with your excellency obtain as soon as possible a discovery which so deeply affects the safety of the states  washingtons reply was characterized with his usual dignity and candor after expressing his surprise that a copy of gates letter should have been sent to congress and asserting that he was thereby laid under the necessity of returning his answer through the same body he proceeds to state that colonel wilkinson in the month of october last fell in with major mcwilliams aidedecamp to lord stirling and informed him not in confidence that general conway had written to gates as follows heaven has been determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it washington then adds that this circumstance had not been communicated to any officer in the army except lafayette to whom it was shown under injunctions of secrecy so desirous was he of concealing every matter that could interrupt the tranquillity of the army or afford a gleam of hope to the enemy by dissensions therein he concludes by declaring that he considered the information as coming from gates given with a view to forewarn and forearm him against a dangerous incendiary in which character sooner or later this country will know general conway  gates was disposed to mark his advent to power by a striking operation a notable project had been concerted by him and the board of war for a winter irruption into canada an expedition was to proceed from albany cross lake champlain on the ice burn the british shipping at st johns and press forward to montreal washington was not consulted in the matter the project was submitted to congress and sanctioned by them without his privity one object of the scheme was to detach the marquis de lafayette from washington to whom he was devotedly attached and bring him into the interests of the cabal for this purpose he was to have the command of the expedition an appointment which it was thought would tempt his military ambition conway was to be second in command and it was trusted that his address and superior intelligence would virtually make him the leader  the first notice that washington received of the project was in a letter from gates enclosing one to lafayette informing the latter of his appointment and requiring his attendance at yorktown to receive his instructions gates in his letter to washington asked his opinion and advice evidently as a matter of form the latter expressed himself obliged by the polite request but observed that as he neither knew the extent of the objects in view nor the means to be employed to effect them it was not in his power to pass any judgment upon the subject the cabal overshot their mark lafayette who was aware of their intrigues was so disgusted by the want of deference and respect to the commanderinchief evinced in the whole proceeding that he would at once have declined the appointment had not washington himself advised him strongly to accept it the project was never carried out lafayette still having a favorable opinion of conways military talents was aware of the game he was playing and succeeded in getting de kalb appointed to the expedition whose commission being of older date would give him the precedence of that officer when lafayette arrived at albany it was soon found that the contemplated irruption was not practicable schuyler lincoln and arnold all opposed it instead of twentyfive hundred men which had been promised lafayette not twelve hundred in all were found to be fit for duty and these shrinking from a winter incursion into so cold a country stark who was to have joined the expedition was disinclined enlistments could not be made for want of money or the means of offering other inducements the project in view of the numerous discouragements and difficulties was at length formally suspended by a resolve of congress  washingtons letter of the 4th of january on the subject of the conway correspondence had not reached general gates until the 22d of january after his arrival at yorktown no sooner did gates learn from its context that all washingtons knowledge of that correspondence was confined to a single paragraph of a letter and that merely as quoted in conversation by wilkinson than the whole matter appeared easily to be explained or shuffled off he accordingly took pen in hand and addressed washington as follows on the 22d of january the letter which i had the honor to receive yesterday from your excellency has relieved me from unspeakable uneasiness i now anticipate the pleasure it will give you when you discover that what has been conveyed to you for an extract of general conways letter to me was not an information which friendly motives induced a man of honor to give that injured virtue might be forearmed against secret enemies the paragraph which your excellency has condescended to transcribe is spurious it was certainly fabricated to answer the most selfish and wicked purposes he then goes on to declare that the genuine letter of conway was perfectly harmless containing judicious remarks upon the want of discipline in the army but making no mention of weak generals or bad counsellors  general conway also in a letter to washington dated january 27th informs him that the letter had been returned to him by gates and that he found with great satisfaction that the paragraph so much spoken of did not exist in the said letter nor anything like it he had intended he adds to publish the letter but had been dissuaded by president laurens and two or three members of congress to whom he had shown it lest it should inform the enemy of a misunderstanding among the american generals he therefore depended upon the justice candor and generosity of general washington to put a stop to the forgery  on the 9th of february washington wrote gates a long and searching reply to his letters of the 8th and 23d of january analyzing them and showing how in spirit and import they contradicted each other and how sometimes the same letter contradicted itself how in the first letter the reality of the extracts was by implication allowed and the only solicitude shown was to find out the person who brought them to light while in the second letter the whole was pronounced in word as well as in substance a wicked forgery it is not my intention observes washington to contradict this assertion but only to intimate some considerations which tend to induce a supposition that though none of general conways letters to you contained the offensive passage mentioned there might have been something in them too nearly related to it that could give such an extraordinary alarm if this were not the case how easy in the first instance to have declared there was nothing exceptionable in them and to have produced the letters themselves in support of it1  footnote 1 the conway letter proved a further source of trouble to the cabal wilkinson learning that gates had denounced him as the betrayer of the letter and spoken of him in the grossest language wrote to gates demanding honorable reparation they met however and the explanations of gates appeased wilkinson for the time who now turned to lord stirling as the betrayer of his confidence asserting that he should bleed for his conduct but in this case as in the other wilkinsons irritable honor was easily pacified lord stirling having admitted according to wilkinsons request that the disclosure in question occurred in a private company during a convivial hour subsequently wilkinson was shown by washington gates letter in which the extract from conways letter was pronounced a forgery wilkinson who was secretary of the board of war of which gates was president now resigned his office compelled to it as he said by the acts of treachery and falsehood in which he had detected majorgeneral gates wilkinson as bearer of the news of the capture of burgoyne to congress had been rewarded by promotion to the rank of brigadiergeneral this was protested against by a large number of colonels whereupon wilkinson resigned and withdrew from the army     chapter xlix exploits of lee and lafayettebritish commissioners   during the winters encampment at valley forge washington sedulously applied himself to the formation of a new system for the army at his earnest solicitation congress appointed a committee of five called the committee of arrangement to repair to the camp and assist him in the task1 before their arrival he had collected the written opinions and suggestions of his officers on the subject and from these and his own observations and experience had prepared a document exhibiting the actual state of the army the defects of previous systems and the alterations and reforms that were necessary the committee remained three months with him in camp and then made a report to congress founded on his statement the reforms therein recommended were generally adopted  footnote 1 names of the committeegeneral reed nathaniel folsom francis dana charles carroll and gouverneur morris  in the meantime the distresses of the army continued to increase the surrounding country for a great distance was exhausted and had the appearance of having been pillaged the parties sent out to forage too often returned emptyhanded for some days past there has been little less than a famine in the camp writes washington on one occasion a part of the army has been a week without any kind of flesh and the rest three or four days naked and starving as they are we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery that they have not been ere this excited by their suffering to a general mutiny and desertion  a british historian gives a striking picture of the indolence and luxury which reigned at the same time in the british army in philadelphia it is true the investment of the city by the americans rendered provisions dear and fuel scanty but the consequent privations were felt by the inhabitants not by their invaders the latter revelled as if in a conquered place private houses were occupied without rendering compensation the officers were quartered on the principal inhabitants many of whom were of the society of friends the quiet habits of the city were outraged by the dissolute habits of a camp gaming prevailed to a shameless degree a foreign officer kept a faro bank at which he made a fortune and some of the young officers ruined themselves during the whole of this long winter of riot and dissipation continues the same writer washington was suffered to remain undisturbed at valley forge with an army not exceeding five thousand effective men and his cannon frozen up and immovable a nocturnal attack might have forced him to a disadvantageous action or compelled him to a disastrous retreat  on one occasion there was a flurry at the most advanced post where captain henry lee lighthorse harry with a few of his troops was stationed he had made himself formidable to the enemy by harassing their foraging parties an attempt was made to surprise him a party of about two hundred dragoons taking a circuitous route in the night came upon him by daybreak he had but a few men with him at the time and took post in a large storehouse his scanty force did not allow a soldier for each window the dragoons attempted to force their way into the house there was a warm contest the dragoons were bravely repulsed and sheered off leaving two killed and four wounded  washington whose heart evidently warmed to this young virginian officer not content with noticing his exploit in general orders not long afterwards strongly recommended him for the command of two troops of horse with the rank of major to act as an independent partisan corps his genius observes he particularly adapts him to a command of this nature and it will be the most agreeable to him of any station in which he could be placed it was a high gratification to washington when congress made this appointment accompanying it with encomiums on lee as a brave and prudent officer  in the month of february mrs washington rejoined the general at valley forge and took up her residence at headquarters the arrangements consequent on her arrival bespeak the simplicity of style in this rude encampment the generals apartment is very small writes she to a friend he has had a log cabin built to dine in which has made our quarters much more tolerable than they were at first lady stirling mrs knox the wife of the general and the wives of other of the officers were also in the camp  the reforms in the commissariat had begun to operate provisions arrived in considerable quantities supplies on their way to the philadelphia market to load the british tables were intercepted and diverted into the hungry camp of the patriots magazines were formed in valley forge the threatened famine was averted grimvisaged war gradually relaxed his features and affairs in the encampment began to assume a more cheering aspect  an important arrival in the camp was that of the baron steuben towards the latter part of february he was a seasoned soldier from the old battle fields of europe having served in the seven years war been aidedecamp to the great frederick and connected with the quartermastergenerals department honors had been heaped upon him in germany after leaving the prussian army he had been grand marshal of the court of the prince of hohenzollernhechingen colonel in the circle of suabia lieutenantgeneral under the prince margrave of baden and knight of the order of fidelity and he had declined liberal offers from the king of sardinia and the emperor of austria with an income of about three thousand dollars chiefly arising from various appointments he was living pleasantly in distinguished society at the german courts and making occasional visits to paris when he was persuaded by the count de st germain french minister of war and others of the french cabinet to come out to america and engage in the cause they were preparing to befriend their object was to secure for the american armies the services of an officer of experience and a thorough disciplinarian through their persuasions he resigned his several offices and came out at fortyeight years of age a soldier of fortune to the rude fighting grounds of america to aid a half disciplined people in their struggle for liberty  the baron had brought strong letters from dr franklin and mr deane our envoys at paris and from the count st germain landing in portsmouth in new hampshire dec 1st he had forwarded copies of his letters to washington by washingtons direction he had proceeded direct to congress his letters procured him a distinguished reception from the president a committee was appointed to confer with him he offered his services as a volunteer making no condition for rank or pay but trusting should he prove himself worthy and the cause be crowned with success he would be indemnified for the sacrifices he had made and receive such further compensation as he might be thought to merit  the committee having made their report the barons proffered services were accepted with a vote of thanks for his disinterestedness and he was ordered to join the army at valley forge that army in its ragged condition and squalid quarters presented a sorry aspect to a strict disciplinarian from germany accustomed to the order and appointments of european camps and the baron often declared that under such circumstances no army in europe could be kept together for a single month the liberal mind of steuben however made every allowance and washington soon found in him a consummate soldier free from pedantry or pretension  the evils arising from a want of uniformity in discipline and manoeuvres throughout the army had long caused washington to desire a well organized inspectorship he knew that the same desire was felt by congress conway had been appointed to that office but had never entered upon its duties the baron appeared to be peculiarly well qualified for such a department washington determined therefore to set on foot a temporary institution of the kind accordingly he proposed to the baron to undertake the office of inspectorgeneral the latter cheerfully agreed two ranks of inspectors were appointed under him the lowest to inspect brigades the highest to superintend several of these  in a little while the whole army was under drill for a great part made up of raw militia scarcely knew the manual exercise many of the officers too knew little of manoeuvring and the best of them had much to learn the baron furnished his subinspectors with written instructions relative to their several functions he took a company of soldiers under his immediate training and after he had sufficiently schooled it made it a model for the others exhibiting the manoeuvres they had to practise his discipline extended to their comforts he inquired into their treatment by the officers he examined the doctors reports visited the sick and saw that they were well lodged and attended  the strong good sense of the baron was evinced in the manner in which he adapted his tactics to the nature of the army and the situation of the country instead of adhering with bigotry to the systems of europe his instructions were appreciated by all the officers received them gladly and conformed to them the men soon became active and adroit the army gradually acquired a proper organization and began to operate like a great machine and washington found in the baron an intelligent disinterested truthful coadjutor well worthy of the badge he wore as a knight of the order of fidelity  another great satisfaction to washington was the appointment by congress march 3d of greene to the office of quartermastergeneral still retaining his rank of majorgeneral in the army the confusion and derangement of this department during the late campaign while filled by general mifflin had been a source of perpetual embarrassment that officer however capable of doing his duty was hardly ever at hand the line and the staff were consequently at variance and the country was plundered in a way sufficient to breed a civil war between the staff and the inhabitants greene undertook the office with reluctance and agreed to perform the military duties of it without compensation for the space of a year  the spring opened without any material alteration in the dispositions of the armies washington at one time expected an attack upon his camp but sir william was deficient in the necessary enterprise he contented himself with sending out parties which foraged the surrounding country for many miles and scoured part of the jerseys bringing in considerable supplies these forays were in some instances accompanied by wanton excesses and needless bloodshed a ravaging party ascended the delaware in flatbottomed boats and galleys set fire to public storehouses in bordentown containing provisions and munitions of war burnt two frigates several privateers and a number of vessels of various classes some of them laden with military stores had the armed vessels been sunk according to the earnest advice of washington the greater part of them might have been saved  a circular letter was sent by washington on the 20th to all the general officers in camp requesting their opinions in writing which of three plans to adopt for the next campaign to attempt the recovery of philadelphia to transfer the war to the north and make an attempt on new york or to remain quiet in a secure and fortified camp disciplining and arranging the army until the enemy should begin their operations then to be governed by circumstances  just after the issue of this circular intelligence received from congress showed that the ascendency of the cabal was at an end by a resolution of that body on the 15th gates was directed to resume the command of the northern department and to proceed forthwith to fishkill for that purpose he was invested with powers for completing the works on the hudson2 and authorized to carry on operations against the enemy should any favorable opportunity offer for which purposes he might call for the artificers and militia of new york and the eastern states but he was not to undertake any expedition against new york without previously consulting the commanderinchief washington was requested to assemble a council of majorgenerals to determine upon a plan of operations and gates and mifflin by a subsequent resolution were ordered to attend that council this arrangement putting gates under washingtons order evinced the determination of congress to sustain the latter in his proper authority  footnote 2 the highlands had been carefully reconnoitred in the course of the winter by putnam gov clinton james clinton and several others and west point selected as the most eligible place to be fortified  and here we may note the downfall of the intriguing individual who had given his name to the now extinguished cabal conway after the departure of lafayette and de kalb from albany had remained but a short time in the command there being ordered to join the army under general mcdougall stationed at fishkill thence he was soon ordered back to albany whereupon he wrote an impertinent letter to the president of congress complaining that he was boxed about in a most indecent manner and intimated a wish that the president would make his resignation acceptable to congress to his surprise and consternation his resignation was immediately accepted he instantly wrote to the president declaring that his meaning had been misapprehended and accounting for it by some orthographical or grammatical faults in his letter being an irishman who had learnt his english in france all his efforts to get reinstated were unavailing though he went to yorktown to make them in person3  footnote 3 conway here disappears from this history he became involved in a duel with gen john cadwalader in which he was severely wounded upon his recovery from his wounds he embarked for france  the capture of burgoyne and his army was now operating with powerful effect on the cabinets of both england and france with the former it was coupled with the apprehension that france was about to espouse the american cause the consequence was lord norths conciliatory bills as they were called submitted by him to parliament and passed with but slight opposition one of these bills regulated taxation in the american colonies in a manner which it was trusted would obviate every objection the other authorized the appointment of commissioners clothed with powers to negotiate with the existing governments to proclaim a cessation of hostilities to grant pardons and to adopt other measures of a conciliatory nature  intelligence that a treaty between france and the united states had actually been concluded at paris induced the british minister to hurry off a draft of the bills to america to forestall the effects of the treaty upon the public mind general tryon caused copies of it to be printed in new york and circulated through the country he sent several of them to general washington 15th april with a request that they should be communicated to the officers and privates of his army washington felt the singular impertinence of the request he transmitted them to congress observing that the time to entertain such overtures was past nothing short of independence it appears to me can possibly do a peace on other terms would if i may be allowed the expression be a peace of war the injuries we have received from the british nation were so unprovoked and have been so great and so many that they can never be forgotten these and other objections advanced by him met with the concurrence of congress and it was unanimously resolved that no conference could be held no treaty made with any commissioners on the part of great britain until that power should have withdrawn its fleets and armies or acknowledged in positive and express terms the independence of the united states  on the following day april 23d a resolution was passed recommending to the different states to pardon under such restrictions as might be deemed expedient such of their citizens as having levied war against the united states should return to their allegiance before the 16th of june  the tidings of the capitulation of burgoyne had been equally efficacious in quickening the action of the french cabinet the negotiations which had gone on so slowly as almost to reduce our commissioners to despair were brought to a happy termination and on the 2d of may ten days after the passing by congress of the resolves just cited a messenger arrived express from france with two treaties one of amity and commerce the other of defensive alliance signed in paris on the 6th of february by m girard on the part of france and by benjamin franklin silas deane and arthur lee on the part of the united states this last treaty stipulated that should war ensue between france and england it should be made a common cause by the contracting parties in which neither should make truce or peace with great britain without the consent of the other nor either lay down their arms until the independence of the united states was established  these treaties were unanimously ratified by congress and their promulgation was celebrated by public rejoicings throughout the country the 6th of may was set apart for a military f√™te at the camp at valley forge the army was assembled in best array there was solemn thanksgiving by the chaplains at the head of each brigade after which a grand parade a national discharge of thirteen guns a general feu de joie and shouts of the whole army long live the king of francelong live the friendly european powershuzza for the american states a banquet succeeded at which washington dined in public with all the officers of his army attended by a band of music  on the 8th the council of war ordered by congress was convened at which were present majorgenerals gates greene stirling mifflin lafayette de kalb armstrong and steuben and brigadiergenerals knox and duportail after the state of the forces british and american their number and distribution had been laid before the council by the commanderinchief and a full discussion had been held it was unanimously determined to remain on the defensive and not attempt any offensive operation until some opportunity should occur to strike a successful blow  the military career of sir william howe in the united states was now drawing to a close his conduct of the war had given much dissatisfaction in england his enemies observed that everything gained by the troops was lost by the general that he had suffered an enemy with less than four thousand men to reconquer a province which he had recently reduced and lay a kind of siege to his army in their winter quarters and that he had brought a sad reverse upon the british arms by failing to cooperate vigorously and efficiently with burgoyne sir william on his part had considered himself slighted by the ministry his suggestions he said were disregarded and the reinforcements withheld which he considered indispensable for the successful conduct of the war he had therefore tendered his resignation which had been promptly accepted and sir henry clinton ordered to relieve him clinton arrived in philadelphia on the 8th of may and took command of the army on the 11th  soon after he had taken the command there were symptoms of an intention to evacuate philadelphia whither the enemy would thence direct their course was a matter of mere conjecture lafayette was therefore detached by washington with twentyone hundred chosen men and five pieces of cannon to take a position nearer the city where he might be at hand to gain information watch the movements of the enemy check their predatory excursions and fall on their rear when in the act of withdrawing  the marquis crossed the schuylkill on the 18th of may and proceeded to barren hill about half way between washingtons camp and philadelphia and about eleven miles from both here he planted his cannon facing the south with rocky ridges bordering the schuylkill on his right woods and stone houses on his left behind him the roads forked one branch leading to matsons ford of the schuylkill the other by swedes ford to valley forge in advance of his left wing was mclanes company and about fifty indians pickets and videttes were placed in the woods to the south through which the roads led to philadelphia and a body of six hundred pennsylvania militia were stationed to keep watch on the roads leading to white marsh  in the meantime sir henry clinton having received intelligence through his spies of this movement of lafayette concerted a plan to entrap the young french nobleman five thousand men were sent out at night under general grant to make a circuitous march by white marsh and get in the rear of the americans another force under general grey was to cross to the west side of the schuylkill and take post below barren hill while sir henry in person was to lead a third division along the philadelphia road  the plan came near being completely successful through the remissness of the pennsylvania militia who had left their post of observation early in the morning word was brought that red coats had been descried in the woods near white marsh lafayette was expecting a troop of american dragoons in that quarter who wore scarlet uniforms and supposed these to be them to be certain however he sent out an officer to reconnoitre the latter soon came spurring back at full speed a column of the enemy had pushed forward on the road from white marsh were within a mile of the camp and had possession of the road leading to valley forge another column was advancing on the philadelphia road in fact the young french general was on the point of being surrounded by a greatly superior force lafayette saw his danger but maintained his presence of mind throwing out small parties of troops to show themselves at various points of the intervening wood as if an attack on grant was meditated he brought that general to a halt to prepare for action while he with his main body pushed forward for matsons ford on the schuylkill  the alarmguns at sunrise had apprised washington that the detachment under lafayette was in danger the troops at valley forge were instantly under arms washington with his aidesdecamp and some of his general officers galloped to the summit of a hill and anxiously reconnoitred the scene of action with a glass his solicitude for the marquis was soon relieved the stratagem of the youthful warrior had been crowned with success he completely gained the march upon general grant reached matsons ford in safety crossed it in great order and took a strong position on high grounds which commanded it the enemy arrived at the river just in time for a skirmish as the artillery was crossing seeing that lafayette had extricated himself from their hands and was so strongly posted they gave over all attack and returned somewhat disconcerted to philadelphia while the youthful marquis rejoined the army at valley forge where he was received with acclamations  the exchange of general lee for general prescott so long delayed by various impediments had recently been effected and lee was reinstated in his position of second in command colonel ethan allen also had been released from his long captivity in exchange for colonel campbell allen paid a visit to the camp at valley forge where he had much to tell of his various vicissitudes and hardships in a few days a brevet commission of colonel arrived for him but he had already left camp for his home in vermont where he appears to have hung up his sword for we meet with no further achievements by him on record  indications continued to increase of the departure of troops from philadelphia new york it was concluded would be the place of destination either as a rendezvous or a post whence to attempt the occupation of the hudson would they proceed thither by land or water supposing the former washington would gladly have taken post in jersey to oppose or harass them on their march through that state his camp however was encumbered by upwards of three thousand sick and covered a great amount of military stores he dared not weaken it by detaching a sufficient force especially as it was said the enemy intended to attack him before their departure for three weeks affairs remained in this state washington held his army ready to march toward the hudson at a moments warning and sent general maxwell with a brigade of jersey troops to cooperate with majorgeneral dickinson and the militia of that state in breaking down the bridges and harassing the enemy should they actually attempt to march through it  in the meantime the commissioners empowered under the new conciliatory bills to negotiate the restoration of peace between great britain and her former colonies arrived in the delaware in the trident shipofwar these were frederick howard earl of carlisle william eden afterwards lord auckland brother of the last colonial governor of maryland and george johnstone commonly known as governor johnstone having held that office in florida the commissioners landed at philadelphia on the 6th of june and discovered to their astonishment that they had come out as it were in the dark on a mission in which but a half confidence had been reposed in them by government three weeks before their departure from england orders had been sent out to sir henry clinton to evacuate philadelphia and concentrate his forces at new york yet these orders were never imparted to them their letters and speeches testify their surprise and indignation at finding their plan of operations so completely disconcerted by their own cabinet  the orders for evacuation however were too peremptory to be evaded but johnstone declared that if he had known of them he never would have gone on the mission the commissioners had prepared a letter for congress merely informing that body of their arrival and powers and their disposition to promote a reconciliation intending quietly to await an answer but the unexpected situation of affairs occasioned by the order for evacuation obliged them to alter their resolution and to write one of a different character bringing forward at once all the powers delegated to them on the 9th of june sir henry clinton informed washington of the arrival of the commissioners and requested a passport for their secretary dr ferguson the historian to proceed to yorktown bearing a letter to congress washington sent to congress a copy of sir henrys letter but did not consider himself at liberty to grant the passport until authorized by them  without waiting the result the commissioners forwarded by the ordinary military post their letter accompanied by the conciliatory acts and other documents they were received by congress on the 13th the reading of the letter was interrupted and it came near being indignantly rejected on account of expressions disrespectful to france charging it with being the insidious enemy of both england and her colonies and interposing its pretended friendship to the latter only to prevent reconciliation and prolong this destructive war in their reply signed by the president june 17th they observed that nothing but an earnest desire to spare further effusion of blood could have induced them to read a paper containing expressions so disrespectful to his most christian majesty or to consider propositions so derogatory to the honor of an independent nation and in conclusion they expressed a readiness to treat as soon as the king of great britain should demonstrate a sincere disposition for peace either by an explicit acknowledgment of the independence of the states or by the withdrawal of his fleets and armies  we will not follow the commissioners through their various attempts overtly and covertly to forward the object of their mission we cannot however pass unnoticed an intimation conveyed from governor johnstone to general joseph reed at this time an influential member of congress that effectual services on his part to restore the union of the two countries might be rewarded by ten thousand pounds sterling and any office in the colonies in his majestys gift to this reed made his brief and memorable reply i am not worth purchasing but such as i am the king of great britain is not rich enough to do it  the commissioners disappointed in their hopes of influencing congress attempted to operate on the feelings of the public at one time by conciliatory appeals at another by threats and denunciations their last measure was to publish a manifesto recapitulating their official proceedings stating the refusal of congress to treat with them and offering to treat within forty days with deputies from all or any of the colonies or provincial assemblies holding forth at the same time the usual offers of conditional amnesty this measure like all which had preceded it proved ineffectual the commissioners embarked for england and so terminated this tardy and blundering attempt of the british government and its agents to effect a reconciliationthe last attempt that was made     chapter l evacuation of philadelphiabattle of monmouth court house   the delay of the british to evacuate philadelphia tasked the sagacity of washington but he supposed it to have been caused by the arrival of the commissioners from great britain the force in the city in the meantime had been much reduced five thousand men had been detached to aid in a sudden descent on the french possessions in the west indies three thousand more to florida most of the cavalry with other troops had been shipped with the provision train and heavy baggage to new york the effective force remaining with sir henry was now about nine or ten thousand men that under washington was a little more than twelve thousand continentals and about thirteen hundred militia it had already acquired considerable proficiency in tactics and field manoeuvring under the diligent instructions of steuben  early in june it was evident that a total evacuation of the city was on the point of taking place and circumstances convinced washington that the march of the main body would be through the jerseys some of his officers thought differently especially general lee who had now the command of a division composed of poor varnum and huntingtons brigades in consequence washington called a general council of war on the 17th to consider what measures to adopt whether to undertake any enterprise against the enemy in their present circumstanceswhether the army should remain in its actual position until the final evacuation had taken place or move immediately toward the delawarewhether should the enemy march through the jerseys it would be advisable to attack them while on the way or to push on directly to the hudson and secure that important communication between the eastern and southern states in case an attack while on the march were determined on should it be a partial or a general one  lee was opposed to an attack of any kind he would make a bridge of gold for the enemy they were nearly equal in number to the americans and far superior in discipline an attack would endanger the safety of the cause he advised merely to follow the enemy observe their motions and prevent them from committing any excesses lees opinions had still great weight with the army most of the officers both foreign and american concurred with him greene lafayette wayne and cadwalader thought differently they could not brook that the enemy should evacuate the city and make a long march through the country unmolested washington seeing such want of unanimity among his generals requested their opinions in writing before these were given in word was brought that the enemy had actually evacuated the city  sir henry had taken his measures with great secrecy and despatch the army commenced moving at three oclock on the morning of the 18th retiring to a point of land below the town formed by the confluence of the delaware and schuylkill and crossing the former river in boats by ten oclock in the morning the rearguard landed on the jersey shore  on the first intelligence of this movement washington detached general maxwell with his brigade to cooperate with general dickinson and the new jersey militia in harassing the enemy on their march he sent general arnold also with a force to take command of philadelphia that officer being not yet sufficiently recovered from his wound for field service then breaking up his camp at valley forge he pushed forward with his main force in pursuit of the enemy as the route of the latter lay along the eastern bank of the delaware as high as trenton washington was obliged to make a considerable circuit so as to cross the river higher up at coryells ferry near the place where eighteen months previously he had crossed to attack the hessians  heavy rains and sultry summer heat retarded his movements but the army crossed on the 24th the british were now at moorestown and mount holly thence they might take the road on the left for brunswick and so on to staten island and new york or the road to the right through monmouth by the heights of middletown to sandy hook uncertain which they might adopt washington detached colonel morgan with six hundred picked men to reinforce maxwell and hang on their rear while he himself pushed forward with the main body toward princeton cautiously keeping along the mountainous country to the left of the most northern road  the march of sir henry was very slow from his dilatory movements washington suspected sir henry of a design to draw him down into the level country and then by a rapid movement on his right to gain possession of the strong ground above him and bring him to a general action on disadvantageous terms he himself was inclined for a general action whenever it could be made on suitable ground he halted therefore at hopewell about five miles from princeton and held another council of war the result of it writes his aidedecamp colonel hamilton would have done honor to the most honorable society of midwives and to them only the purport was to keep at a distance from the enemy and annoy them by detachments lee according to hamilton was the prime mover of this plan in pursuance of which a detachment of fifteen hundred men was sent off under brigadiergeneral scott to join the other troops near the enemys line  generals greene wayne and lafayette were in the minority in the council and subsequently gave separately the same opinion in writing that the rear of the enemy should be attacked by a strong detachment while the main army should be so disposed as to give a general battle should circumstances render it advisable as this opinion coincided with his own washington determined to act upon it sir henry clinton in the meantime had advanced to allentown on his way to brunswick to embark on the raritan finding the passage of that river likely to be strongly disputed by the forces under washington and others advancing from the north under gates he changed his plan and turned to the right by a road leading through freehold to navesink and sandy hook to embark at the latter place  washington no longer in doubt as to the route of the enemys march detached wayne with one thousand men to join the advanced corps which thus augmented was upwards of four thousand strong the command of the advance properly belonged to lee as senior majorgeneral but it was eagerly solicited by lafayette as an attack by it was intended and lee was strenuously opposed to everything of the kind washington willingly gave his consent provided general lee were satisfied with the arrangement the latter ceded the command without hesitation scarce however had he relinquished the command when he changed his mind in a note to washington he declared that in assenting to the arrangement he had considered the command of the detachment one more fitting a young volunteering general than a veteran like himself second in command in the army he now viewed it in a different light lafayette would be at the head of all the continental parties already in the line six thousand men at least a command next to that of the commanderinchief should the detachment march therefore he entreated to have the command of it  washington was perplexed how to satisfy lees punctilious claims without wounding the feelings of lafayette a change in the disposition of the enemys line of march furnished an expedient sir henry clinton finding himself harassed by light troops on the flanks and in danger of an attack in the rear placed all his baggage in front under the convoy of knyphausen while he threw the main strength of his army in the rear under lord cornwallis this made it necessary for washington to strengthen his advanced corps and he took this occasion to detach lee with scotts and varnums brigades to support the force under lafayette as lee was the senior majorgeneral this gave him the command of the whole advance washington explained the matter in a letter to the marquis who resigned the command to lee when the latter joined him on the 27th that evening the enemy encamped on high ground near monmouth court house lee encamped with the advance at englishtown about five miles distant the main body was three miles in his rear  about sunset washington rode forward to the advance and anxiously reconnoitred sir henrys position it was protected by woods and morasses and too strong to be attacked with a prospect of success should the enemy however proceed ten or twelve miles further unmolested they would gain the heights of middletown and be on ground still more difficult to prevent this he resolved that an attack should be made on their rear early in the morning as soon as their front should be in motion this plan he communicated to general lee in presence of his officers ordering him to make dispositions for the attack keeping his troops lying on their arms ready for action on the shortest notice a disposition he intended to observe with his own troops this done he rode back to the main body  early in the morning washington received an express informing him that the enemy were in motion he instantly sent orders to lee to push forward and attack them unless there should be powerful reasons to the contrary adding that he was coming on to support him for that purpose he immediately set forward with his own troops ordering them to throw by their knapsacks and blankets  knyphausen with the british vanguard had begun about daybreak to descend into the valley between monmouth court house and middletown to give the long train of wagons and pack horses time to get well on the way sir henry clinton with his choice troops remained in camp on the heights of freehold until eight oclock when he likewise resumed the line of march toward middletown  in the meantime lee had advanced with the brigades of wayne and maxwell to support the light troops engaged in skirmishing the difficulty of reconnoitring a country cut up by woods and morasses and the perplexity occasioned by contradictory reports embarrassed his movements being joined by lafayette with the main body of the advance he had now about four thousand men at his command independent of those under morgan and general dickinson arriving on the heights of freehold and riding forward with general wayne to an open place to reconnoitre lee caught sight of a force under march but partly hidden from view by intervening woods supposing it to be a mere covering party of about two thousand men he detached wayne with seven hundred men and two pieces of artillery to skirmish in its rear and hold it in check while he with the rest of his force taking a shorter road through the woods would get in front of it and cut it off from the main body he at the same time sent a message to washington apprising him of this movement and of his certainty of success  washington in the meantime was on his march with the main body to support the advance as he had promised the booming of cannon at a distance indicated that the attack so much desired had commenced and caused him to quicken his march arrived near freehold church where the road forked he detached greene with part of his forces to the right to flank the enemy in the rear of monmouth court house while he with the rest of the column would press forward by the other road  washington had alighted while giving these directions and was standing with his arm thrown over his horse when a countryman rode up and said the continental troops were retreating washington was provoked at what he considered a false alarm the man pointed as his authority to an american fifer who just then came up in breathless affright the fifer was ordered into custody to prevent his spreading an alarm among the troops who were advancing and was threatened with a flogging should he repeat the story springing on his horse washington had moved forward but a short distance when he met other fugitives one in the garb of a soldier who all concurred in the report he now sent forward colonels fitzgerald and harrison to learn the truth while he himself spurred past freehold meeting house between that edifice and the morass beyond it he met graysons and pattons regiments in most disorderly retreat jaded with heat and fatigue riding up to the officer at their head washington demanded whether the whole advanced corps were retreating the officer believed they were  it seemed incredible there had been scarce any firingwashington had received no notice of the retreat from lee he was still almost inclined to doubt when the heads of several columns of the advance began to appear it was too evidentthe whole advance was falling back on the main body and no notice had been given to him one of the first officers that came up was colonel shreve at the head of his regiment washington greatly surprised and alarmed asked the meaning of this retreat the colonel smiled significantlyhe did not knowhe had retreated by order there had been no fighting excepting a slight skirmish with the enemys cavalry which had been repulsed  a suspicion flashed across washingtons mind of wrongheaded conduct on the part of lee to mar the plan of attack adopted contrary to his counsels ordering colonel shreve to march his men over the morass halt them on the hill beyond and refresh them he galloped forward to stop the retreat of the rest of the advance his indignation kindling as he rode at the rear of the regiment he met major howard he too could give no reason for the retreat but seemed provoked at itdeclaring that he had never seen the like another officer exclaimed with an oath that they were flying from a shadow arriving at a rising ground washington beheld lee approaching with the residue of his command in full retreat by this time he was thoroughly exasperated  what is the meaning of all this sir demanded he in the sternest and even fiercest tone as lee rode up to him lee for a moment was disconcerted and hesitated in making a reply for washingtons aspect according to lafayette was terrible i desire to know the meaning of this disorder and confusion was again demanded still more vehemently  lee stung by the manner more than the words of the demand made an angry reply and provoked still sharper expressions which have been variously reported i am very sorry said washington that you undertook the command unless you meant to fight the enemy i did not think it prudent to bring on a general engagement whatever your opinion may have been replied washington disdainfully i expected my orders would have been obeyed this all passed rapidly and as it were in flashes for there was no time for parley the enemy were within a quarter of an hours march washingtons appearance had stopped the retreat the fortunes of the day were to be retrieved if possible by instant arrangements these he proceeded to make with great celerity the place was favorable for a stand it was a rising ground to which the enemy could approach only over a narrow causeway the rallied troops were hastily formed upon this eminence colonels stewart and ramsey with two batteries were stationed in a covert of woods on their left to protect them and keep the enemy at bay colonel oswald was posted for the same purpose on a height with two fieldpieces the promptness with which everything was done showed the effects of the baron steubens discipline  washington having made all his arrangements with great dispatch but admirable clearness and precision rode back to lee in calmer mood and inquired will you retain the command on this height or not if you will i will return to the main body and have it formed on the next height it is equal to me where i command replied lee i expect you will take proper means for checking the enemy rejoined washington your orders shall be obeyed and i shall not be the first to leave the ground was the reply  a warm cannonade by oswald stewart and ramsey had the desired effect the enemy were brought to a stand and washington had time to gallop back and bring on the main body this he formed on an eminence with a wood in the rear and the morass in front the left wing was commanded by lord stirling who had with him a detachment of artillery and several fieldpieces general greene was on his right  lee had maintained his advanced position with great spirit but was at length obliged to retire he brought off his troops in good order across a causeway which traversed the morass in front of lord stirling having formed his men in a line beyond the morass he rode up to washington here sir are my troops said he how is it your pleasure i should dispose of them washington saw that the poor fellows were exhausted by marching countermarching hard fighting and the intolerable heat of the weather he ordered lee therefore to repair with them to the rear of englishtown and assemble there all the scattered fugitives he might meet with  the batteries under the direction of lord stirling opened a brisk and wellsustained fire upon the enemy who finding themselves warmly opposed in front attempted to turn the left flank of the americans but were driven back by detached parties of infantry stationed there they then attempted the right but here were met by general greene who had planted his artillery under knox on a commanding ground and not only checked them but enfiladed those who were in front of the left wing wayne too with an advanced party posted in an orchard and partly sheltered by a barn kept up a severe and welldirected fire upon the enemys centre repeated attempts were made to dislodge him but in vain colonel monckton now undertook to drive wayne from his post at the point of the bayonet having made a brief harangue to his men he led them on in column waynes men reserved their fire until colonel monckton waving his sword called out to his grenadiers to charge at that instant a sheeted volley laid him low and made great slaughter in his column which was again repulsed  the enemy at length gave way and fell back to the ground which lee had occupied in the morning here their flanks were secured by woods and morasses and their front could only be approached across a narrow causeway notwithstanding the difficulties of the position washington prepared to attack it ordering general poor with his own and the carolina brigade to move round upon their right and general woodford on their left while the artillery should gall them in front before these orders could be carried into effect the day was at an end many of the soldiers had sunk upon the ground overcome by fatigue and the heat of the weather all needed repose the troops therefore which had been in the advance were ordered to lie on their arms on the ground they occupied so as to be ready to make the attack by daybreak the main army did the same on the field of action to be at hand to support them washington lay on his cloak at the foot of a tree with lafayette beside him talking over the strange conduct of lee whose disorderly retreat had come so near being fatal to the army  it was indeed a matter of general perplexity to which the wayward character of lee greatly contributed some who recollected his previous opposition to all plan of attack almost suspected him of wilfully aiming to procure a defeat it would appear however that he had been really surprised and thrown into confusion by a move of sir henry clinton who seeing the force under lee descending on his rear from freehold heights had suddenly turned upon it aided by troops from knyphausens division to oblige it to call to its assistance the flanking parties under morgan and dickinson which were threatening his baggage train so that lee instead of a mere covering party which he had expected to cut off had found himself front to front with the whole rear division of the british army and that too on unfavorable ground with a deep ravine and a morass in his rear  at daybreak the drums beat the reveill√© the troops roused themselves from their heavy sleep and prepared for action to their surprise the enemy had disappeared there was a deserted camp in which were found four officers and about forty privates too severely wounded to be conveyed away by the retreating army sir henry clinton it appeared had allowed his wearied troops but short repose on the preceding night at ten oclock when the american forces were buried in their first sleep he had set forward to join the division under knyphausen which with the baggage train having pushed on during the action was far on the road to middletown so silent had been his retreat that it was unheard by general poors advance party which lay near by  the distance to which the enemy must by this time have attained the extreme heat of the weather and the fatigued condition of the troops deterred washington from continuing a pursuit through a country where the roads were deep and sandy and there was great scarcity of water besides persons well acquainted with the country assured him that it would be impossible to annoy the enemy in their embarkation as he must approach the place by a narrow passage capable of being defended by a few men against his whole force detaching general maxwells brigade and morgans rifle corps therefore to hang on the rear of the enemy prevent depredation and encourage desertions he determined to shape his course with his main body by brunswick toward the hudson lest sir henry should have any design upon the posts there  the american loss in the recent battle was eight officers and sixtyone privates killed and about one hundred and sixty wounded the officers who had charge of the burying parties reported that they found two hundred and fortyfive noncommissioned officers and privates and four officers left dead by the enemy on the field of battle  after giving his troops a days repose washington decamped on the 30th his march lay through a country destitute of water with deep sandy roads wearying to the feet and reflecting the intolerable heat and glare of a july sun many of the troops harassed by previous fatigue gave out by the way some few died and a number of horses were likewise lost washington ever considerate of the health and comfort of his men encamped near brunswick on open airy grounds and gave them time to repose while lieutenantcolonel aaron burr at that time a young and enterprising officer was sent on a reconnoitring expedition to learn the movements and intentions of the enemy  sir henry clinton with the royal army had arrived at the highlands of navesink in the neighborhood of sandy hook on the 30th of june he had lost many men by desertion hessians especially during his march through the jerseys which with his losses by killed wounded and captured had diminished his army more than two thousand men the storms of the preceding winter had cut off the peninsula of sandy hook from the mainland and formed a deep channel between them fortunately the squadron of lord howe had arrived the day before and was at anchor within the hook a bridge was immediately made across the channel with the boats of the ships over which the army passed to the hook on the 5th of july and thence was distributed  having brought the army to a halt we have time to notice a correspondence between general lee and washington immediately subsequent to the affair of monmouth the pride of the general had been deeply wounded by the rebuke he had received on the field of battle on the following day june 29th he addressed a note to washington on the subject by mistake it was dated july 1st from the knowledge i have of your excellencys character writes he i must conclude that nothing but the misinformation of some very stupid or misrepresentation of some very wicked person could have occasioned your making use of so very singular expressions as you did on my coming up to the ground where you had taken post they implied that i was guilty either of disobedience of orders want of conduct or want of courage your excellency will therefore infinitely oblige me by letting me know on which of these three articles you ground your charge  washington in reply wrote i received your letter dated through mistake the 1st of july expressed as i conceive in terms highly improper i am not conscious of making use of any very singular expressions at the time of meeting you as you intimate what i recollect to have said was dictated by duty and warranted by the occasion as soon as circumstances will permit you shall have an opportunity of justifying yourself to the army to congress to america and to the world in general  to this lee rejoined in a note misdated 28th june sir you cannot afford me greater pleasure than in giving me the opportunity of showing to america the sufficiency of her respective servants i trust that temporary power of office and the tinsel dignity attending it will not be able by all the mists they can raise to obfuscate the bright rays of truth in the meantime your excellency can have no objection to my retiring from the army etc shortly after despatching this note lee addressed another to washington i have reflected on both your situation and mine writes he and beg leave to observe that it will be for our mutual convenience that a court of inquiry should be immediately ordered i must entreat therefore from your love of justice that you will immediately exhibit your charge and that on the first halt i may be brought to a trial  washington in reply acknowledged the receipt of the two last notes and added i have sent colonel scammel and the adjutantgeneral to put you under arrest who will deliver you a copy of the charges on which you will be tried  a courtmartial was accordingly formed on the 4th of july at brunswick the first halting place it was composed of one majorgeneral four brigadiers and eight colonels with lord stirling as president it moved with the army and convened subsequently at paramus peekskill and northcastle the trial lasting until the 12th of august the result of the prolonged and tedious investigation was that he was found guilty of all the charges exhibited against him 1st disobedience of orders 2d misbehavior before the enemy by making an unnecessary and disorderly retreat 3d disrespect to the commanderinchief in letters dated july 1st and june 28th he was sentenced to be suspended from all command for one year the sentence to be approved or set aside by congress  we must anticipate dates to dispose briefly of the career of general lee who is not connected with subsequent events of the revolution congress were more than three months in coming to a decision on the proceedings of the courtmartial at length on the 5th of december the sentence was approved in a very thin session of congress fifteen members voting in the affirmative and seven in the negative from that time lee was unmeasured in his abuse of washington and his reprobation of the courtmartial which he termed a court of inquisition his aggressive tongue at length involved him in a quarrel with colonel laurens one of washingtons aides a highspirited young gentleman who felt himself bound to vindicate the honor of his chief a duel took place and lee was wounded in the side towards spring he retired to his estate in berkley county in virginia where he led a kind of hermit life dogs and horses were his favorite companions his house is described as being a mere shell destitute of comforts and conveniences for want of partitions the different parts were designated by lines chalked on the floor in one corner was his bed in another were his books his saddles and harness in a third a fourth served as a kitchen  the term of his suspension had expired when a rumor reached him that congress intended to take away his commission the intelligence ruffled his temper beyond all bounds in his hurry and heat without attempting to ascertain the truth of the report he scrawled the following note to the president of congress sir i understand that it is in contemplation of congress on the principle of economy to strike me out of their service congress must know very little of me if they suppose that i would accept of their money since the confirmation of the wicked and infamous sentence which was passed upon me i am sir etc this insolent note occasioned his prompt dismissal from the service  though bitter in his enmities lee had his friendships and was warm and constant in them as far as his capricious humors would allow there was nothing crafty or mean in his character nor do we think he ever engaged in the low intrigues of the cabal but he was a disappointed and embittered man and the gall of bitterness overflowed his generous qualities in such a discordant state of feeling he was not a man for the sweet solitude of the country he became weary of his virginia estate though in one of the most fertile regions of the shenandoah valley his farm was mismanaged his agents were unfaithful he entered into negotiations to dispose of his property in the course of which he visited philadelphia on arriving there he was taken with chills followed by a fever which went on increasing in violence and terminated fatally a soldier even unto the end warlike scenes mingled with the delirium of his malady in his dying moments he fancied himself on the field of battle the last words he was heard to utter were stand by me my brave grenadiers     chapter li arrival of a french fleetmassacre at wyoming valleycapture of savannah   while encamped at paramus washington in the night of the 13th of july received a letter from congress informing him of the arrival of a french fleet on the coast instructing him to concert measures with the commander the count destaing for offensive operations by sea and land and empowering him to call on the states from new hampshire to new jersey inclusive to aid with their militia the fleet in question was composed of twelve ships of the line and six frigates with a land force of four thousand men on board of it came mons gerard minister from france to the united states and the hon silas deane one of the american ministers who had effected the late treaty of alliance the fleet had sailed from toulon on the 13th of april after struggling against adverse winds for eightyseven or eightyeight days it had made its appearance off the northern extremity of the virginia coast and anchored at the mouth of the delaware on the 8th of july  finding the enemy had evacuated both city and river the count sent up the french minister and mr deane to philadelphia in a frigate and then putting to sea continued along the coast a little earlier and he might have intercepted the squadron of lord howe on its way to new york it had had but a very few days the advantage of him and when he arrived with his fleet in the road outside of sandy hook he descried the british ships quietly anchored inside of it  a frank and cordial correspondence took place forthwith between the count and washington and a plan of action was concerted between them by the intervention of confidential officers washingtons aidesdecamp laurens and hamilton boarding the fleet while off the hook and major chouin a french officer of merit repairing to the american headquarters  the first idea of the count was to enter at sandy hook and capture or destroy the british fleet composed of six ships of the line four fiftygun ships and a number of frigates and smaller vessels should he succeed in this which his greatly superior force rendered probable he was to proceed against the city with the cooperation of the american forces to be at hand for such purpose washington crossed the hudson with his army at kings ferry and encamped at white plains about the 20th of july several experienced american pilots and masters of vessels however who had accompanied colonels laurens and hamilton on board of the fleet declared that there was not sufficient depth of water on the bar to admit the safe passage of the largest ships one of which carried 80 and another 90 guns the attempt therefore was reluctantly abandoned and the ships anchored about four miles off near shrewsbury on the jersey coast taking in provisions and water  the enterprise which the american and french commanders deemed next worthy of a combined operation was the recapture of rhode island proper that is to say the island which gives its name to the state and which the enemy had made one of their military depots and strongholds in anticipation of such an enterprise washington on the 17th of july wrote to general sullivan who commanded at providence ordering him to make the necessary preparations for a descent from the mainland upon the island and authorizing him to call in reinforcements of new england militia he subsequently sent to his aid the marquis lafayette with two brigades varnums and glovers quartermastergeneral greene also was detached for the service being a native of the island well acquainted with its localities and having great influence among its inhabitants sullivan was instructed to form his whole force continental state and militia into two equal divisions one to be commanded by greene the other by lafayette  on the 22d of july the french fleet having finished taking in its supplies stood away to the eastward and on the 29th arrived off point judith coming to anchor within five miles of newport  rhode island proper the object of this expedition is about sixteen miles long running deep into the great narraganset bay seaconnet channel separates it on the east from the mainland and on the west the main channel passes between it and conanicut island the town of newport is situated near the south end of the island facing the west with conanicut island in front of it it was protected by batteries and a small naval force here general sir robert pigott who commanded in the island had his headquarters the force under him was about six thousand strong variously posted about the island some in works at the north end but the greater part within strongly intrenched lines extending across the island about three miles from the town general greene hastened from providence on hearing of the arrival of the fleet of count destaing and went on board of it at the anchorage to concert a plan of operations it was agreed that the fleet should force its way into the harbor at the same time that the americans approached by land and that the landing of the troops from the ships on the west side of the island should take place at the same time that the americans should cross seaconnet channel and land on the east side near the north end this combined operation was to have been carried promptly into effect but was postponed until the 10th of august to give time for the reinforcements sent by washington to arrive the delay was fatal to the enterprise  on the 8th the count destaing entered the harbor and passed up the main channel exchanging a cannonade with the batteries as he passed and anchored a little above the town between goat and conanicut islands the english on his approach burnt or scuttled three frigates and some smaller vessels which would otherwise have been captured general sullivan to be ready for the concerted attack had moved down from providence to the neighborhood of howlands ferry on the east side of seaconnet passage  the british troops stationed opposite on the north end of the island fearful of being cut off evacuated their works in the night of the 8th and drew into the lines at newport sullivan seeing the works thus abandoned could not resist the temptation to cross the channel in flatbottomed boats on the morning of the 9th and take possession of them  this sudden movement a day in advance of the concerted time and without due notice given to the count surprised and offended him clashing with his notions of etiquette and punctilio he however prepared to cooperate and was ordering out his boats for the purpose when about two oclock in the day his attention was called to a great fleet of ships standing toward newport it was in fact the fleet of lord howe that gallant nobleman had heard of the danger of newport and being reinforced by four stout ships part of a squadron coming out under admiral byron had hastened to its relief though still inferior in force to the french admiral the delay of the concerted attack had enabled him to arrive in time the wind set directly into the harbor had he entered promptly the french would have been placed between two fires from his ships and the batteries and cramped up in a confined channel where their largest ships had no room to operate his lordship however came to anchor at point judith some distance from the southwest entrance of the bay  in the night the wind changed to the northeast the count hastened to avail himself of the error of the british admiral favored by the wind he stood out of the harbor at eight oclock in the morning to give the enemy battle where he should have good sea room previously sending word to general sullivan that he would land his promised troops and marines and cooperate with him on his return the french ships were severely cannonaded as they passed the batteries but without material damage forming in order of battle they bore down upon the fleet of lord howe confidently anticipating a victory from their superiority of force the british ships slipt their cables at their approach and likewise formed in line of battle but his lordship avoided an encounter while the enemy had the weathergage to gain this on the one part and retain it on the other the two fleets manoeuvred throughout the day standing to the southward and gradually disappearing from the anxious eyes of the belligerent forces on rhode island  the army of sullivan now left to itself before newport amounted to ten thousand men having received the militia reinforcements lafayette advised the delay of hostile operations until the return of destaing but the american commander piqued and chagrined at the departure of his allies determined to commence the siege immediately without waiting for his tardy aid on the 12th however came on a tempest of wind and rain which raged for two days and nights with unexampled violence on the 14th the weather cleared up and the sun shone brightly but the army was worn down and dispirited the day was passed in drying their clothes cleaning their arms and putting themselves in order for action by the next morning they were again on the alert expecting the prompt return of the french they now took post on honeymans hill about two miles from the british lines and began to construct batteries form lines of communication and make regular approaches the british were equally active in strengthening their defences there was casual cannonading on each side but nothing of consequence several days elapsed without the reappearance of the french the situation of the besiegers was growing critical when on the evening of the 19th they descried the expected fleet standing toward the harbor all now was exultation in the camp should the french with their ships and troops attack the town by sea and land on the one side while the americans assailed it on the other the surrender of the place was inevitable  these sanguine anticipations however were shortlived the french fleet was in a shattered and forlorn condition after sailing from before newport on the 20th it had manoeuvred for two days with the british fleet each unwilling to enter into action without having the weathergage while thus manoeuvring the same furious storm which had raged on shore separated and dispersed them with fearful ravage some single encounters of scattered ships subsequently took place but without definite result all were too much tempesttossed and disabled to make good fight lord howe with such of his ships as he could collect bore away to new york to refit and the french admiral was now before newport but in no plight or mood for fighting  in a letter to general sullivan he informed him that pursuant to the orders of his sovereign and the advice of his officers he was bound for boston being instructed to repair to that port should he meet with misfortune or a superior british force appear upon the coast dismayed at this intelligence which threatened ruin and disgrace to the enterprise sullivan wrote a letter of remonstrance to the count and general greene and the marquis lafayette repaired with it on board of the admirals ship to enforce it by their personal exertions they represented to the count the certainty of carrying the place in two days by a combined attack and the discouragement and reproach that would follow a failure on this their first attempt at cooperation an attempt too for which the americans had made such great and expensive preparations and on which they had indulged such sanguine hopes these and other considerations equally urgent had their weight with the count and he was inclined to remain and pursue the enterprise but was overruled by the principal officers of his fleet the fact is that he was properly a land officer and they had been indignant at his having a nautical command over their heads they were glad therefore of any opportunity to thwart and mortify him and now insisted on his complying with his letter of instructions and sailing for boston  at the sailing of the ships there was a feeling of exasperation throughout the camp sullivan gave vent to his vexation in a general order on the 24th wherein he observed the general cannot help lamenting the sudden and unexpected departure of the french fleet as he finds it has a tendency to discourage some who placed great dependence upon the assistance of it though he can by no means suppose the army or any part of it endangered by this movement he yet hopes the event will prove america able to procure that by her own arms which her allies refuse to assist in obtaining on cooler reflection he thought proper in subsequent orders to explain away this rash imputation on french loyalty but a general feeling of irritation against the french continued to prevail in the army  the departure of the fleet was a deathblow to the enterprise between two and three thousand volunteers abandoned the camp in the course of four and twenty hours others continued to go off and in a few days the number of besiegers did not exceed that of the besieged all thoughts of offensive operations were now at an end the question was how best to extricate the army from its perilous position on the 28th it was determined in a council of war to fall back to the military works at the north end of the island and fortify there until it should be known whether the french fleet would soon return to their assistance the marquis lafayette setting off with all speed to have an interview with the count destaing and ascertain the fact  general sullivan broke up his camp and commenced his retreat that very night between nine and ten oclock their retreat was not discovered until daylight when a pursuit was commenced the covering parties behaved gallantly making frequent stands after a series of skirmishes they were pressed back to the fortified grounds on the north end of the island but sullivan had already taken post there on batts hill the main body of his army being drawn up in order of battle with strong works in their rear and a redoubt in front of the right wing  the british now took post on an advantageous height called quaker hill a little more than a mile from the american front whence they commenced a cannonade which was briskly returned skirmishing ensued until about ten oclock when two british sloopsofwar and some small vessels having gained a favorable position the enemys troops under cover of their fire advanced in force to turn the right flank of the american army and capture the redoubt which protected it this was bravely defended by general greene a sharp action ensued which had nearly become a general one between two and three hundred men were killed on each side the british at length drew back to their artillery and works on quaker hill and a mutual cannonade was resumed and kept up until night on the following day 29th general sullivan received intelligence that lord howe had again put to sea with the design no doubt to attempt the relief of newport  under these circumstances it was determined to abandon rhode island to do so with safety however required the utmost caution as the hostile sentries were within four hundred yards of each other the position on batts hill favored a deception tents were brought forward and pitched in sight of the enemy and a great part of the troops employed throughout the day in throwing up works as if the post was to be resolutely maintained at the same time the heavy baggage and stores were quietly conveyed away in the rear of the hill and ferried across the bay as soon as it was dark the tents were struck fires were lighted at various points the troops withdrawn and in a few hours the whole were transported across the channel to the mainland  the whole army had crossed by two oclock in the morning unperceived by the enemy the very next day sir henry clinton arrived at newport in a light squadron with a reinforcement of four thousand men a naval and land force that might effectually have cut off sullivans retreat had he lingered on the island sir henry finding he had arrived a day too late returned to new york but first detached majorgeneral sir charles grey with the troops on a ravaging expedition to the eastward chiefly against ports which were the haunts of privateers he destroyed more than seventy vessels in acushnet river some of them privateers with their prizes others peaceful merchant ships new bedford and fair haven having been made military and naval deposits were laid waste wharves demolished ropewalks storehouses and mills with several private dwellings wrapped in flames similar destruction was effected at the island of marthas vineyard having thus ravaged the coasts of new england the squadron returned laden with inglorious spoil to new york  lord howe also who had sailed for boston in the hope of intercepting the count destaing and had reached there on the 30th of august found the french fleet safely sheltered in nantasket road and protected by american batteries erected on commanding points he also returned to new york and shortly afterward availing himself of a permission granted him some time before by government resigned the command of the fleet to admiral gambler to hold it until the arrival of admiral byron  while hostilities were carried on in the customary form along the atlantic borders indian warfare with all its atrocity was going on in the interior the british post at niagara was its cradle it was the common rallying place of tories refugees savage warriors and other desperadoes of the frontiers hither brant the noted indian chief had retired after the repulse of st leger at fort schuyler to plan further mischief and here was concerted the memorable incursion into the valley of wyoming suggested by tory refugees who had until recently inhabited it  the valley of wyoming is a beautiful region lying along the susquehanna peaceful as was its aspect it had been the scene of sanguinary feuds prior to the revolution between the people of pennsylvania and connecticut who both laid claim to it seven rural forts or blockhouses situated on various parts of the valley had been strongholds during these territorial contests and remained as places of refuge for women and children in times of indian ravage the expedition now set on foot against it in june was composed of butlers rangers johnsons royal greens and brant with his indian braves their united force about eleven hundred strong was conducted by colonel john butler renowned in indian warfare passing down the chemung and susquehanna in canoes they landed at a place called three islands struck through the wilderness to a gap or notch of the mountains by which they entered the valley of wyoming butler made his headquarters at one of the strongholds already mentioned called wintermoots fort from a tory family of the same name hence he sent out his marauding parties to plunder and lay waste the country  rumors of this intended invasion had reached the valley some time before the appearance of the enemy and had spread great consternation most of the sturdy yeomanry were absent in the army a company of sixty men enlisted under an act of congress and hastily and imperfectly organized yet styling themselves regulars took post at one of the strongholds called forty fort where they were joined by about three hundred of the most efficient of the yeomanry armed and equipped in rude rustic style in this emergency old men and boys volunteered to meet the common danger posting themselves in the smaller forts in which women and children had taken refuge colonel zebulon butler an officer of the continental army took the general command several officers arrived from the army having obtained leave to repair home for the protection of their families they brought word that a reinforcement sent by washington was on its way  in the meantime the marauding parties sent out by butler and brant were spreading desolation through the valley farmhouses were wrapped in flames husbandmen were murdered while at work in the fields all who had not taken refuge in the fort were threatened with destruction what was to be done wait for the arrival of the promised reinforcement or attempt to check the ravage the latter was rashly determined on leaving the women and children in forty fort colonel zebulon butler with his men sallied forth on the 3d of july and made a rapid move upon wintermoot fort hoping to come upon it by surprise they found the enemy drawn up in front of it in a line extending from the river to a marsh colonel john butler and his rangers with johnsons royal greens on the left indians and tories on the right  the americans formed a line of the same extent the regulars under colonel butler on the right flank resting on the river the militia under colonel denison on the left wing on the marsh a sharp fire was opened from right to left after a few volleys the enemy in front of colonel butler began to give way the indians however throwing themselves into the marsh turned the left flank of the americans and attacked the militia in the rear denison finding himself exposed to a cross fire sought to change his position and gave the word to fall back it was mistaken for an order to retreat in an instant the left wing turned and fled all attempts to rally it were vain the panic extended to the right wing the savages throwing down their rifles rushed on with tomahawk and scalpingknife and a horrible massacre ensued some of the americans escaped to forty fort some swam the river others broke their way across the swamp and climbed the mountain some few were taken prisoners but the greater number were slaughtered  the desolation of the valley was now completed fields were laid waste houses burnt and their inhabitants murdered according to the british accounts upwards of four hundred of the yeomanry of wyoming were slain and five thousand persons fled in the utmost distress and consternation seeking refuge in the settlements on the lehigh and the delaware after completing this horrible work of devastation the enemy retired before the arrival of the troops detached by washington  for a great part of the summer washington had remained encamped at white plains watching the movements of the enemy at new york early in september he observed a great stir of preparation cannon and military stores were embarked and a fleet of one hundred and forty transports were ready to make sail what was their destination there were but two capital objects which they could have in view beside the defeat and dispersion of his army one was to get possession of the forts and passes of the highlands the other by a junction of their land and naval forces to attempt the destruction of the french fleet at boston and regain possession of that town those points were so far asunder that it was difficult to protect the one without leaving the other exposed to do the best that the nature of the case would admit washington strengthened the works and reinforced the garrison in the highlands stationing putnam with two brigades in the neighborhood of west point general gates was sent with three brigades to danbury in connecticut where he was joined by two brigades under general mcdougal while washington moved his camp to a rear position at fredericksburg on the borders of connecticut and about thirty miles from west point so as to be ready for a movement to the eastward or a speedy junction for the defence of the hudson  scarce had washington moved from white plains when sir henry clinton threw a detachment of five thousand men under lord cornwallis into the jerseys between the hackensack and hudson rivers and another of three thousand under knyphausen into westchester county between the hudson and the bronx these detachments held communication with each other and by the aid of flatbottomed boats could unite their forces in twentyfour hours on either side of the hudson washington considered these mere foraging expeditions though on a large scale and detached troops into the jerseys to cooperate with the militia in checking them but as something more might be intended he ordered general putnam to cross the river to west point for its immediate security while he himself moved with a division of his army to fishkill  wayne who was with the detachment in the jerseys took post with a body of militia and a regiment of lighthorse in front of the division of lord cornwallis the militia were quartered at the village of new tappan but lieutenantcolonel baylor who commanded the lighthorse chose to camp apart to be free as is supposed from the control of wayne he took up his quarters therefore in old tappan where his men lay very negligently and unguardedly in barns cornwallis had intelligence of their exposed situation and laid a plan to cut off the whole detachment a body of troops from knyphausens division was to cross the hudson in the night and come by surprise upon the militia in new tappan at the same time majorgeneral grey of marauding renown was to advance on the left and attack baylor and his dragoons in their careless quarters in old tappan  fortunately knyphausens troops led by lieutenantcolonel campbell were slow in crossing the river and the militia were apprised by deserters of their danger in time to escape not so with baylors party general grey having cut off a sergeants patrol advanced in silence and surrounded with his troops three barns in which the dragoons were sleeping we have seen in his surprise of waynes detachment in the preceding year how stealthy and effective he was in the work of destruction to prevent noise he had caused his men to draw the charges and take the flints from their guns and fix their bayonets the bayonet was his favorite weapon with this his men rushed forward and deaf for a time to all cries for mercy made a savage slaughter of naked and defenceless men eleven were killed on the spot and twentyfive mangled with repeated thrusts some receiving ten twelve and even sixteen wounds among the wounded were colonel baylor and major clough the last of whom soon died  this whole movement of troops on both sides of the hudson was designed to cover an expedition against little egg harbor on the east coast of new jersey a noted rendezvous of american privateers three hundred regular troops and a body of royalist volunteers from the jerseys headed by captain patrick ferguson embarked at new york on board galleys and transports and made for little egg harbor under convoy of vessels of war they were long at sea the country heard of their coming four privateers put to sea and escaped others took refuge up the river the wind prevented the transports from entering the troops embarked in row galleys and small craft and pushed twenty miles up the river to the village of chestnut neck here were batteries without guns prize ships which had been hastily scuttled and storehouses for the reception of prize goods the batteries and storehouses were demolished the prize ships burnt saltworks destroyed private dwellings sacked and laid in ashes all it was pretended being the property of persons concerned in privateering  the vessels which brought this detachment being windbound for several days captain ferguson had time for another enterprise among the forces detached by washington into the jerseys to check these ravages was the count pulaskis legionary corps composed of three companies of foot and a troop of horse officered principally by foreigners a deserter from the corps brought word to the british commander that the legion was cantoned about twelve miles up the river the infantry in three houses by themselves count pulaski with the cavalry at some distance apart informed of these circumstances captain ferguson embarked in boats with two hundred and fifty men ascended the river in the night landed at four in the morning and surrounded the houses in which the infantry were sleeping it being a night attack says the captain in his official report little quarter of course could be given so there were only five prisoners fifty of the infantry were butchered on the spot among whom were two of the foreign officers the baron de bose and lieutenant de la broderie the clattering of hoofs gave note of the approach of pulaski and his horse whereupon the british made a rapid retreat to their boats and pulled down the river and thus ended the marauding expedition of captain ferguson worthy of the times of the buccaneers  the detachment on the east side of the hudson likewise made a predatory and disgraceful foray from their lines at kings bridge towards the american encampment at white plains plundering the inhabitants without discrimination not only of their provisions and forage but of the very clothes on their backs none were more efficient in this ravage than a party of about one hundred of captain donops hessian yagers and they were in full maraud between tarrytown and dobbs ferry when a detachment of infantry under colonel richard butler and of cavalry under major henry lee came upon them by surprise killed ten of them on the spot and captured a lieutenant and eighteen privates  the british detachments having accomplished the main objects of their movements returned to new york leaving those parts of the country they had harassed still more determined in their hostility having achieved nothing but what is least honorable and most detestable in warfare  about the middle of september admiral byron arrived at new york with the residue of the scattered armament which had sailed from england in june to counteract the designs of the count destaing finding that the count was still repairing his shattered fleet in the harbor of boston he put to sea again as soon as his ships were refitted and set sail for that port to entrap him success seemed likely to crown his schemes he arrived off boston on the 1st of november his rival was still in port scarce had the admiral entered the bay however when another violent storm drove him out to sea disabled his ships and compelled him to put into rhode island to refit meanwhile the count having his ships in good order and finding the coast clear put to sea and made the best of his way for the west indies  the force at new york which had been an object of watchful solicitude was gradually dispersed in different directions immediately after the departure of admiral byron for boston another naval expedition had been set on foot by sir henry clinton all being ready a fleet of transports with five thousand men under general grant convoyed by commodore hotham with a squadron of six shipsofwar set sail on the 3d of november with the secret design of an attack on st lucia towards the end of the same month another body of troops under lieutenantcolonel campbell sailed for georgia in the squadron of commodore hyde parker the british cabinet having determined to carry the war into the southern states at the same time general prevost who commanded in florida was ordered by sir henry clinton to march to the banks of the savannah river and attack georgia in flank while the expedition under campbell should attack it in front on the seaboard  the squadron of commodore hyde parker anchored in the savannah river towards the end of december an american force of about six hundred regulars and a few militia under general robert howe were encamped near the town lieutenantcolonel campbell landed his troops on the 29th of december the whole country bordering the river is a deep morass cut up by creeks and only to be traversed by causeways over one of these six hundred yards in length with a ditch on each side colonel campbell advanced putting to flight a small party stationed to guard it general howe had posted his little army on the main road with the river on his left and a morass in front a negro gave campbell information of a path leading through the morass by which troops might get unobserved to the rear of the americans sir james baird was detached with the light infantry by this path while colonel campbell advanced in front the americans thus suddenly attacked in front and rear were completely routed upwards of one hundred were either killed on the spot or perished in the morass thirtyeight officers and four hundred and fifteen privates were taken prisoners the rest retreated up the savannah river and crossed into south carolina savannah the capital of georgia was taken possession of by the victors with cannon military stores and provisions their loss was only seven killed and nineteen wounded  while colonel campbell had thus invaded georgia in front general prevost who commanded the british forces in florida had received orders from sir henry clinton to take it in flank he accordingly traversed deserts to its southern frontier took sunbury the only remaining fort of importance and marched to savannah where he assumed the general command detaching colonel campbell against augusta by the middle of january 1779 all georgia was reduced to submission  a more experienced american general than howe had by this time arrived to take command of the southern department majorgeneral lincoln who had gained such reputation in the campaign against burgoyne and whose appointment to this station had been solicited by the delegates from south carolina and georgia he had received his orders from washington in the beginning of october of his operations at the south we shall have occasion to speak hereafter     chapter lii washington in philadelphiaindian warfarecapture of stony pointravages in connecticutrepulse at savannah   about the beginning of december washington distributed his troops for the winter in a line of strong cantonments extending from long island sound to the delaware general putnam commanded at danbury general mcdougall in the highlands while the headquarters of the commanderinchief were near middlebrook in the jerseys the objects of this arrangement were the protection of the country the security of the important posts on the hudson and the safety discipline and easy subsistence of the army  in the course of this winter he devised a plan of alarm signals which general philemon dickinson was employed to carry into effect on bottle hill which commanded a vast map of country sentinels kept watch day and night should there be an irruption of the enemy an eighteen pounder called the old sow fired every half hour gave the alarm in the day time or in dark and stormy nights an immense fire or beacon at other times on the booming of that heavy gun lights sprang up from hill to hill along the different ranges of heights the country was aroused and the yeomanry hastily armed hurried to their gathering places  washington was now doomed to experience great loss in the narrow circle of those about him on whose attachment and devotion he could place implicit reliance the marquis lafayette seeing no immediate prospect of active employment in the united states and anticipating a war on the continent of europe was disposed to return to france to offer his services to his sovereign desirous however of preserving a relation with america he merely solicited from congress the liberty of going home for the next winter engaging himself not to depart until certain that the campaign was over washington backed his application for a furlough as an arrangement that would still link him with the service expressing his reluctance to part with an officer who united to all the military fire of youth an uncommon maturity of judgment congress in consequence granted the marquis an unlimited leave of absence to return to america whenever he should find it convenient  much of the winter was passed by washington in philadelphia occupied in devising and discussing plans for the campaign of 1779 it was an anxious moment with him circumstances which inspired others with confidence filled him with solicitude the alliance with france had produced a baneful feeling of security which it appeared to him was paralyzing the energies of the country england it was thought would now be too much occupied in securing her position in europe to increase her force or extend her operations in america many therefore considered the war as virtually at an end and were unwilling to make the sacrifices or supply the means necessary for important military undertakings  dissensions too and party feuds were breaking out in congress owing to the relaxation of that external pressure of a common and imminent danger which had heretofore produced a unity of sentiment and action that august body had in fact greatly deteriorated since the commencement of the war many of those whose names had been as watchwords at the declaration of independence had withdrawn from the national councils occupied either by their individual affairs or by the affairs of their individual states washington whose comprehensive patriotism embraced the whole union deprecated and deplored the dawning of this sectional spirit america he declared had never stood in more imminent need of the wise patriotic and spirited exertions of her sons than at this period  in discussing the policy to be observed in the next campaign washington presumed the enemy would maintain their present posts and conduct the war as heretofore in which case he was for remaining entirely on the defensive one single exception was made by him the horrible ravages and massacres perpetrated by the indians and their tory allies at wyoming had been followed by similar atrocities at cherry valley in the state of new york and called for signal vengeance to prevent a repetition washington knew by experience that indian warfare to be effective should never be merely defensive but must be carried into the enemys country the six nations the most civilized of the savage tribes had proved themselves the most formidable his idea was to make war upon them in their own style penetrate their country lay waste their villages and settlements and at the same time destroy the british post at niagara that nestlingplace of tories and refugees  the policy thus recommended was adopted by congress arrangements were set on foot to carry that part relative to the indians into execution the first act was an expedition from fort schuyler by colonel van schaick lieutenantcolonel willett and major cochran with about six hundred men who on the 19th of april surprised the towns of the onondagas destroyed the whole settlement and returned to the fort without the loss of a single man  the great expedition of the campaign however was in revenge of the massacre of wyoming early in the summer three thousand men assembled in that lately desolated region and conducted by general sullivan moved up the west branch of the susquehanna into the seneca country while on the way they were joined by a part of the western army under general james clinton who had come from the valley of the mohawk by otsego lake and the east branch of the susquehanna the united forces amounted to about five thousand men of which sullivan had the general command  the indians and their allies the tories had received information of the intended invasion and appeared in arms to oppose it they were much inferior in force however being about fifteen hundred indians and two hundred white men commanded by the two butlers johnson and brant a battle took place at newtown on the 29th of august in which they were easily defeated sullivan then pushed forward into the heart of the indian country penetrating as far as the genesee river laying everything waste setting fire to deserted dwellings destroying cornfields orchards gardens everything that could give sustenance to man the design being to starve the indians out of the country the latter retreated before him with their families and at length took refuge under the protection of the british garrison at niagara having completed his errand sullivan returned to easton in pennsylvania the thanks of congress were voted to him and his army but he shortly afterward resigned his commission on account of ill health and retired from the service  a similar expedition was undertaken by colonel brodhead from pittsburg up the alleghany against the mingo muncey and seneca tribes with similar results the wisdom of washingtons policy of carrying the war against the indians into their country and conducting it in their own way was apparent from the general intimidation produced among the tribes by these expeditions and the subsequent infrequency of their murderous incursions                                       the situation of sir henry clinton must have been mortifying in the extreme to an officer of lofty ambition and generous aims his force between sixteen and seventeen thousand strong was superior in number discipline and equipment to that of washington yet his instructions confined him to a predatory warfare carried on by attacks and marauds at distant points harassing it is true yet irritating to the country intended to be conciliated and brutalizing to his own soldiery such was the nature of an expedition set on foot against the commerce of the chesapeake by which commerce the armies were supplied and the credit of the government sustained on the 9th of may a squadron under sir george collier convoying transports and galleys with twentyfive hundred men commanded by general mathews entered these waters took possession of portsmouth without opposition sent out armed parties against norfolk suffolk gosport kemps landing and other neighboring places where were immense quantities of provisions naval and military stores and merchandise of all kinds with numerous vessels some on the stocks others richly laden wherever they went a scene of plunder conflagration and destruction ensued a few days sufficed to ravage the whole neighborhood  while this was going on at the south washington received intelligence of movements at new york and in its vicinity which made him apprehend an expedition against the highlands of the hudson since the loss of forts montgomery and clinton the main defences of the highlands had been established at the sudden bend of the river where it winds between west point and constitution island two opposite forts commanded this bend and an iron chain which was stretched across it  washington had projected two works also just below the highlands at stony point and verplancks point to serve as outworks of the mountain passes and to protect kings ferry the most direct and convenient communication between the northern and middle states a small but strong fort had been erected on verplancks point and was garrisoned by seventy men under captain armstrong a more important work was in progress at stony point when completed these two forts on opposite promontories would form as it were the lower gates of the highlands to be at hand in case of any real attempt upon the highlands washington drew up with his forces in that direction moving by the way of morristown  an expedition up the hudson was really the object of sir henry clintons movements and for this he was strengthened by the return of sir george collier with his marauding ships and forces from virginia on the 30th of may sir henry set out on his second grand cruise up the hudson with an armament of about seventy sail great and small and one hundred and fifty flatboats admiral sir george collier commanded the armament and there was a land force of about five thousand men under general vaughan  the first aim of sir henry was to get possession of stony and verplancks points his former expedition had acquainted him with the importance of this pass of the river on the morning of the 31st the forces were landed in two divisions the largest under general vaughan on the east side of the river about seven or eight miles below verplancks point the other commanded by sir henry in person landed in haverstraw bay about three miles below stony point there were but about thirty men in the unfinished fort they abandoned it on the approach of the enemy and retreated into the highlands having first set fire to the blockhouse the british took quiet possession of the fort in the evening dragged up cannon and mortars in the night and at daybreak opened a furious fire upon fort lafayette it was cannonaded at the same time by the armed vessels and a demonstration was made on it by the division under general vaughan thus surrounded the little garrison of seventy men was forced to surrender with no other stipulation than safety to their persons and to the property they had in the fort major andr√© was aidedecamp to sir henry and signed the articles of capitulation  washington presumed that the main object of sir henry was to get possession of west point the guardian fortress of the river and that the capture of stony and verplancks points were preparatory steps he would fain have dislodged him from these posts but deferring any attempt on them for the present he took measures for the protection of west point leaving general putnam and the main body of the army at smiths clove a mountain pass in the rear of haverstraw he removed his headquarters to new windsor to be near west point in case of need and to press the completion of its works general mcdougall was transferred to the command of the point three brigades were stationed at different places on the opposite side of the river under general heath from which fatigue parties crossed daily to work on the fortifications  this strong disposition of the american forces checked sir henrys designs against the highlands contenting himself therefore for the present with the acquisition of stony and verplancks points he returned to new york where he soon set on foot a desolating expedition along the seaboard of connecticut that state while it furnished the american armies with provisions and recruits and infested the sea with privateers had hitherto experienced nothing of the horrors of war within its borders sir henry in compliance with his instructions from government was now about to give it a scourging lesson general late governor tryon was the officer selected by sir henry for this inglorious but apparently congenial service about the beginning of july he embarked with two thousand six hundred men in a fleet of transports and tenders and was convoyed up the sound by sir george collier with two shipsofwar  on the 5th of july the troops landed near new haven in two divisions one led by tryon the other by brigadiergeneral garth his lieutenant they came upon the neighborhood by surprise yet the militia assembled in haste and made a resolute though ineffectual opposition the british captured the town dismantled the fort and took or destroyed all the vessels in the harbor with all the artillery ammunition and public stores several private houses were plundered they next proceeded to fairfield where meeting with greater resistance they thought the moment arrived for a wholesome example of severity accordingly they not merely ravaged and destroyed the public stores and the vessels in the harbor but laid the town itself in ashes the exact return of this salutary lesson gives the destruction of ninetyseven dwellinghouses sixtyseven barns and stables fortyeight storehouses three places of worship a courthouse a jail and two schoolhouses  at norwalk where they landed on the 11th of july they burnt one hundred and thirty dwellinghouses eightyseven barns twentytwo storehouses seventeen shops four mills two places of worship and five vessels which were in the harbor the loss of the british throughout the whole expedition amounted according to their own accounts to twenty killed ninetysix wounded and thirtytwo missing it was intended to crown this grand ravage by a descent on new london a noted rendezvous of privateers but as greater opposition was expected there than at either of the other places the squadron returned to huntington bay on long island to await reinforcements and commodore collier proceeded to throgs neck to confer with sir henry clinton about further operations  washington on hearing of the departure of the expedition to the eastward and before he was acquainted with its definite object detached general heath with two brigades of connecticut militia to counteract the movements of the enemy this was all that he could spare from the force stationed for the protection of the highlands any weakening of his posts there might bring the enemy suddenly upon him such was their facility in moving from one place to another by means of their shipping indeed he had divined that a scheme of the kind was at the bottom of the hostile movement to the eastward  as a kind of countercheck to sir henry washington had for some days been planning the recapture of stony point and fort lafayette he had reconnoitred them in person spies had been thrown into them and information collected from deserters stony point having been recently strengthened by the british was now the most important it was a rocky promontory advancing far into the hudson which washed three sides of it a deep morass covered at high water separated it from the mainland but at low tide might be traversed by a narrow causeway and bridge the promontory was crowned by strong works furnished with heavy ordnance commanding the morass and causeway lower down were two rows of abatis and the shore at the foot of the hill could be swept by vessels of war anchored in the river the garrison was about six hundred strong commanded by lieutenantcolonel johnson  to attempt the surprisal of this isolated post thus strongly fortified was a perilous enterprise general wayne mad anthony as he was called from his daring valor was the officer to whom washington proposed it and he engaged in it with avidity according to washingtons plan it was to be attempted by lightinfantry only at night and with the utmost secrecy securing every person they met to prevent discovery between one and two hundred chosen men and officers were to make the surprise preceded by a vanguard of prudent determined men well commanded to remove obstructions secure sentries and drive in the guards on getting possession of stony point wayne was to turn its guns upon fort lafayette and the shipping a detachment was to march down from west point by peekskill to the vicinity of fort lafayette and hold itself ready to join in the attack upon it as soon as the cannonade began from stony point  on the 15th of july about midday wayne set out with his lightinfantry from sandy beach fourteen miles distant from stony point about eight in the evening they arrived within a mile and a half of the forts without being discovered about halfpast eleven the whole moved forward guided by a negro of the neighborhood who had frequently carried in fruit to the garrison and served the americans as a spy he led the way accompanied by two stout men disguised as farmers the countersign was given to the first sentinel posted on high ground west of the morass while the negro talked with him the men seized and gagged him the sentinel posted at the head of the causeway was served in the same manner the causeway however was overflowed and it was some time after twelve oclock before the troops could cross leaving three hundred men under general muhlenberg on the western side of the morass as a reserve  at the foot of the promontory the troops were divided into two columns for simultaneous attacks on opposite sides of the works one hundred and fifty volunteers led by lieutenantcolonel fleury seconded by major posey formed the vanguard of the right column one hundred volunteers under major stewart the vanguard of the left in the advance of each was a forlorn hope of twenty men one led by lieutenant gibbon the other by lieutenant knox it was their desperate duty to remove the abatis so well had the whole affair been conducted that the americans were close upon the outworks before they were discovered there was then severe skirmishing at the pickets the americans used the bayonet the others discharged their muskets the reports roused the garrison stony point was instantly in an uproar the drums beat to arms every one hurried to his alarm post the works were hastily manned and a tremendous fire of grapeshot and musketry opened upon the assailants  the two columns forced their way with the bayonet at opposite points surmounting every obstacle colonel fleury was the first to enter the fort and strike the british flag major posey sprang to the ramparts and shouted the fort is our own the two columns arrived nearly at the same time and met in the centre of the works the garrison surrendered at discretion at daybreak the guns of the fort were turned on fort lafayette and the shipping the latter cut their cables and dropped down the river through a series of blunders the detachment from west point which was to have cooperated did not arrive in time and came unprovided with suitable ammunition for their battering artillery this part of the enterprise therefore failed fort lafayette held out  the storming of stony point stands out in high relief as one of the most brilliant achievements of the war the americans had effected it without firing a musket on their part it was the silent deadly work of the bayonet the fierce resistance they met at the outset may be judged by the havoc made in their forlorn hope out of twentytwo men seventeen were either killed or wounded the whole loss of the americans was fifteen killed and eightythree wounded of the garrison sixtythree were slain including two officers five hundred and fiftythree were taken prisoners among whom were a lieutenantcolonel four captains and twentythree subaltern officers  illustration new london conn vol iv  tidings of the capture of stony point and the imminent danger of fort lafayette reached sir henry clinton just after his conference with sir george collier at throgs neck the expedition against new london was instantly given up the transports and troops were recalled a forced march was made to dobbs ferry on the hudson a detachment was sent up the river in transports to relieve fort lafayette and sir henry followed with a greater force hoping washington might quit his fastnesses and risk a battle for the possession of stony point  again the fabian policy of the american commanderinchief disappointed the british general having well examined the post in company with an engineer and several general officers he found that at least fifteen hundred men would be required to maintain it a number not to be spared from the army at present the works too were only calculated for defence on the land side and were open towards the river where the enemy depended upon protection from their ships it would be necessary to construct them anew with great labor the army also would have to be in the vicinity too distant from west point to aid in completing or defending its fortifications and exposed to the risk of a general action on unfavorable terms for these considerations in which all his officers concurred washington evacuated the post on the 18th removing the cannon and stores and destroying the works after which he drew his forces together in the highlands and established his quarters at west point sir henry retook possession of stony point and fortified and garrisoned it more strongly than ever but was too wary to risk an attempt upon the strongholds of the highlands  the brilliant affair of the storming of stony point was somewhat overshadowed by the result of an enterprise at the eastward undertaken without consulting washington a british detachment from halifax of seven or eight hundred men had founded in june a military post on the eastern side of the bay of penobscot nine miles below the river of that name and were erecting a fort there intended to protect nova scotia control the frontiers of massachusetts and command the vast wooded regions of maine  the people of boston roused by this movement which invaded their territory and touched their pride and interests undertook on their own responsibility a naval and military expedition intended to drive off the invaders a squadron of armed ships and brigantines under commodore saltonstall put to sea convoying transports on board of which were near four thousand land troops under general lovel arriving in the penobscot on the 25th of may they found colonel maclean posted on a peninsula steep and precipitous toward the bay and deeply trenched on the land side with three shipsofwar anchored before it  lovel was repulsed with some little loss in an attempt to effect a landing on the peninsula but finally succeeded before daybreak on the 28th the moment was propitious for a bold and vigorous blow the fort was but half finished the guns were not mounted the three armed vessels could not have offered a formidable resistance but unfortunately the energy of a wayne was wanting to the enterprise lovel proceeded by regular siege he threw up works at seven hundred and fifty yards distance and opened a cannonade which was continued from day to day for a fortnight the delay gave time for admiral collier at new york to hear of this enterprise and take measures for its defeat  on the 13th of august lovel was astounded by intelligence that the admiral was arrived before the bay with a superior armament thus fairly entrapped he endeavored to extricate his force with as little loss as possible before news of colliers arrival could reach the fort he reembarked his troops in the transports to make their escape up the river his armed vessels were drawn up in a crescent as if to give battle but it was merely to hold the enemy in check they soon gave way some were captured others were set on fire or blown up and abandoned by their crews the transports being eagerly pursued and in great danger of being taken disgorged the troops and seamen on the wild shores of the river whence they had to make the best of their way to boston struggling for upwards of a hundred miles through a pathless wilderness before they reached the settled parts of the country  if washington was chagrined by the signal failure of this expedition he was cheered by the better fortune of one set on foot about the same time under his own eye by his young friend major henry lee of the virginia dragoons this active and daring officer had frequently been employed by him in scouring the country on the west side of the hudson to collect information keep an eye upon the enemys posts cut off their supplies and check their foraging parties the coup de main at stony point had piqued his emulation in the course of his reconnoitring and by means of spies he had discovered that the british post at paulus hook immediately opposite to new york was very negligently guarded paulus hook is a long low point of the jersey shore stretching into the hudson and connected to the main land by a sandy isthmus a fort had been erected on it and garrisoned with four or five hundred men under the command of major sutherland it was a strong position a creek fordable only in two places rendered the hook difficult of access within this a deep trench had been cut across the isthmus traversed by a drawbridge with a barred gate and still within this was a double row of abatis extending into the water confident in the strength of his position and its distance from any american force major sutherland had become remiss in his military precautions all this had been ascertained by major lee and he now proposed the daring project of surprising the fort at night and thus striking an insulting blow within cannon shot of new york washington was disposed to favor the adventurous schemes of this young officer  on the 18th of august lee set out on the expedition at the head of three hundred men of lord stirlings division and a troop of dismounted dragoons under captain mclane it was between two and three in the morning when he arrived at the creek it happened fortunately that major sutherland the british commander had the day before detached a foraging party under a major buskirk to a part of the country called the english neighborhood as lee and his men approached they were mistaken by the sentinel for this party on its return the darkness of the night favored the mistake they passed the creek and ditch entered the works unmolested and had made themselves masters of the post before the negligent garrison were well roused from sleep major sutherland and about sixty hessians threw themselves into a small blockhouse on the left of the fort and opened an irregular fire to attempt to dislodge them would have cost too much time alarm guns from the ships in the river and the forts at new york threatened speedy reinforcements to the enemy having made one hundred and fiftynine prisoners among whom were three officers lee commenced his retreat without tarrying to destroy either barracks or artillery few of the enemy were slain for there was but little fighting and no massacre his own loss was two men killed and three wounded  the arrival of admiral arbuthnot with a fleet bringing three thousand troops and a supply of provisions and stores strengthened the hands of sir henry clinton still he had not sufficient force to warrant any further attempt up the hudson washington by his diligence in fortifying west point having rendered that fastness of the highlands apparently impregnable sir henry turned his thoughts therefore towards the south hoping by a successful expedition in that direction to counterbalance ill success in other quarters  at this juncture news was received of the arrival of the count destaing with a formidable fleet on the coast of georgia having made a successful cruise in the west indies in the course of which he had taken st vincents and granada a combined attack upon new york was again talked of in anticipation of it washington called upon several of the middle states for supplies of all kinds and reinforcements of militia sir henry clinton also changed his plans caused rhode island to be evacuated the troops and stores to be brought away the garrisons brought off from stony and verplancks points and all his forces to be concentrated at new york which he endeavored to put in the strongest posture of defence  intelligence recently received too that spain had joined france in hostilities against england contributed to increase the solicitude and perplexities of the enemy while it gave fresh confidence to the americans  washingtons anticipations of a combined operation with destaing against new york were again disappointed the french admiral on arriving on the coast of georgia had been persuaded to cooperate with the southern army under general lincoln in an attempt to recover savannah for three weeks a siege was carried on with great vigor by regular approaches on land and cannonade and bombardment from the shipping on the 9th of october although the approaches were not complete and no sufficient breach had been effected lincoln and destaing at the head of their choicest troops advanced before daybreak to storm the works the assault was gallant but unsuccessful both americans and french had planted their standards on the redoubts but were finally repulsed after the repulse both armies retired from before the place the french having lost in killed and wounded upwards of six hundred men the americans about four hundred destaing himself was among the wounded and the gallant count pulaski among the slain the loss of the enemy was trifling being protected by their works  the tidings of this reverse which reached washington late in november put an end to all prospect of cooperation from the french fleet a consequent change took place in all his plans the militia of new york and massachusetts recently assembled were disbanded and arrangements were made for the winter the army was thrown into two divisions one was to be stationed under general heath in the highlands for the protection of west point and the neighboring posts the other and principal division was to be hutted near morristown where washington was to have his headquarters the cavalry were to be sent to connecticut  understanding that sir henry clinton was making preparations at new york for a large embarkation of troops and fearing they might be destined against georgia and carolina he resolved to detach the greater part of his southern troops for the protection of those states a provident resolution in which he was confirmed by subsequent instructions from congress accordingly the north carolina brigade took up its march for charleston in november and the whole of the virginia line in december  notwithstanding the recent preparations at new york the ships remained in port and the enemy held themselves in collected force there sir henry was regulating his movements by those the french fleet might make after the repulse at savannah intelligence at length arrived that it had been dispersed by a violent storm count destaing with a part had shaped his course for france the rest had proceeded to the west indies sir henry now lost no time in carrying his plans into operation leaving the garrison of new york under the command of lieutenantgeneral knyphausen he embarked several thousand men on board of transports to be convoyed by five shipsoftheline and several frigates under admiral arbuthnot and set sail on the 26th of december accompanied by lord cornwallis on an expedition intended for the capture of charleston and the reduction of south carolina     chapter liii army at morristownarnold in philadelphiacharleston besieged   the dreary encampment at valley forge has become proverbial for its hardships yet they were scarcely more severe than those suffered by washingtons army during the present winter while hutted among the heights of morristown the winter set in early and was uncommonly rigorous the transportation of supplies was obstructed the magazines were exhausted and the commissaries had neither money nor credit to enable them to replenish them for weeks at a time the army was on half allowance sometimes without meat sometimes without bread sometimes without both there was a scarcity too of clothing and blankets so that the poor soldiers were starving with cold as well as hunger  illustration headquarters morristown nj vol iii  a rigorous winter had much to do with the actual distresses of the army but the root of the evil lay in the derangement of the currency congress had commenced the war without adequate funds and without the power of imposing direct taxes to meet pressing emergencies it had emitted paper money which for a time passed currently at par but sank in value as further emissions succeeded and that already in circulation remained unredeemed the several states added to the evil by emitting paper in their separate capacities thus the country gradually became flooded with a continental currency as it was called irredeemable and of no intrinsic value the consequence was a general derangement of trade and finance the continental currency declined to such a degree that forty dollars in paper were equivalent to only one in specie congress attempted to put a stop to this depreciation by making paper money a legal tender at its nominal value in the discharge of debts however contracted this opened the door to knavery and added a new feature to the evil  the commissaries now found it difficult to purchase supplies for the immediate wants of the army and impossible to provide any stores in advance they were left destitute of funds and the public credit was prostrated by the accumulating debts suffered to remain uncancelled the changes which had taken place in the commissary department added to this confusion the commissarygeneral instead of receiving as heretofore a commission on expenditures was to have a fixed salary in paper currency and his deputies were to be compensated in like manner without the usual allowance of rations and forage no competent agents could be procured on such terms and the derangement produced throughout the department compelled colonel wadsworth the able and upright commissarygeneral to resign  in the present emergency washington was reluctantly compelled by the distresses of the army to call upon the counties of the state for supplies of grain and cattle proportioned to their respective abilities these supplies were to be brought into the camp within a certain time the grain to be measured and the cattle estimated by any two of the magistrates of the county in conjunction with the commissary and certificates to be given by the latter specifying the quantity of each and the terms of payment wherever a compliance with this call was refused the articles required were to be impressed it was a painful alternative yet nothing else could save the army from dissolution or starving washington charged his officers to act with as much tenderness as possible graduating the exaction according to the stock of each individual so that no family should be deprived of what was necessary to its subsistence to the honor of the magistrates and the people of jersey washington testifies that his requisitions were punctually complied with and in many counties exceeded  as the winter advanced the cold increased in severity it was the most intense ever remembered in the country the great bay of new york was frozen over no supplies could come to the city by water provisions grew scanty and there was such lack of firewood that old transports were broken up and uninhabited wooden houses pulled down for fuel the safety of the city was endangered the shipsofwar immovably icebound in its harbor no longer gave it protection the insular security of the place was at an end an army with its heaviest artillery and baggage might cross the hudson on the ice  washington was aware of the opportunity which offered itself for a signal coup de main but was not in a condition to profit by it his troops hutted among the heights of morristown were half fed half clothed and inferior in number to the garrison of new york he was destitute of funds necessary to fit them for the enterprise and the quartermaster could not furnish means of transportation  still in the frozen condition of the bay and rivers some minor blow might be attempted sufficient to rouse and cheer the spirits of the people with this view having ascertained that the ice formed a bridge across the strait between the jersey shore and staten island he projected a descent upon the latter by lord stirling with twentyfive hundred men to surprise and capture a british force of ten or twelve hundred his lordship crossed on the night of the 14th of january from de harts point to the island his approach was discovered the troops took refuge in the works which were too strongly situated to be attacked a channel remaining open through the ice across the bay a boat was despatched to new york for reinforcements the projected surprise having thus proved a complete failure and his own situation becoming hazardous lord stirling recrossed to the jersey shore with a number of prisoners whom he had captured  by way of retort knyphausen on the 25th of january sent out two detachments to harass the american outposts one crossed to paulus hook and being joined by part of the garrison of that post pushed on to newark surprised and captured a company stationed there set fire to the academy and returned without loss the other detachment consisting of one hundred dragoons and between three and four hundred infantry under lieutenantcolonel boskirk crossed from staten island to tremblys point surprised the picketguard at elizabethtown and captured two majors two captains and fortytwo privates this likewise was effected without loss the disgraceful part of the expedition was the burning of the town house a church and a private residence and the plundering of the inhabitants the church destroyed was a presbyterian place of worship and its pastor the rev james caldwell had rendered himself an especial object of hostility to both briton and tory his church had at times served as hospital to the american soldier or shelter to the hastily assembled militia its bell was the tocsin of alarm from its pulpit he had many a time stirred up the patriotism of his countrymen by his ardent eloquent and pathetic appeals his popularity in the army and among the jersey people was unbounded  another noted maraud during knyphausens military sway was in the lower part of westchester county in a hilly region lying between the british and american lines which had been the scene of part of the past years campaign in this region about twenty miles from the british outposts and not far from white plains the americans had established a post of three hundred men at a stone building commonly known as youngs house from the name of its owner it commanded a road which passed from north to south down along the narrow but fertile valley of the sawmill river on this road the garrison of youngs house kept a vigilant eye to intercept the convoys of cattle and provisions which had been collected or plundered by the enemy and which passed down this valley toward new york this post had long been an annoyance to the enemy but its distance from the british lines had hitherto saved it from attack the country now was covered with snow troops could be rapidly transported on sleighs and it was determined that youngs house should be surprised and this rebel nest broken up  on the evening of the 2d of february an expedition set out for the purpose from kings bridge led by lieutenantcolonel norton and consisting of four flank companies of guards two companies of hessians and a party of yagers all in sleighs beside a body of yager cavalry and a number of mounted westchester refugees with two threepounders the snow being newly fallen was deep the sleighs broke their way through it with difficulty the troops at length abandoned them and pushed forward on foot the cannon were left behind for the same reason it was a weary tramp the sun rose while they were yet seven miles from youngs house to surprise the post was out of the question still they kept on before they could reach the house the country had taken the alarm and the westchester yeomanry had armed themselves and were hastening to aid the garrison the british light infantry and grenadiers invested the mansion the cavalry posted themselves on a neighboring eminence to prevent retreat or reinforcement and the house was assailed it made a brave resistance and was aided by some of the yeomanry stationed in an adjacent orchard the garrison however was overpowered numbers were killed and ninety taken prisoners the house was sacked and set in flames  the most irksome duty that washington had to perform during this winters encampment at morristown regarded general arnold and his military government of philadelphia in 1778 to explain it requires a glance back to that period  at the time of entering upon this command arnolds accounts with government were yet unsettled the committee appointed by congress at his own request to examine them having considered some of his charges dubious and others exorbitant the command of philadelphia at this time was a delicate and difficult one and required to be exercised with extreme circumspection the boundaries between the powers vested in the military commander and those inherent in the state government were ill defined disaffection to the american cause prevailed both among the permanent and casual residents and required to be held in check with firmness but toleration by a resolve of congress no goods wares or merchandise were to be removed transferred or sold until the ownership of them could be ascertained by a joint committee of congress and of the council of pennsylvania any public stores belonging to the enemy were to be seized and converted to the use of the army washington in his letter of instructions left it to arnolds discretion to adopt such measures as should appear to him most effectual and least offensive in executing this resolve of congress in which he was to be aided by an assistant quartermastergeneral subject to his directions  one of arnolds first measures was to issue a proclamation enforcing the resolve of congress in so doing he was countenanced by leading personages of philadelphia and the proclamation was drafted by general joseph reed the measure excited great dissatisfaction and circumstances attending the enforcement of it gave rise to scandal former instances of a mercenary spirit made arnold liable to suspicions and it was alleged that while by the proclamation he shut up the stores and shops so that even the officers of the army could not procure necessary articles of merchandise he was privately making large purchases for his own enrichment  his style of living gave point to this scandal he occupied one of the finest houses in the city set up a splendid establishment had his carriage and four horses and a train of domestics gave expensive entertainments and indulged in a luxury and parade which were condemned as little befitting a republican general ostentatious prodigality in fact was arnolds besetting sin in the exercise of his military functions he had become involved in disputes with the president wharton and executive council of pennsylvania and by his conduct which was deemed arbitrary and arrogant had drawn upon himself the hostility of that body which became stern and unsparing censors of his conduct  he had not been many weeks in philadelphia before he became attached to one of its reigning belles miss margaret shippen daughter of mr edward shippen in after years chief justice of pennsylvania her family were not considered well affected to the american cause the young lady herself during the occupation of the city by the enemy had been a toast among the british officers party feeling at that time ran high in philadelphia on local subjects connected with the charge of the state government arnolds connection with the shippen family increased his disfavor with the president and executive council who were whigs to a man  in the beginning of december general reed became president of the executive council of pennsylvania and under his administration the ripening hostility to arnold was brought to a crisis his public conduct during arnolds absence at washingtons camp on the raritan was discussed in the executive council of pennsylvania and it was resolved unanimously that the course of his military command in the city had been in many respects oppressive unworthy of his rank and station and highly discouraging to the liberties and interests of america and disrespectful to the supreme executive authority of the state as he was an officer of the united states the complaints and grievances of pennsylvania were set forth by the executive council in eight charges and forwarded to congress accompanied by documents and a letter from president reed  information of these facts with a printed copy of the charges reached arnold at washingtons camp on the following day he issued an address to the public recalling his faithful services of nearly four years and inveighing against the proceedings of the president and council who not content with injuring him in a cruel and unprecedented manner with congress had ordered copies of their charges to be printed and dispersed throughout the several states for the purpose of prejudicing the public mind against him while the matter was yet in suspense in conclusion arnold informed the public that he had requested congress to direct a courtmartial to inquire into his conduct and trusted his countrymen would suspend their judgment in the matter until he should have an opportunity of being heard  on the 16th of february arnolds appeal to congress was referred to the committee which had under consideration the letter of president reed and its accompanying documents and it was charged to make a report with all convenient despatch arnold in the course of january had obtained permission from washington to resign the command of philadelphia but deferred to act upon it until the charges against him should be examined about the middle of march the committee brought in a report exculpating him from all criminality in the matters charged against him as soon as the report was brought in he considered his name vindicated and resigned  whatever exultation he may have felt was shortlived congress did not call up and act upon the report as in justice to him they should have done whether to sanction it or not but referred the subject anew to a joint committee of their body and the assembly and council of pennsylvania the report of the joint committee brought up animated discussions in congress several resolutions recommended by the committee were merely of a formal nature and intended to soothe the wounded sensibilities of pennsylvania these were passed without dissent but it was contended that certain charges advanced by the executive council of that state were only cognizable by a courtmartial and after a warm debate it was resolved april 3d by a large majority that the commanderinchief should appoint such a court for the consideration of them  arnold inveighed bitterly against the injustice of subjecting him to a trial before a military tribunal for alleged offences of which he had been acquitted by the committee of congress he was sacrificed he said to avoid a breach with pennsylvania in a letter to washington he charged it all to the hostility of president reed who he affirmed had by his address kept the affair in suspense for two months and at last obtained the resolution of congress directing the courtmartial he urged washington to appoint a speedy day for the trial that he might not linger under the odium of an unjust public accusation  it was doubtless soothing to his irritated pride that the woman on whom he had placed his affections remained true to him for his marriage with miss shippen took place just five days after the mortifying vote of congress  washington sympathized with arnolds impatience and appointed the 1st of may for the trial but it was repeatedly postponed first at the request of the pennsylvania council to allow time for the arrival of witnesses from the south afterwards in consequence of threatening movements of the enemy which obliged every officer to be at his post arnold in the meantime continued to reside at philadelphia holding his commission in the army but filling no public office getting deeper and deeper in debt and becoming more and more unpopular for months he remained in this anxious and irritated state at length when the campaign was over and the army had gone into winterquarters the longdelayed courtmartial was assembled at morristown of the eight charges originally advanced against arnold by the pennsylvania council four only came under cognizance of the court of two of these he was entirely acquitted the remaining two were  first that while in the camp at valley forge he without the knowledge of the commanderinchief or the sanction of the state government had granted a written permission for a vessel belonging to disaffected persons to proceed from the port of philadelphia then in possession of the enemy to any port of the united states  second that availing himself of his official authority he had appropriated the public wagons of pennsylvania when called forth on a special emergency to the transportation of private property and that of persons who voluntarily remained with the enemy and were deemed disaffected to the interests and independence of america  in regard to the first of these charges arnold alleged that the person who applied for the protection of the vessel had taken the oath of allegiance to the state of pennsylvania required by the laws and that the intentions of that person and his associates with regard to the vessel and cargo appeared to be upright in regard to the second charge while it was proved that under his authority public wagons had been so used it was allowed in extenuation that they had been employed at private expense and without any design to defraud the public or impede the military service in regard to both charges nothing fraudulent on the part of arnold was proved but the transactions involved in the first were pronounced irregular and contrary to one of the articles of war and in the second imprudent and reprehensible considering the high station occupied by the general at the time and the court sentenced him to be reprimanded by the commanderinchief the sentence was confirmed by congress on the 12th of february 1780  the reprimand adjudged by the courtmartial was administered by washington with consummate delicacy the following were his words our profession is the chastest of all even the shadow of a fault tarnishes the lustre of our finest achievements the least inadvertence may rob us of the public favor so hard to be acquired i reprehend you for having forgotten that in proportion as you had rendered yourself formidable to our enemies you should have been guarded and temperate in your deportment towards your fellowcitizens exhibit anew those noble qualities which have placed you on the list of our most valued commanders i will myself furnish you as far as it may be in my power with opportunities of regaining the esteem of your country  a reprimand so mild and considerate accompanied by such high eulogiums and generous promises might have had a favorable effect upon arnold had he been in a different frame of mind but he had persuaded himself that the court would incline in his favor and acquit him altogether and he resented deeply a sentence which he protested against as unmerited his resentment was aggravated by delays in the settlement of his accounts as he depended upon the sums he claimed as due to him for the payment of debts by which he was harassed  in the month of march we find him intent on a new and adventurous project he had proposed to the board of admiralty an expedition requiring several shipsofwar and three or four hundred land troops offering to take command of it should it be carried into effect as his wounds still disabled him from duty on land washington who knew his abilities in either service was disposed to favor his proposition but the scheme fell through from the impossibility of sparing the requisite number of men from the army on the failure of the project he requested and obtained from washington leave of absence from the army for the summer there being he said little prospect of an active campaign and his wounds unfitting him for the field  the return of spring brought little alleviation to the sufferings of the army at morristown all means of supplying its wants or recruiting its ranks were paralyzed by the continued depreciation of the currency while washington saw his forces gradually diminishing his solicitude was intensely excited for the safety of the southern states the reader will recall the departure from new york in the latter part of december of the fleet of admiral arbuthnot with the army of sir henry clinton destined for the subjugation of south carolina  the voyage proved long and tempestuous the ships were dispersed several fell into the hands of the americans one ordnance vessel foundered most of the artillery horses and all those of the cavalry perished the scattered ships rejoined each other about the end of january at tybee bay on savannah river where those that had sustained damage were repaired as speedily as possible the loss of the cavalry horses was especially felt by sir henry there was a corps of two hundred and fifty dragoons on which he depended greatly in the kind of guerilla warfare he was likely to pursue in a country of forests and morasses lieutenantcolonel banastre tarleton who commanded them was one of those dogs of war which sir henry was prepared to let slip on emergencies to scour and maraud the country this bold dragoon so noted in southern warfare was about twentysix years of age of a swarthy complexion with small black piercing eyes he is described as being rather below the middle size squarebuilt and strong with large muscular legs landing from the fleet perfectly dismounted he repaired with his dragoons in some of the quartermasters boats to port royal island on the seaboard of south carolina to collect at that place from friends or enemies by money or by force all the horses belonging to the islands in the neighborhood  in the meantime the transports having on board a great part of the army sailed under convoy on the 10th of february from savannah to north edisto sound where the troops disembarked on the 11th on st johns island about thirty miles below charleston thence sir henry clinton set out for the banks of ashley river opposite to the city while a part of the fleet proceeded round by sea for the purpose of blockading the harbor the advance of sir henry was slow and cautious much time was consumed by him in fortifying intermediate ports to keep up a secure communication with the fleet he ordered from savannah all the troops that could be spared and wrote to knyphausen at new york for reinforcements from that place  general lincoln now in command at charleston took advantage of this slowness on the part of his assailant to extend and strengthen the works charleston stands at the end of an isthmus formed by the ashley and cooper rivers beyond the main works on the land side he cut a canal from one to the other of the swamps which border these rivers in advance of the canal were two rows of abatis and a double picketed ditch within the canal and between it and the main works were strong redoubts and batteries to open a flanking fire on any approaching column while an inclosed hornwork of masonry formed a kind of citadel a squadron commanded by commodore whipple and composed of nine vessels of war of various sizes the largest mounting fortyfour guns was to cooperate with forts moultrie and johnston and the various batteries in defence of the harbor they were to lie before the bar so as to command the entrance of it great reliance also was placed on the bar itself which it was thought no shipoftheline could pass  governor rutledge a man eminent for talents patriotism firmness and decision was clothed with dictatorial powers during the present crisis he called out the militia of the state and it was supposed they would duly obey the call large reinforcements of troops also were expected from the north under all these circumstances general lincoln yielded to the entreaties of the inhabitants and instead of remaining with his army in the open country as he had intended shut himself up with them in the place for its defence leaving merely his cavalry and two hundred light troops outside who were to hover about the enemy and prevent small parties from marauding  it was not until the 12th of march that sir henry clinton effected his tardy approach and took up a position on charleston neck a few miles above the town admiral arbuthnot soon showed an intention of introducing his ships into the harbor barricading their waists anchoring them in a situation where they might take advantage of the first favorable springtide and fixing buoys on the bar for their guidance commodore whipple had by this time ascertained by sounding that a wrong idea had prevailed of the depth of water in the harbor and that his ships could not anchor nearer than within three miles of the bar so that it would be impossible for him to defend the passage of it he quitted his station within it therefore after having destroyed a part of the enemys buoys and took a position where his ships might be abreast and form a crossfire with the batteries of fort moultrie where colonel pinckney commanded  washington was informed of these facts by letters from his former aidedecamp colonel laurens who was in charleston at the time the information caused anxious forebodings the impracticability of defending the bar i fear amounts to the loss of the town and garrison writes he in reply his solicitude for the safety of the south was increased by heaving of the embarkation at new york of two thousand five hundred british and hessian troops under lord rawdon reinforcements for sir henry clinton it seemed evident the enemy intended to push their operations with vigor at the south perhaps to make it the principal theatre of the war  gladly would washington have hastened to the south in person but at this moment his utmost vigilance was required to keep watch upon new york and maintain the security of the hudson the vital part of the confederacy the weak state of the american means of warfare in both quarters presented a choice of difficulties the south needed support could the north give it without exposing itself to ruin since the enemy by means of their ships could suddenly unite their forces and fall upon any point that they might consider weak such were the perplexities to which he was continually subjected in having with scanty means to provide for the security of a vast extent of country and with land forces merely to contend with an amphibious enemy  looking however as usual to the good of the whole union he determined to leave something at hazard in the middle states where the country was internally so strong and yield further succor to the southern states which had not equal military advantages with the consent of congress therefore he put the maryland line under marching orders together with the delaware regiment which acted with it and the first regiment of artillery the baron de kalb now at the head of the maryland division was instructed to conduct this detachment with all haste to the aid of general lincoln he might not arrive in time to prevent the fall of charleston but he might assist to arrest the progress of the enemy and save the carolinas     chapter liv discontents in the armyfall of charleston   we have cited the depreciation of the currency as a main cause of the difficulties and distresses of the army the troops were paid in paper money at its nominal value a memorial of the officers of the jersey line to the legislature of their state represented the depreciation to be so great that four months pay of a private soldier would not procure for his family a single bushel of wheat the pay of a colonel would not purchase oats for his horse and a common laborer or express rider could earn four times the pay in paper of an american officer  congress too in its exigencies being destitute of the power of levying taxes which vested in the state governments devolved upon those governments in their separate capacities the business of supporting the army this produced a great inequality in the condition of the troops according to the means and the degree of liberality of their respective states some states furnished their troops amply not only with clothing but with many comforts and conveniencies others were more contracted in their supplies while others left their troops almost destitute some of the states too undertook to make good to their troops the loss in their pay caused by the depreciation of the currency as this was not general it increased the inequality of condition  these and other defects in the military system were pressed by washington upon the attention of congress in a letter to the president in consequence it was proposed in congress to send a committee of three of its members to headquarters to consult with the commanderinchief and in conjunction with him to effect such reforms and changes in the various departments of the army as might be deemed necessary after a prolonged debate a committee of three was chosen by ballot it consisted of general schuyler and messrs john mathews and nathaniel peabody it was a great satisfaction to washington to have his old friend and coadjutor schuyler near him in this capacity in which he declared no man could be more useful  the committee on arriving at the camp found the disastrous state of affairs had not been exaggerated for five months the army had been unpaid every department was destitute of money or credit there were rarely provisions for six days in advance on some occasions the troops had been for several successive days without meat there was no forage the medical department had neither tea chocolate wine nor spirituous liquors of any kind  to soothe the discontents of the army and counteract the alarming effects of the depreciation of the currency congress now adopted the measure already observed by some of the states and engaged to make good to the continental and the independent troops the difference in the value of their pay caused by this depreciation and that all moneys or other articles heretofore received by them should be considered as advanced on account and comprehended at their just value in the final settlement  at this gloomy crisis came a letter from the marquis de lafayette dated april 27th announcing his arrival at boston washingtons eyes we are told were suffused with tears as he read this most welcome epistle he would immediately have sent a troop of horse to escort the marquis through the tory settlements between morristown and the hudson had he known the route he intended to take the latter however arrived safe at headquarters on the 12th of may where he was welcomed with acclamations for he was popular with both officers and soldiers washington folded him in his arms in a truly paternal embrace and they were soon closeted together to talk over the state of affairs when lafayette made known the result of his visit to france his generous efforts at court had been crowned with success and he brought the animating intelligence that a french fleet under the chevalier de ternay was to put to sea early in april bringing a body of troops under the count de rochambeau and might soon be expected on the coast to cooperate with the american forces this however he was at liberty to make known only to washington and congress remaining but a single day at headquarters he hastened on to the seat of government where he met the reception which his generous enthusiasm in the cause of american independence had so fully merited  within three days after the departure of the marquis from morristown washington in a letter to him gave his idea of the plan which it would be proper for the french fleet and army to pursue on their arrival upon the coast the reduction of new york he considered the first enterprise to be attempted by the cooperating forces the whole effective land force of the enemy he estimated at about eight thousand regulars and four thousand refugees with some militia on which no great dependence could be placed their naval force consisted of one seventyfour gun ship and three or four small frigates in this situation of affairs the french fleet might enter the harbor and gain possession of it without difficulty cut off its communications and with the cooperation of the american army oblige the city to capitulate he advised lafayette therefore to write to the french commanders urging them on their arrival on the coast to proceed with their land and naval forces with all expedition to sandy hook and there await further advices should they learn however that the expedition under sir henry clinton had returned from the south to new york they were to proceed to rhode island  general arnold was at this time in philadelphia and his connection with subsequent events requires a few words concerning his career daily becoming more perplexed he had again petitioned congress on the subject of his accounts the board of treasury had made a report far short of his wishes he had appealed and his appeal together with all the documents connected with the case was referred to a committee of three old doubts and difficulties continued there was no prospect of a speedy settlement he was in extremity in his extremity he applied to the french minister m de luzerne a generousspirited man representing the hardships of his case the ingratitude of his country the hostility he had experienced from pennsylvania his urgent private necessities and implored a loan equal to the amount of his debts intimating that the attachment and gratitude of an american general of his rank and influence would be of vast importance to france in the transactions likely to arise between the two countries m de luzerne in reply said that the league between france and america had for its basis a reciprocal interest and good will and that it could be fulfilled without intrigue or secret practices arnold retired from the interview a mortified and desperate man and writing to general schuyler who was about to visit the camp as one of the committee expressed a wish to rejoin the army and intimated that as his wounds made it painful for him to ride or walk the command of west point would best suit his present condition  in the meantime the army with which washington was to cooperate in the projected attack upon new york was so reduced by the departure of troops whose term had expired and the tardiness in furnishing recruits that it did not amount quite to four thousand rank and file fit for duty among these was a prevalent discontent their pay was five months in arrear if now paid it would be in continental currency without allowance for depreciation consequently almost worthless for present purposes  a long interval of scarcity and several days of actual famine brought matters to a crisis on the 25th of may in the dusk of the evening two regiments of the connecticut line assembled on their parade by beat of drum and declared their intention to march home bag and baggage or at best to gain subsistence at the point of the bayonet every argument and expostulation was used with the mutineers they were reminded of their past good conduct of the noble objects for which they were contending and of the future indemnifications promised by congress their answer was that their sufferings were too great to be allayed by promises in which they had little faith they wanted present relief it was with difficulty they could be prevailed upon to return to their huts indeed a few turned out a second time with their packs and were not to be pacified these were arrested and confined  in this alarming state of destitution washington looked round anxiously for bread for his famishing troops new york jersey pennsylvania and maryland were what he termed his flour country virginia was sufficiently tasked to supply the south new york by legislative coercion had already given all that she could spare from the subsistence of her inhabitants jersey was exhausted by the long residence of the army maryland had made great exertions and might still do something more and delaware might contribute handsomely in proportion to her extent but pennsylvania was now the chief dependence for that state was represented to be full of flour washingtons letter of the 16th of december to president reed had obtained temporary relief from that quarter he now wrote to him a second time and still more earnestly and sought to rouse president reed to extraordinary exertions this is a time writes he to hazard and to take a tone of energy and decision all parties but the disaffected will acquiesce in the necessity and give it their support he urges reed to press upon the legislature of pennsylvania the policy of investing its executive with plenipotentiary powers his letter procured relief for the army from the legislature and a resolve empowering the president and council during its recess to declare martial law should circumstances render it expedient  in like manner he endeavored to rouse the dormant fire of congress and impart to it his own indomitable energy certain i am writes he to a member of that body unless congress speak in a more decisive tone unless they are vested with powers by the several states competent to the purposes of war or assume them as matters of right and they and the states respectively act with more energy than they have hitherto done that our cause is lost we can no longer drudge on in the old way by illtiming the adoption of measures by delays in the execution of them or by unwarrantable jealousies we incur enormous expenses and derive no benefit from them one state will comply with a requisition of congress another neglects to do it a third executes it by halves and all differ either in the manner the matter or so much in point of time that we are always working uphill and while such a system as the present one or rather want of one prevails we shall ever be unable to apply our strength or resources to any advantage  at this juncture came official intelligence from the south to connect which with the general course of events requires a brief notice of the operations of sir henry clinton in that quarter  in the preceding chapter we left the british fleet under admiral arbuthnot preparing to force its way into the harbor of charleston several days elapsed before the ships were able by taking out their guns provisions and water and availing themselves of wind and tide to pass the bar they did so on the 20th of march with but slight opposition from several galleys commodore whipple then seeing the vast superiority of their force made a second retrograde move stationing some of his ships in cooper river and sinking the rest at its mouth so as to prevent the enemy from running up that river and cutting off communication with the country on the east the crews and heavy cannon were landed to aid in the defence of the town the reinforcements expected from the north were not yet arrived the militia of the state did not appear at governor rutledges command and other reliances were failing  at this time the reinforcements which sir henry clinton had ordered from savannah were marching toward the cambayee under brigadiergeneral patterson on his flanks moved major ferguson with a corps of riflemen and major cochrane with the infantry of the british legion two brave and enterprising officers it was a toilsome march through swamps and difficult passes being arrived in the neighborhood of port royal where tarleton had succeeded though indifferently in remounting his dragoons patterson sent orders to that officer to join him tarleton hastened to obey the order his arrival was timely the carolina militia having heard that all the british horses had perished at sea made an attack on the front of general pattersons force supposing it to be without cavalry to their surprise tarleton charged them with his dragoons routed them took several prisoners and what was more acceptable a number of horses  tarleton had soon afterwards to encounter a worthy antagonist in colonel william washington the same cavalry officer who had distinguished himself at trenton and was destined to distinguish himself still more in this southern campaign he is described as being six feet in height broad stout and corpulent bold in the field careless in the camp kind to his soldiers harassing to his enemies gay and goodhumored with an upright heart and a generous hand a universal favorite he was now at the head of a body of continental cavalry consisting of his own and blands lighthorse and pulaskis hussars a brush took place in the neighborhood of rantouls bridge colonel washington had the advantage took several prisoners and drove back the dragoons of the british legion but durst not pursue them for want of infantry  on the 7th of april brigadiergeneral woodford with seven hundred virginia troops after a forced march of five hundred miles in thirty days crossed from the east side of cooper river by the only passage now open and threw himself into charleston it was a timely reinforcement and joyfully welcomed for the garrison when in greatest force amounted to little more than two thousand regulars and one thousand north carolina militia  about the same time admiral arbuthnot in the roebuck passed sullivans island with a fresh southerly breeze at the head of a squadron of seven armed vessels and two transports colonel pinckney opened a heavy cannonade from the batteries of fort moultrie the ships thundered in reply and clouds of smoke were raised under the cover of which they slipped by with no greater loss than twentyseven men killed and wounded a storeship which followed the squadron ran aground was set on fire and abandoned and subsequently blew up the ships took a position near fort johnston just without the range of the shot from the american batteries after the passage of the ships colonel pinckney and a part of the garrison withdrew from fort moultrie  the enemy had by this time completed his first parallel and the town being almost entirely invested by sea and land received a joint summons from the british general and admiral to surrender sixty days have passed writes lincoln in reply since it has been known that your intentions against this town were hostile in which time has been afforded to abandon it but duty and inclination point to the propriety of supporting it to the last extremity  the british batteries were now opened the siege was carried on deliberately by regular parallels and on a scale of magnitude scarcely warranted by the moderate strength of the place a great object with the besieged was to keep open the channel of communication with the country by the cooper river the last that remained by which they could receive reinforcements and supplies or could retreat if necessary for this purpose governor rutledge leaving the town in the care of lieutenantgovernor gadsden and one half of the executive council set off with the other half and endeavored to rouse the militia between the cooper and santee rivers his success was extremely limited two militia posts were established by him one between these rivers the other at a ferry on the santee some regular troops also had been detached by lincoln to throw up works about nine miles above the town on the wando a branch of cooper river and at lemprieres point and brigadiergeneral huger1 with a force of militia and continental cavalry including those of colonel william washington was stationed at monks corner about thirty miles above charleston to guard the passes at the head waters of cooper river  footnote 1 pronounced hugeeof french huguenot descent  sir henry clinton when proceeding with his second parallel detached lieutenantcolonel webster with fourteen hundred men to break up these posts the most distant one was that of hugers cavalry at monks corner the surprisal of this was entrusted to tarleton who with his dragoons was in websters advanced guard he was to be seconded by major patrick ferguson with his riflemen ferguson was a fit associate for tarleton in hardy scrambling partisan enterprise equally intrepid and determined but cooler and more open to impulses of humanity  on the evening of the 13th of april tarleton moved with the van towards monks corner a night march had been judged the most advisable it was made in profound silence and by unfrequented roads a few dollars gained the services of a negro as a guide the surprisal of general hugers camp was complete several officers and men who attempted to defend themselves were killed or wounded general huger colonel washington with many others officers and men escaped in the darkness to the neighboring swamps one hundred officers dragoons and hussars were taken with about four hundred horses and near fifty wagons laden with arms clothing and ammunition biggins bridge on cooper river was likewise secured and the way opened for colonel webster to advance nearly to the head of the passes in such a manner as to shut up charleston entirely  the american cavalry had gradually reassembled on the north of the santee under colonel white of new jersey where they were joined by some militia infantry and by colonel william washington with such of his dragoons as had escaped at monks corner cornwallis had committed the country between cooper and wando rivers to tarletons charge with orders to be continually on the move with the cavalry and infantry of the legion to watch over the landingplaces obtain intelligence from the town the santee river and the back country and to burn such stores as might fall into his hands rather than risk their being retaken by the enemy hearing of the fortuitous assemblage of american troops tarleton came suddenly upon them by surprise at laneaus ferry it was one of his bloody exploits five officers and thirtysix men were killed and wounded and seven officers and six dragoons taken with horses arms and equipments colonels white washington and jamieson with other officers and men threw themselves in the river and escaped by swimming while some who followed their example perished  the arrival of a reinforcement of three thousand men from new york enabled sir henry clinton to throw a powerful detachment under lord cornwallis to the east of cooper river to complete the investment of the town and cut off all retreat fort moultrie surrendered the batteries of the third parallel were opened upon the town this fire was kept up for two days the besiegers crossed the canal pushed a double sap to the inside of the abatis and prepared to make an assault by sea and land all hopes of successful defence were at an end the works were in ruins the guns almost all dismounted the garrison exhausted with fatigue the provisions nearly consumed the inhabitants dreading the horrors of an assault joined in a petition to general lincoln and prevailed upon him to offer a surrender on terms which had already been offered and rejected these terms were still granted and the capitulation was signed on the 12th of may the garrison were allowed some of the honors of war  the loss of the british in the siege was seventysix killed and one hundred and eightynine wounded that of the americans nearly the same the prisoners taken by the enemy exclusive of the sailors amounted to five thousand six hundred and eighteen men comprising every male adult in the city the continental troops did not exceed two thousand five hundred of whom were in the hospital the rest were citizens and militia  sir henry clinton considered the fall of charleston decisive of the fate of south carolina to complete the subjugation of the country he planned three expeditions into the interior one under lieutenantcolonel brown was to move up the savannah river to augusta on the borders of georgia another under lieutenantcolonel cruger was to proceed up the southwest side of the santee river to the district of ninetysix2 a fertile and salubrious region between the savannah and the saluda rivers while a third under cornwallis was to cross the santee march up the northeast bank and strike at a corps of troops under colonel buford which were retreating to north carolina with artillery and a number of wagons laden with arms ammunition and clothing  footnote 2 so called in early times from being ninetysix miles from the principal town of the cherokee nation  colonel buford in fact had arrived too late for the relief of charleston and was now making a retrograde move he had come on with three hundred and eighty troops of the virginia line and two field pieces and had been joined by colonel washington with a few of his cavalry that had survived the surprisal by tarleton as buford was moving with celerity and had the advantage of distance cornwallis detached tarleton in pursuit of him with one hundred and seventy dragoons a hundred mounted infantry and a threepounder the bold partisan pushed forward with his usual ardor and rapidity and coming upon bufords rearguard captured a sergeant and four dragoons buford hastily drew up his men in order of battle in an open wood on the right of the road his artillery and wagons which were in the advance escorted by part of his infantry were ordered to continue on their march  there appears to have been some confusion on the part of the americans and they had an impetuous foe to deal with before they were well prepared for action they were attacked in front and on both flanks by cavalry and mounted infantry the american battalion was broken most of the men threw down their arms and begged for quarter but were cut down without mercy one hundred and thirteen were slain on the spot and one hundred and fifty so mangled and maimed that they could not be removed colonel buford and a few of the cavalry escaped as did about a hundred of the infantry who were with the baggage in the advance fifty prisoners were all that were in a condition to be carried off by tarleton as trophies of this butchery  the two other detachments which had been sent out by clinton met with nothing but submission the people in general considering resistance hopeless accepted the proffered protection and conformed to its humiliating terms sir henry now persuaded himself that south carolina was subdued and proceeded to station garrisons in various parts to maintain it in subjection in the fullness of his confidence he issued a proclamation on the 3d of june discharging all the military prisoners from their paroles after the 20th of the month excepting those captured in fort moultrie and charleston all thus released from their parole were reinstated in the rights and duties of british subjects all were to be ready to take up arms at a moments notice those who had families were to form a militia for home defence those who had none were to serve with the royal forces all who should neglect to return to their allegiance or should refuse to take up arms against the independence of their country were to be considered as rebels and treated accordingly  having struck a blow which as he conceived was to insure the subjugation of the south sir henry embarked for new york on the 5th of june with a part of his forces leaving the residue under the command of lord cornwallis who was to carry the war into north carolina and thence into virginia     chapter lv marauds in the jerseysthe french fleet at newport   a handbill published by the british authorities in new york reached washingtons camp on the 1st of june and made known the surrender of charleston with this intelligence came reports of a large fleet entering sandy hook which was supposed to be the return of sir henry with the whole or part of his force the report proved to be erroneous but on the 6th of june came a new alarm the enemy it was said were actually landing in force at elizabethtown point to carry fire and sword into the jerseys it was even so knyphausen through spies and emissaries had received exaggerated accounts of the recent outbreak in washingtons camp and of the general discontent among the people of new jersey and was persuaded that a sudden show of military protection following up the news of the capture of charleston would produce a general desertion among washingtons troops and rally back the inhabitants of the jerseys to their allegiance to the crown  in this belief he projected a descent into the jerseys with about five thousand men and some light artillery who were to cross in divisions in the night of the 5th of june from staten island to elizabethtown point the first division led by brigadiergeneral sterling actually landed before dawn of the 6th and advanced as silently as possible the heavy and measured tramp of the troops however caught the ear of an american sentinel stationed at a fork where the roads from the old and new point joined he challenged the dimly descried mass as it approached and receiving no answer fired into it that shot wounded general sterling in the thigh and ultimately proved mortal the wounded general was carried back and knyphausen took his place  this delayed the march until sunrise and gave time for the troops of the jersey line under colonel elias dayton stationed in elizabethtown to assemble they were too weak in numbers however to withstand the enemy but retreated in good order skirmishing occasionally signal guns and signal fires were rousing the country the militia and yeomanry armed themselves with such weapons as were at hand and hastened to their alarm posts the enemy took the old road by what was called galloping hill towards the village of connecticut farms fired upon from behind walls and thickets by the hasty levies of the country  at connecticut farms the retreating troops under dayton fell in with the jersey brigade under general maxwell and a few militia joining them the americans were enabled to make some stand and even to hold the enemy in check the latter however brought up several field pieces and being reinforced by a second division which had crossed from staten island some time after the first compelled the americans again to retreat some of the enemy exasperated at the unexpected opposition they had met with throughout their march and pretending that the inhabitants of this village had fired upon them from their windows began to pillage and set fire to the houses1  footnote 1 the wife of the rev james caldwell already alluded to was in the village at the time and while sitting on the side of a bed holding a child by the hand a musket was discharged in at the window and the ball striking her in the breast she fell dead on the floor  in the meantime knyphausen was pressing on with his main force towards morristown the booming of alarm guns had roused the country every valley was pouring out its yeomanry two thousand were said to be already in arms below the mountains within half a mile of springfield knyphausen halted to reconnoitre that village through which passes the road to springfield had been made the american rallyingpoint it stands at the foot of what are called the short hills on the west side of rahway river which runs in front of it on the bank of the river general maxwells jersey brigade and the militia of the neighborhood were drawn up to dispute the passage washington had arrived and taken his position that afternoon prepared to withstand an encounter though not to seek one all night his camp fires lighted up the short hills and he remained on the alert expecting to be assailed in the morning but in the morning no enemy was to be seen knyphausen had experienced enough to convince him that he had been completely misinformed as to the disposition of the jersey people and of the army disappointed as to the main objects of his enterprise he had retreated under cover of the night  on the 17th of june the fleet from the south actually arrived in the bay of new york and sir henry clinton landed his troops on staten island but almost immediately reembarked them as if meditating an expedition up the river fearing for the safety of west point washington set off on the 21st june with the main body of his troops towards pompton while general greene with maxwell and starks brigades lees dragoons and the militia of the neighborhood remained encamped on the short hills to cover the country and protect the stores at morristown  washingtons movements were slow and wary unwilling to be far from greene until better informed of the designs of the enemy at rockaway bridge about eleven miles beyond morristown he received word on the 23d that the enemy were advancing from elizabethtown against springfield supposing the military depot at morristown to be their ultimate object he detached a brigade to the assistance of greene and fell back five or six miles so as to be in supporting distance of him  the reembarkation of the troops at staten island had in fact been a stratagem of sir henry clinton to divert the attention of washington and enable knyphausen to carry out the enterprise which had hitherto hung fire no sooner did the latter ascertain that the american commanderinchief had moved off with his main force towards the highlands than he sallied from elizabethtown five thousand strong with a large body of cavalry and fifteen or twenty pieces of artillery hoping not merely to destroy the public stores at morristown but to get possession of those difficult hills and defiles among which washingtons army had been so securely posted and which constituted the strength of that part of the country  it was early on the morning of the 23d that knyphausen pushed forward toward springfield beside the main road which passes directly through the village toward morristown there is another north of it called the vauxhall road crossing several small streams the confluence of which forms the rahway these two roads unite beyond the village in the principal pass of the short hills the enemys troops advanced rapidly in two compact columns the right one by the vauxhall road the other by the main or direct road general greene was stationed among the short hills about a mile above the town his troops were distributed at various posts for there were many passes to guard  at five oclock in the morning signalguns gave notice of the approach of the enemy the drums beat to arms throughout the camp the troops were hastily called in from their posts among the mountain passes and preparations were made to defend the village major lee with his dragoons and a picketguard was posted on the vauxhall road to check the right column of the enemy in its advance colonel dayton with his regiment of new jersey militia was to check the left column on the main road colonel angel of rhode island with about two hundred picked men and a piece of artillery was to defend a bridge over the rahway a little west of the town colonel shreve stationed with his regiment at a second bridge over a branch of the rahway east of the town was to cover if necessary the retreat of colonel angel those parts of maxwell and starks brigades which were not thus detached were drawn up on high grounds in the rear of the town having the militia on their flanks  there was some sharp fighting at a bridge on the vauxhall road where major lee with his dragoons and picketguard held the right column at bay a part of the column however forded the stream above the bridge gained a commanding position and obliged lee to retire the left column met with similar opposition from dayton and his jersey regiment the severest fighting of the day was at the bridge over the rahway for upwards of half an hour colonel angel defended it with his handful of men against a vastly superior force onefourth of his men were either killed or disabled the loss of the enemy was still more severe angel was at length compelled to retire he did so in good order carrying off his wounded and making his way through the village to the bridge beyond it here his retreat was bravely covered by colonel shreve but he too was obliged to give way before the overwhelming force of the enemy and join the brigades of maxwell and stark upon the hill  general greene finding his front too much extended for his small force and that he was in danger of being outflanked on the left by the column pressing forward on the vauxhall road took post with his main body on the first range of hills where the roads were brought near to a point and passed between him and the height occupied by stark and maxwell he then threw out a detachment which checked the further advance of the right column of the enemy along the vauxhall road and secured that pass through the short hills feeling himself now strongly posted he awaited with confidence the expected attempt of the enemy to gain the height no such attempt was made the resistance already experienced especially at the bridge and the sight of militia gathering from various points dampened the ardor of the hostile commander he saw that should he persist in pushing for morristown he would have to fight his way through a country abounding with difficult passes every one of which would be obstinately disputed and that the enterprise even if successful might cost too much beside taking him too far from new york at a time when a french armament might be expected  before the brigade detached by washington arrived at the scene of action therefore the enemy had retreated previous to their retreat they wreaked upon springfield the same vengeance they had inflicted on connecticut farms the whole village excepting four houses was reduced to ashes their second retreat was equally ignoble with their first they were pursued and harassed the whole way to elizabethtown by light scouting parties and by the militia and yeomanry of the country exasperated by the sight of the burning village lee too came upon their rearguard with his dragoons captured a quantity of stores abandoned by them in the hurry of retreat and made prisoners of several refugees it was sunset when the enemy reached elizabethtown during the night they passed over to staten island by their bridge of boats by six oclock in the morning all had crossed and the bridge had been removedand the state of new jersey so long harassed by the campaignings of either army was finally evacuated by the enemy  apprehensive that the next move of the enemy would be up the hudson washington resumed his measures for the security of west point moving towards the highlands in the latter part of june circumstances soon convinced him that the enemy had no present intention of attacking that fortress but merely menaced him at various points to retard his operations and oblige him to call out the militia thereby interrupting agriculture distressing the country and rendering his cause unpopular having therefore caused the military stores in the jerseys to be removed to more remote and secure places he countermanded by letter the militia which were marching to camp from connecticut and massachusetts  he now exerted himself to the utmost to procure from the different state legislatures their quotas and supplies for the regular army the desired relief however had to be effected through the ramifications of general and state governments and their committees the operations were tardy and unproductive liberal contributions were made by individuals a bank was established by the inhabitants of philadelphia to facilitate the supplies of the army and an association of ladies of that city raised by subscription between seven and eight thousand dollars which were put at the disposition of washington  the capture of general lincoln at charleston had left the southern department without a commanderinchief as there were likely to be important military operations in that quarter washington had intended to recommend general greene for the appointment he was an officer on whose abilities discretion and disinterested patriotism he had the fullest reliance and whom he had always found thoroughly disposed to act in unison with him in his general plan of carrying on the war congress however with unbecoming precipitancy gave that important command to general gates june 13th without waiting to consult washingtons views or wishes  on the 10th of july a french fleet under the chevalier de ternay arrived at newport in rhode island it was composed of seven shipsoftheline two frigates and two bombs and convoyed transports on board of which were upwards of five thousand troops this was the first division of the forces promised by france of which lafayette had spoken the second division had been detained at brest for want of transports but might soon be expected the count de rochambeau lieutenantgeneral of the royal armies was commanderinchief of this auxiliary force he was a veteran fiftyfive years of age who had early distinguished himself when colonel of the regiment of auvergne and had gained laurels in various battles another officer of rank and distinction in this force was majorgeneral the marquis de chastellux a friend and relative of lafayette but much his senior being now fortysix years of age he was not only a soldier but a man of letters and one familiar with courts as well as camps  the instructions of the french ministry to the count de rochambeau placed him entirely under the command of general washington the french troops were to be considered as auxiliaries and as such were to take the left of the american troops and in all cases of ceremony to yield them the preference this considerate arrangement was intended to prevent the recurrence of those questions of rank and etiquette which had heretofore disturbed the combined service  washington in general orders congratulated the army on the arrival of this timely and generous succor which he hailed as a new tie between france and america anticipating that the only contention between the two armies would be to excel each other in good offices and in the display of every military virtue the american cockade had hitherto been black that of the french was white he recommended to his officers a cockade of black and white intermingled in compliment to their allies and as a symbol of friendship and union  his joy at this important reinforcement was dashed by the mortifying reflection that he was still unprovided with the troops and military means requisite for the combined operations meditated still he took upon himself the responsibility of immediate action and forthwith despatched lafayette to have an interview with the french commanders explain the circumstances of the case and concert plans for the proposed attack upon new york the arrival however of the british admiral graves at new york on the 13th of july with six shipsoftheline gave the enemy such a superiority of naval force that the design on new york was postponed until the second french division should make its appearance or a squadron under the count de guichen which was expected from the west indies  in the meantime sir henry clinton who had information of all the plans and movements of the allies determined to forestall the meditated attack upon new york by beating up the french quarters on rhode island this he was to do in person at the head of six thousand men aided by admiral arbuthnot with his fleet sir henry accordingly proceeded with his troops to throgs neck on the sound there to embark on board of transports which arbuthnot was to provide no sooner did washington learn that so large a force had left new york than he crossed the hudson to peekskill and prepared to move towards kings bridge with the main body of his troops which had recently been reinforced his intention was either to oblige sir henry to abandon his project against rhode island or to strike a blow at new york during his absence  the expedition of sir henry was delayed by the tardy arrival of transports in the meantime he heard of the sudden move of washington and learned moreover that the position of the french at newport had been strengthened by the militia from the neighboring country these tidings disconcerted his plans he left admiral arbuthnot to proceed with his squadron to newport blockade the french fleet and endeavor to intercept the second division supposed to be on its way while he with his troops hastened back to new york in consequence of their return washington again withdrew his forces to the west side of the hudson first establishing a post and throwing up small works at dobbs ferry about ten miles above kings bridge  arnold now received the important command which he had so earnestly coveted it included the fortress at west point and the posts from fishkill to kings ferry together with the corps of infantry and cavalry advanced toward the enemys line on the east side of the river washington took post at orangetown or tappan on the borders of the jerseys and opposite to dobbs ferry to be at hand for any attempt upon new york the execution of this cherished design however was again postponed by intelligence that the second division of the french reinforcements was blockaded in the harbor of brest by the british washington still had hopes that it might be carried into effect by the aid of the squadron of the count de guichen from the west indies or of a fleet from cadiz  at this juncture a derangement took place in the quartermastergenerals department of which general greene was the head the reorganization of this department had long been in agitation a system had been digested by washington schuyler and greene adapted as they thought to the actual situation of the country greene had offered should it be adopted to continue in the discharge of the duties of the department without any extra emolument other than would cover the expenses of his family congress devised a different scheme he considered it incapable of execution and likely to be attended with calamitous and disgraceful results he therefore tendered his resignation the tone and manner assumed by general greene in offering his resignation were deeply offensive to congress his resignation was promptly accepted and colonel pickering appointed to succeed him the commissariat was equally in a state of derangement at this very juncture writes washington aug 20th i am reduced to the painful alternative either of dismissing a part of the militia now assembling or of letting them come forward to starve which it will be extremely difficult for the troops already in the field to avoid every days experience proves more and more that the present mode of supplies is the most uncertain expensive and injurious that could be devised it is impossible for us to form any calculations of what we are to expect and consequently to concert any plans for future execution the anxiety of washington at this moment of embarrassment was heightened by the receipt of disastrous intelligence from the south     chapter lvi battle of camden   lord cornwallis when left in military command at the south by sir henry clinton was charged it will be recollected with the invasion of north carolina it was an enterprise in which much difficulty was to be apprehended both from the character of the people and the country the original settlers were from various parts most of them men who had experienced political or religious oppression and had brought with them a quick sensibility to wrong a stern appreciation of their rights and an indomitable spirit of freedom and independence it was this spirit which gave rise to the confederacy called the regulation formed to withstand the abuses of power and the first blood shed in our country in resistance to arbitrary taxation was at almance in this province in a conflict between the regulators and governor tryon above all it should never be forgotten that at mecklenburg in the heart of north carolina was fulminated the first declaration of independence of the british crown upwards of a year before like declaration by congress  the physical difficulties arising from the nature of the country consisted in its mountain fastnesses in the northwestern part its vast forests its sterile tracts its long rivers destitute of bridges and which though fordable in fair weather were liable to be swollen by sudden storms and freshets and rendered deep turbulent and impassable these rivers in fact which rushed down from the mountain but wound sluggishly through the plains were the military strength of the country as we shall have frequent occasion to show in the course of our narrative  lord cornwallis forbore to attempt the invasion of north carolina until the summer heats should be over and the harvests gathered in in the meantime he disposed of his troops in cantonments to cover the frontiers of south carolina and georgia and maintain their internal quiet the command of the frontiers was given by him to lord rawdon who made camden his principal post this town the capital of kershaw district a fertile fruitful country was situated on the east bank of the wateree river on the road leading to north carolina it was to be the grand military depot for the projected campaign  the proclamation of sir henry clinton putting an end to all neutrality and the rigorous penalties and persecutions with which all infractions of its terms were punished had for a time quelled the spirit of the country by degrees however the dread of british power gave way to impatience of british exactions symptoms of revolt manifested themselves in various parts they were encouraged by intelligence that de kalb sent by washington was advancing through north carolina at the head of two thousand men and that the militia of that state and of virginia were joining his standard this was soon followed by tidings that gates the conqueror of burgoyne was on his way to take command of the southern forces  the prospect of such aid from the north reanimated the southern patriots one of the most eminent of these was thomas sumter whom the carolinians had surnamed the game cock he was now between forty and fifty years of age brave hardy and vigorous he had seen service against the indians and in the french war and had held the rank of lieutenantcolonel in the continental line after the fall of charleston he had sought refuge with his family in one of the open savannahs that lie concealed amid the swamps with which the lower part of south carolina abounds in one of his temporary absences his retreat had been invaded his house burnt to the ground and his wife and children driven forth without shelter private injury had thus been added to the incentives of patriotism emerging from his hidingplace he had thrown himself among a handful of his fellowsufferers who had taken refuge in north carolina they chose him at once as a leader and resolved on a desperate struggle for the deliverance of their native state destitute of regular weapons they forged rude substitutes out of the implements of husbandry old millsaws were converted into broadswords knives at the ends of poles served for lances while the country housewives gladly gave up their pewter dishes and other utensils to be melted down and cast into bullets for such as had firearms  when sumter led this gallant band of exiles over the border they did not amount in number to two hundred yet with these he attacked and routed a wellarmed body of british troops and tories the terror of the frontier his followers supplied themselves with weapons from the slain in a little while his band was augmented by recruits parties of militia also recently embodied under the compelling measures of cornwallis deserted to the patriot standard thus reinforced to the amount of six hundred men he made on the 30th of july a spirited attack on the british post at rocky mount near the catawba but was repulsed a more successful attack was made by him eight days afterwards on another post at hanging rock  the advance of de kalb with reinforcements from the north had been retarded by various difficulties the most important of which was want of provisions this had been especially the case he said since his arrival in north carolina the legislative or executive power he complained gave him no assistance nor could he obtain supplies from the people but by military force there was no flour in the camp nor were dispositions made to furnish any his troops were reduced for a time to short allowance and at length on the 6th of july brought to a positive halt at deep river the north carolina militia under general caswell were already in the field on the road to camden beyond the pedee river he was anxious to form a junction with them but a wide and sterile region lay between him and them difficult to be traversed unless magazines were established in advance or he were supplied with provisions to take with him for three weeks he remained in this encampment foraging an exhausted country for a meagre subsistence and was thinking of deviating to the right and seeking the fertile counties of mecklenburg and rowan when on the 25th of july general gates arrived at the camp  gates approved of de kalbs standing orders but at the first review of the troops to the great astonishment of the baron gave orders for them to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moments warning it was evident he meant to signalize himself by celerity of movement in contrast with protracted delays it was in vain the destitute situation of the troops was represented to him and that they had not a days provision in advance his reply was that wagons laden with supplies were coming on and would overtake them in two days  on the 27th he actually put the army in motion over the buffalo ford on the direct road to camden colonel williams the adjutantgeneral of de kalb warned him of the sterile nature of that route and recommended a more circuitous one further north which passed through the abundant county of mecklenburg gates persisted in taking the direct route which proved all that had been represented it led through a region of pine barrens sand hills and swamps with few human habitations and those mostly deserted the supplies of which he had spoken never overtook him his army had to subsist itself on lean cattle roaming almost wild in the woods and to supply the want of bread with green indian corn unripe apples and peaches the consequence was a distressing prevalence of dysentery  having crossed the pedee river on the 3d of august the army was joined by a handful of brave virginia regulars under lieutenantcolonel porterfield who had been wandering about the country since the disaster of charleston and on the 7th the muchdesired junction took place with the north carolina militia on the 13th they encamped at rugeleys mills otherwise called clermont about twelve miles from camden and on the following day were reinforced by a brigade of seven hundred virginia militia under general stephens  on the approach of gates lord rawdon had concentrated his forces at camden the post was flanked by the wateree river and pinetree creek and strengthened with redoubts lord cornwallis had hastened hither from charleston on learning that affairs in this quarter were drawing to a crisis and had arrived here on the 13th the british effective force thus collected was something more than two thousand including officers about five hundred were militia and tory refugees from north carolina the forces under gates according to the return of his adjutantgeneral were three thousand and fiftytwo fit for duty more than twothirds of them however were militia  on the 14th he received an express from general sumter who with his partisan corps after harassing the enemy at various points was now endeavoring to cut off their supplies from charleston the object of the express was to ask a reinforcement of regulars to aid him in capturing a large convoy of clothing ammunition and stores on its way to the garrison and which would pass wateree ferry about a mile from camden gates accordingly detached colonel woolford of the maryland line with one hundred regulars a party of artillery and two brass fieldpieces on the same evening he moved with his main force to take post at a deep stream about seven miles from camden intending to attack lord rawdon or his redoubts should he march out in force to repel sumter  by a singular coincidence lord cornwallis on the very same evening sallied forth from camden to attack the american camp at clermont about two oclock at night the two forces blundered as it were on each other about half way a skirmish took place between their advanced guards in which porterfield of the virginia regulars was mortally wounded some prisoners were taken on either side gates was astounded at being told that the enemy at hand was cornwallis with three thousand men calling a council of war he demanded what was best to be done for a moment or two there was blank silence it was broken by general stevens of the virginia militia with the significant question gentlemen is it not too late now to do anything but fight no other advice was asked or offered and all were required to repair to their respective commands in forming the line the first maryland division including the delawares was on the right commanded by de kalb the virginia militia under stevens were on the left caswell with the north carolinians formed the centre the artillery was in battery on the road each flank was covered by a marsh the second maryland brigade formed a reserve a few hundred yards in rear of the first  at daybreak aug 16th the enemy were dimly descried advancing in column they appeared to be displaying to the right gates ordered that stevens should advance briskly with his brigade of virginia militia and attack them while in the act of displaying no sooner did stevens receive the order than he put his brigade in motion but discovered that the right wing of the enemy was already in line a few sharpshooters were detached to run forward post themselves behind trees within forty or fifty yards of the enemy to extort their fire while at a distance and render it less terrible to the militia the expedient failed the british rushed on shouting and firing the inexperienced militia dismayed and confounded by this impetuous assault threw down their loaded muskets and fled the panic spread to the north carolina militia part of them made a temporary stand but soon joined with the rest in flight rendered headlong and disastrous by the charge and pursuit of tarleton and his cavalry  gates seconded by his officers made several attempts to rally the militia but was borne along with them the day was hazy there was no wind to carry off the smoke which hung over the field of battle like a thick cloud nothing could be seen distinctly supposing that the regular troops were dispersed like the militia gates gave up all for lost and retreated from the field  the regulars however had not given away the maryland brigades and the delaware regiment unconscious that they were deserted by the militia stood their ground and bore the brunt of the battle though repeatedly broken they as often rallied and braved even the deadly push of the bayonet at length a charge of tarletons cavalry on their flank threw them into confusion and drove them into the woods and swamps none showed more gallantry on this disastrous day than the baron de kalb he fought on foot with the second maryland brigade and fell exhausted after receiving eleven wounds his aidedecamp de buysson supported him in his arms and was repeatedly wounded in protecting him he announced the rank and nation of his general and both were taken prisoners de kalb died in the course of a few days  general gates in retreating had hoped to rally a sufficient force at clermont to cover the retreat of the regulars but the further they fled the more the militia were dispersed until the generals were abandoned by all but their aides to add to the mortification of gates he learned in the course of his retreat that sumter had been completely successful and having reduced the enemys redoubt on the wateree and captured one hundred prisoners and forty loaded wagons was marching off with his booty on the opposite side of the river apprehending danger from the quarter in which he had heard firing in the morning  cornwallis was apprehensive that sumters corps might form a rallying point to the routed army on the morning of the 17th of august therefore he detached tarleton in pursuit with a body of cavalry and light infantry about three hundred and fifty strong sumter was retreating up the western side of the wateree much encumbered by his spoils and prisoners tarleton pushed up by forced and concealed marches on the eastern side at dusk tarleton descried the fires of the american camp about a mile from the opposite shore in the morning his sentries gave word that the americans were quitting their encampment it was evident they knew nothing of a british force being in pursuit of them tarleton now crossed the wateree the delay in crossing and the diligence of sumters march increased the distance between the pursuers and the pursued about noon a part of tarletons force gave out through heat and fatigue leaving them to repose on the bank of fishing creek he pushed on with about one hundred dragoons the freshest and most able still marching with great circumspection a sergeant and five dragoons rode up to the summit of a neighboring hill to reconnoitre crouching on their horses they made signs to tarleton he cautiously approached the crest of the hill and looking over beheld the american camp on a neighboring height in a most negligent condition the troops having for the last four days been almost without food or sleep were indulged in complete relaxation their arms were stacked and they were scattered about some strolling some lying on the grass under the trees some bathing in the river sumter himself had thrown off part of his clothes on account of the heat of the weather  tarleton prepared for instant attack his cavalry and infantry formed into one line dashed forward with a general shout and before the americans could recover from their surprise got between them and the parade ground on which the muskets were stacked all was confusion and consternation in the american camp some opposition was made from behind baggage wagons and there was skirmishing in various quarters but in a little while there was a universal flight to the river and the woods between three and four hundred were killed and wounded all their arms and baggage with two brass fieldpieces fell into the hands of the enemy who also recaptured the prisoners and booty taken at camden sumter with about three hundred and fifty of his men effected a retreat he galloped off it is said without saddle hat or coat  it was not until the beginning of september that washington received word of the disastrous reverse at camden the shock was the greater as previous reports from that quarter had represented the operations a few days preceding the action as much in our favor it was evident to washington that the course of war must ultimately tend to the southern states yet the situation of affairs in the north did not permit him to detach any sufficient force for their relief all that he could do for the present was to endeavor to hold the enemy in check in that quarter for this purpose he gave orders that some regular troops enlisted in maryland for the war and intended for the main army should be sent to the southward he wrote to governor rutledge of south carolina 12th september to raise a permanent compact wellorganized body of troops instead of depending upon a numerous army of militia always inconceivably expensive and too fluctuating and undisciplined to oppose a regular force he was still more urgent and explicit on this head in his letters to the president of congress september 15th regular troops alone said he are equal to the exigencies of modern war as well for defence as offence and whenever a substitute is attempted it must prove illusory and ruinous no militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist a regular force  he had scarce written the foregoing when he received a letter from the now unfortunate gates dated at hillsborough august 30th and september 3d giving particulars of his discomfiture no longer vaunting and vainglorious he pleads nothing but his patriotism and deprecates the fall which he apprehends awaits him the appeal which he makes to washingtons magnanimity to support him in this day of his reverse is the highest testimonial he could give to the exalted character of the man whom he once affected to underrate and aspired to supplant  washington still cherished the idea of a combined attack upon new york as soon as a french naval force should arrive the destruction of the enemy here would relieve this part of the union from an internal war and enable its troops and resources to be united with those of france in vigorous efforts against the common enemy elsewhere hearing therefore that the count de guichen with his west india squadron was approaching the coast washington prepared to proceed to hartford in connecticut there to hold a conference with the count de rochambeau and the chevalier de ternay and concert a plan for future operations of which the attack on new york was to form the principal feature     chapter lvii the treason of arnoldtrial and execution of andr√â   we have now to enter upon a sad episode of our revolutionary historythe treason of arnold of the military skill daring enterprise and indomitable courage of this man ample evidence has been given in the foregoing pages of the implicit confidence reposed in his patriotism by washington sufficient proof is manifested in the command with which he was actually entrusted but arnold was false at heart and at the very time of seeking that command had been for many months in traitorous correspondence with the enemy  the first idea of proving recreant to the cause he had vindicated so bravely appears to have entered his mind when the charges preferred against him by the council of pennsylvania were referred by congress to a courtmartial before that time he had been incensed against pennsylvania but now his wrath was excited against his country which appeared so insensible to his services disappointment in regard to the settlement of his accounts added to his irritation and mingled sordid motives with his resentment and he began to think how while he wreaked his vengeance on his country he might do it with advantage to his fortunes with this view he commenced a correspondence with sir henry clinton in a disguised handwriting and under the signature of gustavus representing himself as a person of importance in the american service who being dissatisfied with the late proceedings of congress particularly the alliance with france was desirous of joining the cause of great britain could he be certain of personal security and indemnification for whatever loss of property he might sustain his letters occasionally communicated articles of intelligence of some moment which proved to be true and induced sir henry to keep up the correspondence which was conducted on his part by his aidedecamp major john andr√©1 likewise in a disguised hand and under the signature of john anderson months elapsed before sir henry discovered who was his secret correspondent even after discovering it he did not see fit to hold out very strong inducements to arnold for desertion the latter was out of command and had nothing to offer but his services which in his actual situation were scarcely worth buying  footnote 1 major andr√© was born in london in 1751 but his parents were of geneva switzerland where he was educated he was designed for mercantile life and entered a london countinghouse the sober routine of which however was so distasteful to him that he soon abandoned it for the army an engagement in his eighteenth year to a beautiful girl miss honora sneyd which the father of the young lady broke off is said to have been one cause of this step he came to america in 1774 as lieutenant of the royal fusiliers his temper was light and festive and his varied graceful talents and his engaging manners rendered him generally popular  in the meantime the circumstances of arnold were daily becoming more desperate debts were accumulating and creditors becoming more and more importunate as his means to satisfy them decreased the public reprimand he had received was rankling in his mind and filling his heart with bitterness still he hesitated on the brink of absolute infamy and attempted a halfway leap such was his proposition to m de luzerne to make himself subservient to the policy of the french government on condition of receiving a loan equal to the amount of his debts it was his last card before resorting to utter treachery failing in it his desperate alternative was to get some important command the betrayal of which to the enemy might obtain for him a munificent reward such was the secret of his eagerness to obtain the command of west point the great object of british and american solicitude on the possession of which were supposed by many to hinge the fortunes of the war  he took command of the post and its dependencies about the beginning of august fixing his headquarters at beverley a countryseat a little below west point on the opposite or eastern side of the river it was commonly called the robinson house having formerly belonged to colonel beverley robinson colonel robinson was a royalist had entered into the british service and was now residing in new york and beverley with its surrounding lands had been confiscated  from this place arnold carried on a secret correspondence with major andr√© their letters still in disguised hands and under the names of gustavus and john anderson purported to treat merely of commercial operations but the real matter in negotiation was the betrayal of west point and the highlands to sir henry clinton this stupendous piece of treachery was to be consummated at the time when washington with the main body of his army would be drawn down towards kings bridge and the french troops landed on long island in the projected cooperation against new york at such time a flotilla under rodney having on board a large land force was to ascend the hudson to the highlands which would be surrendered by arnold almost without opposition under pretext of insufficient force to make resistance the immediate result of this surrender it was anticipated would be the defeat of the combined attempt upon new york and its ultimate effect might be the dismemberment of the union and the dislocation of the whole american scheme of warfare  correspondence had now done its part in the business for the completion of the plan and the adjustment of the traitors recompense a personal meeting was necessary between arnold and andr√© the former proposed that it should take place at his own quarters where andr√© should come in disguise as a bearer of intelligence and under the feigned name of john anderson andr√© positively objected to entering the american lines it was arranged therefore that the meeting should take place on neutral ground near the american outposts at dobbs ferry on the 11th of september at twelve oclock andr√© attended at the appointed place and time accompanied by colonel beverley robinson who was acquainted with the plot an application of the latter for the restoration of his confiscated property in the highlands seemed to have been used occasionally as a blind in these proceedings  arnold had passed the preceding night at what was called the white house the residence of mr joshua hett smith situated on the west side of the hudson in haverstraw bay about two miles below stony point he set off thence in his barge for the place of rendezvous but not being protected by a flag was fired upon and pursued by the british guardboats stationed near dobbs ferry he took refuge at an american post on the western shore whence he returned in the night to his quarters new arrangements were made for an interview but it was postponed until after washington should depart for hartford to hold the proposed conference with count rochambeau and the other french officers in the meantime the british sloopofwar vulture anchored a few miles below tellers point to be at hand in aid of the negotiation on board was colonel robinson who pretending to believe that general putnam still commanded in the highlands addressed a note to him requesting an interview on the subject of his confiscated property this letter he sent by a flag enclosed in one addressed to arnold soliciting of him the same boon should general putnam be absent  on the 18th september washington with his suite crossed the hudson to verplancks point in arnolds barge on his way to hartford arnold accompanied him as far as peekskill and on the way laid before him with affected frankness the letter of colonel robinson and asked his advice washington disapproved of any such interview observing that the civil authorities alone had cognizance of these questions of confiscated property arnold now openly sent a flag on board of the vulture as if bearing a reply to the letter he had communicated to the commanderinchief by this occasion he informed colonel robinson that a person with a boat and flag would be alongside of the vulture on the night of the 20th and that any matter he might wish to communicate would be laid before general washington on the following saturday when he might be expected back from newport  on the faith of the information thus covertly conveyed andr√© proceeded up the hudson on the 20th and went on board of the vulture where he found colonel robinson and expected to meet arnold the latter however had made other arrangements probably with a view to his personal security about halfpast eleven of a still and starlight night the 21st a boat was descried from on board gliding silently along rowed by two men with muffled oars she was hailed by an officer on watch and called to account a man seated in the stern gave out that they were from kings ferry bound to dobbs ferry he was ordered alongside and soon made his way on board he proved to be mr joshua hett smith already mentioned whom arnold had prevailed upon to go on board of the vulture and bring a person on shore who was coming from new york with important intelligence he had given him passes to protect him and those with him in case he should be stopped either in going or returning by the american water guard which patrolled the river in whaleboats he had made him the bearer of a letter addressed to colonel beverley robinson which was to the following purport this will be delivered to you by mr smith who will conduct you to a place of safety neither mr smith nor any other person shall be made acquainted with your proposals if they which i doubt not are of such a nature that i can officially take notice of them i shall do it with pleasure i take it for granted colonel robinson will not propose anything that is not for the interest of the united states as well as of himself all this use of colonel robinsons name was intended as a blind should the letter be intercepted  robinson introduced andr√© to smith by the name of john anderson who was to go on shore in his place he being unwell to have an interview with general arnold andr√© wore a blue great coat which covered his uniform and smith always declared that at the time he was totally ignorant of his name and military character andr√© embarking in the boat with smith was silently rowed to the western side of the river about six miles below stony point here they landed a little after midnight at the foot of a shadowy mountain called the long clove arnold was in waiting but standing aloof among thickets the midnight negotiation between andr√© and arnold was carried on in darkness among the trees one hour after another passed away when smith approached the place of conference and gave warning that it was near daybreak and if they lingered much longer the boat would be discovered  the nefarious bargain was not yet completed and arnold feared the sight of a boat going to the vulture might cause suspicion he prevailed therefore upon andr√© to remain on shore until the following night the boat was accordingly sent to a creek higher up the river and andr√© set off with arnold for smiths house the road passed through the village of haverstraw as they rode along in the dark the voice of a sentinel demanding the countersign startled andr√© with the fearful conviction that he was within the american lines but it was too late to recede it was daybreak when they arrived at smiths house they had scarcely entered when the booming of cannon was heard from down the river it gave andr√© uneasiness and with reason colonel livingston who commanded above at verplancks point learning that the vulture lay within shot of tellers point which divides haverstraw bay from the tappan sea had sent a party with cannon to that point in the night and they were now firing upon the sloopofwar andr√© watched the cannonade with an anxious eye from an upper window of smiths house he was relieved from painful solicitude when he saw the vessel weigh anchor and drop down the river out of reach of cannon shot  after breakfast the plot for the betrayal of west point and its dependent posts was adjusted and the sum agreed upon that arnold was to receive should it be successful andr√© was furnished with plans of the works and explanatory papers which at arnolds request he placed between his stockings and his feet promising in case of accident to destroy them  all matters being thus arranged arnold prepared to return in his own barge to his headquarters at the robinson house as the vulture had shifted her ground he suggested to andr√© a return to new york by land as most safe and expeditious the latter however insisted upon being put on board of the sloopofwar on the ensuing night arnold consented but before his departure to provide against the possible necessity of a return by land he gave andr√© the following pass dated from the robinson house  permit mr john anderson to pass the guards to the white plains or below if he chooses he being on public business by my direction b arnold m genl  smith also who was to accompany him was furnished with passports to proceed either by water or by land arnold departed about ten oclock andr√© passed a lonely day casting many a wistful look toward the vulture as evening approached he grew impatient and spoke to smith about departure to his surprise he found the latter had made no preparation for it he had discharged his boatmen who had gone home in short he refused to take him on board the vulture the cannonade of the morning had probably made him fear for his personal safety should he attempt to go on board the vulture having resumed her exposed position he offered however to cross the river with andr√© at kings ferry put him in the way of returning to new york by land and accompany him some distance on horseback  andr√© was in an agony at finding himself notwithstanding all his stipulations forced within the american lines but there seemed to be no alternative and he prepared for the hazardous journey he wore as we have noted a military coat under a long blue surtout he was now persuaded to lay it aside and put on a citizens coat of smiths thus adding disguise to the other humiliating and hazardous circumstances of the case  it was about sunset when andr√© and smith crossed from kings ferry to verplancks point after proceeding about eight miles on the road toward white plains they were stopped between eight and nine oclock near crompond by a patrolling party the captain of it was uncommonly inquisitive and suspicious the passports with arnolds signature satisfied him he warned them however against the danger of proceeding further in the night cow boys from the british lines were scouring the country and had recently marauded the neighborhood smiths fears were again excited and andr√© was obliged to yield to them a bed was furnished them in a neighboring house where andr√© passed an anxious and restless night at daybreak he awoke smith and hurried their departure  they were now approaching that noted part of the country heretofore mentioned as the neutral ground extending north and south about thirty miles between the british and american lines a beautiful region of forestclad hills fertile valleys and abundant streams but now almost desolated by the scourings of skinners and cow boys the former professing allegiance to the american cause the latter to the british but both arrant marauders about two and a half miles from pines bridge on the croton river andr√© and his companion partook of a scanty meal at a farmhouse here they parted smith to return home andr√© to pursue his journey alone to new york  he had not proceeded far when coming to a place where a small stream crossed the road and ran into a woody dell a man stepped out from the trees levelled a musket and brought him to a stand while two other men similarly armed showed themselves prepared to second their comrade the man who had first stepped out wore a refugee uniform at sight of it andr√©s heart leapt and he felt himself secure losing all caution he exclaimed eagerly gentlemen i hope you belong to our party what party was asked the lower party said andr√© we do was the reply all reserve was now at an end andr√© declared himself to be a british officer that he had been up the country on particular business and must not be detained a single moment to his consternation the supposed refugee now avowed himself and his companions to be americans and told andr√© he was their prisoner2  footnote 2 the names of the captors were john paulding isaac van wart and david williams  andr√© was astounded at finding into what hands he had fallen and how he had betrayed himself by his heedless avowal promptly however recovering his self possession he endeavored to pass off his previous account of himself as a mere subterfuge a man must do anything said he laughingly to get along he now declared himself to be a continental officer going down to dobbs ferry to get information from below so saying he drew forth and showed them the pass of general arnold  this in the first instance would have been sufficient but his unwary tongue had ruined him the suspicions of his captors were completely roused paulding asked whether he had any letters about him he answered no they proceeded to search him they obliged him to take off his coat and vest and found on him eighty dollars in continental money but nothing to warrant suspicion of anything sinister and were disposed to let him proceed when paulding exclaimed boys i am not satisfiedhis boots must come off at this andr√© changed color his boots he said came off with difficulty and he begged he might not be subjected to the inconvenience and delay his remonstrances were in vain he was obliged to sit down his boots were drawn off and the concealed papers discovered hastily scanning them paulding exclaimed my god he is a spy he demanded of andr√© where he had gotten these papers of a man at pines bridge a stranger to me was the reply  while dressing himself andr√© endeavored to ransom himself from his captors rising from one offer to another he would give any reward they might name either in goods or money and would remain with two of their party while one went to new york to get it here paulding broke in and declared with an oath that if he would give ten thousand guineas he should not stir one step  the unfortunate andr√© now submitted to his fate and the captors set off with their prisoner for north castle the nearest american post distant ten or twelve miles arrived at north castle lieutenantcolonel jameson who was in command there recognized the handwriting of arnold in the papers found upon andr√© and perceiving that they were of a dangerous nature sent them off by express to general washington at hartford  andr√© still adhering to his assumed name begged that the commander at west point might be informed that john anderson though bearing his passport was detained jameson appears completely to have lost his head on the occasion he wrote to arnold stating the circumstances of the arrest and that the papers found upon the prisoner had been despatched by express to the commanderinchief and at the same time he sent the prisoner himself under a strong guard to accompany the letter  shortly afterwards major tallmadge next in command to jameson but of a much clearer head arrived at north castle having been absent on duty to white plains when the circumstances of the case were related to him he at once suspected treachery on the part of arnold at his earnest entreaties an express was sent after the officer who had andr√© in charge ordering him to bring the latter back to north castle but by singular perversity or obtuseness in judgment jameson neglected to countermand the letter which he had written to arnold when andr√© was brought back and was pacing up and down the room tallmadge saw at once by his air and movements and the mode of turning on his heel that he was a military man by his advice and under his escort the prisoner was conducted to colonel sheldons post at lower salem as more secure than north castle  here andr√© being told that the papers found upon his person had been forwarded to washington addressed to him immediately the following lines i beg your excellency will be persuaded that no alteration in the temper of my mind or apprehensions for my safety induces me to take the step of addressing you but that it is to secure myself from the imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes or selfinterest it is to vindicate my fame that i speak and not to solicit security the person in your possession is major john andr√© adjutantgeneral of the british army the influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage taken in war a correspondence for this purpose i held as confidential in the present instance with his excellency sir henry clinton to favor it i agreed to meet upon ground not within the posts of either army a person who was to give me intelligence i came up in the vulture manofwar for this effect and was fetched from the shore to the beach being there i was told that the approach of day would prevent my return and that i must be concealed until the next night i was in my regimentals and had fairly risked my person against my stipulation my intention and without my knowledge beforehand i was conducted within one of your posts thus was i betrayed into the vile condition of an enemy within your posts  this letter he submitted to the perusal of major tallmadge who was surprised and agitated at finding the rank and importance of the prisoner he had in charge the letter being despatched and andr√©s pride relieved on a sensitive point he resumed his serenity apparently unconscious of the awful responsibility of his situation  on the very day that the treasonable conference between arnold and andr√© took place on the banks of haverstraw bay washington had his interview with the french officers at hartford it led to no important result intelligence was received that the squadron of the count de guichen on which they had relied to give them superiority by sea had sailed for europe this disconcerted their plans and washington in consequence set out two or three days sooner than had been anticipated on his return to his headquarters on the hudson he was accompanied by lafayette and general knox with their suites also part of the way by count matthew dumas aidedecamp to rochambeau  on approaching the hudson washington took a more circuitous route than the one he had originally intended striking the river at fishkill just above the highlands that he might visit west point and show the marquis the works which had been erected there during his absence in france circumstances detained them a night at fishkill their baggage was sent on to arnolds quarters in the robinson house with a message apprising the general that they would breakfast there the next day in the morning sept 24th they were in the saddle before break of day having a ride to make of eighteen miles through the mountains when within a mile of the robinson house washington turned down a cross road leading to the banks of the hudson lafayette apprised him that he was going out of the way and hinted that mrs arnold must be waiting breakfast for him ah marquis replied he goodhumoredly you young men are all in love with mrs arnold go you and breakfast with her and tell her not to wait for me i must ride down and examine the redoubts on this side of the river but will be with her shortly the marquis and general knox however turned off and accompanied him down to the redoubts while colonel hamilton and lafayettes aidedecamp major james mchenry continued along the main road to the robinson house bearing washingtons apology and request that the breakfast might not be retarded  the family with the two aidesdecamp sat down to breakfast mrs arnold had arrived but four or five days previously from philadelphia with her infant child then about six months old she was bright and amiable as usual arnold was silent and gloomy it was an anxious moment with him in the midst of the repast a horseman alighted at the gate it was the messenger bearing jamesons letter to arnold stating the capture of andr√© and that dangerous papers found on him had been forwarded to washington the mine had exploded beneath arnolds feet controlling the dismay that must have smitten him to the heart he beckoned mrs arnold from the breakfast table signifying a wish to speak with her in private when alone with her in her room upstairs he announced in hurried words that he was a ruined man and must instantly fly for his life overcome by the shock she fell senseless on the floor without pausing to aid her he hurried down stairs informed his guests that he must haste to west point to prepare for the reception of the commanderinchief and mounting the horse of the messenger which stood saddled at the door galloped down to the landingplace where his sixoared barge was moored throwing himself into it he ordered his men to pull out into the middle of the river and then made down with all speed for tellers point  washington arrived at the robinson house shortly after the flight of the traitor being informed that mrs arnold was in her room unwell and that arnold had gone to west point to receive him he took a hasty breakfast and repaired to the fortress leaving word that he and his suite would return to dinner  he remained at the point throughout the morning inspecting the fortifications in the meantime the messenger whom jameson had despatched to hartford with a letter covering the papers taken on andr√© arrived at the robinson house he had learnt while on the way to hartford that washington had left that place whereupon he turned bridle to overtake him but missed him in consequence of the generals change of route coming by the lower road the messenger had passed through salem where andr√© was confined and brought with him the letter written by that unfortunate officer to the commanderinchief the purport of which has already been given these letters being represented as of the utmost moment were opened and read by colonel hamilton as washingtons aidedecamp and confidential officer he maintained silence as to their contents met washington as he and his companions were coming up from the river on their return from west point spoke to him a few words in a low voice and they retired together into the house whatever agitation washington may have felt when these documents of deeplaid treachery were put before him he wore his usual air of equanimity when he rejoined his companions taking knox and lafayette aside he communicated to them the intelligence and placed the papers in their hands  his first idea was to arrest the traitor conjecturing the direction of his flight he despatched colonel hamilton on horseback to spur with all speed to verplancks point with orders to the commander to intercept arnold should he not already have passed that post in the meantime arnold panicstricken had sped his caitiff flight through the highlands infamy howling in his rear arrest threatening him in the advance a fugitive past the posts which he had recently commanded shrinking at the sight of that flag which hitherto it had been his glory to defend  he had passed through the highlands in safety but there were the batteries at verplancks point yet to fear fortunately for him hamilton with the order for his arrest had not arrived there his barge was known by the garrison a white handkerchief displayed gave it the sanction of a flag of truce it was suffered to pass without question and the traitor effected his escape to the vulture sloopofwar anchored a few miles below as if to consummate his degradation by a despicable act of treachery and meanness he gave up to the commander his coxswain and six bargemen as prisoners of war we are happy to add that this perfidy excited the scorn of the british officers and when it was found that the men had supposed they were acting under the protection of a flag they were released by order of sir henry clinton  colonel hamilton returned to the robinson house and reported the escape of the traitor he brought two letters also to washington which had been sent on shore from the vulture under a flag of truce one was from arnold in which he wrote i ask no favor for myself i have too often experienced the ingratitude of my country to attempt it but from the known humanity of your excellency i am induced to ask your protection for mrs arnold from every insult and injury that a mistaken vengeance of my country may expose her to i beg she may be permitted to return to her friends in philadelphia or to come to me as she may choose the other letter was from colonel beverley robinson interceding for the release of andr√© on the plea that he was on shore under the sanction of a flag of truce at the request of arnold  notwithstanding washingtons apparent tranquillity and real selfpossession it was a time of appalling distrust how far the treason had extended who else might be implicated in it was unknown arnold had escaped and was actually on board of the vulture he knew everything about the condition of the posts might he not persuade the enemy in the present weak state of the garrisons to attempt a coup de main washington instantly therefore despatched a letter to colonel wade who was in temporary command at west point general arnold is gone to the enemy writes he i request that you will be as vigilant as possible and as the enemy may have it in contemplation to attempt some enterprise even tonight against these posts i wish you to make immediately after the receipt of this the best disposition you can of your force so as to have a proportion of men in each work on the west side of the river a regiment stationed in the highlands was ordered to the same duty as well as a body of the massachusetts militia from fishkill at halfpast seven in the evening washington wrote to general greene who in his absence commanded the army at tappan urging him to put the left division in motion as soon as possible with orders to proceed to kings ferry where or before they should arrive there they would be met with further orders  in the meantime mrs arnold remained in her room in a state bordering on frenzy arnold might well confide in the humanity and delicacy of washington in respect to her he regarded her with the sincerest commiseration acquitting her of all previous knowledge of her husbands guilt during the brief time she remained at the robinson house she was treated with the utmost deference and delicacy but soon set off under a passport of washington for her fathers house in philadelphia  on the 26th of september the day after the treason of arnold had been revealed to washington andr√© arrived at the robinson house having been brought on in the night under escort and in charge of major tallmadge washington made many inquiries of the major but declined to have the prisoner brought into his presence apparently entertaining a strong idea of his moral obliquity from the nature of the scheme in which he had been engaged and the circumstances under which he had been arrested the same evening he transmitted him to west point and shortly afterwards joshua h smith who had likewise been arrested still not considering them secure even there he determined on the following day to send them on to the camp  major tallmadge continued to have the charge of andr√© not regarding him from the same anxious point with the commanderinchief and having had opportunities of acquiring a personal knowledge of him he had become fascinated by his engaging qualities the ease and affability of his manners writes he polished by the refinement of good society and a finished education made him a most delightful companion it often drew tears from my eyes to find him so agreeable in conversation on different subjects when i reflected on his future fate and that too as i feared so near at hand  early on the morning of the 28th the prisoners were embarked in a barge to be conveyed from west point to kings ferry after disembarking at kings ferry near stony point they set off for tappan under the escort of a body of horse as they approached the clove a deep defile in the rear of the highlands andr√© who rode beside tallmadge became solicitous to know the opinion of the latter as to what would be the result of his capture and in what light he would be regarded by general washington and by a military tribunal should one be ordered tallmadge evaded the question as long as possible but being urged to a full and explicit reply gave it he says in the following words i had a muchloved classmate in yale college by the name of nathan hale who entered the army in 1775 immediately after the battle of long island general washington wanted information respecting the strength position and probable movements of the enemy captain hale tendered his services went over to brooklyn and was taken just as he was passing the outposts of the enemy on his return said i with emphasisdo you remember the sequel of the story yes said andr√© he was hanged as a spy but you surely do not consider his case and mine alike yes precisely similar3  footnote 3 the fate of the heroic youth here alluded to deserves a more ample notice born in coventry connecticut june 6th 1755 he entered yale college in 1770 and graduated with some distinction in september 1773 on quitting college he engaged as a teacher as is common with young men in new england while studying for a profession his halfformed purpose was to devote himself to the ministry he was teaching at new london when an express arrived bringing tidings of the outbreak at lexington a town meeting was called and hale was among the most ardent of the speakers proposing an instant march to the scene of hostilities and offering to volunteer  he served in the army before boston as a lieutenant prevailed on his company to extend their term of service by offering them his own pay and for his good conduct received from congress the commission of captain he commanded a company in colonel knowltons regiment in the following year after the disastrous battle of long island washington applied to that officer for a competent person to penetrate the enemys camp and procure intelligence of their designs hale in the ardor of patriotism volunteered for the unenviable enterprise though fully aware of its peril and the consequences of capture assuming his old character as schoolmaster he crossed the sound at night from norwalk to huntington on long island visited the british encampments unsuspected made drawings of the enemys works and noted down memoranda in latin of the information he gathered and then retraced his steps to huntington where a boat was to meet him and convey him back to the connecticut shore unfortunately a british guard ship was at that time anchored out of view in the sound and had sent a boat on shore for water hale mistook it for the expected boat and did not discover his mistake until he found himself in the hands of enemies he was stripped and searched the plans and memoranda were found concealed in the soles of his shoes and proved him to be a spy he was conveyed to the guard ship and thence to new york where he was landed on the 21st of september the day of the great fire he was taken to general howes headquarters and after brief parley with his judge ordered for execution the next morning at daybreak his patriot spirit shone forth in his dying wordsi only regret that i have but one life to lose for my country  the capture of andr√© caused a great sensation at new york he was universally popular with the army and an especial favorite of sir henry clinton the latter addressed a letter to washington on the 29th claiming the release of andr√© on similar ground to that urged by colonel robinsonhis having visited arnold at the particular request of that general officer and under the sanction of a flag of truce and his having been stopped while travelling under arnolds passports the same letter inclosed one addressed by arnold to sir henry and intended as a kind of certificate of the innocence of andr√© i commanded at the time at west point writes the renegade had an undoubted right to send my flag of truce to major andr√© who came to me under that protection and having held conversation with him i delivered him confidential papers in my own handwriting to deliver to your excellency  neither the official demand of sir henry clinton nor the impudent certificate of arnold had any effect on the steady mind of washington he considered the circumstances under which andr√© had been taken such as would have justified the most summary proceedings but he determined to refer the case to the examination and decision of a board of general officers which he convened on the 29th of september the day after his arrival at tappan it was composed of six majorgeneralsgreene stirling st clair lafayette r howe and steuben and eight brigadiersparsons jas clinton knox glover paterson hand huntingdon and stark general greene who was well versed in military law and was a man of sound head and kind heart was president and colonel john lawrence judge advocategeneral  colonel alexander hamilton gives in letters to his friends many interesting particulars concerning the conduct of the prisoner when brought before the board of officers writes he he met with every mark of indulgence and was required to answer no interrogatory which would even embarrass his feelings on his part while he carefully concealed everything that might implicate others he frankly confessed all the facts relating to himself and upon his confession without the trouble of examining a witness the board made up their report it briefly stated the circumstances of the case and concluded with the opinion of the court that major andr√© adjutantgeneral of the british army ought to be considered a spy from the enemy and agreeably to the law and usage of nations ought to suffer death  andr√© met the result with manly firmness even in this situation of gathering horrors he thought of others more than of himself there is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity said he to hamilton sir henry clinton has been too good to me he has been lavish of his kindness i am bound to him by too many obligations and love him too well to bear the thought that he should reproach himself or others should reproach him on the supposition of my having conceived myself obliged by his instructions to run the risk i did i would not for the world leave a sting in his mind that should embitter his future days he could scarce finish the sentence bursting into tears in spite of his efforts to suppress them and with difficulty collected himself enough afterwards to add i wish to be permitted to assure him that i did not act under this impression but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me as contrary to my own inclination as to his wishes his request was complied with and he wrote a letter to sir henry clinton to the above purport he made mention also of his mother and three sisters to whom the value of his commission would be an object it is needless said he to be more explicit on this subject i am persuaded of your excellencys goodness  this letter accompanied one from washington to sir henry clinton stating the report of the board of inquiry omitting the sentence captain aaron ogden a worthy officer of the new jersey line was selected by washington to bear these despatches to the enemys post at paulus hook thence to be conveyed across the hudson to new york before his departure he called by washingtons request on the marquis lafayette who gave him instructions to sound the officer commanding at that post whether sir henry clinton might not be willing to deliver up arnold in exchange for andr√© ogden arrived at paulus hook in the evening and made the suggestion as if incidentally in the course of conversation the officer crossed the river before morning and communicated the matter to sir henry clinton but the latter instantly rejected the expedient as incompatible with honor and military principle  the execution was to have taken place on the 1st of october at five oclock in the afternoon but in the interim washington received a second letter from sir henry clinton dated september 30th expressing an opinion that the board of inquiry had not been rightly informed of all the circumstances on which a judgment ought to be formed and that in order that he might be perfectly apprised of the state of the matter before he proceeded to put that judgment in execution he should send a commission on the following day composed of lieutenantgovernor elliot william smith chief justice of the province and lieutenantgeneral robertson to wait near dobbs ferry for permission and safe conduct to meet washington or such persons as he should appoint to converse with them on the subject this letter caused a postponement of the execution and general greene was sent to meet the commissioners at dobbs ferry they came up in the morning of the 1st of october in a schooner with a flag of truce and were accompanied by colonel beverley robinson general robertson however was the only commissioner permitted to land the others not being military officers a long conference took place between him and general greene without any agreement of opinion upon the question at issue greene returned to camp promising to report faithfully to washington the arguments urged by robertson and to inform the latter of the result  greene in a brief letter to general robertson informed him that he had as full a report of their conference to the commanderinchief as his memory would serve but that it had made no alteration in washingtons opinion and determination robertson was piqued at the brevity of the note and professed to doubt whether greenes memory had served him with sufficient fulness and exactness he addressed therefore to washington his own statement of his reasoning on the subject after despatching which he and the other commissioners returned in the schooner to new york  illustration major john andr√â vol iv  during this day of respite andr√© had conducted himself with his usual tranquillity a likeness of himself seated at a table in his guardroom which he sketched with a pen and gave to the officer on guard is still extant it being announced to him that one oclock on the following day was fixed on for his execution he remarked that since it was his lot to die there was still a choice in the mode he therefore addressed a note to washington concluding as follows let me hope sir that if aught in my character impresses you with esteem towards me if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy and not of resentment i shall experience the operation of these feelings in your breast by being informed that i am not to die on a gibbet  had washington consulted his feelings merely this affecting appeal might not have been in vain for though not impulsive he was eminently benevolent he had no popular censure to apprehend should he exercise indulgence for the popular feeling was with the prisoner but he had a high and tenacious sense of the duties and responsibilities of his position and never more than in this trying moment when he had to elevate himself above the contagious sympathies of those around him dismiss all personal considerations and regard the peculiar circumstances of the case the long course of insidious operations which had been pursued to undermine the loyalty of one of his most trusted officers the greatness of the evil which the treason would have effected if successful the uncertainty how far the enemy had carried or might still be carrying their scheme of corruption for anonymous intimations spoke of treachery in other quarters all these considerations pointed this out as a case in which a signal example was required he took counsel with some of his general officers their opinions coincided with his ownthat under present circumstances it was important to give a signal warning to the enemy by a rigorous observance of the rules of war and the usages of nations in like cases  but although andr√©s request as to the mode of his death was not to be granted it was thought best to let him remain in uncertainty on the subject no answer therefore was returned to his note on the morning of the 2d he maintained a calm demeanor though all around him were gloomy and silent he even rebuked his servant for shedding tears having breakfasted he dressed himself with care in the full uniform of a british officer which he had sent for to new york placed his hat upon the table and accosting the officers on guardi am ready said he at any moment gentlemen to wait upon you  he walked to the place of execution between two subaltern officers arm in arm with a serene countenance bowing to several gentlemen whom he knew colonel tallmadge accompanied him and we quote his words when he came within sight of the gibbet he appeared to be startled and inquired with some emotion whether he was not to be shot being informed that the mode first appointed for his death could not consistently be altered he exclaimed how hard is my fate but immediately added it will soon be over i then shook hands with him under the gallows and retired all things being ready he stepped into the wagon appeared to shrink for an instant but recovering himself exclaimed it will be but a momentary pang  taking off his hat and stock and opening his shirt collar he deliberately adjusted the noose to his neck after which he took out a handkerchief and tied it over his eyes being told by the officer in command that his arms must be bound he drew out a second handkerchief with which they were pinioned colonel scammel now told him that he had an opportunity to speak if he desired it his only reply was i pray you to bear witness that i meet my fate like a brave man the wagon moved from under him and left him suspended he died almost without a struggle his remains were interred within a few yards of the place of his execution whence they were transferred to england in 1821 by the british consul then resident in new york and were buried in westminster abbey near a mural monument which had been erected to his memory  washington in a letter to the president of congress passed a high eulogium on the captors of andr√© and recommended them for a handsome gratuity congress accordingly expressed in a formal vote a high sense of their virtuous and patriotic conduct awarded to each of them a farm a pension for life of two hundred dollars and a silver medal bearing on one side an escutcheon on which was engraved the word fidelity and on the other side the motto vincit amor patri√¶ these medals were delivered to them by general washington at headquarters with impressive ceremony  joshua h smith who aided in bringing andr√© and arnold together was tried by a courtmartial on a charge of participating in the treason but was acquitted no proof appearing of his having had any knowledge of arnolds plot though it was thought he must have been conscious of something wrong in an interview so mysteriously conducted  arnold was now made brigadiergeneral in the british service and put on an official level with honorable men who scorned to associate with the traitor what golden reward he was to have received had his treason been successful is not known but six thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds sterling were paid to him as a compensation for losses which he pretended to have suffered in going over to the enemies of his country  the vilest culprit however shrinks from sustaining the obloquy of his crimes shortly after his arrival in new york arnold published an address to the inhabitants of america in which he endeavored to vindicate his conduct he alleged that he had originally taken up arms merely to aid in obtaining a redress of grievances he had considered the declaration of independence precipitate and the reasons for it obviated by the subsequent proffers of the british government and he inveighed against congress for rejecting those offers without submitting them to the people finally the treaty with france a proud ancient and crafty foe the enemy of the protestant faith and of real liberty had completed he said the measure of his indignation and determined him to abandon a cause sustained by iniquity and controlled by usurpers  besides this address he issued a proclamation inviting the officers and soldiers of the american army who had the real interest of their country at heart and who were determined to be no longer the tools and dupes of congress and of france to rally under the royal standard and fight for true american liberty holding out promises of large bounties and liberal subsistence with compensation for all the implements and accoutrements of war they might bring with them both the address and the proclamation were regarded by americans with the contempt they merited none rallied to the standard of the renegade but a few deserters and refugees who were already within the british lines and prepared for any desperate or despicable service  mrs arnold on arriving at her fathers house in philadelphia had decided on a separation from her husband to whom she could not endure the thoughts of returning after his dishonor this course however was not allowed her the executive council wrongfully suspecting her of having aided in the correspondence between her husband and andr√© knowing its treasonable tendency ordered her to leave the state within fourteen days and not to return during the continuance of the war we tried every means writes one of her connections to prevail on the council to permit her to stay among us it was all in vain and strongly against her will she rejoined her husband in new york she returned home but once about five years after her exile and was treated with such coldness and neglect that she declared she never could come again in england her charms and virtues it is said procured her sympathy and friendship and helped to sustain the social position of her husband who however was generally slighted and sometimes insulted she died in london in the winter of 1796     chapter lviii plan to entrap arnoldprojects against new york   at this time a plan was formed at washingtons suggestion to get possession of the person of arnold the agent pitched upon by lee for the purpose was the sergeantmajor of cavalry in his legion john champe by name a young virginian about twentyfour years of age by many promises and much persuasion lee brought him to engage in the attempt champe was to make a pretended desertion to the enemy at new york there he was to enlist in a corps which arnold was raising insinuate himself into some menial or military situation about his person and watching for a favorable moment was with the aid of a confederate from newark to seize him in the night gag him and bring him across the hudson into bergen woods in the jerseys washington in approving the plan enjoined and stipulated that arnold should be brought to him alive  the pretended desertion of the sergeant took place on the night of october 20th and was attended with difficulties he had to evade patrols of horse and foot beside stationary guards and irregular scouting parties major lee could render him no assistance other than to delay pursuit should his departure be discovered about eleven oclock the sergeant took his cloak valise and orderly book drew his horse from the picket and mounting set out on his hazardous course while the major retired to rest he had not been in bed half an hour when captain carnes officer of the day hurrying into his quarters gave word that one of the patrols had fallen in with a dragoon who on being challenged put spurs to his horse and escaped lee pretended to be annoyed by the intrusion and to believe that the pretended dragoon was some countryman of the neighborhood the captain was piqued made a muster of the dragoons and returned with word that the sergeantmajor was missing who had gone off with horse baggage arms and orderly book  lee was now compelled to order out a party in pursuit under cornet middleton but in so doing he contrived so many delays that by the time they were in the saddle champe had an hours start his pursuers too were obliged in the course of the night to halt occasionally dismount and examine the road to guide themselves by the horses tracks at daybreak they pressed forward more rapidly and from the summit of a hill descried champe not more than half a mile in front the sergeant at the same moment caught sight of his pursuers and now the chase became desperate champe had originally intended to make for paulus hook but changed his course threw his pursuers at fault and succeeded in getting abreast of two british galleys at anchor near the shore beyond bergen he had no time to lose cornet middleton was but two or three hundred yards behind him throwing himself off his horse and running through a marsh he plunged into the river and called to the galleys for help a boat was sent to his assistance and he was conveyed on board of one of those vessels  for a time the whole plan promised to be successful champe enlisted in arnolds corps was employed about his person and every arrangement was made to surprise him at night in a garden in the rear of his quarters convey him to a boat and ferry him across the hudson on the appointed night lee with three dragoons and three led horses was in the woods of hoboken on the jersey shore waiting to receive the captive hour after hour passed awayno boat approachedday broke and the major with his dragoons and his led horses returned perplexed and disappointed to the camp it subsequently proved that on the day preceding the night fixed on for the capture arnold had removed his quarters to another part of the town and that the american legion consisting chiefly of american deserters had been transferred from their barracks to one of the transports among the troops thus transferred was john champe nor was he able for a long time to effect his escape and resume his real character of a loyal and patriotic soldier he was rewarded when he did so by the munificence of the commanderinchief and the admiration of his old comrades in arms  we have here to note the altered fortunes of the once prosperous general gates the sudden annihilation of an army from which so much had been expected and the retreat of the general before the field was absolutely lost appeared to demand a strict investigation congress therefore passed a resolution october 5th requiring washington to order a court of inquiry into the conduct of gates as commander of the southern army and to appoint some other officer to the command until the inquiry should be made washington at once selected greene for the important trust his choice was in concurrence with the expressed wishes of the delegates of the three southern states conveyed to him by one of their number  with regard to the court of inquiry baron steuben who was to accompany greene to the south was to preside and the members of the court were to be such general and fieldofficers of the continental troops as were not present at the battle of camden or having been present were not wanted as witnesses or were persons to whom general gates had no objection the affair was to be conducted with the greatest impartiality and with as much despatch as circumstances would permit  ravaging incursions from canada had harassed the northern parts of the state of new york of late and laid desolate some parts of the country from which washington had hoped to receive great supplies of flour for the armies major carleton a nephew of sir guy at the head of a motley force european tory and indian had captured forts anne and george sir john johnson also with joseph brant and a mongrel halfsavage crew had laid waste the fertile region of the mohawk river and burned the villages of schoharie and caughnawaga the greatest alarm prevailed throughout the neighboring country governor clinton himself took the field at the head of the militia but before he arrived at the scene of mischief the marauders had been encountered and driven back by general van rensselaer and the militia of those parts not however until they had nearly destroyed the settlements on the mohawk washington now put brigadiergeneral james clinton the governors brother in command of the northern department  the state of the army was growing more and more a subject of solicitude to the commanderinchief he felt weary of struggling on with such scanty means and such vast responsibility the campaign which at its commencement had seemed pregnant with favorable events had proved sterile and inactive and was drawing to a close the short terms for which most of the troops were enlisted must soon expire and then the present army would be reduced to a mere shadow to suppose writes he that this great revolution can be accomplished by a temporary army that this army will be subsisted by state supplies and that taxation alone is adequate to our wants is in my opinion absurd and as unreasonable as to expect an inversion in the order of nature to accommodate itself to our views if it was necessary it could be proved to any person of a moderate understanding that an annual army raised on the spur of the occasion besides being unqualified for the end designed is in various ways which could be enumerated ten times more expensive than a permanent body of men under good organization and military discipline which never was nor ever will be the case with new troops  we will here add that the repeated and elaborate reasonings of washington backed by dear bought experience slowly brought congress to adopt a system suggested by him for the organization and support of the army according to which troops were to be enlisted to serve throughout the war and all officers who continued in service until the return of peace were to receive half pay during life  the marquis lafayette at this time commanded the advance guard of washingtons army composed of six battalions of light infantry they were better clad than the other soldiery in trim uniforms leathern helmets with crests of horsehair the officers were armed with spontoons the noncommissioned officers with fusees both with short sabres which the marquis had brought from france and presented to them he was proud of his troops and had a young mans ardor for active service the inactivity which had prevailed for some time past was intolerable to him the marquis saw with repining the campaign drawing to a close and nothing done that would rouse the people in america and be spoken of at the court of versailles he was urgent with washington that the campaign should be terminated by some brilliant stroke complaints he hinted had been made in france of the prevailing inactivity the brilliant stroke suggested with some detail by the marquis was a general attack upon fort washington and the other posts at the north end of the island of new york and under certain circumstances which he specified make a push for the city  washington regarded the project of his young and ardent friend with a more sober and cautious eye it is impossible my dear marquis replies he to desire more ardently than i do to terminate the campaign by some happy stroke but we must consult our means rather than our wishes and not endeavor to better our affairs by attempting things which for want of success may make them worse it would in my opinion be imprudent to throw an army of ten thousand men upon an island against nine thousand exclusive of seamen and militia this from the accounts we have appears to be the enemys force all we can do at present therefore is to endeavor to gain a more certain knowledge of their situation and act accordingly  the british posts in question were accordingly reconnoitred from the opposite banks of the hudson by colonel gouvion an able french engineer preparations were made to carry the scheme into effect should it be determined upon when news was received of the unexpected and accidental appearance of several british armed vessels in the hudson the effect was to disconcert the plan and finally to cause it to be abandoned  some parts of the scheme were attended with success the veteran stark with a detachment of twentyfive hundred men made an extensive forage in westchester county and major tallmadge with eighty men chiefly dismounted dragoons of sheldons regiment crossed in boats from the connecticut shore to long island where the sound was twenty miles wide traversed the island on the night of the 22d of november surprised fort george at coram captured the garrison of fiftytwo men demolished the fort set fire to magazines of forage and recrossed the sound to fairfield without the loss of a man an achievement which drew forth a high eulogium from congress  at the end of november the army went into winterquarters the pennsylvania line in the neighborhood of morristown the jersey line about pompton the new england troops at west point and the other posts of the highlands and the new york line was stationed at albany to guard against any invasion from canada the french army remained stationed at newport excepting the duke of lauzuns legion which was cantoned at lebanon in connecticut washingtons headquarters were established at new windsor on the hudson  we will now turn to the south to note the course of affairs in that quarter during the last few months     chapter lix the war in the southbattle of kings mountain   cornwallis having as he supposed entirely crushed the rebel cause in south carolina by the defeats of gates and sumter remained for some time at camden detained by the excessive heat of the weather and the sickness of part of his troops broken down by the hardships of campaigning under a southern sun he awaited also supplies and reinforcements  immediately after the victory at camden he had ordered the friends to royalty in north carolina to arm and intercept the beaten army of general gates promising that he would march directly to the borders of that province in their support he now detached major patrick ferguson to its western confines to keep the war alive in that quarter this resolute partisan had with him his own corps of light infantry and a body of royalist militia of his own training his whole force was between eleven and twelve hundred men noted for activity and alertness and unincumbered with baggage or artillery his orders were to skirr the mountain country between the catawba and the yadkin harass the whigs inspirit the tories and embody the militia under the royal banner this done he was to repair to charlotte the capital of mecklenburg county where he would find lord cornwallis who intended to make it his rendezvous should he however in the course of his tour be threatened by a superior force he was immediately to return to the main army  during the suspense of his active operations in the field cornwallis instituted rigorous measures against americans who continued under arms among these were included many who had taken refuge in north carolina a commissioner was appointed to take possession of their estates and property of the annual product of which a part was to be allowed for the support of their families the residue to be applied to the maintenance of the war letters from several of the principal inhabitants of charleston having been found in the baggage of the captured american generals the former were accused of breaking their parole and holding a treasonable correspondence with the armed enemies of england they were in consequence confined on board of prison ships and afterwards transported to st augustine in florida among the prisoners taken in the late combats many it was discovered had british protections in their pockets these were deemed amenable to the penalties of the proclamation issued by sir henry clinton on the 3d of june they were therefore led forth from the provost and hanged almost without the form of an inquiry these measures certainly were not in keeping with the character for moderation and benevolence usually given to lord cornwallis but they accorded with the rancorous spirit manifested toward each other both by whigs and tories in southern warfare  cornwallis decamped from camden and set out for north carolina in the subjugation of that province he counted on the cooperation of the troops which sir henry clinton was to send to the lower part of virginia which after reducing the virginians to obedience were to join his lordships standard on the confines of north carolina advancing into the latter province he took post at charlotte where he had given rendezvous to ferguson the surrounding country was wild and rugged covered with close and thick woods and crossed in every direction by narrow roads the inhabitants were stanch whigs with the pugnacious spirit of the old covenanters instead of remaining at home and receiving the kings money in exchange for their produce they turned out with their rifles stationed themselves in covert places and fired upon the foraging parties convoys of provisions from camden had to fight their way and expresses were shot down and their despatches seized  the capture of his expresses was a sore annoyance to cornwallis depriving him of all intelligence concerning the movements of colonel ferguson whose arrival he was anxiously awaiting the expedition of that doughty partisan officer here calls for especial notice he had been chosen for this military tour as being calculated to gain friends by his conciliating disposition and manners he however had a loyal hatred of whigs and to his standard flocked many rancorous tories besides outlaws and desperadoes so that his progress through the country was attended by many exasperating excesses  he was on his way to join cornwallis when a chance for a signal exploit presented itself an american force under colonel elijah clarke of georgia was retreating to the mountain districts of north carolina after an unsuccessful attack upon the british post at augusta ferguson resolved to cut off their retreat turning towards the mountains he made his way through a rugged wilderness and took post at gilberttown a small frontier village of loghouses all of a sudden say the british chroniclers just cited a numerous fierce and unexpected enemy sprung up in the depths of the desert the scattered inhabitants of the mountains assembled without noise or warning under the conduct of six or seven of their militia colonels to the number of six hundred strong daring wellmounted and excellent horsemen  these were the people of the mountains which form the frontiers of the carolinas and georgia mountain men as they were commonly called a hardy race half huntsmen half herdsmen beside these there were other elements of war suddenly gathering in fergusons vicinity a band of what were termed the wild and fierce inhabitants of kentucky with men from other settlements west of the alleghanies had crossed the mountains led by colonels campbell and boone to pounce upon a quantity of indian goods at augusta but had pulled up on hearing of the repulse of clarke the stout yeomen also of the district of ninetysix roused by the marauds of ferguson had taken the field under the conduct of colonel james williams of granville county here too were hardriders and sharpshooters from holston river powels valley botetourt fincastle and other parts of virginia commanded by colonels campbell cleveland shelby and sevier such were the different bodies of mountaineers and backwoodsmen suddenly drawing together from various parts to the number of three thousand  in this exigency ferguson remembered the instructions of cornwallis that he should rejoin him should he find himself threatened by a superior force breaking up his quarters therefore he pushed for the british army sending messengers ahead to apprise his lordship of his danger unfortunately for him his missives were intercepted gilberttown had not long been vacated by ferguson and his troops when the motley host we have described thronged in some were on foot but the greater part on horseback some were in homespun garb but the most part in huntingshirts each man had his long rifle and huntingknife his wallet or knapsack and blanket and either a bucks tail or sprig of evergreen in his hat there was neither tent nor tent equipage neither baggage nor baggagewagon to encumber the movements of that extemporaneous host being told that ferguson had retreated by the cherokee road toward north carolina about nine hundred of the hardiest and best mounted set out in urgent pursuit leaving those who were on foot or weakly mounted to follow on as fast as possible colonel william campbell of virginia having come from the greatest distance was allowed to have command of the whole party but there was not much order nor subordination each colonel led his own men in his own way  a rapid and irregular march was kept up all night in murky darkness and through a heavy rain about daybreak they crossed broad river where an attack was apprehended not finding the enemy they halted lit their fires made their mornings meal and took a brief repose by nine oclock they were again on the march the rainy night had been succeeded by a bright october morning and all were in high spirits ferguson they learnt had taken the road toward kings mountain about twelve miles distant when within three miles of it their scouts brought in word that he had taken post on its summit the officers now held a short consultation on horseback and then proceeded the position taken by ferguson was a strong one kings mountain rises out of a broken country and is detached on the north from inferior heights by a deep valley so as to resemble an insulated promontory about half a mile in length with sloping sides excepting on the north the mountain was covered for the most part with lofty forest trees free from underwood interspersed with boulders and masses of gray rock the forest was sufficiently open to give free passage to horsemen  dismounting at a small stream which runs through a ravine the americans picketed their horses or tied them to the branches of the trees and gave them in charge of a small guard they then formed themselves into three divisions of nearly equal size and prepared to storm the heights on three sides campbell seconded by shelby was to lead the centre division sevier with mcdowell the right and cleveland and williams the left the divisions were to scale the mountain as nearly as possible at the same time the fighting directions were in frontier stylewhen once in action everyone must act for himself the men were not to wait for the word of command but to take good aim and fire as fast as possible when they could no longer hold their ground they were to get behind trees or retreat a little and return to the fight but never to go quite off  campbell allowed time for the flanking divisions to move to the right and left along the base of the mountain and take their proper distances he then pushed up in front with the centre division he and shelby each at the head of his men the first firing was about four oclock when a picket was driven in by cleveland and williams on the left and pursued up the mountain campbell soon arrived within rifle distance of the crest of the mountain whence a sheeted fire of musketry was opened upon him he instantly deployed his men posted them behind trees and returned the fire with deadly effect ferguson rushed out with his regulars made an impetuous charge with the bayonet and dislodging his assailants from their coverts began to drive them down the mountain they not having a bayonet among them he had not proceeded far when a flanking fire was opened by one of the other divisions facing about and attacking this he was again successful when a third fire was opened from another quarter thus as fast as one division gave way before the bayonet another came to its relief while those who had given way rallied and returned to the charge ferguson found that he was completely in the hunters toils beset on every side but he stood bravely at bay until the ground around him was strewed with the killed and wounded picked off by the fatal rifle his men were at length broken and retreated in confusion along the ridge he galloped from place to place endeavoring to rally them when a rifle ball brought him to the ground and his white horse was seen careering down the mountain without a rider  this closed the bloody fight for fergusons second in command seeing all further resistance hopeless hoisted a white flag beat a parley and sued for quarters one hundred and fifty of the enemy had fallen and as many been wounded while of the americans but twenty were killed though a considerable number were wounded among those slain was colonel james williams who had commanded the troops of ninetysix and proved himself one of the most daring of the partisan leaders eight hundred and ten men were taken prisoners one hundred of whom were regulars the rest royalists the rancor awakened by civil war was shown in the treatment of some of the prisoners a courtmartial was held the day after the battle and a number of tory prisoners who had been bitter in their hostility to the american cause and flagitious in their persecution of their countrymen were hanged this was to revenge the death of american prisoners hanged at camden and elsewhere  the army of mountaineers and frontier men thus fortuitously congregated did not attempt to follow up their signal blow they had no general scheme no plan of campaign it was the spontaneous rising of the sons of the soil to revenge it on its invaders and having effected their purpose they returned in triumph to their homes they were little aware of the importance of their achievement the battle of kings mountain inconsiderable as it was in the numbers engaged turned the tide of southern warfare the destruction of ferguson and his corps gave a complete check to the expedition of cornwallis he began to fear for the safety of south carolina liable to such sudden irruptions from the mountains lest while he was facing to the north these hordes of starkriding warriors might throw themselves behind him and produce a popular combustion in the province he had left he resolved therefore to return with all speed to that province and provide for its security  on the 14th of october he commenced his retrograde and mortifying march conducting it in the night and with such hurry and confusion that nearly twenty wagons laden with baggage and supplies were lost as he proceeded the rainy season set in the brooks and rivers became swollen and almost impassable the roads deep and miry provisions and forage scanty the troops generally sickly having no tents at length the army arrived at winnsborough in south carolina hence by order of cornwallis lord rawdon wrote on the 24th october to brigadiergeneral leslie who was at that time in the chesapeake with the force detached by sir henry clinton for a descent upon virginia suggesting the expediency of his advancing to north carolina for the purpose of cooperation with cornwallis who feared to proceed far from south carolina lest it should be again in insurrection  the victory at kings mountain had set the partisan spirit throughout the country in a blaze francis marion was soon in the field he had been made a brigadiergeneral by governor rutledge but his brigade as it was called was formed of neighbors and friends and was continually fluctuating in numbers he was nearly fifty years of age and small of stature but hardy healthy and vigorous he had his haunts and strongholds in the morasses of the pedee and black river his men were hardy and abstemious as himself they ate their meat without salt often subsisted on potatoes were scantily clad and almost destitute of blankets marion was full of stratagems and expedients sallying forth from his morasses he would overrun the lower districts pass the santee beat up the small posts in the vicinity of charleston cut up the communication between that city and camden and having struck some signal blow so as to rouse the vengeance of the enemy would retreat again into his fenny fastnesses hence the british gave him the byename of the swamp fox but those of his countrymen who knew his courage his loftiness of spirit and spotless integrity considered him the bayard of the south  tarleton who was on duty in that part of the country undertook as he said to draw the swamp fox from his cover he accordingly marched cautiously down the east bank of the wateree with a body of dragoons and infantry in compact order the fox however kept close he saw that the enemy was too strong for him tarleton now changed his plan by day he broke up his force into small detachments or patrols giving them orders to keep near enough to each other to render mutual support if attacked and to gather together at night the artifice had its effect marion sallied forth from his covert just before daybreak to make an attack upon one of these detachments when to his surprise he found himself close upon the british camp perceiving the snare that had been spread for him he made a rapid retreat a close pursuit took place for seven hours marion was hunted from one swamp and fastness to another several stragglers of his band were captured and tarleton was in strong hope of bringing him into action when an express came spurring from cornwallis calling for the immediate services of himself and his dragoons in another quarter  sumter was again in the field that indefatigable partisan having recruited a strong party in the mountainous country to which he retreated after his defeat on the wateree had reappeared on the west side of the santee repulsed a british party sent against him killing its leader then crossing broad river had effected a junction with colonels clark and brannan and now menaced the british posts in the district of ninetysix  it was to disperse this head of partisan war that tarleton was called off from beleaguering marion advancing with his accustomed celerity he thought to surprise sumter on the enoree river a deserter apprised the latter of his danger he pushed across the river but was hotly pursued and his rearguard roughly handled he now made for the tyger river noted for turbulence and rapidity once beyond this he might disband his followers in the woods tarleton to prevent his passing it unmolested spurred forward in advance of his main body with one hundred and seventy dragoons and eighty mounted men of the infantry before five oclock nov 20th his advanced guard overtook and charged the rear of the americans who retreated to the main body sumter finding it impossible to cross tyger river in safety took post on black stock hill with a rivulet and rail fence in front the tyger river in the rear and on the right flank and a large log barn on the left the barn was turned into a fortress and a part of the force stationed in it to fire through the apertures between the logs  tarleton halted on an opposite height to await the arrival of his infantry and part of his men dismounted to ease their horses sumter seized this moment for an attack he was driven back after some sharp fighting the enemy pursued but were severely galled by the fire from the log barn enraged at seeing his men shot down tarleton charged with his cavalry but found it impossible to dislodge the americans from their rustic fortress at the approach of night he fell back to join his infantry leaving the ground strewed with his killed and wounded the loss of the americans was only three killed and four wounded sumter who had received a severe wound in the breast remained several hours on the field of action but understanding the enemy would be powerfully reinforced in the morning he crossed the tyger river in the night he was then placed on a litter between two horses and thus conducted across the country by a few faithful adherents the rest of his little army dispersed themselves through the woods  while the attention of the enemy was thus engaged by the enterprises of sumter and marion and their swamp warriors general gates was gathering together the scattered fragments of his army at hillsborough the vanity of gates was completely cut down by his late reverses to add to his depression of spirits he received the melancholy intelligence of the death of an only son and while he was yet writhing under the blow came official despatches informing him of his being superseded in command a letter from washington we are told accompanied them sympathizing with him in his domestic misfortunes adverting with peculiar delicacy to his reverses in battle assuring him of his undiminished confidence in his zeal and capacity the effect of this letter was overpowering gates was found walking about his room in the greatest agitation pressing the letter to his lips breaking forth into ejaculations of gratitude and admiration and when he could find utterance to his thoughts declared that its tender sympathy and considerate delicacy had conveyed more consolation and delight to his heart than he had believed it possible ever to have felt again  general greene arrived at charlotte on the 2d of december on his way from the north he had made arrangements for supplies from the different states and had left the baron steuben in virginia to defend that state and procure and send on reinforcements and stores for the southern army on the day following his arrival greene took formal command the delicacy with which he conducted himself towards his unfortunate predecessor is said to have been edifying to the army consulting with his officers as to the court of inquiry on the conduct of general gates ordered by congress it was determined that there was not a sufficient number of general officers in camp to sit upon it that the state of general gates feelings in consequence of the death of his son disqualified him from entering upon the task of his defence and that it would be indelicate in the extreme to press on him an investigation which his honor would not permit him to defer gates in fact when informed in the most delicate manner of the order of congress was urgent that a court of inquiry should be immediately convened he acknowledged there was some important evidence that could not at present be procured but he relied on the honor and justice of the court to make allowance for the deficiency he was ultimately brought to acquiesce in the decision of the council of war for the postponement but declared that he could not think of serving until the matter should have been properly investigated he determined to pass the interim on his estate in virginia  the whole force at charlotte when greene took command did not much exceed twentythree hundred men and more than half of them were militia it had been broken in spirit by the recent defeat the officers had fallen into habits of negligence the soldiers were loose and disorderly without tents and camp equipage badly clothed and fed and prone to relieve their necessities by depredating upon the inhabitants  a recent exploit had given some animation to the troops lieutenantcolonel washington detached with a troop of lighthorse to check a foraging party of the enemy scoured the country within thirteen miles of camden here he found a body of loyalist militia strongly posted at clermont the seat of colonel rugeley their tory commander they had ensconced themselves in a large barn built of logs and had fortified it by a slight intrenchment and a line of abatis to attack it with cavalry was useless colonel washington dismounted part of his troops to appear like infantry placed on two wagonwheels the trunk of a pinetree shaped and painted to look like a fieldpiece brought it to bear upon the enemy and displaying his cavalry sent in a flag summoning the garrison to surrender instantly on pain of having their log castle battered about their ears the garrison to the number of one hundred and twelve men with colonel rugeley at their head gave themselves up prisoners of war  the first care of general greene was to reorganize his army he went to work quietly but resolutely called no councils of war communicated his plans and intentions to few and such only as were able and willing to aid in executing them finding the country round charlotte exhausted by repeated foragings he separated the army into two divisions one about one thousand strong was commanded by brigadiergeneral morgan of rifle renown and was composed of four hundred continental infantry under lieutenantcolonel howard of the maryland line two companies of virginia militia under captains tripplet and tate and one hundred dragoons under lieutenantcolonel washington with these morgan was detached towards the district of ninetysix in south carolina with orders to take a position near the confluence of the pacolet and broad rivers and assemble the militia of the country with the other division greene made a march of toilful difficulty through a barren country to hicks creek in chesterfield district on the east side of the pedee river opposite the cheraw hills there he posted himself on the 26th partly to discourage the enemy from attempting to possess themselves of cross creek which would give them command of the greatest part of the provisions of the lower countrypartly to form a camp of repose     chapter lx hostilities in the southmutiny   the occurrences recorded in the last few pages made washington apprehend a design on the part of the enemy to carry the stress of war into the southern states conscious that he was the man to whom all looked in time of emergency and who was in a manner responsible for the general course of military affairs he deeply felt the actual impotency of his position in a letter to franklin who was ministerplenipotentiary at the court of versailles he strongly expresses his chagrin latterly we have been obliged to become spectators of a succession of detachments from the army at new york in aid of lord cornwallis while our naval weakness and the political dissolution of a great part of our army put it out of our power to counteract them at the southward or to take advantage of them here  the last of these detachments to the south took place on the 20th of december but was not destined as washington had supposed for carolina sir henry clinton had received information that the troops already mentioned as being under general leslie in the chesapeake had by orders from cornwallis sailed for charleston to reinforce his lordship and this detachment was to take their place in virginia it was composed of british german and refugee troops about seventeen hundred strong and was commanded by benedict arnold now a brigadiergeneral in his majestys service sir henry clinton who distrusted the fidelity of the man he had corrupted sent with him colonels dundas and simcoe experienced officers by whose advice he was to be guided in every important measure he was to make an incursion into virginia destroy the public magazines assemble and arm the loyalists and hold himself ready to cooperate with lord cornwallis  as washington beheld one hostile armament after another winging its way to the south and received applications from that quarter for assistance which he had not the means to furnish it became painfully apparent to him that the efforts to carry on the war had exceeded the natural capabilities of the country its widely diffused population and the composition and temper of some of its people rendered it difficult to draw together its resources commerce was almost extinct there was not sufficient natural wealth on which to found a revenue paper currency had depreciated through want of funds for its redemption until it was nearly worthless the mode of supplying the army by assessing a proportion of the productions of the earth had proved ineffectual oppressive and productive of an alarming opposition domestic loans yielded but trifling assistance these considerations washington was continually urging upon the attention of congress in his full and perspicuous manner the end of which was to enforce his opinion that a foreign loan was indispensably necessary to a continuance of the war his earnest counsels and entreaties were at length successful in determining congress to seek aid both in men and money from abroad accordingly on the 28th of december they commissioned lieutenantcolonel john laurens special minister at the court of versailles to apply for such aid the situation he had held as aidedecamp to the commanderinchief had given him an opportunity of observing the course of affairs and acquainting himself with the wants and resources of the country and he was instructed to confer with washington previous to his departure as to the objects of his mission scarce had colonel laurens been appointed when a painful occurrence proved the urgent necessity of the required aid  in the arrangement for winterquarters the pennsylvania line consisting of six regiments was hutted near morristown these troops had experienced the hardships and privations common to the whole army but had an additional grievance peculiar to themselves many of them had enlisted to serve for three years or during war that is to say for less than three years should the war cease in less time when however having served for three years they sought their discharge the officers loth to lose such experienced soldiers interpreted the terms of enlistment to mean three years or to the end of the war should it continue for a longer time this chicanery naturally produced great exasperation  the first day of the new year arrived the men were excited by an extra allowance of ardent spirits in the evening at a preconcerted signal a great part of the pennsylvania line noncommissioned officers included turned out under arms declaring their intention to march to philadelphia and demand redress from congress wayne endeavored to pacify them they were no longer to be pacified by words three regiments which had taken no part in the mutiny were paraded under their officers the mutineers compelled them to join their ranks their number being increased to about thirteen hundred they seized upon six fieldpieces and set out in the night for philadelphia under command of their sergeants  fearing the enemy might take advantage of this outbreak wayne detached a jersey brigade to chatham and ordered the militia to be called out there alarm fires were kindled upon the hills alarm guns boomed from post to post the country was soon on the alert wayne was not mad anthony on the present occasion all his measures were taken with judgment and forecast he sent provisions after the mutineers lest they should supply their wants from the country people by force two officers of rank spurred to philadelphia to apprise congress of the approach of the insurgents and put it upon its guard wayne sent a despatch with news of the outbreak to washington he then mounted his horse and accompanied by colonels butler and stewart two officers popular with the troops set off after the mutineers either to bring them to a halt or to keep with them and seek every occasion to exert a favorable influence over them  in the meantime sir henry clinton received intelligence at new york of the mutiny and hastened to profit by it emissaries were despatched to the camp of the mutineers holding out offers of pardon protection and ample pay if they would return to their allegiance to the crown  general wayne and his companions colonels butler and stewart had overtaken the insurgent troops on the 3d of january at middlebrook they were proceeding in military form under the control of a selfconstituted board of sergeants whose orders were implicitly obeyed conferences were held by wayne with sergeants delegated from each regiment they appeared to be satisfied with the mode and promises of redress held out to them but the main body of the mutineers persisted in revolt and proceeded on the next day to princeton their proceedings continued to be orderly military forms were still observed they obeyed their leaders behaved well to the people of the country and committed no excesses general wayne and colonels butler and stewart remained with them in an equivocal position popular but without authority and almost in durance the insurgents professed themselves still ready to march under them against the enemy but would permit none other of their former officers to come among them the marquis de lafayette general st clair and colonel laurens the newlyappointed minister to france arrived at the camp and were admitted but afterwards were ordered away at a short notice  the news of the revolt caused great consternation in philadelphia a committee of congress set off to meet the insurgents accompanied by reed the president of pennsylvania and one or two other officers and escorted by a city troop of horse the committee halted at trenton whence president reed wrote to wayne requesting a personal interview at four oclock in the afternoon at four miles distance from princeton wayne was moreover told to inform the troops that he reed would be there to receive any propositions from them and redress any injuries they might have sustained but that after the indignities they had offered to the marquis and general st clair he could not venture to put himself in their power wayne knowing that the letter was intended for his troops more than for himself read it publicly on the parade it had a good effect upon the sergeants and many of the men still it was not thought prudent for president reed to trust himself within their camp wayne promised to meet him on the following day 7th though it seemed uncertain whether he was master of himself or whether he was not a kind of prisoner  at this critical juncture two of sir henrys emissaries arrived in the camp and delivered to the leaders of the malcontents a paper containing his seductive proposals and promises the mutineers though openly arrayed in arms against their government spurned at the idea of turning arnolds as they termed it the emissaries were seized and conducted to general wayne who placed them in confinement promising that they should be liberated should the pending negotiation fail this incident had a great effect in inspiring hope of the ultimate loyalty of the troops and the favorable representations of the temper of the men made by general wayne in a personal interview determined president reed to venture among them  the propositions now offered to the troops wereto discharge all those who had enlisted indefinitely for three years or during the war the fact to be inquired into by three commissioners appointed by the executive to give immediate certificates for the deficit in their pay caused by the depreciation of the currency and the arrearages to be settled as soon as circumstances would permit to furnish them immediately with certain specified articles of clothing which were most wanted  these propositions proving satisfactory the troops set out for trenton where the negotiation was concluded the two spies who had tampered with the fidelity of the troops were tried by a courtmartial found guilty and hanged at the crossroads near trenton  the accommodation entered into with the mutineers of the pennsylvania line appeared to washington of doubtful policy and likely to have a pernicious effect on the whole army his apprehensions were soon justified by events on the night of the 20th of january a part of the jersey troops stationed at pompton rose in arms claiming the same terms just yielded to the pennsylvanians for a time it was feared the revolt would spread throughout the line in this instance washington adopted a more rigorous course than in the other the present insurgents were not so formidable in point of numbers as the pennsylvanians the greater part of them also were foreigners for whom he felt less sympathy than for native troops a detachment from the massachusetts line was sent under majorgeneral howe who was instructed to compel the mutineers to unconditional submission to grant them no terms while in arms or in a state of resistance and on their surrender instantly to execute a few of the most active and incendiary leaders  his orders were punctually obeyed and were crowned with complete success howe had the good fortune after a tedious night march to surprise the mutineers napping in their huts just at daybreak five minutes only were allowed them to parade without their arms and give up their ringleaders this was instantly complied with and two of them were executed on the spot thus the mutiny was quelled the officers resumed their command and all things were restored to order  a great cause of satisfaction to washington was the ratification of the articles of confederation between the states which took place not long after this agitating juncture a set of articles had been submitted to congress by dr franklin as far back as 1775 a form had been prepared and digested by a committee in 1776 and agreed upon with some modifications in 1777 but had ever since remained in abeyance in consequence of objections made by individual states the confederation was now complete and washington in a letter to the president of congress congratulated him and the body over which he presided on an event long wished for and which he hoped would have the happiest effects upon the politics of this country and be of essential service to our cause in europe                                       the armament under command of arnold met with that boisterous weather which often rages along our coast in the winter his ships were tempest tost and scattered and half of his cavalry horses and several of his guns had to be thrown overboard it was the close of the year when he anchored in the chesapeake  virginia at the time was almost in a defenceless state baron steuben who had the general command there had recently detached such of his regular troops as were clothed and equipped to the south to reinforce general greene governor jefferson on hearing of the arrival of the fleet called out the militia from the neighboring counties but few could be collected on the spur of the moment for the whole country was terrorstricken and in confusion having land and sea forces at his command arnold opened the new year with a buccaneering ravage ascending james river with some small vessels which he had captured he landed on the 4th of january with nine hundred men at westover about twentyfive miles below richmond and pushed for the latter place at that time little more than a village though the metropolis of virginia  it was arnolds hope to capture the governor but the latter after providing for the security of as much as possible of the public stores had left richmond the evening before on horseback to join his family at tuckahoe whence on the following day he conveyed them to a place of safety governor jefferson got back by noon to manchester on the opposite side of james river in time to see arnolds marauders march into the town arnold sent some of the citizens to the governor offering to spare the town provided his ships might come up james river to be laden with tobacco from the warehouses his offer was indignantly rejected whereupon fire was set to the public edifices stores and workshops private houses were pillaged and a great quantity of tobacco consumed  while this was going on colonel simcoe had been detached to westham six miles up the river where he destroyed a cannon foundry and sacked a public magazine and after effecting a complete devastation rejoined arnold at richmond having completed his ravage arnold reembarked at westover and fell slowly down the river landing occasionally to burn plunder and destroy pursued by steuben with a few continental troops and all the militia that he could muster general nelson also with similar levies opposed him lower down the river some skirmishing took place a few of arnolds troops were killed and a number wounded but he made his way to portsmouth opposite norfolk where he took post on the 20th of january and proceeded to fortify steuben would have attempted to drive him from this position but his means were totally inadequate collecting from various parts of the country all the force that could be mustered he so disposed it at different points as to hem the traitor in and prevent his making further incursions  about this time an important resolution was adopted in congress washington had repeatedly in his communications to that body attributed much of the distresses and disasters of the war to the congressional mode of conducting business through committees and boards thus causing irregularity and delay preventing secrecy and augmenting expense he was greatly rejoiced therefore when congress decided to appoint heads of departments secretaries of foreign affairs of war and of marine and a superintendent of finance i am happy thrice happy on private as well as public account writes he to find that these are in train for it will ease my shoulders of an immense burthen which the deranged and perplexed situation of our affairs and the distresses of every department of the army had placed upon them  colonel hamilton was suggested to take charge of the department of finance and washington in reply to general sullivan who had sounded him on the subject spoke in warm terms of his fitness for the post a few days after washington had penned this eulogium a scene occurred between him and colonel hamilton that gave him deep chagrin washington in passing hamilton on the stairs informed him that he wished to speak to him hamilton allowed some circumstances to delay his compliance with this request and washington when they met accosted him with warmth colonel hamilton said he you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these ten minutes i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect hamilton promptly replied i am not conscious of it sir but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part and they separated washington soon after sent to hamilton stating his desire in a candid conversation to heal a difference which could not have happened but in a moment of passion but hamilton had long determined according to his own statement that if a breach should occur between them not to consent to an accommodation he was ambitious of an independent position and declared that he had always disliked the office of an aidedecamp but although a coolness ensued between washington and his favorite aide it proved but temporary the friendship between these illustrious men was destined to survive the revolution and to signalize itself through many eventful years     chapter lxi battle of the cowpensbattle of guilford courthouse   the stress of war as washington apprehended was at present shifted to the south in a former chapter we left general greene in the latter part of december posted with one division of his army on the east side of the pedee river in north carolina having detached general morgan with the other division one thousand strong to take post near the confluence of the pacolet and broad rivers in south carolina  cornwallis lay encamped about seventy miles to the southwest of greene at winnsborough in fairfield district general leslie had recently arrived at charleston from virginia and was advancing to reinforce him with fifteen hundred men this would give cornwallis such a superiority of force that he prepared for a second invasion of north carolina his plan was to leave lord rawdon at the central post of camden with a considerable body of troops to keep all quiet while his lordship by rapid marches would throw himself between greene and virginia cut him off from all reinforcements in that quarter and oblige him either to make battle with his present force or retreat precipitately from north carolina by recent information he learnt that morgan had passed both the catawba and broad rivers and was about seventy miles to the northwest of him on his way to the district of ninetysix as he might prove extremely formidable if left in his rear tarleton was sent in quest of him with about three hundred and fifty of his famous cavalry a corps of legion and light infantry and a number of the royal artillery with two fieldpieces about eleven hundred choice troops in all  cornwallis moved with his main force on the 12th of december in a northwest direction between the broad river and the catawba leading toward the back country this was for the purpose of crossing the great rivers at their fords near their sources for they are fed by innumerable petty streams which drain the mountains and are apt in the winter time when storms of rain prevail to swell and become impassable below their forks he took this route also to cut off morgans retreat or prevent his junction with greene should tarletons expedition fail of its object  tarleton after several days hard marching came upon the traces of morgan who was posted on the north bank of the pacolet to guard the passes of that river he sent word to cornwallis of his intention to force a passage across the river and compel morgan either to fight or retreat and suggested that his lordship should proceed up the eastern bank of broad river so as to be at hand to cooperate his lordship in consequence took up a position at turkey creek on broad river  morgan had been recruited by north carolina and georgia militia so that his force was nearly equal in number to that of tarleton but in point of cavalry and discipline vastly inferior cornwallis too was on his left and might get in his rear checking his impulse therefore to dispute the passage of the pacolet he crossed that stream and retreated towards the upper fords of broad river tarleton reached the pacolet on the evening of the 15th and pressed on in pursuit at ten oclock at night he reached an encampment which morgan had abandoned a few hours previously apparently in great haste for the camp fires were still smoking and provisions had been left behind halfcooked eager to come upon his enemy while in the confusion of a hurried flight tarleton allowed his exhausted troops but a brief repose and leaving his baggage under a guard resumed his dogged march about two oclock in the night a little before daylight of the 17th he captured two videttes from whom he learnt to his surprise that morgan instead of a headlong retreat had taken a nights repose and was actually preparing to give him battle  morgan in fact had been urged by his officers to retreat across broad river which was near by and make for the mountainous country but closely pressed as he was he feared to be overtaken while fording the river and while his troops were fatigued and in confusion beside being now nearly equal in number to the enemy military pride would not suffer him to avoid a combat the place where he came to halt was known in the early grants by the name of hannahs cowpens being part of a grazing establishment of a man named hannah it was in an open wood favorable to the action of cavalry there were two eminences of unequal height and separated from each other by an interval about eighty yards wide to the first eminence which was the highest there was an easy ascent of about three hundred yards on these heights morgan had posted himself  in arranging his troops for action he drew out his infantry in two lines the first was composed of the north and south carolina militia under colonel pickens having an advanced corps of north carolina and georgia volunteer riflemen this line on which he had the least dependence was charged to wait until the enemy were within dead shot then to take good aim fire two volleys and fall back the second line drawn up a moderate distance in the rear of the first and near the brow of the main eminence was composed of colonel howards light infantry and the virginia riflemen all continental troops they were informed of the orders which had been given to the first line lest they should mistake their falling back for a retreat colonel howard had the command of this line on which the greatest reliance was placed about a hundred and fifty yards in the rear of the second line and on the slope of the lesser eminence was colonel washingtons troop of cavalry about eighty strong with about fifty mounted carolinian volunteers under major mccall armed with sabres and pistols  it was about eight oclock in the morning jan 17th when tarleton came up the position of the americans seemed to him to give great advantage to his cavalry and he made hasty preparation for immediate attack anticipating an easy victory part of his infantry he formed into a line with dragoons on each flank the rest of the infantry and cavalry were to be a reserve and to wait for orders impetuous at all times he did not even wait until the reserve could be placed but led on his first line which rushed shouting to the attack the north carolina and georgia riflemen in the advance delivered their fire with effect and fell back to the flanks of pickens militia these as they had been instructed waited until the enemy were within fifty yards and then made a destructive volley but soon gave way before the push of the bayonet the british infantry pressed up to the second line while forty of their cavalry attacked it on the right seeking to turn its flank colonel howard seeing himself in danger of being outflanked endeavored to change his front to the right his orders were misunderstood and his troops were falling into confusion when morgan rode up and ordered them to retreat over the hill where colonel washingtons cavalry were hurried forward for their protection  the british seeing the troops retiring over the hill rushed forward irregularly in pursuit of what they deemed a routed foe to their astonishment they were met by colonel washingtons dragoons who spurred on them impetuously while howards infantry facing about gave them an effective volley of musketry and then charged with the bayonet the enemy now fell into complete confusion some few artillerymen attempted to defend their guns but were cut down or taken prisoners and the cannon and colors captured a panic seized upon the british troops tarleton endeavored to bring his legion cavalry into action to retrieve the day they had stood aloof as a reserve and now infected by the panic turned their backs upon their commander and galloped off through the woods riding over the flying infantry fourteen of his officers however and forty of his dragoons remained true to him with these he attempted to withstand the attack of washingtons cavalry and a fierce mel√©e took place but on the approach of howards infantry tarleton gave up all for lost and spurred off with his few but faithful adherents trusting to the speed of their horses for safety  the loss of the british in this action was ten officers and above one hundred men killed two hundred wounded and between five and six hundred rank and file made prisoners while the americans had but twelve men killed and sixty wounded the spoils taken by morgan according to his own account were two fieldpieces two standards eight hundred muskets one traveling forge thirtyfive wagons seventy negroes upwards of one hundred dragoonhorses and all the music the enemy however had destroyed most of their baggage which was immense  morgan did not linger on the field of battle leaving colonel pickens with a body of militia under the protection of a flag to bury the dead and provide for the wounded of both armies he set out the same day about noon with his prisoners and spoils lord cornwallis with his main force was at turkey creek only twentyfive miles distant and must soon hear of the late battle his object was to get to the catawba before he could be intercepted by his lordship who lay nearer than he did to the fords of that river before nightfall he crossed broad river at the cherokee ford and halted for a few hours on its northern bank before daylight of the 18th he was again on the march colonel washington who had been in pursuit of the enemy rejoined him in the course of the day as also did colonel pickens who had left such of the wounded as could not be moved under the protection of the flag of truce  cornwallis on the eventful day of the 17th was at his camp on turkey creek confidently waiting for tidings from tarleton of a new triumph when towards evening some of his routed dragoons came straggling into camp haggard and forlorn to tell the tale of his defeat it was a thunderstroke tarleton defeated and by the rude soldier he had been so sure of entrapping it seemed incredible it was confirmed however the next morning by the arrival of tarleton himself discomfited and crestfallen in his account of the recent battle he represented the force under morgan to be two thousand this exaggerated estimate together with the idea that the militia would now be out in great force rendered his lordship cautious he remained a day or two at turkey creek to collect the scattered remains of tarletons forces and to await the arrival of general leslie  on the 19th having been rejoined by leslie his lordship moved towards kings creek and thence in the direction of kings mountain until informed of morgans retreat toward the catawba cornwallis now altered his course in that direction and trusting that morgan encumbered as he supposed him to be by prisoners and spoils might be overtaken before he could cross that river detached a part of his force without baggage in pursuit of him while he followed on with the remainder  nothing say the british chroniclers could exceed the exertions of the detachment but morgan succeeded in reaching the catawba and crossing it in the evening just two hours before those in pursuit of him arrived on its banks a heavy rain came on and fell all night and by daybreak the river was so swollen as to be impassable it continued for several days and gave morgan time to send off his prisoners who had crossed several miles above and to call out the militia of mecklenburg and rowan counties to guard the fords of the river  lord cornwallis had moved slowly with his main body he was encumbered by an immense train of baggage the roads were through deep red clay and the country was cut up by streams and morasses it was not until the 25th that he assembled his whole force at ramsours mills on the little catawba as the south fork of that river is called and learnt that morgan had crossed the main stream now he felt the loss he had sustained in the late defeat of tarleton of a great part of his light troops in this crippled condition he determined to relieve his army of everything that could impede rapid movement in his future operations two days therefore were spent by him at ramsours mills in destroying all such baggage and stores as could possibly be spared  general greene was gladdened by a letter from morgan written shortly after his defeat of tarleton and transmitted the news to washington with his own generous comments he had recently received intelligence of the landing of troops at wilmington from a british squadron supposed to be a force under arnold destined to push up cape fear river and cooperate with cornwallis he had to prepare therefore not only to succor morgan but to prevent this cooperation he accordingly detached general stevens with his virginia militia whose term of service was nearly expired to take charge of morgans prisoners and conduct them to charlottesville in virginia at the same time he wrote to the governors of north carolina and virginia for all the aid they could furnish to steuben to hasten forward his recruits and to shelby campbell and others to take arms once more and rival their achievements at kings mountain  this done he left general huger in command of the division on the pedee with orders to hasten on by forced marches to salisbury to join the other division in the meantime he set off on horseback for morgans camp attended merely by a guide an aidedecamp and a sergeants guard of dragoons his object was to aid morgan in assembling militia and checking the enemy until the junction of his forces could be effected it was a hard ride of upwards of a hundred miles through a rough country on the last day of january he reached morgans camp at sherrards ford on the east side of the catawba the british army lay on the opposite side of the river but a few miles distant from it and appeared to be making preparations to force a passage across as it was subsiding and would soon be fordable greene supposed cornwallis had in view a junction with arnold at cape fear he wrote therefore to general huger to hurry on so that with their united forces they could give his lordship a defeat before he could effect the junction  more correct information relieved him from the apprehension of a cooperation of arnold and cornwallis the british troops which had landed at wilmington were merely a small detachment sent from charleston to establish a military depot for the use of cornwallis in his southern campaign they had taken possession of wilmington without opposition greene now changed his plans he was aware of the illprovided state of the british army from the voluntary destruction of their wagons tents and baggage his plan now was to tempt the enemy continually with the prospect of a battle but continually to elude one to harass them by a long pursuit draw them higher into the country and gain time for the division advancing under huger to join him it was the fabian policy that he had learnt under washington of whom he prided himself on being a disciple  as the subsiding of the catawba would enable cornwallis to cross greene ordered morgan to move off silently with his division on the evening of the 31st and to press his march all night so as to gain a good start in advance while he greene would remain to bring on the militia who were employed to check the enemy these militia assembled from the neighboring counties did not exceed five hundred two hundred of them were distributed at different fords the remaining three hundred forming a corps of mounted riflemen under general davidson were to watch the movements of the enemy and attack him wherever he should make his main attempt to cross when the enemy should have actually crossed the different bodies of militia were to make the best of their way to a rendezvous sixteen miles distant on the road to salisbury while these dispositions were being made by the american commander cornwallis was preparing to cross the river the night of the 31st was chosen for the attempt to divert the attention of the americans he detached colonels webster and tarleton with a part of the army to a public ford called beatties ford where he supposed davidson to be stationed there they were to make a feint of forcing a passage the main attempt however was to be made six miles lower down where little if any opposition was anticipated  cornwallis set out with the main body of his army at one oclock in the morning the night was dark and rainy it was near daybreak by the time the head of the column reached the ford to their surprise they beheld numerous camp fires on the opposite bank word was hastily carried to cornwallis that the ford was guarded it was so indeed davidson was there with his riflemen at that place the catawba was nearly five hundred yards wide about three feet deep very rapid and full of large stones the troops entered the river in platoons to support each other against the current and were ordered not to fire until they should gain the opposite bank colonel hall of the light infantry of the guards led the way the grenadiers followed the noise of the water and the darkness covered their movements until they were nearly halfway across when they were descried by an american sentinel he challenged them three times and receiving no answer fired terrified by the report the man who was guiding the british turned and fled colonel hall thus abandoned led the way directly across the river whereas the true ford inclined diagonally further down hall had to pass through deeper water but he reached a part of the bank where it was unguarded the american pickets too which had turned out at the alarm given by the sentinel had to deliver a distant and slanting fire still it had its effect three of the british were killed and thirtysix wounded colonel hall pushed on gallantly but was shot down as he ascended the bank  general davidson hastened with his men towards the place where the british were landing the latter formed as soon as they found themselves on firm ground charged davidsons men before he had time to get them in order killed and wounded about forty and put the rest to flight general davidson was the last to leave the ground and was killed just as he was mounting his horse  general greene informed that the enemy had crossed the catawba at daybreak awaited anxiously at the rendezvous the arrival of the militia it was not until after midnight that he heard of their utter dispersion and of the death of davidson apprehending the rapid advance of cornwallis he hastened to rejoin morgan who with his division was pushing forward for the yadkin first sending orders to general huger to conduct the other division by the most direct route to guilford courthouse where the forces were to be united greene spurred forward through heavy rain and deep miry roads it was a dreary ride and a lonely one for he had detached his aidesdecamp in different directions to collect the scattered militia  cornwallis did not advance so rapidly as had been apprehended after crossing the catawba he had to wait for his wagons and artillery which had remained on the other side in the woods so that by nightfall of the 1st of february he was not more than five miles on the road to salisbury eager to come up with the americans he mounted some of the infantry upon the baggage horses joined them to the cavalry and sent the whole forward under general ohara they arrived on the banks of the yadkin at night between the 2d and 3d of february just in time to capture a few wagons lingering in the rear of the american army which had passed the riflemen who guarded them retreated after a short skirmish there were no boats with which to cross the americans had secured them on the other side the rain which had fallen throughout the day had overflooded the ford by which the american cavalry had passed the pursuers were again brought to a stand after some doubt and delay cornwallis took his course up the south side of the yadkin and crossed by what is still called the shallow ford while greene continued on unmolested to guilford courthouse where he was joined by general huger and his division on the 9th cornwallis was now encamped about twentyfive miles above them at the old moravian town of salem  the great object of greene now was to get across the river dan and throw himself into virginia with the reinforcements and assistance he might there expect to find he hoped to effect the salvation of the south and prevent the dismemberment of the union the object of cornwallis was to get between him and virginia force him to a combat before he could receive those reinforcements or enclose him in between the great rivers on the west the sea on the east and the two divisions of the british army under himself and lord rawdon on the north and south his lordship had been informed that the lower part of the dan at present could only be crossed in boats and that the country could not afford a sufficient number for the passage of greenes army he trusted therefore to cut him off from the upper part of the river where alone it was fordable greene however had provided against such a contingency boats had been secured at various places by his agents and could be collected at a few hours notice at the lower ferries instead therefore of striving with his lordship for the upper fords greene shaped his course for boyds and irwins fords just above the confluence of the dan and staunton rivers which forms the roanoke and about seventy miles from guilford courthouse this would give him twentyfive miles advantage of lord cornwallis at the outset general kosciuszko was sent with a party in advance to collect the boats and throw up breastworks at the ferries  in ordering his march general greene took the lead with the main body the baggage and stores general morgan would have had the command of the rearguard but being disabled by a violent attack of ague and rheumatism it was given to colonel otho h williams formerly adjutantgeneral who had with him colonels howard washington and lee this corps detached some distance in the rear did infinite service being lightly equipped it could manoeuvre in front of the british line of march break down bridges sweep off provisions and impede its progress in a variety of ways while the main body moved forward unmolested it was now that cornwallis most felt the severity of the blow he had received at the battle of the cowpens in the loss of his light troops having so few to cope with the √©lite corps under williams  we forbear to enter into the details of this masterly retreat the many stratagems and manoeuvres of the covering party to delay and hoodwink the enemy tarleton himself bears witness in his narrative that every measure of the americans was judiciously designed and vigorously executed so much had cornwallis been misinformed at the outset as to the means below of passing the river that he pushed on in the firm conviction that he was driving the american army into a trap and would give it a signal blow before it could cross the dan  in the meantime greene with the main body reached the banks of the river and succeeded in crossing over with ease in the course of a single day at boyds and irwins ferries sending back word to williams who with his covering party was far in the rear that intelligent officer encamped as usual in the evening at a wary distance in front of the enemy but stole a march upon them after dark leaving his camp fires burning he pushed on all night arrived at the ferry in the morning of the 15th having marched forty miles within the last four and twenty hours and made such despatch in crossing that his last troops had landed on the virginia shore by the time the astonished enemy arrived on the opposite bank  for a day the two armies lay panting within sight of each other on the opposite banks of the river which had put an end to the race on the 16th the river began to subside the enemy might soon be able to cross greene prepared for a further retreat by sending forward his baggage on the road to halifax and securing the passage of the staunton at halifax he was resolved to make a stand rather than suffer the enemy to take possession of it without a struggle its situation on the roanoke would make it a strong position for their army supported by a fleet and would favor their designs both on virginia and the carolinas with a view to its defence intrenchments had already been thrown up under the direction of kosciuszko  lord cornwallis however did not deem it prudent under present circumstances to venture into virginia where greene would be sure of powerful reinforcements north carolina was in a state of the utmost disorder and confusion he thought it better to remain in it for a time and profit by having compelled greene to abandon it after giving his troops a days repose therefore he put them once more in motion on the 18th along the road by which he had pursued greene this changed the game lee with his legion strengthened by two veteran maryland companies and pickens with a corps of south carolina militia all light troops were transported across the dan in the boats with orders to gain the front of cornwallis hover as near as safety would permit cut off his intercourse with the disaffected parts of the country and check the rising of the royalists greene in the meanwhile remained with his main force on the northern bank of the dan waiting to ascertain his lordships real designs and ready to cross at a moments warning  the movements of cornwallis for a day or two were of a dubious nature designed to perplex his opponents or the 20th however he took post at hillsborough here he issued a proclamation inviting all loyal subjects to assist in suppressing the remains of rebellion and reestablishing good order and constitutional government by another instrument all who could raise independent companies were called upon to give in their names at headquarters and a bounty in money and lands was promised to those who should enlist under them tarleton was detached with the cavalry and a small body of infantry to a region of country lying between the haw and deep rivers to bring on a considerable number of loyalists who were said to be assembling there  rumor in the meantime had magnified the effect of his lordships proclamations word was brought to greene that the tories were flocking from all quarters to the royal standard seven companies it was said had been raised in a single day at this time the reinforcements to the american camp had been little more than six hundred virginia militia under general stevens greene saw that at this rate if cornwallis was allowed to remain undisturbed he would soon have complete command of north carolina he boldly determined therefore to recross the dan at all hazards with the scanty force at his command and give his lordship check in this spirit he broke up his camp and crossed the river on the 23d  in the meantime lee and pickens who were scouring the country about hillsborough received information of tarletons recruiting expedition there was no foe they were more eager to cope with and they resolved to give him a surprise having forded the haw one day about noon they learned that he was encamped about three miles off that his horses were unsaddled and that everything indicated confident security they now pushed on under covert of the woods prepared to give the bold partisan a blow after his own fashion before they reached the place tarleton had marched on being informed that he was to halt for the night at the distance of six miles they still trusted to surprise him on the way however they had an encounter with a body of three or four hundred mounted royalists armed with rifles and commanded by a colonel pyle marching in quest of tarleton as lee with his cavalry was in the advance he was mistaken for tarleton and hailed with loyal acclamations he favored the mistake and was taking measures to capture the royalists when some of them seeing the infantry under pickens discovered their error and fired upon the rearguard the cavalry instantly charged upon them ninety were cut down and slain and a great number wounded among the latter was colonel pyle himself who took refuge among the thickets on the borders of a piece of water which still bears his name  after all lee and pickens missed the object of their enterprise the approach of night and the fatigue of their troops made them defer their attack upon tarleton until morning in the meantime the latter had received an express from cornwallis informing him that greene had passed the dan and ordering him to return to hillsborough as soon as possible he hastened to obey lee with his legion was in the saddle before daybreak but tarletons troops were already on the march before sunrise he had forded the haw and lighthorse harry gave over the pursuit  the reappearance of greene and his army in north carolina heralded by the scourings of lee and pickens disconcerted the schemes of lord cornwallis the recruiting service was interrupted many royalists who were on the way to his camp returned home forage and provisions became scarce in the neighborhood he found himself he said amongst timid friends and adjoining to inveterate rebels on the 26th therefore he abandoned hillsborough threw himself across the haw and encamped near alamance creek one of its principal tributaries in a country favorable to supplies and with a tory population his position was commanding at the point of concurrence of roads from salisbury guilford high rockford cross creek and hillsborough it covered also the communication with wilmington where a d√©p√¥t of military stores so important to his halfdestitute army had recently been established  greene with his main army took post about fifteen miles above him on the heights between troublesome creek and reedy fork one of the tributaries of the haw his plan was to cut the enemy off from the upper counties to harass him by skirmishes but to avoid a general battle thus gaining time for the arrival of reinforcements daily expected  on the 6th of march cornwallis learning that the light troops under williams were very carelessly posted put his army suddenly in motion and crossed the alamance in a thick fog with the design to beat up their quarters drive them in upon the main army and bring greene to action should he come to their assistance his movement was discovered by the american patrols and the alarm given williams hastily called in his detachments and retreated with his light troops across reedy fork while lee with his legion manoeuvred in front of the enemy a stand was made by the americans at wetzells mill but they were obliged to retire with the loss of fifty killed and wounded cornwallis did not pursue evening was approaching and he had failed in his main object that of bringing greene to action the latter fixed in his resolve of avoiding a conflict had retreated across the haw  greenes longexpected reinforcements now arrived having been hurried on by forced marches they consisted of a brigade of virginia militia under general lawson two brigades of north carolina militia under generals butler and eaton and four hundred regulars enlisted for eighteen months his whole effective force according to official returns amounted to four thousand two hundred and fortythree foot and one hundred and sixtyone cavalry of his infantry not quite two thousand were regulars and of these threefourths were new levies his force nearly doubled in number that of cornwallis which did not exceed two thousand four hundred men but many of greenes troops were raw and inexperienced and had never been in battle those of the enemy were veterans schooled in warfare greene knew the inferiority of his troops in this respect his reinforcements too fell far short of what he had been led to expect yet he determined to accept the battle which had so long been offered all detachments were ordered to assemble at guilford within eight miles of the enemy where he encamped on the 14th sending his wagons and heavy baggage to the iron works at troublesome creek ten miles in his rear  cornwallis sent his carriages and baggage to bells mills on deep river and set out at daybreak on the 15th for guilford within four miles of that place near the new garden meetinghouse tarleton with the advanced guard came upon the american advanceguard composed of lees partisan legion and some mountaineers and virginia militia tarleton and lee were well matched in military prowess and the skirmish between them was severe lees horses being from virginia and pennsylvania were superior in weight and strength to those of his opponent which had been chiefly taken from plantations in south carolina the latter were borne down by a charge in close column tarleton seeing that his weaklymounted men fought to a disadvantage sounded a retreat lee endeavored to cut him off a general conflict of the vanguards horse and foot ensued when the appearance of the main body of the enemy obliged lee in his turn to retire with precipitation  during this time greene was preparing for action on a woody eminence a little more than a mile south of guilford courthouse the neighboring country was covered with forest excepting some cultivated fields about the courthouse and along the salisbury road which passed through the centre of the place from south to north he had drawn out his troops in three lines the first composed of north carolina militia volunteers and riflemen under generals butler and eaton was posted behind a fence with an open field in front and woods on the flanks and in the rear about three hundred yards behind this was the second line composed of virginia militia under generals stevens and lawson drawn up across the road and covered by a wood the third line about four hundred yards in the rear of the second was composed of continental troops or regulars those of virginia under general huger on the right those of maryland under colonel williams on the left colonel washington with a body of dragoons kirkwoods delaware infantry and a battalion of virginia militia covered the right flank lees legion with the virginia riflemen under colonel campbell covered the left two sixpounders were in the road in advance of the first line two fieldpieces with the rearline near the courthouse where general greene took his station  about noon the head of the british army was descried advancing spiritedly from the south along the salisbury road and defiling into the fields a cannonade was opened from the two sixpounders in front of the first american line it was answered by the british artillery neither produced much effect the enemy now advanced coolly and steadily in three columns the hessians and highlanders under general leslie on the right the royal artillery and guards in the centre and websters brigade on the left the north carolinians who formed the first line waited until the enemy were within one hundred and fifty yards when agitated by their martial array and undaunted movement they began to fall into confusion some fired off their pieces without taking aim others threw them down and took to flight a volley from the foe a shout and a charge of the bayonet completed their discomfiture some fled to the woods others fell back upon the virginians who formed the second line general stevens who commanded the latter ordered his men to open and let the fugitives pass pretending that they had orders to retire under his spirited command and example the virginians kept their ground and fought bravely  the action became much broken up and diversified by the extent of the ground the thickness of the woods impeded the movements of the cavalry the reserves on both sides were called up the british bayonet again succeeded the second line gave way and general stevens who had kept the field for some time after being wounded in the thigh by a musketball ordered a retreat the enemy pressed with increasing ardor against the third line composed of continental troops and supported by colonel washingtons dragoons and kirkwoods delawares greene counted on these to retrieve the day they were regulars they were fresh and in perfect order he rode along the line calling on them to stand firm and give the enemy a warm reception  the first maryland regiment which was on the right wing was attacked by colonel webster with the british left it stood the shock bravely and being seconded by some virginia troops and kirkwoods delawares drove webster across a ravine the second maryland regiment was not so successful impetuously attacked by colonel stewart with a battalion of the guards and a company of grenadiers it faltered gave way and fled abandoning two fieldpieces which were seized by the enemy stewart was pursuing when the first regiment which had driven webster across the ravine came to the rescue with fixed bayonets while colonel washington spurred up with his cavalry the fight now was fierce and bloody stewart was slain the two fieldpieces were retaken and the enemy in their turn gave way and were pursued with slaughter a destructive fire of grapeshot from the enemys artillery checked the pursuit two regiments approached on the right and left webster recrossed the ravine and fell upon kirkwoods delawares there was intrepid fighting in different parts of the field but greene saw that the day was lost there was no retrieving the effect produced by the first flight of the north carolinians unwilling to risk the utter destruction of his army he directed a retreat which was made in good order but they had to leave their artillery on the field most of the horses having been killed about three miles from the field of action he made a halt to collect stragglers and then continued on to the place of rendezvous at speedwells iron works on troublesome creek the british were too much cut up and fatigued to follow up their victory two regiments with tarletons cavalry attempted a pursuit but were called back  the loss of the americans in this hardfought affair was never fully ascertained their official returns made immediately after the action give little more than four hundred killed and wounded and between eight and nine hundred missing but lord cornwallis states in his despatches that between two and three hundred of the americans were found dead on the field of battle the loss sustained by his lordship even if numerically less was far more fatal for in the circumstances in which he was placed it was not to be supplied and it completely maimed him of his small army ninetythree had fallen four hundred and thirteen were wounded and twentysix missing among the killed and wounded were several officers of note thus onefourth of his army was either killed or disabled his troops were exhausted by fatigue and hunger his camp was encumbered by the wounded his victory in fact was almost as ruinous as a defeat  greene lay for two days within ten miles of him near the iron works on troublesome creek gathering up his scattered troops he had imbibed the spirit of washington and remained undismayed by hardships or reverses cornwallis so far from being able to advance in the career of victory could not even hold the ground he had so bravely won but was obliged to retreat from the scene of triumph to some secure position where he might obtain supplies for his famished army  leaving therefore about seventy of his officers and men who were too severely wounded to bear travelling together with a number of wounded americans under the protection of a flag of truce he set out on the third day after the action by easy marches for cross creek an eastern branch of cape fear river where was a settlement of scottish highlanders stout adherents as he was led to believe to the royal cause here he expected to be plentifully supplied with provisions and to have his sick and wounded well taken care of hence too he could open a communication by cape fear river with wilmington  no sooner did greene learn that cornwallis was retreating than he set out to follow him determined to bring him again to action and presenting the singular spectacle of the vanquished pursuing the victor his troops however suffered greatly in this pursuit from wintry weather deep wet clayey roads and scarcity of provisions on the 28th greene arrived at ramseys mills on deep river hard on the traces of cornwallis who had left the place a few hours previously with such precipitation that several of his wounded who had died while on the march were left behind unburied at deep river greene was brought to a stand cornwallis had broken down the bridge by which he had crossed and further pursuit for the present was impossible the constancy of the militia now gave way they had been continually on the march with little to eat less to drink and obliged to sleep in the woods in the midst of smoke every step had led them from their homes and increased their privations they were now in want of everything for the retreating enemy left a famished country behind him the term for which most of them had enlisted was expired and they now demanded their discharge the demand was just and reasonable and after striving in vain to shake their determination greene felt compelled to comply with it his force thus reduced it would be impossible to pursue the enemy further  in this situation remote from reinforcements inferior to the enemy in numbers and without hope of support what was to be done if the enemy falls down toward wilmington said he they will be in a position where it would be impossible for us to injure them if we had a force suddenly he determined to change his course and carry the war into south carolina this would oblige the enemy either to follow him and thus abandon north carolina or to sacrifice all his posts in the upper part of north carolina and georgia to washington to whom he considered himself accountable for his policy and from whose council he derived confidence and strength he writes on the present occasion all things considered i think the movement is warranted by the soundest reasons both political and military  he apprised sumter pickens and marion by letter of his intentions and called upon them to be ready to cooperate on the 30th of march he discharged all his militia with many thanks for the courage and fortitude with which they had followed him through so many scenes of peril and hardship then after giving his army a short taste of the repose they needed and having collected a few days provisions he set forward on the 5th of april toward camden where lord rawdon had his headquarters  cornwallis in the meantime was grievously disappointed in the hopes he had formed of obtaining ample provisions and forage at cross creek and strong reinforcements from the royalists in the neighborhood neither could he open a communication by cape fear river for the conveyance of his troops to wilmington the distance by water was upwards of a hundred miles the breadth of the river seldom above one hundred yards the banks high and the inhabitants on each side generally hostile he was compelled therefore to continue his retreat by land quite to wilmington where he arrived on the 7th of april  it was his lordships intention as soon as he should have equipped his own corps and received a part of the expected reinforcements from ireland to return to the upper country in hopes of giving protection to the royal interests in south carolina and of preserving the health of his troops until he should concert new measures with sir henry clinton his plans were all disconcerted however by intelligence of greenes rapid march toward camden all thoughts of offensive operations against north carolina were at an end sickness desertion and the loss sustained at guilford courthouse had reduced his little army to fourteen hundred and thirtyfive men in this sad predicament after remaining several days in a painful state of irresolution he determined to take advantage of greenes having left the back part of virginia open to march directly into that province and attempt a junction with the force acting there under general phillips  by this move he might draw greene back to the northward and by the reduction of virginia he might promote the subjugation of the south the move however he felt to be perilous his troops were worn down by upwards of eight hundred miles of marching and countermarching through an inhospitable and impracticable country they had now three hundred more before them under still worse circumstances than those in which they first set out there was no time for hesitation or delay greene might return and render the junction with phillips impracticable having sent an express to the latter therefore informing him of his coming and appointing a meeting at petersburg his lordship set off on the 25th of april on his fated march into virginia  we must now step back in dates to bring up events in the more northern parts of the union     chapter lxii the war in virginiademonstrations against new york   in a former chapter we left benedict arnold fortifying himself at portsmouth after his ravaging incursion at the solicitation of governor jefferson backed by congress the chevalier de la luzerne had requested the french commander at the eastward to send a shipoftheline and some frigates to chesapeake bay to oppose the traitor fortunately at this juncture a severe snowstorm jan 22d scattered arbuthnots blockading squadron wrecking one shipoftheline and dismasting others and enabled the french fleet at newport to look abroad and rochambeau wrote to washington that the chevalier destouches who commanded the fleet proposed to send three or four ships to the chesapeake  washington feared the position of arnold and his wellknown address might enable him to withstand a mere attack by sea anxious to ensure his capture he advised that destouches should send his whole fleet and that de rochambeau should embark about a thousand men on board of it with artillery and apparatus for a siege engaging on his own part to send off immediately a detachment of twelve hundred men to cooperate  before the receipt of this letter the french commanders acting on their first impulse had about the 9th of february detached m de tilly with a sixtygun ship and two frigates to make a dash into the chesapeake washington was apprised of their sailing just as he was preparing to send off the twelve hundred men spoken of in his letter to de rochambeau he gave the command of this detachment to lafayette instructing him to act in conjunction with the militia and the ships sent by destouches against the enemys corps actually in virginia as the case was urgent he was to suffer no delay when on the march for want either of provisions forage or wagons but where ordinary means did not suffice he was to resort to military impress  lafayette set out on his march on the 22d of february and washington was indulging the hope that scanty as was the naval force sent to the chesapeake the combined enterprise might be successful when on the 27th he received a letter from the count de rochambeau announcing its failure de tilly had made his dash into chesapeake bay but arnold had been apprised by the british admiral arbuthnot of his approach and had drawn his ships high up elizabeth river the water was too shallow for the largest french ships to get within four leagues of him one of de tillys frigates ran aground and was got off with difficulty and that commander seeing that arnold was out of his reach and fearing to be himself blockaded should he linger put to sea and returned to newport having captured during his cruise a british frigate of fortyfour guns and two privateers with their prizes  the french commanders now determined to follow the plan suggested by washington and operate in the chesapeake with their whole fleet and a detachment of land troops being as they said disposed to risk everything to hinder arnold from establishing himself at portsmouth washington set out for newport to concert operations with the french commanders where he arrived on the 6th of march and found the french fleet ready for sea the troops eleven hundred strong commanded by general the baron de viomenil being already embarked he went immediately on board of the admirals ship where he had an interview with the count de rochambeau and arranged the plan of the campaign on the 8th of march at ten oclock at night he writes to lafayette i have the pleasure to inform you that the whole fleet went out with a fair wind this evening about sunset the british fleet made sail in pursuit on the morning of the 10th as the french had so much the start it was hoped they would reach chesapeake bay before them  in the meantime lafayette with his detachment was pressing forward by forced marches for virginia arriving at the head of elk on the 3d of march he halted until he should receive tidings respecting the french fleet on the 7th he received washingtons letter of the 1st apprising him of the approaching departure of the whole fleet with land forces lafayette now conducted his troops by water to annapolis and concluding from the time the ships were to sail and the winds which had since prevailed the french fleet must be already in the chesapeake he crossed the bay in an open boat to virginia and pushed on to confer with the american and french commanders get a convoy for his troops and concert matters for a vigorous cooperation arriving at york on the 14th he found the baron steuben in the bustle of military preparations and confident of having five thousand militia ready to cooperate these with lafayettes detachment would be sufficient for the attack by land nothing was wanting but a cooperation by sea and the french fleet had not yet appeared though double the time necessary for the voyage had elapsed  on the 20th word was brought that a fleet had come to anchor within the capes it was supposed of course to be the french and now the capture of the traitor was certain he himself from certain signs appeared to be in great confusion none of his ships ventured down the bay an officer of the french navy bore down to visit the fleet but returned with the astounding intelligence that it was british  admiral arbuthnot had in fact overtaken destouches on the 16th of march off the capes of virginia their forces were nearly equal eight shipsoftheline and four frigates on each side the french having more men the english more guns an engagement took place which lasted about an hour the british van at first took the brunt of the action and was severely handled the centre came up to its relief the french line was broken and gave way but rallied and formed again at some distance the crippled state of some of his ships prevented the british admiral from bringing on a second encounter nor did the french seek one but shaped their course the next day back to newport both sides claimed a victory the british certainly effected the main objects they had in view the french were cut off from the chesapeake the combined enterprise against portsmouth was disconcerted and arnold was saved  a detachment of two thousand troops from new york under general phillips arrived at portsmouth on the 26th of march that officer immediately took command greatly to the satisfaction of the british officers who had been acting under arnold the force now collected there amounted to three thousand five hundred men the disparity in force was now so great that the baron steuben had to withdraw his troops and remove the military stores into the interior many of the militia too their term of three months being expired stacked their arms and set off for their homes and most of the residue had to be discharged  general phillips had hitherto remained quiet in portsmouth completing the fortifications but evidently making preparations for an expedition on the 16th of april he left one thousand men in garrison and embarking the rest in small vessels of light draught proceeded up james river destroying armed vessels public magazines and a shipyard belonging to the state landing at city point he advanced against petersburg a place of deposit of military stores and tobacco he was met about a mile below the town by about one thousand militia under general muhlenburg who after disputing the ground inch by inch for nearly two hours with considerable loss on both sides retreated across the appomattox breaking down the bridge behind them  phillips entered the town set fire to the tobacco warehouses and destroyed all the vessels lying in the river repairing and crossing the bridge over the appomattox he proceeded to chesterfield courthouse where he destroyed barracks and public stores while arnold with a detachment laid waste the magazines of tobacco in the direction of warwick a fire was opened by the latter from a few fieldpieces on the river bank upon a squadron of small armed vessels which had been intended to cooperate with the french fleet against portsmouth the crews scuttled or set fire to them and escaped to the north side of the river  this destructive course was pursued until they arrived at manchester a small place opposite richmond where the tobacco warehouses were immediately in a blaze richmond was a leading object of this desolating enterprise for there a great part of the military stores of the state had been collected fortunately lafayette with his detachment of two thousand men had arrived there by forced marches the evening before and being joined by about two thousand militia and sixty dragoons the latter principally young virginians of family had posted himself strongly on the high banks on the north side of the river there being no bridge across the river at that time general phillips did not think it prudent to attempt a passage in face of such a force so posted returning down the south bank of the river to the place where his vessels awaited him he reembarked on the 2d of may and dropped slowly down the river below the confluence of the chickahomony he was followed cautiously and his movements watched by lafayette who posted himself behind the lastnamed river  despatches from cornwallis now informed phillips that his lordship was advancing with all speed from the south to effect a junction with him the general immediately made a rapid move to regain possession of petersburg where the junction was to take place lafayette attempted by forced marches to get there before him but was too late falling back therefore he recrossed james river and stationed himself some miles below richmond to be at hand for the protection of the public stores collected there  during this main expedition of phillips some of his smaller vessels had carried on the plan of plunder and devastation in other of the rivers emptying into the chesapeake bay setting fire to the houses where they met with resistance  in the meantime the desolating career of general phillips was brought to a close he had been ill for some days previous to his arrival at petersburg and by the time he reached there was no longer capable of giving orders he died four days afterwards honored and deeply regretted by his brothers in arms as a meritorious and welltried soldier  lord cornwallis arrived at petersburg on the 20th of may after nearly a months weary marching from wilmington his lordship on taking command found his force augmented by a considerable detachment of royal artillery two battalions of light infantry the 76th and 80th british regiments a hessian regiment lieutenantcolonel simcoes corps of queens rangers cavalry and infantry one hundred yagers arnolds legion of royalists and the garrison of portsmouth his mind we are told was now set at ease with regard to southern affairs his spirits so long jaded by his harassing tramps about the carolinas were again lifted up by his augmented strength  while affairs were approaching a crisis in virginia troubles were threatening from the north there were rumors of invasion from canada of war councils and leagues among the savage tribes of a revival of the territorial feuds between new york and vermont such however was the deplorable inefficiency of the military system that though according to the resolves of congress there were to have been thirtyseven thousand men under arms at the beginning of the year washingtons whole force on the hudson in the month of may did not amount to seven thousand men of whom little more than four thousand were effective  he still had his headquarters at new windsor just above the highlands and within a few miles of west point here he received intelligence that the enemy were in force on the opposite side of the hudson marauding the country on the north side of croton river and he ordered a hasty advance of connecticut troops in that direction the croton river flows from east to west across westchester county and formed as it were the barrier of the american lines the advanced posts of washingtons army guarded it and by its aid protected the upper country from the incursions of those foraging parties and marauders which had desolated the neutral ground below it the incursions most to be guarded against were those of colonel delanceys loyalists a horde of tories and refugees which had their stronghold in morrisania  the object of their present incursion was to surprise an outpost of the american army stationed near a fordable part of the croton river not far from pines bridge the post was commanded by colonel christopher greene of rhode island the same who had successfully defended fort mercer on the delaware when assailed by count donop he was a valuable officer highly prized by washington colonel delancey who led this foray was successor to the unfortunate andr√© as adjutantgeneral of the british army he conducted it secretly and in the night at the head of a hundred horse and two hundred foot the croton was forded at daybreak just as the nightguard had been withdrawn and the farmhouses were surprised and assailed in which the americans were quartered that occupied by colonel greene and a brother officer major flagg was first surrounded the major started from his bed and discharged his pistols from a window but was shot through the head and afterwards despatched by cuts and thrusts of the sabre  the door of greenes room was burst open he defended himself vigorously and effectively with his sword for he had great strength but he was overpowered by numbers cut down and barbarously mangled a massacre was going on in other quarters besides these two officers there were between thirty and forty killed and wounded and several made prisoners it is said that colonel delancey was not present at the carnage but remained on the south side of the croton to secure the retreat of his party before the troops ordered out by washington arrived at the post the marauders had made a precipitate retreat they had attempted to carry off greene a prisoner but he died within threequarters of a mile of the house the commanderinchief we are told heard with anguish and indignation the tragical fate of this his faithful friend and soldier  at this juncture washingtons attention was called in another direction a frigate had arrived at boston bringing the count de barras to take command of the french naval force he was a veteran about sixty years of age and had commanded destaings vanguard when he forced the entrance of newport harbor the count brought the cheering intelligence that an armament of twenty shipsoftheline with land forces was to sail or had sailed from france under the count de grasse for the west indies and that twelve of these ships were to relieve the squadron at newport and might be expected on the coast of the united states in july or august  the count de rochambeau having received despatches from the court of france now requested an interview with washington the latter appointed weathersfield in connecticut for the purpose and met the count there on the 22d of may hoping to settle a definite plan of the campaign both as yet were ignorant of the arrival of cornwallis in virginia the policy of a joint expedition to relieve the carolinas was discussed as the french ships in newport were still blockaded by a superior force such an expedition would have to be made by land a march to the southern states was long and harassing and always attended with a great waste of life on the other hand an effective blow might be struck at new york the garrison having been reduced onehalf by detachments to the south it was determined therefore that the french troops should march from newport as soon as possible and form a junction with the american army on the hudson and that both should move down to the vicinity of new york to make a combined attack in which the count de grasse should be invited to cooperate with his fleet and a body of land troops  a vessel was despatched by de rochambeau to inform the count de grasse of this arrangement and letters were addressed by washington to the executive authorities of new jersey and the new england states urging them to fill up their battalions and furnish their quotas of provisions notwithstanding all his exertions however when he mustered his forces at peekskill he was mortified to find not more than five thousand effective men notwithstanding too all the resolutions passed in the legislatures of the various states for supplying the army it would at this critical moment have been destitute of provisions especially bread had it not been for the zeal talents and activity of mr robert morris now a delegate to congress from the state of pennsylvania and recently appointed superintendent of finance this patriotic and energetic man when public means failed pledged his own credit in transporting military stores and feeding the army  the count de rochambeau and the duke de lauzun being arrived with their troops in connecticut on their way to join the american army washington prepared for spirited operations quickened by the intelligence that a part of the garrison of new york had been detached to forage the jerseys two objects were contemplated by him one the surprisal of the british works at the north end of new york island the other the capture or destruction of delanceys corps of refugees in morrisania the attack upon the posts was to be conducted by general lincoln with a detachment from the main army which he was to bring down by waterthat on delanceys corps by the duke de lauzun with his legion aided by sheldons dragoons and a body of connecticut troops both operations were to be carried into effect on the 3d of july the duke was to march down from ridgebury in connecticut for the purpose everything was to be conducted with secrecy and by the way of surprisal should anything occur to prevent lincoln from attempting the works on new york island he was to land his men above spyt den duivel creek march to the high grounds in front of kings bridge lie concealed there until the dukes attack on delanceys corps should be announced by firing or other means then to dispose of his force in such a manner as to make the enemy think it larger than it really was thereby deterring troops from coming over the bridge to turn lauzuns right while he prevented the escape over the bridge of delanceys refugees when routed from morrisania  in pursuance of the plan lincoln left the camp near peekskill on the 1st with eight hundred men and artillery and proceeded to tellers point where they were embarked in boats with muffled oars and rowed silently at night down the tappan sea at daylight they kept concealed under the land the duke de lauzun was supposed at the same time to be on the way from connecticut washington at three oclock on the morning of the 2d left his tents standing at peekskill and commenced his march with his main force to valentines hill four miles above kings bridge there he posted himself to cover the detached troops and improve any advantages that might be gained them  lincoln on the morning of the 2d had left his flotilla concealed under the eastern shore and crossed to fort lee to reconnoitre fort washington from the cliffs on the opposite side of the hudson to his surprise and chagrin he discovered a british force encamped on the north end of new york island and a shipofwar anchored in the river in fact the troops which had been detached into the jerseys had returned and the enemy were on the alert the surprisal of the forts therefore was out of the question his thoughts now were to aid the duke de lauzuns part of the scheme as he had been instructed before daylight on the 3d he landed his troops above spyt den duivel creek and took possession of the high ground on the north of harlem river where fort independence once stood here he was discovered by a foraging party of the enemy fifteen hundred strong who had sallied out at daybreak to scour the country an irregular skirmish ensued the firing was heard by the duke de lauzun who was just arrived with his troops at eastchester fatigued by a long and forced march in sultry weather finding the country alarmed and all hope of surprising delanceys corps at an end he hastened to the support of lincoln washington also advanced with his troops from valentines hill the british perceiving their danger retreated to their boats on the east side of harlem river and crossed over to new york island a trifling loss in killed and wounded had been sustained on each side and lincoln had made a few prisoners  being disappointed in both objects washington did not care to fatigue his troops any more but suffered them to remain on their arms and spent a good part of the day reconnoitring the enemys works in the afternoon he retired to valentines hill and the next day marched to dobbs ferry where he was joined by the count de rochambeau on the 6th july the two armies now encampedthe american in two lines resting on the hudson at dobbs ferry where it was covered by batteries and extending eastward toward the neperan or sawmill river the french in a single line on the hills further east reaching to the bronx river  the two armies lay thus encamped for three or four weeks in the meantime letters urged washingtons presence in virginia richard henry lee advised that he should come with two or three thousand good troops and be clothed with dictatorial powers i am fully persuaded and upon good military principles writes washington in reply that the measures i have adopted will give more effectual and speedy relief to the state of virginia than my marching thither with dictatorial powers at the head of every man i could draw from hence without leaving the important posts on the north river quite defenceless and these states open to devastation and ruin my present plan of operation which i have been preparing with all the zeal and activity in my power will i am morally certain with proper support produce one of two things either the fall of new york or a withdrawal of the troops from virginia excepting a garrison at portsmouth at which place i have no doubt of the enemys intention of establishing a permanent post  within two or three days after this letter was written washington crossed the river at dobbs ferry accompanied by the count de rochambeau general de beville and general duportail to reconnoitre the british posts on the north end of new york island they were escorted by one hundred and fifty of the new jersey troops and spent the day on the jersey heights ascertaining the exact position of the enemy on the opposite shore their next movement was to reconnoitre the enemys posts at kings bridge and on the east side of new york island and to cut off if possible such of delanceys corps as should be found without the british lines five thousand troops french and american led by the count de chastellux and general lincoln were to protect this reconnoissance and menace the enemys posts everything was prepared in secrecy on the 21st of july at eight oclock in the evening the troops began their march the detachment arrived at kings bridge about daylight and formed on the height back of fort independence the enemys forts on new york island did not appear to have the least intelligence of what was going on nor to be aware that hostile troops were upon the heights opposite until the latter displayed themselves in full array their arms flashing in the morning sunshine and their banners american and french unfolded to the breeze  while the enemy was thus held in check washington and de rochambeau accompanied by engineers and by their staffs set out under the escort of a troop of dragoons to reconnoitre the enemys position and works from every point of view it was a wide reconnoissance extending across the country outside of the british lines from the hudson to the sound the whole was done slowly and scientifically exact notes and diagrams being made of everything that might be of importance in future operations while the enemys works had been thoroughly reconnoitred light troops and lancers had performed their duty in scouring the neighborhood the refugee posts which had desolated the country were broken up most of the refugees washington says had fled and hid themselves in secret places some got over by stealth to the adjacent islands and to the enemys shipping and a few were caught     chapter lxiii ravages in virginiaoperations in carolinaattack on new london   the first object of lord cornwallis on the junction of his forces at petersburg in may was to strike a blow at lafayette the marquis was encamped on the north side of james river between wilton and richmond with about one thousand regulars two thousand militia and fifty dragoons he was waiting for reinforcements of militia and for the arrival of general wayne with the pennsylvania line his lordship hoped to draw him into an action before thus reinforced and with that view marched on the 24th of may from petersburg to james river which he crossed at westover about thirty miles below richmond here he was joined on the 26th by a reinforcement just arrived from new york part of which he sent under general leslie to strengthen the garrison at portsmouth he was relieved also from military companionship with the infamous arnold who obtained leave of absence to return to new york where business of importance was said to demand his attention  being now strongly reinforced cornwallis moved to dislodge lafayette from richmond this latter conscious of the inferiority of his forces decamped as soon as he heard his lordship had crossed james river and directed his march toward the upper country inclining to the north to favor a junction with wayne cornwallis followed him as far as the upper part of hanover county destroying public stores wherever found he soon found it impossible either to overtake lafayette or prevent his junction with wayne he turned his attention therefore to other objects  greene in his passage through virginia had urged the importance of removing horses out of the way of the enemy his caution had been neglected the consequences were now felt the great number of fine horses in the stables of virginia gentlemen who are noted for their love of the noble animal had enabled cornwallis to mount many of his troops in firstrate style these he employed in scouring the country and destroying public stores tarleton and his legion it is said were mounted on racehorses  the state legislature had been removed for safety to charlottesville where it was assembled for the purpose of levying taxes and drafting militia tarleton with one hundred and eighty cavalry and seventy mounted infantry was ordered by cornwallis to make a dash there break up the legislature and carry off members on his way thither on the 4th of june he captured and destroyed a convoy of arms and clothing destined for greenes army in north carolina at another place he surprised several persons of note at the house of a dr walker but lingered so long breakfasting that a person mounted on a fleet horse had time to reach charlottesville before him and spread the alarm tarleton crossed the rivanna which washes the hill on which charlottesville is situated dispersed a small force collected on the bank and galloped into the town thinking to capture the whole assembly seven alone fell into his hands the rest had made their escape no better success attended a party of horse under captain mcleod detached to surprise the governor thomas jefferson at his residence in monticello  having set fire to all the public stores at charlottesville tarleton pushed for the point of fork at the confluence of the rivanna and fluvanna to aid if necessary a detachment sent under colonel simcoe to destroy a great quantity of military stores collected at that post the baron steuben who was stationed there with five hundred virginia regulars and a few militia and had heard of the march of tarleton had succeeded in transporting the greater part of the stores as well as his troops across the river and as the water was deep and the boats were all on his side he might have felt himself secure the unexpected appearance of simcoes infantry however designedly spread out on the opposite heights deceived him into the idea that it was the van of the british army in his alarm he made a night retreat of thirty miles leaving the greater part of the stores scattered along the river bank which were destroyed the next morning by a small detachment of the enemy sent across in canoes  on the 10th of june lafayette was at length gladdened by the arrival of wayne with about nine hundred of the pennsylvania line thus reinforced he changed his whole plan and ventured on the aggressive cornwallis had gotten between him and a large deposit of military stores at albemarle old courthouse the marquis by a rapid march at night through a road long disused threw himself between the british army and the stores and being joined by a numerous body of mountain militia took a strong position to dispute the advance of the enemy  cornwallis did not think it advisable to pursue this enterprise especially as he heard lafayette would soon be joined by forces under baron steuben he turned his face therefore toward the lower part of virginia and made a retrograde march first to richmond and afterwards to williamsburg lafayette being joined by steuben and his forces had about four thousand men under him one half of whom were regulars he now followed the british army at the distance of eighteen or twenty miles throwing forward his light troops to harass their rear which was covered by tarleton and simcoe with their cavalry and infantry  cornwallis arrived at williamsburg on the 25th and sent out simcoe to destroy some boats and stores on the chickahominy river and to sweep off the cattle of the neighborhood lafayette heard of the ravage and detached lieutenantcolonel butler of the pennsylvania line with a corps of light troops and a body of horse under major mcpherson to intercept the marauders as the infantry could not push on fast enough for the emergency mcpherson took up fifty of them behind fifty of his dragoons and dashed on he overtook a company of simcoes rangers under captain shank about six miles from williamsburg foraging at a farm a sharp encounter took place mcpherson at the outset was unhorsed and severely hurt the action continued simcoe with his infantry who had been in the advance convoying a drove of cattle now engaged in the fight butlers riflemen began to arrive and supported the dragoons neither knew the strength of the force they were contending with but supposed it the advance guard of the opposite army an alarm gun was fired by the british on a neighboring hill it was answered by alarm guns at williamsburg the americans supposed the whole british force coming out to assail them and began to retire simcoe imagining lafayette to be at hand likewise drew off and pursued his march to williamsburg the loss in killed and wounded on both sides was severe for the number engaged but the statements vary and were never reconciled  an express was received by cornwallis at williamsburg which obliged him to change his plans the movements of washington in the neighborhood of new york menacing an attack had produced the desired effect sir henry clinton alarmed for the safety of the place had written to cornwallis requiring a part of his troops for its protection his lordship prepared to comply with this requisition but as it would leave him too weak to continue at williamsburg he set out on the 4th of july for portsmouth  lafayette followed him on the ensuing day and took post within nine miles of his camp intending when the main body of the enemy should have crossed the ford to the island of jamestown to fall upon the rear guard cornwallis suspected his design and prepared to take advantage of it the wheel carriages bat horses and baggage were passed over to the island under the escort of the queens rangers making a great display as if the main body had crossed his lordship however with the greater part of his forces remained on the mainland his right covered by ponds the centre and left by morasses over which a few narrow causeways of logs connected his position with the country and james island lay in the rear his camp was concealed by a skirt of woods and covered by an outpost  in the morning of the 6th as the americans were advancing a negro and a dragoon employed by tarleton threw themselves in their way pretending to be deserters and informed them that the body of the kings troops had passed james river in the night leaving nothing behind but the rear guard composed of the british legion and a detachment of infantry persuaded of the fact lafayette with his troops crossed the morass on the left of the enemy by a narrow causeway of logs and halted beyond about sunset wayne was detached with a body of riflemen dragoons and continental infantry to make the attack while the marquis with nine hundred continentals and some militia stood ready to support him  wayne easily routed a patrol of cavalry and drove in the pickets who had been ordered to give way readily the outpost which covered the camp defended itself more obstinately though exceedingly galled by the riflemen wayne pushed forward with the pennsylvania line eight hundred strong and three fieldpieces to attack it at the first discharge of a cannon more than two thousand of the enemy emerged from their concealment and he found too late that the whole british line was in battle array before him to retreat was more dangerous than to go on so thinking with that impetuous valor which had gained him the name of mad anthony he ordered a charge to be sounded and threw himself horse and foot with shouts upon the enemy it was a sanguinary conflict and a desperate one for the enemy were outflanking him right and left fortunately the heaviness of the fire had awakened the suspicions of lafayetteit was too strong for the outpost of a rearguard spurring to a point of land which commanded a view of the british camp he discovered the actual force of the enemy and the peril of wayne galloping back he sent word to wayne to fall back to general muhlenburgs brigade which had just arrived and was forming within half a mile of the scene of conflict wayne did so in good order leaving behind him his three cannon the horses which drew them having been killed the whole army then retired across the morass  the loss of the americans in this brief but severe conflict is stated by lafayette to have been one hundred and eighteen killed wounded and prisoners including ten officers the british loss was said to be five officers wounded and seventyfive privates killed and wounded lafayette retreated to green springs where he rallied and reposed his troops cornwallis crossed over to jamestown island after dark and three days afterwards passing the james river with his main force proceeded to portsmouth  we will now turn to resume the course of general greenes campaigning in the carolinas it will be recollected that he on the 5th of april set out from deep river on a retrograde march to carry the war again into south carolina beginning by an attack on lord rawdons post at camden sumter and marion had been keeping alive the revolutionary fire in that state on the reappearance of greene they stood ready to aid with heart and hand  on his way to camden greene detached lee to join marion with his legion and make an attack upon fort watson by way of diversion for himself he appeared before camden but finding it too strong and too well garrisoned fell back about two miles and took post at hobkirks hill hoping to draw his lordship out he succeeded but too well his lordship attacked him on the 25th of april coming upon him partly by surprise there was a hardfought battle but through some false move among part of his troops greene was obliged to retreat his lordship did not pursue but shut himself up in camden waiting to be rejoined by part of his garrison which was absent greene posted himself near camden ferry on the wateree to intercept these reinforcements lee and marion who had succeeded in capturing fort watson also took a position on the high hills of santee for the same purpose their efforts were unavailing lord rawdon was rejoined by the other part of his troops his superior force now threatened to give him the mastery greene felt the hazardous nature of his situation his troops were fatigued by their long marchings he was disappointed of promised aid and reinforcements from virginia still he was undismayed and prepared for another of his long and stubborn retreats the next morning there was a joyful reverse rawdon was preparing to evacuate camden his lordship had heard of the march of cornwallis into virginia and that all hope of aid from him was at an end his garrison was out of provisions all supplies were cut off by the americans he had no choice but to evacuate he left camden in flames  rapid successes now attended the american arms fort motte the middle post between camden and ninetysix was taken by marion and lee lee next captured granby and marched to aid pickens in the siege of augusta while greene having acquired a supply of arms ammunition and provisions from the captured forts sat down before the fortress of ninetysix on the 22d of may it was the great mart and stronghold of the royalists and was principally garrisoned by royalists from new jersey and new york commanded by colonel cruger a native of new york the siege lasted for nearly a month the place was valiantly defended lee arrived with his legion having failed before augusta and invested a stockaded fort which formed part of the works  word was brought that lord rawdon was pressing forward with reinforcements and but a few miles distant on the saluda greene endeavored to get up sumter marion and pickens to his assistance but they were too far on the right of lord rawdon to form a junction the troops were eager to storm the works before his lordship should arrive a partial assault was made on the 18th of june it was a bloody contest the stockaded fort was taken but the troops were repulsed from the main works  greene retreated across the saluda and halted at bush river at twenty miles distance to observe the motion of the enemy lord rawdon entered ninetysix on the 21st but sallied forth again on the 24th taking with him all the troops capable of fatigue two thousand in number without wheel carriage of any kind or even knapsacks hoping by a rapid move to overtake greene want of provisions soon obliged him to give up the pursuit and return to ninetysix leaving about one half of his force there under colonel cruger he sallied a second time from ninetysix at the head of eleven hundred infantry with cavalry artillery and fieldpieces marching by the south side of the saluda for the congaree  he was now pursued in his turn by greene and lee in this march more than fifty of his lordships soldiers fell dead from heat fatigue and privation at orangeburg where he arrived on the 8th of july his lordship was joined by a large detachment under colonel stuart greene had followed him closely and having collected all his detachments and being joined by sumter appeared within four miles of orangeburg on the 10th of july and offered battle the offer was not accepted and the position of lord rawdon was too strong to be attacked greene remained there two or three days when learning that colonel cruger was advancing with the residue of the forces from ninetysix which would again give his lordship a superiority of force he moved off with his infantry on the night of the 13th of july crossed the saluda and posted himself on the east side of the wateree at the high hills of santee  he now detached sumter with about a thousand light troops to scour the lower country and attack the british posts in the vicinity of charleston now left uncovered by the concentration of their forces at orangeburg under sumter acted marion lee the hamptons and other enterprising partisans they were to act separately in breaking up the minor posts at and about dorchester but to unite at monks corner where lieutenantcolonel coates was stationed with the 9th regiment this post carried they were to reunite with greenes army on the high hills of santee  scarce was sumter on his march when he received a letter from greene dated july 14th stating that cruger had formed a junction with lord rawdon the preceding night no time therefore was to be lost push your operations night and day station a party to watch the enemys motions at orangeburg keep colonel lee and general marion advised of all matters from above and tell colonel lee to thunder even at the gates of charleston conformably to these orders colonel henry hampton with a party was posted to keep an eye on orangeburg lee with his legion accompanied by lieutenantcolonel wade hampton and a detachment of cavalry was sent to carry dorchester and then press forward to the gates of charleston while sumter with the main body took up his line of march along the road on the south side of the congaree towards monks corner  as lee approached dorchester colonel wade hampton with his cavalry passed to the east of that place to a bridge on goose creek to cut off all communication between the garrison and monks corner his sudden appearance gave the alarm the garrison abandoned its post and when lee arrived there he found it deserted he proceeded to secure a number of horses and wagons and some fixed ammunition which the garrison had left behind and to send them off to hampton hampton kept in suspense by this delay lost patience he feared that the alarm would spread through the country and the dash into the vicinity of charleston be prevented abandoning the bridge at goose creek therefore he set off with his cavalry clattered down to the neighborhood of the lines and threw the city into confusion the bells rang alarm guns were fired the citizens turned out under arms hampton captured a patrol of dragoons and a guard at the quarterhouse and then retired carrying off fifty prisoners several of them officers  lee arrived in the neighborhood on the following day but hampton had been beforehand with him made the dash and thundered at the gate both now hastened to rejoin sumter on the evening of the 16th who was only waiting to collect his detachments before he made an attack on colonel coates at monks corner the assault was to be made on the following morning during the night coates decamped a pursuit was commenced lee with his legion and hampton with the state cavalry took the lead sumter followed with the infantry the rearguard of the british about one hundred strong was overtaken with the baggage at the distance of eighteen miles they were new troops recently arrived from ireland and had not seen service on being charged by the cavalry sword in hand they threw down their arms without firing a shot and cried for quarter which was granted while lee was securing them captain armstrong with the first section of cavalry pushed on in pursuit of coates and the main body that officer had crossed a wooden bridge over quimby creek loosened the planks and was only waiting to be rejoined by his rearguard to throw them off and cut off all pursuit his troops were partly on a causeway beyond the bridge partly crowded in a lane he knew nothing of an enemy being at hand until he saw armstrong spurring up with his section coates gave orders for his troops to halt form and march up a howitzer was brought to bear upon the bridge and a fatigue party rushed forward to throw off the planks armstrong saw the danger dashed across the bridge with his section drove off the artillerists and captured the howitzer before it could be discharged the fatigue men who had been at work on the bridge snatched up their guns gave a volley and fled armstrongs party in crossing the bridge had displaced some of the planks and formed a chasm lieutenant carrington with the second section of dragoons leaped over it the chasm being thus enlarged the horses of the third section refused a pellmell fight took place between the handful of dragoons who had crossed and some of the enemy armstrong seeing the foe too strong in front and no reinforcement coming on in rear wheeled off with some of his men to the left galloped into the woods and pushed up along the stream to ford it and seek the main body  during the mel√©e lee had come up and endeavored with the dragoons of the third section to replace the planks of the bridge their efforts were vain the water was deep the mud deeper there was no foothold nor was there any firm spot where to swim the horses across while they were thus occupied colonel coates with his men opened a fire upon them from the other end of the bridge having no firearms to reply with they were obliged to retire the remainder of the planks were then thrown off from the bridge after which colonel coates took post on an adjacent plantation  it was not until three oclock in the afternoon that sumter with his forces appeared upon the ground having had to make a considerable circuit on account of the destruction of the bridge by four oclock the attack commenced sumter with part of the troops advanced in front under cover of a line of negro huts which he wished to secure marion with his brigade much reduced in number approached on the right of the enemy where there was no shelter but fences the cavalry not being able to act remained at a distance as a reserve and if necessary to cover a retreat sumters brigade soon got possession of the huts where they used their rifles with sure effect marion and his men rushed up through a galling fire to the fences on the right the enemy retired within the house and garden and kept up a sharp fire from doors and windows and picketed fence unfortunately the americans had neglected to bring on their artillery having repaired the bridge they sent off for the artillery and a supply of powder which accompanied it the evening was at hand their ammunition was exhausted and they retired in good order intending to renew the combat with artillery in the morning when they came to compare notes it was found that the loss in killed and wounded had chiefly fallen on marions corps his men from their exposed situation had borne the brunt of the battle while sumters had suffered but little being mostly sheltered in the huts jealousy and distrust were awakened and discord reigned in the camp partisan and volunteer troops readily fall asunder under such circumstances many moved off in the night lee accustomed to act independently and unwilling perhaps to acknowledge sumter as his superior officer took up his line of march for headquarters without consulting him sumter still had force enough now that he was joined by the artillery to have held the enemy in a state of siege but he was short of ammunition and he apprehended the approach of lord rawdon who it was said was moving down from orangeburg he therefore retired across the santee and rejoined greene at his encampment  so ended this foray which fell far short of the expectations formed from the spirit and activity of the leaders and their men one of the best effects of the incursion was the drawing down lord rawdon from orangeburg with five hundred of his troops he returned no more to the upper country but sailed not long after from charleston for europe colonel stuart who was left in command at orangeburg moved forward from that place and encamped on the south side of the congaree river near its junction with the wateree and within sixteen miles of greenes position on the high hills of santee the two armies lay in sight of each others fires but two large rivers intervened to secure each party from sudden attack both armies however needed repose and military operations were suspended as if by mutual consent during the sultry summer heat                                       after the grand reconnoissance of the posts on new york island related in a former page the confederate armies remained encamped about dobbs ferry and the greenburg hills awaiting an augmentation of force for their meditated attack letters now came from lafayette dated 26th and 30th of july speaking of the embarkation of the greatest part of cornwallis army at portsmouth he supposed their destination to be new york yet though wind and weather were favorable they did not sail should a french fleet now come into hampton roads adds the sanguine marquis the british army would i think be ours at this juncture arrived the french frigate concorde at newport bringing despatches from admiral the count de grasse he was to leave st domingo on the 3d of august with between twentyfive and thirty shipsoftheline and a considerable body of land forces and to steer immediately for the chesapeake  this changed the face of affairs and called for a change in the game all attempt upon new york was postponed the whole of the french army and as large a part of the americans as could be spared were to move to virginia and cooperate with the count de grasse for the redemption of the southern states washington apprised the count by letter of this intention he wrote also to lafayette on the 15th of august by the time this reaches you the count de grasse will either be in the chesapeake or may be looked for every moment under these circumstances whether the enemy remain in full force or whether they have only a detachment left you will immediately take such a position as will best enable you to prevent their sudden retreat through north carolina which i presume they will attempt the instant they perceive so formidable an armament  washingtons soul was now in arms at length after being baffled and disappointed so often by the incompetency of his means and above all thwarted by the enemys naval potency he had the possibility of coping with them both on land and sea the contemplated expedition was likely to consummate his plans and wind up the fortunes of the war and he determined to lead it in person he would take with him something more than two thousand of the american army the rest chiefly northern troops were to remain with general heath who was to hold command of the posts of the hudson perfect secrecy was maintained as to this change of plan preparations were still carried on as if for an attack upon new york an extensive encampment was marked out in the jerseys and ovens erected and fuel provided for the baking of bread as if a part of the besieging force was to be stationed there thence to make a descent upon the enemys garrison on staten island in aid of the operations against the city the american troops themselves were kept in ignorance of their destination  previous to his decampment washington sent forward a party of pioneers to clear the roads towards kings bridge as if the posts recently reconnoitred were about to be attempted on the 19th of august his troops were paraded with their faces in that direction when all were ready however they were ordered to face about and were marched up along the hudson river towards kings ferry de rochambeau in like manner broke up his encampment and took the road by white plains north castle pines bridge and crompond toward the same point  on the 20th washington arrived at kings ferry and his troops began to cross the hudson with their baggage stores and cannon and encamp at haverstraw he himself crossed in the evening and took up his quarters at colonel hays at the white house thence he wrote to the count de grasse presuming that the letter would find him in the chesapeake urging him to send up all his frigates and transports to the head of elk by the 8th of september for the transportation of the combined army which would be there by that time he informed him also that the count de barras had resolved to join him in the chesapeake with his squadron  on the 22d the french troops arrived by their circuitous route and began to cross to stony point with their artillery baggage and stores the two armies having safely crossed the hudson commenced on the 25th their several lines of march toward the jerseys both armies were still kept in the dark as to the ultimate object of their movement an intelligent observer who accompanied the army writes our situation reminds me of some theatrical exhibition where the interest and expectations of the spectators are continually increasing and where curiosity is wrought to the highest point the mystery was at length solved we have now passed all the enemys posts continues the foregoing writer and are pursuing our route with increased rapidity toward philadelphia  washington reached the delaware with his troops before sir henry clinton was aware of their destination it was too late to oppose their march even had his forces been adequate as a kind of counterplot therefore and in the hope of distracting the attention of the american commander and drawing off a part of his troops he hurried off an expedition to the eastward to insult the state of connecticut and attack her seaport of new london the command of this expedition which was to be one of ravage and destruction was given to arnold as if it was necessary to complete the measure of his infamy that he should carry fire and sword into his native state and desecrate the very cradle of his infancy  on the 6th of september he appeared off the harbor of new london with a fleet of ships and transports and a force of two thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry new london stands on the west bank of the river thames the approach to it was defended by two forts on opposite sides of the river and about a mile below the town fort trumbull on the west and fort griswold on the east side on a height called groton hill the troops landed in two divisions of about eight hundred men each one under lieutenantcolonel eyre on the east side the other under arnold on the west on the same side with new london and about three miles below it arnold met with but little opposition the few militia who manned an advance battery and fort trumbull abandoned their posts and crossed the river to fort griswold he pushed on and took possession of the town  colonel eyre had a harder task the militia about one hundred and fiftyseven strong had collected in fort griswold hastily and imperfectly armed it is true but they were brave men and had a brave commander colonel william ledyard brother of the celebrated traveller the fort was square and regularly built arnold unaware of its strength had ordered colonel eyre to take it by a coup de main he discovered his mistake and sent counter orders but too late colonel eyre forced the pickets made his way into the fosse and attacked the force on three sides it was bravely defended the enemy were repeatedly repulsed they returned to the assault scrambled up on each others shoulders effected a lodgment on the fraise and made their way with fixed bayonets through the embrasures colonel eyre received a mortal wound near the works major montgomery took his place a negro thrust him through with a spear as he mounted the parapet major bromfield succeeded to the command and carried the fort at the point of the bayonet in fact after the enemy were within the walls the fighting was at an end and the slaughter commenced colonel ledyard had ordered his men to lay down their arms but the enemy exasperated by the resistance they had experienced and by the death of their officers continued the deadly work of the musket and the bayonet colonel ledyard it is said was thrust through with his own sword after yielding it up to major bromfield seventy of the garrison were slain and thirtyfive desperately wounded and most of them after the fort had been taken the loss of the enemy was two officers and fortysix soldiers killed and eight officers and one hundred and thirtyfive soldiers wounded  arnold in the meantime had carried on the work of destruction at new london some of the american shipping had effected their escape up the river but a number were burnt fire too was set to the public stores it communicated to the dwellinghouses and in a little while the whole place was wrapped in flames having completed his ravage arnold retreated to his boats leaving the town still burning so ended his career of infamy in his native land a land which had once delighted to honor him but in which his name was never thenceforth to be pronounced without a malediction  on the 30th of august washington with his suite had arrived at philadelphia during his sojourn in the city he was hospitably entertained at the house of mr morris the patriotic financier the greatest difficulty with which he had to contend in his present enterprise was the want of funds part of his troops not having received any pay for a long time and having occasionally given evidence of great discontent in this emergency he was accommodated by the count de rochambeau with a loan of twenty thousand hard dollars which mr robert morris engaged to repay by the 1st of october this pecuniary pressure was relieved by the arrival in boston on the 25th of august of colonel john laurens from his mission to france bringing with him two and a half millions of livres in cash being part of a subsidy of six millions of livres granted by the french king on the 2d of september the american troops passed through philadelphia the french troops entered on the following day  at philadelphia washington received despatches from lafayette dated the 21st and 24th of august from his camp at the forks of york river in virginia the embarkation at portsmouth which the marquis had supposed might be intended for new york was merely for yorktown where cornwallis had determined to establish the permanent post ordered in his instructions yorktown was a small place situated on a projecting bank on the south side of york river opposite a promontory called gloucester point the river between was not more than a mile wide but deep enough to admit ships of a large size and burthen here concentrating his forces he had proceeded to fortify the opposite points calculating to have the works finished by the beginning of october believing that he had no present enemy but lafayette to guard against cornwallis felt so secure in his position that he wrote to sir henry on the 22d of august offering to detach a thousand or twelve hundred men to strengthen new york against the apprehended attack of the combined armies  washington left philadelphia on the 5th of september on his way to the head of elk about three miles below chester he was met by an express bearing tidings of the arrival of the count de grasse in the chesapeake with twentyeight shipsoftheline washington instantly rode back to chester to rejoice with the count de rochambeau who was coming down to that place from philadelphia by water  washington reached the head of elk on the 6th the troops and a great part of the stores were already arrived and beginning to embark thence he wrote to the count de grasse felicitating him on his arrival and informing him that the van of the two armies were about to embark and fall down the chesapeake form a junction with the troops under the count de st simon and the marquis de lafayette and cooperate in blocking up cornwallis in york river so as to prevent his retreat by land or his getting any supplies from the country everything had thus far gone on well but there were not vessels enough at the head of elk for the immediate transportation of all the troops ordnance and stores a part of the troops would have to proceed to baltimore by land leaving general heath to bring on the american forces and the baron de viomenil the french washington accompanied by de rochambeau crossed the susquehanna early on the 8th and pushed forward for baltimore  on the 9th he left baltimore a little after daybreak accompanied only by colonel humphreys the rest of his suite were to follow at their ease for himself he was determined to reach mount vernon that evening six years had elapsed since last he was under its roof six wearing years of toil of danger and of constant anxiety during all that time and amid all his military cares he had kept up a regular weekly correspondence with his steward or agent regulating all the affairs of his rural establishment with as much exactness as he did those of the army it was a late hour when he arrived he was joined by his suite at dinnertime on the following day and by the count de rochambeau in the evening general chastellux and his aidesdecamp arrived there on the 11th and mount vernon was now crowded with guests who were all entertained in the ample style of old virginian hospitality on the 12th tearing himself away once more from the home of his heart washington with his military associates continued onward to join lafayette at williamsburg     chapter lxiv operations before yorktowngreene in the south   lord cornwallis had been completely roused from his dream of security by the appearance on the 28th of august of the fleet of count de grasse within the capes of the delaware three french shipsoftheline and a frigate soon anchored at the mouth of york river the boats of the fleet were immediately busy conveying three thousand three hundred land forces under the marquis de st simon up james river to form the preconcerted junction with those under lafayette awakened to his danger cornwallis as washington had foreseen meditated a retreat to the carolinas it was too late york river was blocked up by french ships james river was filled with armed vessels covering the transportation of the troops his lordship reconnoitred williamsburg it was too strong to be forced and wayne had crossed james river to join his troops to those under the marquis seeing his retreat cut off in every direction cornwallis proceeded to strengthen his works sending off repeated expresses to apprise sir henry clinton of his perilous situation  the count de grasse had been but a few days anchored within the chesapeake and fifteen hundred of his seamen were absent conveying the troops up james river when admiral graves who then commanded the british naval force on the american coast appeared with twenty sail off the capes of virginia de grasse anxious to protect the squadron of the count de barras which was expected from rhode island and which it was the object of graves to intercept immediately slipped his cables and put to sea with twentyfour ships leaving the rest to blockade york and james rivers  admiral graves immediately prepared for action although he had five ships less than de grasse the latter however was not disposed to accept the challenge his force being weakened by the absence of so many of his seamen employed in transporting troops his plan was to occupy the enemy by partial actions and skilful manoeuvres so as to retain his possession of the chesapeake and cover the arrival of de barras  the vans of the two fleets and some ships of the centre engaged about four oclock in the afternoon of the 7th of september the conflict soon became animated several ships were damaged and many men killed and wounded on both sides de grasse who had the advantage of the wind drew off after sunset satisfied with the damage done and sustained and not disposed for a general action for four days the fleets remained in sight of each other repairing damages and manoeuvring but the french having still the advantage of the wind maintained their prudent policy of avoiding a general engagement at length de grasse learning that de barras was arrived within the capes formed a junction with him and returned with him to his former anchoring ground with two english frigates which he had captured admiral graves disappointed in his hope of interrupting de barras and finding the chesapeake guarded by a superior force with which he could not prudently contend left the coast and bore away for new york under convoy of the squadron of de barras came a fleet of transports conveying land forces under m de choisy with siege artillery and military stores  from williamsburg washington sent forward count fersen one of the aidesdecamp of de rochambeau to hurry on the french troops with all possible despatch he wrote to the same purport to general lincoln every day we now lose said he is comparatively an age as soon as it is in our power with safety we ought to take our position near the enemy hurry on then my dear sir with your troops on the wings of speed  it was with great satisfaction washington learned that admiral de barras had anticipated his wishes in sending transports and prize vessels up the bay to assist in bringing on the french troops in the meantime he with count de rochambeau was desirous of having an interview with the admiral on board of his ship provided he could send some fastsailing cutter to receive them a small ship the queen charlotte was furnished by the admiral for the purpose it had been captured on its voyage from charleston to new york having lord rawdon on board and had been commodiously fitted up for his lordships reception  on board of this vessel washington and de rochambeau with the chevalier de chastellux and generals knox and duportail embarked on the 18th and proceeding down james river came the next morning in sight of the french fleet riding at anchor in lynn haven bay just under the point of cape henry about noon they got alongside of the admirals ship the ville de paris and were received on board with great ceremony and naval and military parade admiral de grasse was a tall finelooking man plain in his address and prompt in the discharge of business a plan of cooperation was soon arranged to be carried into effect on the arrival of the american and french armies from the north which were actually on their way down the chesapeake from the head of elk business being despatched dinner was served after which they were conducted throughout the ship and received the officers of the fleet almost all of whom came on board  by the 25th the american and french troops were mostly arrived and encamped near williamsburg and preparations were made for the decisive blow  yorktown as has already been noted is situated on the south side of york river immediately opposite gloucester point cornwallis had fortified the town by seven redoubts and six batteries on the land side connected by intrenchments and there was a line of batteries along the river the town was flanked on each side by deep ravines and creeks emptying into york river their heads in front of the town being not more than half a mile apart the enemy had availed themselves of these natural defences in the arrangement of extensive outworks with redoubts strengthened by abatis fieldworks mounted with cannon and trees cut down and left with the branches pointed outward gloucester point had likewise been fortified its batteries with those of yorktown commanded the intervening river ships of war were likewise stationed on it protected by the guns of the forts and the channel was obstructed by sunken vessels the defence of gloucester point was confided to lieutenantcolonel dundas with six or seven hundred men  that evening cornwallis received despatches from sir henry clinton informing him of the arrival of admiral digby and that a fleet of twentythree shipsoftheline with about five thousand troops would sail to his assistance probably on the 5th of october cornwallis immediately wrote in reply i have ventured these last two days to look general washingtons whole force in the face in the position on the outside of my works and have the pleasure to assure your excellency that there is but one wish throughout the army which is that the enemy would advance i shall retire this night within the works and have no doubt if relief arrives in any reasonable time york and gloucester will be both in the possession of his majestys troops that night his lordship accordingly abandoned his outworks and drew his troops within the town the outworks thus abandoned were seized upon the next morning by detachments of american light infantry and french troops and served to cover the troops employed in throwing up breastworks  the combined french and american forces were now twelve thousand strong exclusive of the virginia militia which general thomas nelson now governor of virginia had brought into the field on the morning of the 28th of september the combined armies marched from williamsburg toward yorktown about twelve miles distant and encamped at night within two miles of it driving in the pickets and some patrols of cavalry general de choisy was sent across york river with lauzuns legion and general weedons brigade of militia to watch the enemy on the side of gloucester point by the 1st of october the line of the besiegers nearly two miles from the works formed a semicircle each end resting on the river so that the investment by land was complete while the count de grasse with the main fleet remained in lynn haven bay to keep off assistance by sea  the besieged army began now to be greatly distressed for want of forage and had to kill many of their horses the carcasses of which were continually floating down the river in the evening of the 2d of october tarleton with his legion and the mounted infantry were passed over the river to gloucester point to assist in foraging at daybreak lieutenantcolonel dundas led out part of his garrison to forage the neighboring country about ten oclock the wagons and bat horses laden with indian corn were returning covered by tarleton and his dragoons as a rearguard when word was brought that an enemy was advancing in force the report was confirmed by a cloud of dust from which emerged lauzun and the frence hussars and lancers  tarleton with part of his legion advanced to meet them the rest with simcoes dragoons remained as a rearguard in a skirt of woods a skirmish ensued gallantly sustained on each side but the superiority of tarletons horses gave him the advantage general choisy hastened up with a corps of cavalry and infantry to support the hussars in the medley fight a dragoons horse wounded by a lance plunged and overthrew both tarleton and his steed the rearguard rushed from their covert to rescue their commander they came galloping up in such disorder that they were roughly received by lauzuns hussars who were drawn up on the plain in the meantime tarleton scrambled out of the mel√©e mounted another horse and ordered a retreat to enable his men to recover from their confusion dismounting forty infantry he placed them in a thicket their fire checked the hussars in their pursuit the british dragoons rallied and were about to charge when the hussars retired behind their infantry and a fire was opened upon the british by some militia from behind a fence tarleton again ordered a retreat to be sounded and the conflict came to an end this was the last affair of tarleton and his legion in the revolutionary war the next day general choisy being reinforced by a detachment of marines from the fleet of de grasse cut off all communication by land between gloucester and the country  at this momentous time when the first parallel before the besieged city was about to be opened washington received dispatches from his faithful coadjutor general greene giving him important intelligence of his cooperations in the south to consider which we will suspend for a moment our narrative of affairs before yorktown  for some weeks in the months of july and august general greene had remained encamped with his main force on the high hills of santee refreshing and disciplining his men and awaiting the arrival of promised reinforcements in the meantime marion with his light troops aided by colonel washington with his dragoons held control over the lower santee lee was detached to operate with sumters brigade on the congaree and colonel harden with his mounted militia was scouring the country about the edisto  greene was disappointed as to reinforcements all that he had received were two hundred north carolina levies and five hundred south carolina militia still he prepared for a bold effort to drive the enemy from their remaining posts for that purpose on the 22d of august he broke up his encampment to march against colonel stuart the latter still lay encamped about sixteen miles distant in a straight line but the congaree and wateree lay between bordered by swamps overflowed by recent rains to cross them and reach the hostile camp it was necessary to make a circuit of seventy miles while greene was making it stuart abandoned his position and moved down forty miles to the vicinity of eutaw springs where he was reinforced by a detachment from charleston with provisions  greene followed on by easy marches he had been joined by general pickens with a party of the ninetysix militia and by the state troops under lieutenantcolonel henderson and now moved slowly to give time for marion who was scouring the country about the edisto to rejoin him this was done on the 5th of september at laurens place within seventeen miles of stuarts camp here baggage tents everything that could impede motion was left behind and on the afternoon of the 7th the army was pushed on within seven miles of the eutaws where it bivouacked for the night at four oclock in the morning this little army was in motion greenes whole force at that time did not exceed two thousand men that of the enemy he was seeking about twentythree hundred the americans however were superior in cavalry his army advanced in two columns which were to form the two lines of battle within four miles of eutaw they met with a british detachment of one hundred and fifty infantry and fifty cavalry under major coffin sent forward to reconnoitre it was put to flight after a severe skirmish supposing this to be the van of the enemy greene halted his columns and formed the south carolinians in equal divisions formed the right and left of the first line the north carolinians the centre general marion commanded the right general pickens the left colonel malmedy the centre colonel henderson with the state troops covered the left of the line colonel lee with his legion the right  of the second line composed of regulars the north carolinians under general sumner were on the right the marylanders under colonel williams on the left the virginians under colonel campbell in the centre colonel washington with his cavalry followed in the rear as a corps de reserve two threepounders moved on the road in the centre of the first line two sixpounders in a like position in the second line in this order the troops moved forward keeping their lines as well as they could through open woods which covered the country on each side of the road  within a mile of the camp they encountered a body of infantry thrown forward by colonel stuart to check their advance while he had time to form his troops in order of battle these were drawn up in line in a wood two hundred yards west of eutaw springs the right rested on eutaw creek and was covered by a battalion of grenadiers and infantry under major majoribanks partly concealed among thickets on the margin of the stream the left of the line extended across the charleston road with a reserve corps in a commanding situation covering the road about fifty yards in the rear of the british line was a cleared field in which was their encampment with the tents all standing adjoining it was a brick house with a palisadoed garden which colonel stuart intended as a protection if too much pressed by cavalry the advanced party of infantry which had retired firing before the americans formed on the flanks of colonel stuarts line the carolinian militia had pressed after them about nine oclock the action was commenced by the left of the american line and soon became general the militia fought until they had expended seventeen rounds when they gave way covered by lee and henderson who fought bravely on the flanks of the line  sumner with the regulars who formed the second line advanced in fine style to take the place of the first the enemy likewise brought their reserve into action the conflict continued to be bloody and severe sumners brigade formed partly of recruits gave way under the superior fire of the enemy the british rushed forward to secure their fancied victory greene seeing their line disordered instantly ordered williams with his marylanders to sweep the field with the bayonet williams was seconded by colonel campbell with the virginians the order was gallantly obeyed they delivered a deadly volley at forty yards distance and then advanced at a brisk rate with loud shouts and trailed arms the british recoiled while the marylanders and virginians attacked them in front lee with his legion turned their left flank and charged them in rear colonel hampton with the state cavalry made a great number of prisoners and colonel washington coming up with his reserve of horse and foot completed their defeat they were driven back through their camp many were captured many fled along the charleston road and others threw themselves into the brick house  major majoribanks and his troops could still enfilade the left flank of the americans from their covert among the thickets on the border of the stream greene ordered colonel washington with his dragoons and kirkwoods delaware infantry to dislodge them and colonel wade hampton to assist with the state troops colonel washington without waiting for the infantry dashed forward with his dragoons it was a rash move the thickets were impervious to cavalry the dragoons separated into small squads and endeavored to force their way in horses and riders were shot down or bayoneted most of the officers were either killed or wounded colonel washington had his horse shot under him he himself was bayoneted and would have been slain had not a british officer interposed who took him prisoner by the time hampton and kirkwood came up the cavalry were routed while hampton rallied them kirkwood with his delawares charged with bayonet upon the enemy in the thickets majoribanks fell back with his troops and made a stand in the palisadoed garden of the brick house  victory now seemed certain on the side of the americans unfortunately the soldiers thinking the day their own fell to plundering the tents devouring the food and carousing on the liquors found there many of them became intoxicated and unmanageablethe officers interfered in vain all was riot and disorder  the enemy in the meantime recovered from their confusion and opened a fire from every window of the house and from the palisadoed garden there was a scattering fire also from the woods and thickets on the right and left colonel stuart was by this time rallying his left wing and advancing to support the right when greene finding his ammunition nearly exhausted determined to give up the attempt to dislodge the enemy from their places of refuge since he could not do it without severe loss he remained on the ground long enough to collect his wounded excepting those who were too much under the fire of the house and then leaving colonel hampton with a strong picket on the field he returned to the position seven miles off which he had left in the morning  the enemy decamped in the night after destroying a large quantity of provisions and breaking upwards of a thousand stand of arms they left behind also seventy of their wounded their loss in killed wounded and captured in this action was six hundred and thirtythree of whom five hundred were prisoners the loss sustained by the americans in killed wounded and missing was five hundred and thirtyfive one of the slain most deplored was colonel campbell who had so bravely led on the virginians  stuart met with reinforcements about fourteen miles from eutaw but continued his retreat to monks corner within twentyfive miles of charleston greene followed with his main force almost to monks corner finding the number and position of the enemy too strong to be attacked with prudence he fell back to eutaw where he remained a day or two to rest his troops and then returned by easy marches to his old position near the heights of santee     chapter lxv siege and surrender of yorktown   general lincoln had the honor on the night of the 6th of october of opening the first parallel before yorktown it was within six hundred yards of the enemy nearly two miles in extent and the foundations were laid for two redoubts he had under him a large detachment of french and american troops and the work was conducted with such silence and secrecy in a night of extreme darkness that the enemy were not aware of it until daylight a severe cannonade was then opened from the fortifications but the men were under cover and continued working by the afternoon of the 9th the parallel was completed and two or three batteries were ready to fire upon the town general washington put the match to the first gun says an observer who was present a furious discharge of cannon and mortars immediately followed and earl cornwallis received his first salutation  the cannonade was kept up almost incessantly for three or four days from the batteries above mentioned and from three others managed by the french the halffinished works of the enemy suffered severely the guns were dismounted or silenced and many men killed the redhot shot from the french batteries northwest of the town reached the english shipping the charon a fortyfour gun ship and three large transports were set on fire by them the flames ran up the rigging to the tops of the masts the conflagration seen in the darkness of the night with the accompanying flash and thundering of cannon and soaring and bursting of shells and the tremendous explosions of the ships all presented a scene of mingled magnificence and horror  on the night of the 11th the second parallel was opened by the baron steubens division within three hundred yards of the works the british now made new embrasures and for two or three days kept up a galling fire upon those at work the latter were still more annoyed by the flanking fire of two redoubts three hundred yards in front of the british works as they enfiladed the intrenchments and were supposed also to command the communication between yorktown and gloucester it was resolved to storm them both on the night of the 14th the one nearest the river by a detachment of americans commanded by lafayette the other by a french detachment led by the baron de viomenil in the arrangements for the assault lafayette had given the honor of leading the advance to his own aidedecamp lieutenantcolonel gimat this instantly touched the military pride of hamilton who exclaimed against it as an unjust preference it being his tour of duty it was therefore arranged that colonel gimats battalion should lead the van and be followed by that of hamilton and that the latter should command the whole advanced corps  about eight oclock in the evening rockets were sent up as signals for the simultaneous attack hamilton to his great joy led the advance of the americans the men without waiting for the sappers to demolish the abatis in regular style pushed them aside or pulled them down with their hands and scrambled over like rough bushfighters hamilton was the first to mount the parapet placing one foot on the shoulder of a soldier who knelt on one knee for the purpose the men mounted after him not a musket was fired the redoubt was carried at the point of the bayonet the loss of the americans was one sergeant and eight privates killed seven officers and twentyfive noncommissioned officers and privates wounded the loss of the enemy was eight killed and seventeen taken prisoners among the latter was major campbell who had commanded the redoubt  the french stormed the other redoubt which was more strongly garrisoned with equal gallantry but less precipitation they proceeded according to rule the soldiers paused while the sappers removed the abatis during which time they were exposed to a destructive fire and lost more men than did the americans in their headlong attack the abatis being removed the troops rushed to the assault the chevalier de lameth lafayettes adjutantgeneral was the first to mount the parapet of the redoubt and received a volley at arms length from the hessians who manned it shot through both knees he fell back into the ditch and was conveyed away under care of his friend the count de dumas the count de deuxponts leading on the royal grenadiers of the same name was likewise wounded the grenadiers of the gatinais regiment fought with true gallic fire one third of them were slain and among them captain de sireuil a valiant officer of chasseurs  the redoubts thus taken were included the same night in the second parallel and howitzers were mounted upon them the following day the capture of them reduced lord cornwallis almost to despair writing that same day to sir henry clinton he observes my situation now becomes very critical we dare not show a gun to their old batteries and i expect that their new ones will open tomorrow morning the safety of the place is therefore so precarious that i cannot recommend that the fleet and army should run great risk in endeavoring to save us a generous abnegation of self on the part of the beleaguered commander had the fleet and army sailed as he had been given to expect about the 5th of october they might have arrived in time to save his lordship but at the date of the above letter they were still lingering in port delay of naval succor was fatal to british operations in this war  the second parallel was now nearly ready to open cornwallis dreaded the effect of its batteries on his almost dismantled works to retard the danger as much as possible he ordered an attack on two of the batteries that were in the greatest state of forwardness their guns to be spiked it was made a little before daybreak of the 16th by about three hundred and fifty men under the direction of lieutenantcolonel abercrombie the redoubts which covered the batteries were forced in gallant style and several pieces of artillery hastily spiked by this time the supporting troops from the trenches came up and the enemy were obliged to retreat the mischief had been done too hastily the spikes were easily extracted and before evening all the batteries and the parallel were nearly complete  at this time the garrison could not show a gun on the side of the works exposed to attack and the shells were nearly expended the place was no longer tenable rather than surrender cornwallis determined to attempt an escape his plan was to leave his sick and wounded and his baggage behind cross over in the night to gloucester point attack choisys camp before daybreak mount his infantry on the captured cavalry horses and on such other as could be collected on the road push for the upper country by rapid marches until opposite the fords of the great rivers then turn suddenly northward force his way through maryland pennsylvania and the jerseys and join sir henry clinton in new york it was a wild and daring scheme but his situation was desperate and the idea of surrender intolerable  in pursuance of this design sixteen large boats were secretly prepared a detachment was appointed to remain and capitulate for the townspeople the sick and the wounded a large part of the troops were transported to the gloucester side of the river before midnight and the second division had actually embarked when a violent storm of wind and rain scattered the boats and drove them a considerable distance down the river they were collected with difficulty it was now too late to effect the passage of the second division before daybreak and an effort was made to get back the division which had already crossed it was not done until the morning was far advanced and the troops in recrossing were exposed to the fire of the american batteries  the hopes of lord cornwallis were now at an end his works were tumbling in ruins about him under an incessant cannonade his garrison was reduced in number by sickness and death and exhausted by constant watching and severe duty unwilling to expose the residue of the brave troops which had stood by him so faithfully to the dangers and horrors of an assault which could not fail to be successful he ordered a parley to be beaten about ten oclock on the morning of the 17th and despatched a flag with a letter to washington proposing a cessation of hostilities for twentyfour hours and that two officers might be appointed by each side to meet and settle terms for the surrender of the posts of york and gloucester washington felt unwilling to grant such delay when reinforcements might be on the way for cornwallis from new york in reply therefore he requested that previous to the meeting of commissioners his lordships proposals might be sent in writing to the american lines for which purpose a suspension of hostilities during two hours from the delivery of the letter would be granted this was complied with but as the proposals offered by cornwallis were not all admissible washington drew up a schedule of such terms as he would grant and transmitted it to his lordship  the armistice was prolonged commissioners met the viscount de noailles and lieutenantcolonel laurens on the part of the allies colonel dundas and major ross on the part of the british after much discussion a rough draft was made of the terms of capitulation to be submitted to the british general these washington caused to be promptly transcribed and sent to lord cornwallis early in the morning of the 19th with a note expressing his expectation that they would be signed by eleven oclock and that the garrison would be ready to march out by two oclock in the afternoon lord cornwallis was fain to comply and accordingly on the same day the posts of yorktown and gloucester were surrendered to general washington as commanderinchief of the combined army and the ships of war transports and other vessels to the count de grasse as commander of the french fleet the garrison of yorktown and gloucester including the officers of the navy and seamen of every denomination were to surrender as prisoners of war to the combined army the land force to remain prisoners to the united states the seamen to the king of france1 the garrison was to be allowed the same honors granted to the garrison of charleston when it surrendered to sir henry clinton the officers were to retain their side arms both officers and soldiers their private property and no part of their baggage or papers was to be subject to search or inspection the soldiers were to be kept in virginia maryland or pennsylvania as much by regiments as possible and supplied with the same rations of provisions as the american soldiers the officers were to be permitted to proceed upon parole to europe or to any maritime port on the continent of america in possession of british troops  footnote 1 the number of prisoners amounted to 7073 of whom 5950 were rank and file six commissioned and twentyeight noncommissioned officers and privates had previously been captured in the two redoubts or in the sortie of the garrison the loss sustained by the garrison during the siege in killed wounded and missing amounted to 552 that of the combined army in killed was about 300 the combined army to which cornwallis surrendered was estimated at 16000 of whom 7000 were french 5500 continentals and 3500 militiaholmes annals  on the following morning washington in general orders congratulated the allied armies on the recent victory awarding high praise to the officers and troops both french and american for their conduct during the siege and specifying by name several of the generals and other officers who had especially distinguished themselves all those of his army who were under arrest were pardoned and set at liberty  cornwallis felt deeply the humiliation of this close to all his wide and wild campaigning and was made the more sensitive on the subject by circumstances of which he soon became apprised on the very day that he had been compelled to lay down his arms before yorktown the lingering armament intended for his relief sailed from new york it consisted of twentyfive shipsoftheline two fiftygun ships and eight frigates with sir henry clinton and seven thousand of his best troops sir henry arrived off the capes of virginia on the 24th and gathered information which led him to apprehend that lord cornwallis had capitulated he hovered off the mouth of the chesapeake until the 29th when having fully ascertained that he had come too late he turned his tardy prows toward new york  in the meantime rejoicings spread throughout the union cornwallis is taken was the universal acclaim it was considered a deathblow to the war congress gave way to transports of joy thanks were voted to the commanderinchief to the counts de rochambeau and de grasse to the officers of the allied armies generally and to the corps of artillery and engineers especially two stands of colors trophies of the capitulation were voted to washington two pieces of field ordnance to de rochambeau and de grasse and it was decreed that a marble column commemorative of the alliance between france and the united states and of the victory achieved by their associated arms should be erected in yorktown finally congress issued a proclamation appointing a day for general thanksgiving and prayer in acknowledgment of this signal interposition of divine providence  far different was the feeling of the british ministry when news of the event reached the other side of the atlantic lord george germain was the first to announce it to lord north at his office in downing street and how did he take it was the inquiry as he would have taken a ball in the breast replied lord george for he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as he paced up and down the apartment oh god it is all over     chapter lxvi dissolution of the combined armiesdiscontents in the army   washington would have followed up the reduction of yorktown by a combined operation against charleston and addressed a letter to the count de grasse on the subject but the count alleged in reply that the orders of his court ulterior projects and his engagements with the spaniards rendered it impossible to remain the necessary time for the operation  the prosecution of the southern war therefore upon the broad scale which washington had contemplated had to be relinquished for without shipping and a convoy the troops and everything necessary for a siege would have to be transported by land with immense trouble expense and delay while the enemy by means of their fleets could reinforce or withdraw the garrison at pleasure under these circumstances washington had to content himself for the present with detaching two thousand pennsylvania maryland and virginia continental troops under general st clair for the support of general greene trusting that with this aid he would be able to command the interior of south carolina and confine the enemy to the town of charleston  a dissolution of the combined forces now took place the marquis st simon embarked his troops on the last of october and the count de grasse made sail on the 4th of november taking with him two beautiful horses which washington had presented to him in token of cordial regard lafayette seeing there was no probability of further active service in the present year resolved to return to france on a visit to his family and with washingtons approbation set out for philadelphia to obtain leave of absence from congress  the british prisoners were marched to winchester in virginia and frederickstown in maryland and lord cornwallis and his principal officers sailed for new york on parole the main part of the american army embarked for the head of elk and returned northward under the command of general lincoln to be cantoned for the winter in the jerseys and on the hudson so as to be ready for operations against new york or elsewhere in the next years campaign the french army were to remain for the winter in virginia and the count de rochambeau established his headquarters at williamsburg  having attended in person to the distribution of ordnance and stores the departure of prisoners and the embarkation of the troops under lincoln washington left yorktown on the 5th of november and arrived the same day at eltham the seat of his friend colonel bassett he arrived just in time to receive the last breath of john parke custis the son of mrs washington the deceased had been an object of washingtons care from childhood and had been cherished by him with paternal affection formed under his guidance and instructions he had been fitted to take a part in the public concerns of his country and had acquitted himself with credit as a member of the virginia legislature he was but twentyeight years old at the time of his death and left a widow and four young children it was an unexpected event and the dying scene was rendered peculiarly affecting from the presence of the mother and wife of the deceased as a consolation to mrs washington in her bereavement washington adopted the two youngest children of the deceased a boy and girl who thenceforth formed a part of his immediate family  from eltham washington proceeded to mount vernon but public cares gave him little leisure to attend to his private concerns we have seen how repeatedly his steady mind had been exercised in the darkest times of the revolutionary struggle in buoying up the public heart when sinking into despondency he had now an opposite task to perform to guard against an overweening confidence inspired by the recent triumph in a letter to general greene he writes i shall remain but a few days here and shall proceed to philadelphia when i shall attempt to stimulate congress to the best improvement of our late success by taking the most vigorous and effectual measures to be ready for an early and decisive campaign the next year my greatest fear is that congress viewing this stroke in too important a point of light may think our work too nearly closed and will fall into a state of languor and relaxation  towards the end of november washington was in philadelphia where congress received him with distinguished honors he lost no time in enforcing the policy respecting the ensuing campaign which he had set forth in his letter to general greene his views were met by the military committee of congress with which he was in frequent consultation and by the secretaries of war finance and public affairs who attended their conferences under his impulse and personal supervision the military arrangements for 1782 were made with unusual despatch on the 10th of december resolutions were passed in congress for requisitions of men and money from the several states and washington backed those requisitions by letters to the respective governors urging prompt compliance the persuasion that peace was at hand was however too prevalent for the public to be roused to new sacrifices and toils to maintain what was considered the mere shadow of a war the states were slow in furnishing a small part of their respective quotas of troops and still slower in answering to the requisitions for money after remaining four months in philadelphia washington set out in march to rejoin the army at newburg on the hudson  in a recent letter to general greene washington had expressed himself strongly on the subject of retaliation of all laws it is the most difficult to execute where you have not the transgressor himself in your possession humanity will ever interfere and plead strongly against the sacrifice of an innocent person for the guilt of another his judgment and feelings were soon put to the proof in this respect a new york refugee by the name of philip white had been captured by the jersey people and killed in attempting to escape his partisans in new york determined on a signal revenge captain joseph huddy who had been captured when bravely defending a blockhouse in monmouth county was now drawn forth from prison conducted into the jerseys by a party of refugees headed by a captain lippencott and hanged on the heights of middletown the neighboring country cried out for retaliation washington submitted the matter to a board of general and fieldofficers it was unanimously determined that the offender should be demanded for execution and if not given up that retaliation should be exercised on a british prisoner of equal rank washington accordingly sent proofs to sir henry clinton of what he stigmatized as a murder and demanded that the officer who commanded the execution of captain huddy should be given up sir henry declined a compliance but stated that he had ordered a strict inquiry into the circumstances of captain huddys death and would bring the perpetrators of it to immediate trial  washington about the same time received the copy of a resolution of congress approving of his firm and judicious conduct and promising to support him in his fixed purpose of exemplary retaliation he accordingly ordered a selection to be made by lot for the above purpose from among the british officers prisoners at lancaster in pennsylvania the lot fell upon captain charles asgill of the guards a youth only nineteen years of age of an amiable character and only son and heir of sir charles asgill a wealthy baronet the youth bore his lot with firmness but his fellow prisoners were incensed at sir henry clinton for exposing him to such a fate by refusing to deliver up the culprit one of their number a son of the earl of ludlow solicited permission from washington to proceed to new york and lay the case before sir guy carleton who had succeeded in command to sir henry clinton the matter remained for some time in suspense  lippencott was at length tried by a courtmartial but acquitted it appearing that he had acted under the verbal orders of governor franklin president of the board of associated loyalists the british commander reprobated the death of captain huddy and broke up the board  these circumstances changed in some degree the ground upon which washington was proceeding he laid the whole matter before congress admitted captain asgill on parole at morristown and subsequently intimated to the secretary of war his private opinion in favor of his release with permission to go to his friends in europe in the meantime lady asgill the mother of the youth had written a pathetic letter to the count de vergennes the french minister of state imploring his intercession in behalf of her son the letter was shown to the king and queen and by their direction the count wrote to washington soliciting the liberation of asgill washington referred to congress the communication from the count and urged a favorable decision to his great relief he received their directions to set captain asgill at liberty  the solicitude felt by washington on account of the universal relaxation of the sinews of war was not allayed by reports of pacific speeches and motions made in the british parliament which might be delusive even if the nation and parliament said he are really in earnest to obtain peace with america it will undoubtedly be wisdom in us to meet them with great caution and circumspection and by all means to keep our arms firm in our hands and instead of relaxing one iota in our exertions rather to spring forward with redoubled vigor that we may take the advantage of every favorable opportunity until our wishes are fully obtained no nation ever yet suffered in treaty by preparing even in the moment of negotiation most vigorously for the field  sir guy carleton arrived in new york early in may to take the place of sir henry clinton who had solicited his recall in a letter dated may 7th sir guy informed washington of his being joined with admiral digby in the commission of peace he transmitted at the same time printed copies of the proceedings in the house of commons on the 4th of march respecting an address to the king in favor of peace and of a bill reported in consequence thereof authorizing the king to conclude a peace or truce with the revolted provinces of north america as this bill however had not passed into a law when sir guy left england it presented no basis for a negotiation and was only cited by him to show the pacific disposition of the british nation with which he professed the most zealous concurrence still though multiplied circumstances gradually persuaded washington of a real disposition on the part of great britain to terminate the war he did not think fit to relax his preparations for hostilities  on the 2d of august sir guy carleton and admiral digby wrote a joint letter to washington informing him that they were acquainted by authority that negotiations for a general peace had already been commenced at paris and that the independence of the united states would be proposed in the first instance by the british commissioner instead of being made a condition of a general treaty even yet washington was wary no offers had been made on the part of great britain for a general cessation of hostilities and although the british commanders were in a manner tied down by the resolves of the house of commons to a defensive war only in the united states they might be at liberty to transport part of their force to the west indies to act against the french possessions in that quarter with these considerations he wrote to the count de rochambeau then at baltimore advising him for the good of the common cause to march his troops to the banks of the hudson and form a junction with the american army the junction took place about the middle of september the french army crossed the hudson at kings ferry to verplancks point where the american forces were paraded under arms to welcome them  great discontents prevailed at this time in the army both among officers and men the army was almost destitute and there were days when the troops were absolutely in want of provisions the pay of the officers too was greatly in arrear many doubted whether they would ever receive the halfpay decreed to them by congress for a term of years after the war and fears began to be expressed that in the event of peace they would all be disbanded with their claims unliquidated and themselves cast upon the community penniless and unfitted by long military habitudes for the gainful pursuits of peace  the army went into winterquarters at newburg and in the leisure and idleness of a winter camp the discontents among the officers had time to ferment the arrearages of pay became a topic of constant and angry comment and a memorial was addressed to congress representing the hardships of the case and proposing that a specific sum should be granted them for the money actually due and as a commutation for halfpay the memorial gave rise to prolonged discussions and the winter passed without any definite measures on the subject meanwhile anonymous papers of a dangerous and incendiary character began to be circulated in the camp and meetings were summoned having in view ulterior measures of redress this washington anticipated by summoning a meeting of the officers in his own name which he addressed in a forcible and feeling manner dwelling upon their services the good intentions of congress and urging them in the most eloquent terms to turn a deaf ear to the specious arguments of those who were attempting to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood his earnest appeal was of effect resolutions were passed declaring that no circumstances of distress or danger should induce them to sully the reputation and glory acquired at the price of their blood and eight years faithful services washington now urged the subject upon the attention of congress and a resolution was concurred in commuting the halfpay into a sum equal to five years whole pay     chapter lxvii news of peacewashingtons farewell to the army and resignation of his commission   at length arrived the wishedfor news of peace a general treaty had been signed at paris on the 20th of january an armed vessel the triumph belonging to the count destaings squadron arrived at philadelphia from cadiz on the 23d of march bringing a letter from the marquis de lafayette to the president of congress communicating the intelligence in a few days sir guy carleton informed washington by letter that he was ordered to proclaim a cessation of hostilities by sea and land  a similar proclamation issued by congress was received by washington on the 17th of april being unaccompanied by any instructions respecting the discharge of the part of the army with him should the measure be deemed necessary he found himself in a perplexing situation  the accounts of peace received at different times had raised an expectation in the minds of those of his troops that had engaged for the war that a speedy discharge must be the consequence of the proclamation most of them could not distinguish between a proclamation of a cessation of hostilities and a definitive declaration of peace and might consider any further claim on their military services an act of injustice it was becoming difficult to enforce the discipline necessary to the coherence of an army washington represented these circumstances in a letter to the president and earnestly entreated a prompt determination on the part of congress as to what was to be the period of the services of these men and how he was to act respecting their discharge he urged that in discharging those who had been engaged for the war the noncommissioned officers and soldiers should be allowed to take with them as their own property and as a gratuity their arms and accoutrements  his letter produced a resolution in congress that the services of the men engaged in the war did not expire until the ratification of the definitive articles of peace but that the commanderinchief might grant furloughs to such as he thought proper and that they should be allowed to take their arms with them washington availed himself freely of this permission furloughs were granted without stint the men set out singly or in small parties for their rustic homes and the danger and inconvenience were avoided of disbanding large masses at a time of unpaid soldiery  in the meantime sir guy carleton was making preparations for the evacuation of the city of new york on the 6th of may a personal conference took place between washington and sir guy at orangetown about the transfer of posts in the united states held by the british troops and the delivery of all property stipulated by the treaty to be given up to the americans on the 8th of may egbert benson william s smith and daniel parker were commissioned by congress to inspect and superintend at new york the embarkation of persons and property in fulfilment of the seventh article of the provisional treaty  the officers in the patriot camp on the hudson were not without gloomy feelings at the thought of their approaching separation from each other eight years of dangers and hardships shared in common and nobly sustained had welded their hearts together and made it hard to rend them asunder prompted by such feelings general knox suggested as a mode of perpetuating the friendships thus formed and keeping alive the brotherhood of the camp the formation of a society composed of the officers of the army the suggestion met with universal concurrence and the hearty approbation of washington meetings were held at which the baron steuben as senior officer presided a plan was drafted and the society was organized  in memory of the illustrious roman lucius quintius cincinnatus who retired from war to the peaceful duties of the citizen it was to be called the society of the cincinnati the objects proposed by it were to preserve inviolate the rights and liberties for which they had contended to promote and cherish national honor and union between the states to maintain brotherly kindness toward each other and extend relief to such officers and their families as might stand in need of it the general society for the sake of frequent communications was to be divided into state societies and these again into districts washington was chosen unanimously to officiate as president of it until the first general meeting to be held in may 1784  on the 8th of june washington addressed a letter to the governors of the several states on the subject of the dissolution of the army the opening of it breathes that aspiration after the serene quiet of private life which had been his dream of happiness throughout the storms and trials of his anxious career but the full fruition of which he was never to realize his letter then described the enviable condition of the citizens of america and proceeded ably and eloquently to discuss what he considered the four things essential to the wellbeing and even the existence of the united states as an independent power  first an indissoluble union of the states under one federal head and a perfect acquiescence of the several states in the full exercise of the prerogative vested in such a head by the constitution  second a sacred regard to public justice in discharging debts and fulfilling contracts made by congress for the purpose of carrying on the war  third the adoption of a proper peace establishment in which care should be taken to place the militia throughout the union on a regular uniform and efficient footing  and fourth a disposition among the people of the united states to forget local prejudices and policies to make mutual concessions and to sacrifice individual advantages to the interests of the community  these four things washington pronounced the pillars on which the glorious character must be supported liberty is the basis and whoever would dare to sap the foundation or overturn the structure under whatever specious pretext he may attempt it will merit the bitterest execration and the severest punishment which can be inflicted by his injured country we forbear to go into the ample and admirable reasoning with which he expatiates on these heads and above all enforces the sacred inviolability of the union they have become familiar with every american mind and ought to govern every american heart  washington resolved to while away part of the time that must intervene before the arrival of the definitive treaty by making a tour to the northern and western parts of the state and visiting the places which had been the theatre of important military transactions he had another object in view he desired to facilitate as far as in his power the operations which would be necessary for occupying as soon as evacuated by british troops the posts ceded by the treaty of peace  governor clinton accompanied him on the expedition they set out by water from newburg ascended the hudson to albany visited saratoga and the scene of burgoynes surrender embarked on lake george where light boats had been provided for them traversed that beautiful lake so full of historic interest proceeded to ticonderoga and crown point and after reconnoitring those eventful posts returned to schenectady whence they proceeded up the valley of the mohawk river having reached fort schuyler formerly fort stanwix they crossed over to wood creek which empties into oneida lake and affords the water communication with ontario they then traversed the country to the head of the eastern branch of the susquehanna and viewed lake otsego and the portage between that lake and the mohawk river washington returned to headquarters at newburg on the 5th of august after a tour of at least seven hundred and fifty miles performed in nineteen days and for the most part on horseback  by a proclamation of congress dated 18th of october all officers and soldiers absent on furlough were discharged from further service and all others who had engaged to serve during the war were to be discharged from and after the 3d of november a small force only composed of those who had enlisted for a definite time were to be retained in service until the peace establishment should be organized in general orders of november 2d washington after adverting to this proclamation adds it only remains for the commanderinchief to address himself once more and that for the last time to the armies of the united states however widely dispersed the individuals who compose them may be and to bid them an affectionate and a long farewell  he then goes on to make them one of those paternal addresses which so eminently characterize his relationship with his army so different from that of any other commander he takes a brief view of the glorious struggle from which they had just emerged the unpromising circumstances under which they had undertaken it and the signal interposition of providence in behalf of their feeble condition the unparalleled perseverance of the american armies for eight long years through almost every possible suffering and discouragement a perseverance which he justly pronounces to be little short of a standing miracle adverting then to the enlarged prospects of happiness opened by the confirmation of national independence and sovereignty and the ample and profitable employments held out in a republic so happily circumstanced he exhorts them to maintain the strongest attachment to the union and to carry with them into civil society the most conciliatory dispositions proving themselves not less virtuous and useful as citizens than they had been victorious as soldiers  notwithstanding every exertion had been made for the evacuation of new york such was the number of persons and the quantity of effects of all kinds to be conveyed away that the month of november was far advanced before it could be completed sir guy carleton had given notice to washington of the time he supposed the different posts would be vacated that the americans might be prepared to take possession of them on the 21st the british troops were drawn in from the oftdisputed post of kings bridge and from mgowans pass also from the various posts on the eastern part of long island paulus hook was relinquished on the following day and the afternoon of the 25th of november was appointed by sir guy for the evacuation of the city and the opposite village of brooklyn  washington in the meantime had taken his station at harlem accompanied by governor clinton who in virtue of his office was to take charge of the city they found there general knox with the detachment from west point sir guy carleton had intimated a wish that washington would be at hand to take immediate possession of the city and prevent all outrage as he had been informed of a plot to plunder the place whenever the kings troops should be withdrawn he had engaged also that the guards of the redoubts on the east river covering the upper part of the town should be the first to be withdrawn and that an officer should be sent to give washingtons advanced guard information of their retiring  although washington doubted the existence of any such plot as that which had been reported to the british commander yet he took precautions accordingly on the morning of the 25th the american troops composed of dragoons light infantry and artillery moved from harlem to the bowery at the upper part of the city there they remained until the troops in that quarter were withdrawn when they marched into the city and took possession the british embarking from the lower parts a formal entry then took place of the military and civil authorities  illustration room in fraunces tavern vol iv  in the course of a few days washington prepared to depart for annapolis where congress was assembling with the intention of asking leave to resign his command a barge was in waiting about noon on the 4th of december at whitehall ferry to convey him across the hudson to paulus hook the principal officers of the army assembled at fraunces tavern in the neighborhood of the ferry to take a final leave of him on entering the room and finding himself surrounded by his old companions in arms who shared with him so many scenes of hardship difficulty and danger his agitated feelings overcame his usual selfcommand filling a glass of wine and turning upon them his benignant but saddened countenance with a heart full of love and gratitude said he i now take leave of you most devoutly wishing that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable having drunk his farewell benediction he added with emotion i cannot come to each of you to take my leave but shall be obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand  general knox who was nearest was the first to advance washington affected even to tears grasped his hand and gave him a brothers embrace in the same affectionate manner he took leave severally of the rest not a word was spoken the deep feeling and manly tenderness of these veterans in the parting moment could find no utterance in words silent and solemn they followed their loved commander as he left the room passed through a corps of light infantry and proceeded on foot to whitehall ferry having entered the barge he turned to them took off his hat and waved a silent adieu they replied in the same manner and having watched the barge until the intervening point of the battery shut it from sight returned still solemn and silent to the place where they had assembled  on his way to annapolis washington stopped for a few days at philadelphia where with his usual exactness in matters of business he adjusted with the comptroller of the treasury his accounts from the commencement of the war down to the 13th of the actual month of december these were all in his own handwriting and kept in the cleanest and most accurate manner each entry being accompanied by a statement of the occasion and object of the charge the gross amount was about fourteen thousand five hundred pounds sterling in which were included moneys expended for secret intelligence and service and in various incidental charges all this it must be noted was an account of money actually expended in the progress of the war not for arrearage of pay for it will be recollected washington accepted no pay  in passing through new jersey pennsylvania and maryland the scenes of his anxious and precarious campaigns washington was everywhere hailed with enthusiasm by the people and greeted with addresses by legislative assemblies and learned and religious institutions being arrived at annapolis he addressed a letter to the president of congress on the 20th of december requesting to know in what manner it would be most proper to offer his resignation whether in writing or at an audience the latter mode was adopted and the hall of congress appointed for the ceremonial  at twelve oclock the 23d the gallery and a great part of the floor of the hall of congress were filled with ladies with public functionaries of the state and with general officers washington entered conducted by the secretary of congress and took his seat in a chair appointed for him after a brief pause the president general mifflin informed him that the united states in congress assembled were prepared to receive his communication washington then rose and delivered a short address  the great events said he on which my resignation depended having at length taken place i now have the honor of offering my sincere congratulations to congress and of presenting myself before them to surrender into their hands the trust committed to me and to claim the indulgence of retiring from the service of my country  after expressing his obligations to the army in general and acknowledging the peculiar services and distinguished merits of the confidential officers who had been attached to his person and composed his family during the war and whom he especially recommended to the favor of congress he continuedhaving now finished the work assigned me i retire from the great theatre of action and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body under whose orders i have long acted i here offer my commission and take my leave of all the employments of public life  having delivered his commission into the hands of the president the latter in reply to his address bore testimony to the patriotism with which he had answered to the call of his country and defended its invaded rights before it had formed alliances and while it was without funds or a government to support him to the wisdom and fortitude with which he had conducted the great military contest invariably regarding the rights of the civil power through all disasters and changes you retire added he from the theatre of action with the blessings of your fellowcitizens but the glory of your virtues will not terminate with your military command it will continue to animate remotest ages  the very next morning washington left annapolis and hastened to his beloved mount vernon where he arrived the same day on christmaseve in a frame of mind suited to enjoy the sacred and genial festival the scene is at last closed said he in a letter to governor clinton i feel myself eased of a load of public care i hope to spend the remainder of my days in cultivating the affections of good men and in the practice of the domestic virtues     chapter lxviii washington at mount vernon   for some time after his return to mount vernon washington was in a manner locked up by the ice and snow of an uncommonly rigorous winter so that social intercourse was interrupted and he could not even pay a visit of duty and affection to his aged mother at fredericksburg but it was enough for him at present that he was at length at home at mount vernon yet the habitudes of the camp still haunted him he could hardly realize that he was free from military duties on waking in the morning he almost expected to hear the drum going its stirring rounds and beating the reveill√©  during the winter storms he anticipates the time when the return of the sun will enable him to welcome his friends and companions in arms to partake of his hospitality and lays down his unpretending plan of receiving the curious visitors who are likely to throng in upon him my manner of living writes he to a friend is plain and i do not mean to be put out of it a glass of wine and a bit of mutton are always ready and such as will be content to partake of them are always welcome those who expect more will be disappointed some degree of economy was necessary for his financial concerns had suffered during the war and the products of his estate had fallen off during his long absence  in the meantime the supreme council of pennsylvania properly appreciating the disinterestedness of his conduct aware that popular love and popular curiosity would attract crowds of visitors to mount vernon and subject him to extraordinary expenses had instructed their delegates in congress to call the attention of that body to these circumstances with a view to produce some national reward for his eminent services before acting upon these instructions the delegates were directed to send a copy of them to washington for his approbation  he received the document while buried in accounts and calculations and when had he been of a mercenary disposition the offered intervention in his favor would have seemed most seasonable but he at once most gratefully and respectfully declined it jealously maintaining the satisfaction of having served his country at the sacrifice of his private interests  as spring advanced mount vernon as had been anticipated began to attract numerous visitors they were received in the frank unpretending style washington had determined upon it was truly edifying to behold how easily and contentedly he subsided from the authoritative commanderinchief of armies into the quiet country gentleman there was nothing awkward or violent in the transition he seemed to be in his natural element mrs washington too who presided with quiet dignity at headquarters and cheered the wintry gloom of valley forge with her presence presided with equal amenity and grace at the simple board of mount vernon she had a cheerful good sense that always made her an agreeable companion and was an excellent manager  in entering upon the outdoor management of his estate washington was but doing in person what he had long been doing through others he had never virtually ceased to be the agriculturist throughout all his campaigns he had kept himself informed of the course of rural affairs at mount vernon by means of maps on which every field was laid down and numbered he was enabled to give directions for their several cultivation and receive accounts of their several crops no hurry of affairs prevented a correspondence with his overseer or agent and he exacted weekly reports thus his rural were interwoven with his military cares the agriculturist was mingled with the soldier  the fairfaxes the kind friends of his boyhood and social companions of his riper years were no longer at hand to share his pleasures and lighten his cares there were no more hunting dinners at belvoir george william fairfax its former possessor was in england his political principles had detained him there during the war and part of his property had been sequestered old lord fairfax the nimrod of greenway court washingtons early friend and patron with whom he had first learned to follow the hounds had lived on in a green old age at his sylvan retreat in the beautiful valley of the shenandoah popular with his neighbors and unmolested by the whigs although frank and open in his adherence to great britain he had attained his ninetysecond year when tidings of the surrender of yorktown wounded the national pride of the old cavalier to the quick and snapped the attenuated thread of his existence  on the 17th of august washington was gladdened by having the marquis de lafayette under his roof who had recently arrived from france the marquis passed a fortnight with him a loved and cherished guest at the end of which he departed for a time to be present at the ceremony of a treaty with the indians  washington now prepared for a tour to the west of the appalachian mountains to visit his lands on the ohio and kanawha rivers dr craik the companion of his various campaigns and who had accompanied him in 1770 on a similar tour was to be his fellowtraveller his original intention had been to survey and inspect his lands on the monongahela river then to descend the ohio to the great kanawha where also he had large tracts of wild land on arriving on the monongahela however he heard such accounts of discontent and irritation among the indian tribes that he did not consider it prudent to venture among them some of his land on the monongahela was settled the rest was in the wilderness and of little value in the present unquiet state of the country he abridged his tour therefore proceeded no further west than the monongahela ascended that river and then struck southward through the wild unsettled regions of the alleghanies until he came out into the shenandoah valley near staunton he returned to mount vernon on the 4th of october  during all this tour he had carefully observed the course and character of the streams flowing from the west into the ohio and the distance of their navigable parts from the head navigation of the rivers east of the mountains with the nearest and best portage between them for many years he had been convinced of the practicability of an easy and short communication between the potomac and james rivers and the waters of the ohio and thence on to the great chain of lakes and of the vast advantages that would result therefrom to the states of virginia and maryland he had even attempted to set a company on foot to undertake at their own expense the opening of such a communication but the breaking out of the revolution had put a stop to the enterprise one object of his recent tour was to make observations and collect information on the subject and all that he had seen and heard quickened his solicitude to carry the scheme into effect he set forth his views upon the subject to benjamin harrison governor of virginia urging its importance to the state and predicting that new york would lose no time in forming communication by water with the western lakes the governor laid the letter before the state legislature and washington was induced to go to richmond to give the measure his personal support  in a letter to richard henry lee recently chosen president of congress he urged it upon his attention suggesting that the western waters should be explored their navigable capabilities ascertained and that a complete map should be made of the country in the latter part of december he was at annapolis at the request of the assembly of virginia to arrange matters with the assembly of maryland respecting it through his indefatigable exertions two companies were formed under the patronage of the governments of these states for opening the navigation of the potomac and james rivers and he was appointed president of both by a unanimous vote of the assembly of virginia fifty shares in the potomac and one hundred in the james river company were appropriated for his benefit  washington was exceedingly embarrassed by the appropriation to decline so noble and unequivocal a testimonial of the good opinion and good will of his countrymen might be construed into disrespect yet he wished to be perfectly free to exercise his judgment and express his opinions in the matter without being liable to the least suspicion of interested motives while however he declined to receive the proffered shares for his own benefit he intimated a disposition to receive them in trust to be applied to the use of some object or institution of a public nature his wishes were complied with and the shares were ultimately appropriated by him to institutions devoted to public education yet though the love for his country would thus interfere with his love for his home the dream of rural retirement at mount vernon still went on  at the opening of the year 1785 the entries in his diary show him diligently employed in preparations to improve his groves and shrubbery on the 10th of january he notes that the white thorn is full in berry on the 20th he begins to clear the pine groves of undergrowth in february he transplants ivy under the walls of the garden to which it still clings in march he is planting hemlock trees that most beautiful species of american evergreen numbers of which had been brought hither from occoquan in april he is sowing holly berries in drills some adjoining a greenbriar hedge on the north side of the garden gate others in a semicircle on the lawn many of the holly bushes thus produced are still flourishing about the place in full vigor  we find in his diary noted down with curious exactness each days labor and the share he took in it his frequent rides to the mill swamp the dogue creek the plantation of the neck and other places along the potomac in quest of young elms ash trees white thorn crabapples maples mulberries willows and lilacs the winding walks which he lays out and the trees and shrubs which he plants along them now he sows acorns and buckeye nuts brought by himself from the monongahela now he opens vistas through the pine grove commanding distant views through the woodlands and now he twines round his columns scarlet honeysuckles which his gardener tells him will blow all the summer  the ornamental cultivation of which we have spoken was confined to the grounds appertaining to what was called the mansionhouse farm but his estate included four other farms all lying contiguous and containing three thousand two hundred and sixty acres each farm having its bailiff or overseer with a house for his accommodation barns and outhouses for the produce and cabins for the negroes on a general map of the estate drawn out by washington himself these farms were all laid down accurately and their several fields numbered he knew the soil and local qualities of each and regulated the culture of them accordingly in addition to these five farms there were several hundred acres of fine woodland so that the estate presented a beautiful diversity of land and water in the stables near the mansionhouse were the carriage and saddle horses of which he was very choice on the four farms there were 54 draught horses 12 mules 317 head of black cattle 360 sheep and a great number of swine which last ran at large in the woods  in the management of his estate he was remarkably exact no negligence on the part of the overseers or those under them was passed over unnoticed he seldom used many words on the subject of his plans rarely asked advice but when once determined carried them directly and silently into execution and was not easily dissuaded from a project when once commenced  while washington was thus calmly employed came a letter from henry lee who was now in congress conveying a mournful piece of intelligence your friend and second the patriot and noble greene is no more universal grief reigns here greene died on the 18th of june at his estate of mulberry grove on savannah river presented to him by the state of georgia his last illness was brief caused by a stroke of the sun he was but fortyfour years of age the news of his death struck heavily on washingtons heart to whom in the most arduous trials of the revolution he had been a second self he had taken washington as his model and possessed naturally many of his great qualities like him he was sound in judgment persevering in the midst of discouragements calm and selfpossessed in time of danger heedful of the safety of others heedless of his own like him he was modest and unpretending and like him he had a perfect command of temper  other deaths pressed upon washingtons sensibility about the same time that of general mcdougall who had served his country faithfully through the war and since with equal fidelity in congress that too of colonel tench tilghman for a long time one of washingtons aidesdecamp and who left writes he as fair a reputation as ever belonged to a human character thus adds he some of the pillars of the revolution fall others are mouldering by insensible degrees may our country never want props to support the glorious fabric     chapter lxix the constitutional conventionwashington elected president   from his quiet retreat of mount vernon washington though ostensibly withdrawn from public affairs was watching with intense solicitude the working together of the several parts in the great political confederacy anxious to know whether the thirteen distinct states under the present organization could form a sufficiently efficient general government he was daily becoming more and more doubtful of the solidity of the fabric he had assisted to raise the form of confederation which had bound the states together and met the public exigencies during the revolution when there was a pressure of external danger was daily proving more and more incompetent to the purposes of a national government congress had devised a system of credit to provide for the national expenditure and the extinction of the national debts which amounted to something more than forty millions of dollars the system experienced neglect from some states and opposition from others each consulting its local interests and prejudices instead of the interests and obligations of the whole in like manner treaty stipulations which bound the good faith of the whole were slighted if not violated by individual states apparently unconscious that they must each share in the discredit thus brought upon the national name  in letters to his correspondents washington writes the confederation appears to me to be little more than a shadow without the substance and congress a nugatory body their ordinances being little attended to the wheels of government are clogged and our brightest prospects and that high expectation which was entertained of us by the wondering world are turned into astonishment and from the high ground on which we stood we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness  i have ever been a friend to adequate powers in congress without which it is evident to me we never shall establish a national character or be considered as on a respectable footing by the powers of europe we are either a united people under one head and for federal purposes or we are thirteen independent sovereignties eternally counteracting each other  we have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of coercive power i do not conceive we can exist long as a nation without lodging somewhere a power which will pervade the whole union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the state governments extends over the several states we are apt to run from one extreme to another i am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchial form of government without horror from thinking proceeds speaking thence acting is often but a single step but how irrevocable and tremendous what a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions what a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious would to god that wise measures may be taken in time to avert the consequences we have but too much reason to apprehend  his anxiety on the subject was quickened by accounts of discontents and commotions in the eastern states produced by the pressure of the times the public and private indebtedness and the imposition of heavy taxes at a moment of financial embarrassment general knox now secretary at war who had been sent by congress to massachusetts to inquire into these troubles thus writes about the insurgents their creed is that the property of the united states has been protected from the confiscation of britain by the joint exertions of all and therefore ought to be the common property of all and he that attempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice and ought to be swept from off the face of the earth again they are determined to annihilate all debts public and private and have agrarian laws which are easily effected by the means of unfunded paper which shall be a tender in all cases whatever  in reply to colonel henry lee in congress who had addressed several letters to him on the subject washington writes you talk my good sir of employing influence to appease the present tumults in massachusetts i know not where that influence is to be found or if attainable that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders influence is not government let us have a government by which our lives liberties and properties will be secured or let us know the worst at once there is a call for decision know precisely what the insurgents aim at if they have real grievances redress them if possible or acknowledge the justice of them and your inability to do it at the moment if they have not employ the force of government against them at once let the reins of government then be braced and held with a steady hand and every violation of the constitution be reprehended if defective let it be amended but not suffered to be trampled upon whilst it has an existence  a letter to him from his former aidedecamp colonel humphreys dated new haven november 1st says the troubles in massachusetts still continue government is prostrated in the dust and it is much to be feared that there is not energy enough in that state to reestablish the civil powers the leaders of the mob whose fortunes and measures are desperate are strengthening themselves daily and it is expected that they will soon take possession of the continental magazine at springfield in which there are from ten to fifteen thousand stand of arms in excellent order a general want of compliance with the requisitions of congress for money seems to prognosticate that we are rapidly advancing to a crisis congress i am told are seriously alarmed and hardly know which way to turn or what to expect indeed my dear general nothing but a good providence can extricate us from the present convulsion  what gracious god is man writes washington that there should be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct it was but the other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions under which we now live constitutions of our own choice and making and now we are unsheathing the sword to overturn them how melancholy is the reflection that in so short a time we should have made such large strides towards fulfilling the predictions of our transatlantic foes leave them to themselves and their government will soon dissolve will not the wise and good strive hard to avert this evil or will their supineness suffer ignorance and the arts of selfinterested and designing disaffected and desperate characters to involve this great country in wretchedness and contempt what stronger evidence can be given of the want of energy in our government than these disorders if there is not power in it to check them what security has a man for life liberty or property  thus washington even though in retirement was almost unconsciously exercising a powerful influence on national affairs no longer the soldier he was now becoming the statesman the opinions and counsels given in his letters were widely effective the expedient for federate organization had extended and ripened in legislative assemblies and ended in a plan of a convention composed of delegates from all the states to meet in philadelphia for the sole and express purpose of revising the federal system and correcting its defects the proceedings of the convention to be subsequently reported to congress and the several legislatures for approval and confirmation  washington was unanimously put at the head of the virginia delegation but for some time objected to accept the nomination he feared to be charged with inconsistency in again appearing in a public situation after his declared resolution to the contrary these considerations were strenuously combated for the weight and influence of his name and counsel were felt to be allimportant in giving dignity to the delegation two things contributed to bring him to a favorable decision first an insinuation that the opponents of the convention were monarchists who wished the distractions of the country should continue until a monarchial government might be resorted to as an ark of safety the other was the insurrection in massachusetts before the time arrived for the meeting of the convention which was the second monday in may his mind was relieved from poignant solicitude by learning that the insurrection in massachusetts had been suppressed with but little bloodshed and that the principals had fled to canada  on the 9th of may washington set out from mount vernon to attend the convention it was not until the 25th of may that a sufficient number of delegates were assembled to form a quorum when they proceeded to organize the body and by a unanimous vote washington was called up to the chair as president  we forbear to go into the voluminous proceedings of this memorable convention which occupied from four to seven hours each day for four months and in which every point was the subject of able and scrupulous discussion by the best talent and noblest spirits of the country washington felt restrained by his situation as president from taking a part in the debates but his wellknown opinions influenced the whole the result was the formation of the constitution of the united states which with some amendments made in after years still exists  the constitution thus formed was forwarded to congress and thence transmitted to the state legislatures each of which submitted it to a state convention composed of delegates chosen for that express purpose by the people the ratification of the instrument by nine states was necessary to carry it into effect and as the several state conventions would assemble at different times nearly a year must elapse before the decisions of the requisite number could be obtained during this time washington resumed his retired life at mount vernon seldom riding as he says beyond the limits of his own farms but kept informed by his numerous correspondents such as james madison john jay and generals knox lincoln and armstrong of the progress of the constitution through its various ordeals and of the strenuous opposition which it met with in different quarters both in debate and through the press  the testimonials of ratification having been received by congress from a sufficient number of states an act was passed by that body on the 13th of september appointing the first wednesday in january 1789 for the people of the united states to choose electors of a president according to the constitution and the first wednesday in the month of february following for the electors to meet and make a choice the meeting of the government was to be on the first wednesday in march and in the city of new york  before the official forms of an election could be carried into operation a unanimous sentiment throughout the union pronounced washington the nations choice to fill the presidential chair he looked forward to the possibility of his election with characteristic modesty and unfeigned reluctance as his letters to his confidential friends bear witness it has no fascinating allurements for me writes he to lafayette at my time of life and under my circumstances the increasing infirmities of nature and the growing love of retirement do not permit me to entertain a wish beyond that of living and dying an honest man on my own farm let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame who have a keener relish for them or who may have more years in store for the enjoyment  the election took place at the appointed time and it was soon ascertained that washington was chosen president for the term of four years from the 4th of march by this time the arguments and entreaties of his friends and his own convictions of public expediency had determined him to accept and he made preparations to depart for the seat of government as soon as he should receive official notice of his election among other duties he paid a visit to his mother at fredericksburg it was a painful because likely to be a final one for she was afflicted with a malady which it was evident must soon terminate her life their parting was affectionate but solemn she had always been reserved and moderate in expressing herself in regard to the successes of her son but it must have been a serene satisfaction at the close of her life to see him elevated by his virtues to the highest honor of his country  from a delay in forming a quorum of congress the votes of the electoral college were not counted until early in april when they were found to be unanimous in favor of washington on the 14th of april he received a letter from the president of congress duly notifying him of his election and he prepared to set out immediately for new york the seat of government  his progress was a continued ovation the ringing of bells and roaring of cannonry proclaimed his course through the country the old and young women and children thronged the highways to bless and welcome him deputations of the most respectable inhabitants from the principal places came forth to meet and escort him at baltimore on his arrival and departure his carriage was attended by a numerous cavalcade of citizens and he was saluted by the thunder of artillery at the frontier of pennsylvania he was met by his former companioninarms mifflin now governor of the state who with judge peters and a civil and military escort was waiting to receive him washington had hoped to be spared all military parade but found it was not to be evaded at chester where he stopped to breakfast there were preparations for a public entrance into philadelphia cavalry had assembled from the surrounding country a superb white horse was led out for washington to mount and a grand procession set forward with general st clair of revolutionary notoriety at its head it gathered numbers as it advanced passed under triumphal arches entwined with laurel and entered philadelphia amid the shouts of the multitude  we question whether any of these testimonials of a nations gratitude affected washington more sensibly than those he received at trenton it was on a sunny afternoon when he arrived on the banks of the delaware where twelve years before he had crossed in darkness and storm through clouds of snow and drifts of floating ice on his daring attempt to strike a blow at a triumphant enemy on the bridge crossing that eventful stream the ladies of trenton had caused a triumphal arch to be erected it was entwined with evergreens and laurels and bore the inscription the defender of the mothers will be the protector of the daughters at this bridge the matrons of the city were assembled to pay him reverence and as he passed under the arch a number of young girls dressed in white and crowned with garlands strewed flowers before him singing an ode expressive of their love and gratitude never was ovation more graceful touching and sincere and washington tenderly affected declared that the impression of it on his heart could never be effaced  in respect to his reception at new york washington had signified in a letter to governor clinton that none could be so congenial to his feelings as a quiet entry devoid of ceremony but his modest wishes were not complied with at elizabethtown point a committee of both houses of congress with various civic functionaries waited by appointment to receive him he embarked on board of a splendid barge constructed for the occasion it was manned by thirteen branch pilots masters of vessels in white uniforms and commanded by commodore nicholson other barges fancifully decorated followed having on board the heads of departments and other public officers and several distinguished citizens as they passed through the strait between the jerseys and staten island called the kills other boats decorated with flags fell in their wake until the whole forming a nautical procession swept up the broad and beautiful bay of new york to the sound of instrumental music  he approached the landingplace of murrays wharf amid the ringing of bells the roaring of cannonry and the shouting of multitudes collected on every pierhead on landing he was received by governor clinton general knox too who had taken such affectionate leave of him on his retirement from military life was there to welcome him in his civil capacity other of his fellowsoldiers of the revolution were likewise there mingled with the civic dignitaries  carpets had been spread to a carriage prepared to convey him to his destined residence but he preferred to walk he was attended by a long civil and military train in the streets through which he passed the houses were decorated with flags silken banners garlands of flowers and evergreens and bore his name in every form of ornament the streets were crowded with people so that it was with difficulty a passage could be made by the city officers  the inauguration was delayed for several days in which a question arose as to the form or title by which the president elect was to be addressed and a committee in both houses was appointed to report upon the subject it was finally resolved that the address should be simply the president of the united states without any addition of title a judicious form which has remained to the present day  the inauguration took place on the 30th of april at nine oclock in the morning there were religious services in all the churches at twelve oclock the city troops paraded before washingtons door and soon after the committees of congress and heads of departments came in their carriages at halfpast twelve the procession moved forward preceded by the troops next came the committees and heads of departments in their carriages then washington in a coach of state his aidedecamp colonel humphreys and his secretary mr lear in his own carriage the foreign ministers and a long train of citizens brought up the rear  about two hundred yards before reaching the hall washington and his suite alighted from their carriages and passed through the troops who were drawn up on each side into the hall and senate chamber where the vicepresident the senate and house of representatives were assembled the vicepresident john adams recently inaugurated advanced and conducted washington to a chair of state at the upper end of the room a solemn silence prevailed when the vicepresident rose and informed him that all things were prepared for him to take the oath of office required by the constitution  the oath was to be administered by the chancellor of the state of new york in a balcony in front of the senate chamber and in full view of an immense multitude occupying the street the windows and even roofs of the adjacent houses the balcony formed a kind of open recess with lofty columns supporting the roof in the centre was a table with a covering of crimson velvet upon which lay a superbly bound bible on a crimson velvet cushion this was all the paraphernalia for the august scene  all eyes were fixed upon the balcony when at the appointed hour washington made his appearance accompanied by various public functionaries and members of the senate and house of representatives he was clad in a full suit of darkbrown cloth of american manufacture with a steelhilted dress sword white silk stockings and silver shoebuckles his hair was dressed and powdered in the fashion of the day and worn in a bag and solitaire his entrance on the balcony was hailed by universal shouts he was evidently moved by this demonstration of public affection advancing to the front of the balcony he laid his hand upon his heart bowed several times and then retreated to an armchair near the table the populace appeared to understand that the scene had overcome him and were hushed at once into profound silence  after a few moments washington rose and again came forward john adams the vicepresident stood on his right on his left the chancellor of the state robert r livingston somewhat in the rear were roger sherman alexander hamilton generals knox st clair the baron steuben and others the chancellor advanced to administer the oath prescribed by the constitution and mr otis the secretary of the senate held up the bible on its crimson cushion the oath was read slowly and distinctly washington at the same time laying his hand on the open bible when it was concluded he replied solemnly i swearso help me god the chancellor now stepped forward waved his hand and exclaimed long live george washington president of the united states at this moment a flag was displayed on the cupola of the hall on which signal there was a general discharge of artillery on the battery all the bells in the city rang out a joyful peal and the multitude rent the air with acclamations  washington again bowed to the people and returned into the senate chamber where he delivered to both houses of congress his inaugural address after this he proceeded with the whole assemblage on foot to st pauls church where prayers suited to the occasion were read by dr prevost bishop of the protestant episcopal church in new york who had been appointed by the senate one of the chaplains of congress so closed the ceremonies of the inauguration  we have been accustomed to look to washingtons private letters for the sentiments of his heart those written to several of his friends immediately after his inauguration show how little he was excited by his official elevation i greatly fear writes he that my countrymen will expect too much from me i fear if the issue of public measures should not correspond with their sanguine expectations they will turn the extravagant and i might almost say undue praises which they are heaping upon me at this moment into equally extravagant though i will fondly hope unmerited censures little was his modest spirit aware that the praises so dubiously received were but the opening notes of a theme that was to increase from age to age to pervade all lands and endure throughout all generations     chapter lxx organization of the new government   the eyes of the world were upon washington at the commencement of his administration he had won laurels in the field would they continue to flourish in the cabinet his position was surrounded by difficulties inexperienced in the duties of civil administration he was to inaugurate a new and untried system of government composed of states and people as yet a mere experiment to which some looked forward with buoyant confidence many with doubt and apprehension the constitution had met with vehement opposition when under discussion in the general and state governments only three states new jersey delaware and georgia had accepted it unanimously several of the most important states had adopted it by a mere majority five of them under an expressed expectation of specified amendments or modifications while two states rhode island and north carolina still stood aloof  the very extent of the country he was called upon to govern ten times larger than that of any previous republic must have pressed with weight upon washingtons mind it presented to the atlantic a front of fifteen hundred miles divided into individual states differing in the forms of their local governments differing from each other in interests in territorial magnitudes in amount of population in manners soils climates and productions and the characteristics of their several peoples beyond the alleghanies extended regions almost boundless as yet for the most part wild and uncultivated vast tracts however were rapidly being peopled and would soon be portioned into sections requiring local governments the great natural outlet for the exportation of the products of this region of inexhaustible fertility was the mississippi but spain opposed a barrier to the free navigation of this river here was peculiar cause of solicitude before leaving mount vernon washington had heard that the hardy yeomanry of the far west were becoming impatient of this barrier and indignant at the apparent indifference of congress to their prayers for its removal he had heard moreover that british emissaries were fostering these discontents sowing the seed of disaffection and offering assistance to the western people to seize on the city of new orleans and fortify the mouth of the mississippi while on the other hand the spanish authorities at new orleans were represented as intriguing to effect a separation of the western territory from the union with a view or hope of attaching it to the dominion of spain  great britain too was giving grounds for territorial solicitude in these distant quarters by retaining possession of the western posts the surrender of which had been stipulated by treaty her plea was that debts due to british subjects for which by the same treaty the union states were bound remained unpaid this the americans alleged was a mere pretext the real object of their retention being the monopoly of the fur trade and to the mischievous influence exercised by these posts over the indian tribes was attributed much of the hostile disposition manifested by the latter along the western frontier  while these brooding causes of anxiety existed at home the foreign commerce of the union was on a most unsatisfactory footing and required prompt and thorough attention it was subject to maraud even by the corsairs of algiers tunis and tripoli who captured american merchant vessels and carried their crews into slavery no treaty having yet been made with any of the barbary powers excepting morocco  to complete the perplexities which beset the new government the finances of the country were in a lamentable state there was no money in the treasury the efforts of the former government to pay or fund its debts had failed there was a universal state of indebtedness foreign and domestic and public credit was prostrate  such was the condition of affairs when washington entered upon his new field of action as yet he was without the support of constitutional advisers the departments under the new government not being organized he could turn with confidence however for counsel in an emergency to john jay who still remained at the head of affairs where he had been placed in 1784 he was sure of sympathy also in his old comrade general knox who continued to officiate as secretary of war while the affairs of the treasury were managed by a board consisting of samuel osgood walter livingston and arthur lee among the personal friends not in office to whom washington felt that he could safely have recourse for aid in initiating the new government was alexander hamilton it was also a great satisfaction to washington on looking round for reliable advisers at this moment to see james madison among the members of congress madison who had been with him in the convention who had labored in the federalist and whose talents as a speaker and calm dispassionate reasoner whose extensive information and legislative experience destined him to be a leader in the house highly appreciating his intellectual and moral worth washington would often turn to him for counsel  the moment the inauguration was over washington was made to perceive that he was no longer master of himself or of his home by the time i had done breakfast writes he and thence till dinner and afterwards till bedtime i could not get rid of the ceremony of one visit before i had to attend to another in a word i had no leisure to read or to answer the despatches that were pouring in upon me from all quarters  how was he to be protected from these intrusions what too were to be the forms and ceremonials to be adopted in the presidential mansion that would maintain the dignity of his station allow him time for the performance of its official duties and yet be in harmony with the temper and feelings of the people and the prevalent notions of equality and republican simplicity looking round upon the able men at hand such as adams hamilton jay madison he propounded to them a series of questions as to a line of conduct proper for him to observe  in regard to visitors for instance would not one day in the week be sufficient for visits of compliment and one hour every morning at eight oclock for example for visits on business might he make social visits to acquaintances and public characters not as president but as private individual and then as to his tableunder the preceding form of government the presidents of congress had been accustomed to give dinners twice a week to large parties of both sexes and invitations had been so indiscriminate that every one who could get introduced to the president conceived he had a right to be invited to his board washington was resolved not to give general entertainments of this kind but in his series of questions he asked whether he might not invite informally or otherwise six eight or ten official characters including in rotation the members of both houses of congress to dine with him on the days fixed for receiving company without exciting clamors in the rest of the community  adams in his reply talked of chamberlains aidesdecamp masters of ceremony and evinced a high idea of the presidential office and the state with which it ought to be maintained two days in a week would be required for the receipt of visits of compliment persons desiring an interview with the president should make application through the minister of state in every case the name quality or business of the visitor should be communicated to a chamberlain or gentleman in waiting who should judge whom to admit and whom to exclude the time for receiving visits ought to be limited as for example from eight to nine or ten oclock lest the whole morning be taken up the president might invite what official character members of congress strangers or citizens of distinction he pleased in small parties without exciting clamors but this should always be done without formality his private life should be at his own discretion as to giving or receiving informal visits among friends and acquaintances but in his official character he should have no intercourse with society but upon public business or at his levees  hamilton in his reply while he considered it a primary object for the public good that the dignity of the presidential office should be supported advised that care should be taken to avoid so high a tone in the demeanor of the occupant as to shock the prevalent notions of equality the president he thought should hold a levee at a fixed time once a week remain half an hour converse cursorily on indifferent subjects with such persons as invited his attention and then retire he should accept no invitations give formal entertainments twice or at most four times in the year on levee days to give informal invitations to family dinners not more than six or eight to be asked at a time and the civility to be confined essentially to members of the legislature and other official charactersthe president never to remain long at table the heads of departments should of course have access to the president on business foreign ministers of some descriptions should also be entitled to it members of the senate should also have a right of individual access on matters relative to the public administration the reason alleged by hamilton for giving the senate this privilege and not the representatives was that in the constitution the senate are coupled with the president in certain executive functions treaties and appointments this makes them in a degree his constitutional counsellors and give them a peculiar claim to the right of access  these are the only written replies that we have before us of washingtons advisers on this subject colonel humphreys formerly one of washingtons aidesdecamp and recently secretary of jeffersons legation at paris was at present an inmate in the presidential mansion general knox was frequently there to these jefferson assures us on washingtons authority was assigned the task of considering and prescribing the minor forms and ceremonies the etiquette in fact to be observed on public occasions some of the forms proposed by them he adds were adopted others were so highly strained that washington absolutely rejected them  on the 17th of may mrs washington accompanied by her grandchildren eleanor custis and george washington parke custis set out from mount vernon in her travelling carriage with a small escort of horse to join her husband at the seat of government as she had been accustomed to join him at headquarters in the intervals of his revolutionary campaigns throughout the journey she was greeted with public testimonials of respect and affection  on the following day after her arrival in new york washington gave a demiofficial dinner of which mr wingate a senator from new hampshire who was present writes as follows the guests consisted of the vicepresident the foreign ministers the heads of departments the speaker of the house of representatives and the senators from new hampshire and georgia the then most northern and southern states it was the least showy dinner that i ever saw at the presidents table and the company was not large  on the evening of the following day friday may 29th mrs washington had a general reception which was attended by all that were distinguished in official and fashionable society henceforward there were similar receptions every friday evening from eight to ten oclock to which the families of all persons of respectability native or foreign had access without special invitation and at which the president was always present these assemblages were as free from ostentation and restraint as the ordinary receptions of polite society yet the reader will find they were soon subject to invidious misrepresentation and cavilled at as courtlike levees and queenly drawingrooms  in regard to the deportment of washington at this juncture we have been informed by one who had opportunities of seeing him that he still retained a military air of command which had become habitual to him at levees and drawingrooms he sometimes appeared cold and distant but this was attributed by those who best knew him to the novelty of his position and his innate diffidence which seemed to increase with the light which his renown shed about him though reserved at times his reserve had nothing repulsive in it and in social intercourse where he was no longer under the eye of critical supervision soon gave way to soldierlike frankness and cordiality at all times his courtesy was genuine and benignant and totally free from that stately condescension sometimes mistaken for politeness nothing we are told could surpass the noble grace with which he presided at a ceremonial dinner kindly attentive to all his guests but particularly attentive to put those at their ease and in a favorable light who appeared to be most diffident  much has been said of washingtons equipages when at new york and of his having four and sometimes six horses before his carriage with servants and outriders in rich livery such style we would premise was usual at the time both in england and the colonies and had been occasionally maintained by the continental dignitaries and by the governors of the several states prior to the adoption of the new constitution it was still prevalent we are told among the wealthy planters of the south and sometimes adopted by merchant princes and rich individuals at the north  as soon as washington could command sufficient leisure to inspect papers and documents he called unofficially upon the heads of departments to furnish him with such reports in writing as would aid him in gaining a distinct idea of the state of public affairs for this purpose also he had recourse to the public archives and proceeded to make notes of the foreign official correspondence from the close of the war until his inauguration he was interrupted in his task by a virulent attack of anthrax which for several days threatened mortification the knowledge of his perilous condition spread alarm through the community he however remained unagitated his sufferings were intense and his recovery was slow for six weeks he was obliged to lie on his right side but after a time he had his carriage so contrived that he could extend himself at full length in it and take exercise in the open air  while yet in a state of convalescence washington received intelligence of the death of his mother the event which took place at fredericksburg in virginia on the 25th of august was not unexpected she was eightytwo years of age and had for some time been sinking under an incurable malady so that when he last parted with her he had apprehended that it was a final separation  hitherto the new government had not been properly organized but its several duties had been performed by the officers who had them in charge at the time of washingtons inauguration it was not until the 10th of september that laws were passed instituting a department of foreign affairs afterwards termed department of state a treasury department and a department of war and fixing their respective salaries on the following day washington nominated general knox to the department of war the duties of which that officer had hitherto discharged  the post of secretary of the treasury was one of far greater importance at the present moment it was a time of financial exigency as yet no statistical account of the country had been attempted its fiscal resources were wholly unknown its credit was almost annihilated for it was obliged to borrow money even to pay the interest of its debts under these circumstances washington needed an able and zealous coadjutor in the treasury department such a person he considered alexander hamilton whom he nominated as secretary of the treasury and whose qualifications for the office were so well understood by the senate that his nomination was confirmed on the same day on which it was made  within a few days after hamiltons appointment the house of representatives sept 21 acting upon the policy so ardently desired by washington passed a resolution declaring their opinion of the high importance to the honor and prosperity of the united states that an adequate provision should be made for the support of public credit and instructing the secretary of the treasury to prepare a plan for the purpose and report it at their next session  the arrangement of the judicial department was one of washingtons earliest cares on the 27th of september he wrote unofficially to edmund randolph of virginia informing him that he had nominated him attorneygeneral of the united states and would be highly gratified with his acceptance of that office randolph promptly accepted the nomination but did not take his seat in the cabinet until some months after knox and hamilton  by the judicial system established for the federal government the supreme court of the united states was to be composed of a chief justice and five associate judges there were to be district courts with a judge in each state and circuit courts held by an associate judge and a district judge john jay of new york received the appointment of chief justice jays associate judges were john rutledge of south carolina james wilson of pennsylvania william cushing of massachusetts john blair of virginia and james iredell of north carolina  on the 29th of september congress adjourned to the first monday in january after an arduous session in which many important questions had been discussed and powers organized and distributed  the cabinet was still incomplete the department of foreign affairs or rather of state as it was now called was yet to be supplied with a head john jay would have received the nomination had he not preferred the bench washington next thought of thomas jefferson who had so long filled the post of minister plenipotentiary at the court of versailles but had recently solicited and obtained permission to return for a few months to the united states for the purpose of placing his children among their friends in their native country and of arranging his private affairs which had suffered from his protracted absence  at the time of writing to jefferson offering him the department of state washington was on the eve of a journey through the eastern states with a view as he said to observe the situation of the country and with a hope of perfectly reestablishing his health which a series of indispositions had much impaired having made all his arrangements and left the papers appertaining to the office of foreign affairs under the temporary superintendence of mr jay he set out from new york on the 15th of october travelling in his carriage with four horses and accompanied by his official secretary major jackson and his private secretary mr lear though averse from public parade he could not but be deeply affected and gratified at every step by the manifestations of a peoples love wherever he came all labor was suspended business neglected the bells were rung the guns were fired there were civic processions and military parades and triumphal arches and all classes poured forth to testify in every possible manner their gratitude and affection for the man whom they hailed as the father of his country and well did his noble stature his dignified demeanor his matured years and his benevolent aspect suit that venerable appellation  his journey eastward terminated at portsmouth whence he turned his face homeward by a middle route through the interior of the country to hartford and thence to new york where he arrived between two and three oclock on the 13th of november     chapter lxxi financial difficultiesparty jealousiesoperations against the indians   congress reassembled on the 4th of january 1790 but a quorum of the two houses was not present until the 8th when the session was opened by washington in form with an address delivered before them in the senate chamber among the most important objects suggested in the address for the deliberation of congress were provisions for national defence provisions for facilitating intercourse with foreign nations and defraying the expenses of diplomatic agents laws for the naturalization of foreigners uniformity in the currency weights and measures of the united states facilities for the advancement of commerce agriculture and manufactures attention to the postoffice and postroads measures for the promotion of science and literature and for the support of public credit  this last object was the one which washington had more immediately at heart the government was now organized apparently to the satisfaction of all parties but its efficiency would essentially depend on the success of a measure which washington had pledged himself to institute and which was yet to be tried namely a system of finance adapted to revive the national credit and place the public debt in a condition to be paid off at the close of the war the debt amounted to fortytwo millions of dollars but so little had the country been able to fulfil its engagements owing to the want of a sovereign legislature having the sole and exclusive power of laying duties upon imports and thus providing adequate resources that the debt had swollen through arrears of interest to upwards of fiftyfour millions of this amount nearly eight millions were due to france between three and four millions to private lenders in holland and about two hundred and fifty thousand in spain making altogether nearly twelve millions due abroad the debt contracted at home amounted to upwards of fortytwo millions and was due originally to officers and soldiers of the revolutionary war who had risked their lives for the cause farmers who had furnished supplies for the public service or whose property had been assumed for it capitalists who in critical periods of the war had adventured their fortunes in support of their countrys independence the domestic debt therefore could not have had a more sacred and patriotic origin but in the long delay of national justice the paper which represented these outstanding claims had sunk to less than a sixth of its nominal value and the larger portion of it had been parted with at that depreciated rate either in the course of trade or to speculative purchasers  the debt when thus transferred lost its commanding appeal to patriotic sympathy but remained as obligatory in the eye of justice in public newspapers however and in private circles the propriety of a discrimination between the assignees and the original holders of the public securities was freely discussed beside the foreign and domestic debt of the federal government the states individually were involved in liabilities contracted for the common cause to an aggregate amount of about twentyfive millions of dollars of which more than onehalf was due from three of them massachusetts and south carolina each owing more than five millions and virginia more than three and a half the reputation and the wellbeing of the government were therefore at stake upon the issue of some plan to retrieve the national credit and establish it upon a firm and secure foundation  the secretary of the treasury mr hamilton it will be remembered had been directed by congress to prepare such a plan during its recess in the one thus prepared he asserted what none were disposed to question the propriety of paying the foreign debt according to its terms he asserted also the equal validity of the original claims of the american creditors of the government whether those creditors were the original holders of its certificates or subsequent purchasers of them at a depreciated value the idea of any distinction between them which some were inclined to advance he repudiated as alike unjust impolitic and impracticable he urged moreover the assumption by the general government of the separate debts of the states contracted for the common cause and that a like provision should be made for their payment as for the payment of those of the union they were all contracted in the struggle for national independence not for the independence of any particular part no more money would be required for their discharge as federal than as state debts he recommended therefore that the entire mass of debt be funded the union made responsible for it and taxes imposed for its liquidation  the plan was reported to the house by mr hamilton the 14th of january but did not undergo consideration until the 8th of february when it was opposed with great earnestness especially the point of assuming the state debts as tending to consolidation as giving an undue influence to the general government and as being of doubtful constitutionality this financial union of the states was reprobated not only on the floor of congress but in different parts of the union as fraught with political evil the northern and eastern states generally favored the plan as did also south carolina but virginia manifested a determined opposition the measure however passed in committee of the whole on the 9th of march by a vote of 31 to 26  the funding of the state debts was supposed to benefit materially the northern states in which was the entire capital of the country yet south carolina voted for the assumption the fact is opinions were honestly divided on the subject the great majority were aiming to do their dutyto do what was right but their disagreement was the result of real difficulties incident to the intricate and complicated problem with which they had to deal  at this juncture march 21st when virginian discontents were daily gaining strength mr jefferson arrived in new york to undertake the duties of the department of state he had just been in virginia where the forms and ceremonials adopted at the seat of our government were subjects of cavil and sneer where it was reported that washington affected a monarchial style in his official intercourse that he held courtlike levees and mrs washington queenly drawingrooms at which none but the aristocracy were admitted that the manners of both were haughty and their personal habits reserved and exclusive  the impressions thus made on jeffersons mind received a deeper stamp on his arrival in new york from conversations with his friend madison in the course of which the latter observed that the satellites and sycophants which surrounded washington had wound up the ceremonials of the government to a pitch of stateliness which nothing but his personal character could have supported and which no character after him could ever maintain  thus prepossessed and premonished jefferson looked round him with an apprehensive eye and appears to have seen something to startle him at every turn we give from his private correspondence his own account of his impressions being fresh from the french revolution while in its first and pure stage and consequently somewhat whetted up in my own republican principles i found a state of things in the general society of the place which i could not have supposed possible the revolution i had left and that we had just gone through in the recent change of our own government being the common topics of conversation i was astonished to find the general prevalence of monarchial sentiments insomuch that in maintaining those of republicanism i had always the whole company on my hands never scarcely finding among them a single coadvocate in that argument unless some old member of congress happened to be present the furthest that any one would go in support of the republican features of our new government would be to say the present constitution is well as a beginning and may be allowed a fair trial but it is in fact only a stepping stone to something better  alexander hamilton though pledged and sincerely disposed to support the republican form with regard to our country preferred theoretically a monarchial form and being frank of speech and as gouverneur morris writes prone to mount his hobby may have spoken openly in favor of that form as suitable to france and as his admirers took their creed from him opinions of the kind may have been uttered pretty freely at dinnertables these however which so much surprised and shocked mr jefferson were probably merely speculative opinions broached in unguarded hours with no sinister design by men who had no thought of paving the way for a monarchy they made however a deep impression on his apprehensive mind which sank deeper and deeper until it became a fixed opinion with him that there was the desire and aim of a large party of which hamilton was the leader to give a regal form to the government  the question of the assumption of the state debts was resumed in congress on the 29th of march on a motion to commit which was carried by a majority of two the five members from north carolina now a state of the union who were strongly opposed to assumption having taken their seats and reversed the position of parties on the question an angry and intemperate discussion was revived much to the chagrin of washington who was concerned for the dignity of congress and who considered the assumption of the state debts under proper restrictions and scrutiny into accounts to be just and reasonable on the 12th of april when the question to commit was taken there was a majority of two against the assumption  on the 26th the house was discharged for the present from proceeding on so much of the report as related to the assumption jefferson who had arrived in new york in the midst of what he terms this bitter and angry contest had taken no concern in it being as he says a stranger to the ground a stranger to the actors in it so long absent as to have lost all familiarity with the subject and to be unaware of its object we give his own account of an earnest effort made by hamilton who he says was in despair to resuscitate through his influence his almost hopeless project as i was going to the presidents one day i met him hamilton in the street he walked me backwards and forwards before the presidents door for half an hour he painted pathetically the temper into which the legislature had been wrought the disgust of those who were called the creditor states the danger of the secession of their members and the separation of the states he observed that the members of the administration ought to act in concert that though this question was not of my department yet a common duty should make it a common concern that the president was the centre on which all administrative questions ultimately rested and that all of us should rally around him and support with joint efforts measures approved by him i proposed to him to dine with me the next day and i would invite another friend or two bring them into conference together and i thought it impossible that reasonable men consulting together coolly could fail by some mutual sacrifices of opinion to form a compromise which was to save the union the discussion took place i could take no part in it but an exhortatory one because i was a stranger to the circumstances which should govern it but it was finally agreed that whatever importance had been attached to the rejection of this proposition the preservation of the union and of concord among the states was more important and that therefore it would be better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded to effect which some members should change their votes but it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the southern states and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them there had before been projects to fix the seat of government either at philadelphia or at georgetown on the potomac and it was thought that by giving it to philadelphia for ten years and to georgetown permanently afterwards this might as an anodyne calm in some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone so two of the potomac members white and lee but white with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive agreed to change their votes and hamilton undertook to carry the other point in doing this the influence he had established over the eastern members with the agency of robert morris with those of the middle states effected his side of the engagement  the decision of congress was ultimately in favor of assumption though the form in which it finally passed differed somewhat from the proposition of hamilton a specific sum was assumed 21500000 and this was distributed among the states in specific portions thus modified it passed the senate july 22d by the close vote of fourteen to twelve and the house july 24th by thirtyfour to twentyeight  the question about the permanent seat of government which from the variety of contending interests had been equally a subject of violent contest was now compromised it was agreed that congress should continue for ten years to hold its sessions at philadelphia during which time the public buildings should be erected at some place on the potomac to which the government should remove at the expiration of the above term a territory ten miles square selected for the purpose on the confines of maryland and virginia was ceded by those states to the united states and subsequently designated as the district of columbia  one of the last acts of the executive during this session was the conclusion of a treaty of peace and friendship with the creek nation of indians represented at new york by mr mgillivray and thirty of the chiefs and head men by this treaty signed august 7th an extensive territory claimed by georgia was relinquished greatly to the discontent of that state being considered by it an unjustifiable abandonment of its rights and interests  congress adjourned on the 12th of august jefferson commenting on the discord that had prevailed for a time among the members observes that in the latter part of the session they had reacquired the harmony which had always distinguished their proceedings before the introduction of the two disagreeable subjects of the assumption and the residence these said he really threatened at one time a separation of the legislature sine die  washington too however grieved and disappointed he may have been by the dissensions which had prevailed in congress consoled himself by the fancied harmony of his cabinet singularly free himself from all jealousy of the talents and popularity of others and solely actuated by zeal for the public good he had sought the ablest men to assist him in his arduous task and supposed them influenced by the same unselfish spirit yet at this very moment a lurking spirit of rivalry between jefferson and hamilton was already existing and daily gaining strength jefferson who as we have intimated already considered hamilton a monarchist in his principles regarded all his financial schemes with suspicion as intended to strengthen the influence of the treasury and make its chief the master of every vote in the legislature which might give to the government the direction suited to his political views under these impressions jefferson looked back with an angry and resentful eye to the manner in which hamilton had procured his aid in effecting the measure of assumption he now regarded it as a finesse by which he had been entrapped and stigmatized the measure itself as a fiscal manoeuvre to which he had most ignorantly and innocently been made to hold the candle                                       frequent depredations had of late been made on our frontier settlements by what washington termed certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio some of our people had been massacred and others carried into deplorable captivity the indians of the wabash and the miami rivers who were the present aggressors were numerous warlike and not deficient in discipline  washington had deprecated a war with these savages but finding all pacific overtures unavailing and rather productive of more daring atrocities he felt compelled to resort to it alike by motives of policy humanity and justice an act had been provided for emergencies by which the president was empowered to call out the militia for the protection of the frontier this act he put in force in the interval of congress and under it an expedition was set on foot which began its march on the 30th of september from fort washington which stood on the site of the present city of cincinnati brigadiergeneral harmer a veteran of the revolution led the expedition having under him three hundred and twenty regulars with militia detachments from pennsylvania and virginia or kentucky making in all fourteen hundred and fiftythree men after a march of seventeen days they approached the principal village of the miamis the indians did not await an attack but set fire to the village and fled to the woods the destruction of the place with that of large quantities of provisions was completed  an indian trail being discovered colonel hardin a continental officer who commanded the kentucky militia was detached to follow it at the head of one hundred and fifty of his men and about thirty regulars under captain armstrong and ensign hartshorn they followed the trail for about six miles and were crossing a plain covered by thickets when suddenly there were volleys of rifles on each side from unseen marksmen accompanied by the horrid warwhoop the trail had in fact decoyed them into an ambush of seven hundred savages under the famous warrior little turtle the militia fled without firing a musket the savages now turned upon the little handful of regulars who stood their ground and made a brave resistance with the bayonet until all were slain excepting captain armstrong ensign hartshorn and five privates  the army notwithstanding effected the main purpose of the expedition in laying waste the indian villages and destroying their winters stock of provisions after which it commenced its march back to fort washington on the 21st of october when it was halted about ten miles to the west of chillicothe an opportunity was given colonel hardin to wipe out the late disgrace of his arms he was detached with a larger body of militia than before and sixty regulars under major willys to seek and bring the savages to action the accounts of these indian wars are very confused it appears however that he had another encounter with little turtle and his braves it was a bloody battle fought well on both sides the militia behaved bravely and lost many men and officers as did the regulars major willys fell at the commencement of the action colonel hardin was at length compelled to retreat leaving the dead and wounded in the hands of the enemy after he had rejoined the main force the whole exhibition made its way back to fort washington on the banks of the ohio  congress reassembled according to adjournment on the first monday in december at philadelphia which was now for a time the seat of government  congress at its opening was chiefly occupied in financial arrangements intended to establish the public credit and provide for the expenses of government according to the statement of the secretary of the treasury an additional annual revenue of eight hundred and twentysix thousand dollars would be required principally to meet the additional charges arising from the assumption of the state debts he proposed to raise it by an increase of the impost on foreign distilled spirits and a tax by way of excise on spirits distilled at home an impost and excise bill was accordingly introduced into congress and met with violent opposition an attempt was made to strike out the excise but failed and the whole bill was finally carried through the house  mr hamilton in his former treasury report had recommended the establishment of a national bank he now in a special report urged the policy of the measure a bill introduced in conformity with his views was passed in the senate but vehemently opposed in the house partly on considerations of policy but chiefly on the ground of constitutionality on one side it was denied that the constitution had given to congress the power of incorporation on the other side it was insisted that such power was incident to the power vested in congress for raising money  the question was argued at length and with great ardor and after passing the house of representatives by a majority of nineteen votes came before the executive for his approval washington was fully alive to the magnitude of the question and the interest felt in it by the opposing parties the cabinet was divided on it jefferson and randolph denied its constitutionality hamilton and knox maintained it washington required of each minister the reasons of his opinion in writing and after maturely weighing them gave his sanction to the act and the bill was carried into effect  the objection of jefferson to a bank was not merely on constitutional grounds in his subsequent writings he avows himself opposed to banks as introducing a paper instead of a cash systemraising up a moneyed aristocracy and abandoning the public to the discretion of avarice and swindlers paper money might have some advantages but its abuses were inevitable and by breaking up the measure of value it made a lottery of all private property these objections he maintained to his dying day but he had others which may have been more cogent with him in the present instance he considered the bank as a powerful engine intended by hamilton to complete the machinery by which the whole action of the legislature was to be placed under the direction of the treasury and shaped to further a monarchial system of government  the opposite policy of these rival statesmen brought them into incessant collision hamilton and myself writes jefferson were daily pitted in the cabinet like two cocks in the meantime two political parties were forming under their adverse standards both had the good of the country at heart but differed as to the policy by which it was to be secured the federalists who looked up to hamilton as their model were in favor of strengthening the general government so as to give it weight and dignity abroad and efficiency at home to guard it against the encroachments of the individual states and a general tendency to anarchy the other party known as republicans or democrats and taking mr jeffersons view of affairs saw in all the measures advocated by the federalists an intention to convert the federal into a great central or consolidated government preparatory to a change from a republic to a monarchy  the particulars of general harmers expedition against the indians when reported to congress gave great dissatisfaction the conduct of the troops in suffering themselves to be surprised was for some time stigmatized as disgraceful further troubles in that quarter were apprehended for the miamis were said to be less disheartened by the ravage of their villages than exultant at the successful ambuscades of little turtle three seneca chiefs cornplanter half town and great tree being at the seat of government on business of their own nation offered to visit these belligerent tribes and persuade them to bury the hatchet washington in a set speech encouraged them in the undertaking  in the course of the present session congress received and granted the applications of kentucky and vermont for admission into the union the former after august 1792 the latter immediately on the 3d of march the term of this first congress expired  as the indians on the northwest side of the ohio still continued their hostilities one of the last measures of congress had been an act to augment the military establishments and to place in the hands of the executive more ample means for the protection of the frontiers a new expedition against the belligerent tribes had in consequence been projected general st clair actually governor of the territory west of the ohio was appointed commanderinchief of the forces to be employed  washington had been deeply chagrined by the mortifying disasters of general harmers expedition to the wabash resulting from indian ambushes in taking leave of his old military comrade st clair he wished him success and honor but gave him a solemn warning you have your instructions from the secretary of war i had a strict eye to them and will add but one wordbeware of a surprise you know how the indians fight i repeat itbeware of a surprise with these warning words sounding in his ear st clair departed     chapter lxxii tour southwarddefeat of st clairdissensions in the cabinet   in the month of march washington set out on a tour through the southern states travelling with one set of horses and making occasional halts the route projected and of which he had marked off the halting places was by fredericksburg richmond wilmington n c and charleston to savannah thence to augusta columbia and the interior towns of north carolina and virginia comprising a journey of eighteen hundred and eightyseven miles all which he accomplished without any interruption from sickness bad weather or any untoward accident  he returned to philadelphia on the 6th of july much pleased with his tour it had enabled him he said to see with his own eyes the situation of the country and to learn more accurately the disposition of the people than he could have done from any verbal information he had looked around him in fact with a paternal eye been cheered as usual by continual demonstrations of a nations love and his heart had warmed with the reflection how much of this national happiness had been won by his own patriotic exertions  a few weeks of autumn were passed by washington at mount vernon with his family in rural enjoyment and in instructing a new agent mr robert lewis in the management of his estate his nephew major george a washington who ordinarily attended to his landed concerns being absent among the mountains in quest of health  the second congress assembled at philadelphia on the 24th of october and on the 25th washington delivered his opening speech after remarking upon the prosperous situation of the country and the success which had attended its financial measures he adverted to the offensive operations against the indians which government had been compelled to adopt for the protection of the western frontier some of these operations he observed had been successful others were still depending a brief statement will be sufficient for the successful operations alluded to  two expeditions had been organized in kentucky against the villages on the wabash the first in may was led by general charles scott having general wilkinson as second in command the second a volunteer enterprise in august was led by wilkinson alone very little good was effected or glory gained by either of these expeditions indian villages and wigwams were burned and fields laid waste some few warriors were killed and prisoners taken and an immense expense incurred  of the events of a third enterprise led by general st clair himself no tidings had been received at the time of washingtons opening speech but we will anticipate the official despatches and proceed to show how it fared with that veteran soldier and how far he profited by the impressive warning which he had received from the president at parting  the troops for his expedition assembled early in september in the vicinity of fort washington now cincinnati there were about two thousand regulars and one thousand militia the regulars included a corps of artillery and several squadrons of horse an arduous task was before them roads were to be opened through a wilderness bridges constructed for the conveyance of artillery and stores and forts to be built so as to keep up a line of communication between the wabash and the ohio the base of operations the troops commenced their march directly north on the 6th or 7th of september cutting their way through the woods and slowly constructing the line of forts  after placing garrisons in the forts the general continued his march it was a forced one with him for he was so afflicted with the gout that he could not walk and had to be helped on and off his horse but his only chance to keep his little army together was to move on the army had proceeded six days after leaving fort jefferson and were drawing near a part of the country where they were likely to meet with indians when on the 30th of october sixty of the militia deserted in a body intending to supply themselves by plundering the convoys of provisions which were coming forward in the rear the 1st united states regiment under major hamtranck was detached to march back beyond fort jefferson apprehend these deserters if possible and at all events prevent the provisions that might be on the way from being rifled the force thus detached consisted of three hundred of the best disciplined men in the service with experienced officers  thus reduced to 1400 effective rank and file the army continued its march to a point about twentynine miles from fort jefferson and ninetyseven from fort washington and fifteen miles south of the miami villages where it encamped november 3d on a rising ground with a stream forty feet wide in front running westerly the militia were encamped beyond the stream about a quarter of a mile in the advance on a high flat  it was the intention of st clair to throw up a slight work on the following day nov 4th and to move on to the attack of the indian villages as soon as he should be rejoined by major hamtranck and the first united states regiment but about half an hour before sunrise just after the troops had been dismissed on parade a horrible sound burst forth from the woods around the militia camp resembling says an officer the jangling of an infinitude of horsebells it was the direful indian yell followed by the sharp reports of the deadly rifle the militia returned a feeble fire and then took to flight dashing helterskelter into the other camp the first line of the continental troops which was hastily forming was thrown into disorder the indians were close upon the heels of the flying militia and would have entered the camp with them but the sight of troops drawn up with fixed bayonets to receive them checked their ardor and they threw themselves behind logs and bushes at the distance of seventy yards and immediately commenced an attack upon the first line which was soon extended to the second the great weight of the attack was upon the centre of each line where the artillery was placed the artillery if not well served was bravely fought a quantity of canister and some round shot were thrown in the direction whence the indians fired but concealed as they were and only seen occasionally as they sprang from one covert to another it was impossible to direct the pieces to advantage  st clair who unable to mount his horse was borne about on a litter preserved his coolness in the midst of the peril and disaster giving his orders with judgment and selfpossession seeing to what disadvantage his troops fought with a concealed enemy he ordered colonel darke with his regiment of regulars to rouse the indians from their covert with the bayonet and turn their left flank this was executed with great spirit the enemy were driven three or four hundred yards but for want of cavalry or riflemen the pursuit slackened and the troops were forced to give back in turn the savages had now got into the camp by the left flank again several charges were made but in vain the contest had now endured for more than two hours and a half half the army was killed and the situation of the remainder was desperate there appeared to be no alternative but a retreat  at halfpast nine general st clair ordered colonel darke with the second regiment to make another charge as if to turn the right wing of the enemy but in fact to regain the road from which the army was cut off this object was effected having collected in one body the greatest part of the troops writes one of the officers and such of the wounded as could possibly hobble along with us we pushed out from the left of the rear line sacrificing our artillery and baggage it was a disorderly flight the troops threw away arms ammunition and accoutrements even the officers in some instances divested themselves of their fusees fortunately the enemy did not pursue above a mile or two returning most probably to plunder the camp  by seven in the evening the fugitives reached fort jefferson a distance of twentynine miles here they met major hamtranck with the first regiment but as this force was far from sufficient to make up for the losses of the morning the retreat was continued to fort washington where the army arrived on the 8th at noon shattered and brokenspirited in this disastrous battle the whole loss amounted to six hundred and seventyseven killed including thirty women and two hundred and seventyone wounded  washington was at dinner with company when the news of the disaster reached him an officer had dismounted at the presidents door bearing despatches which he insisted should be placed in the presidents hands immediately washington with an apology to his guests left the table to receive them and presently returned resuming his seat without allusion to the incident mrs washington held her drawingroom that evening and washington appeared in the assembly with his usual serenity at ten oclock he and his secretary mr lear were alone the general walked slowly backward and forward for some minutes in silence as yet there had been no change in his manner taking a seat on a sofa by the fire he told mr lear to sit down the latter had scarce time to notice that he was extremely agitated when he broke out suddenly its all overst clairs defeatedrouted the officers nearly all killed the men by wholesale the rout complete too shocking to think of and a surprise into the bargain all this was uttered with great vehemence then pausing and rising from the sofa he walked up and down the room in silence violently agitated but saying nothing when near the door he stopped short stood still for a few moments when there was another terrible explosion of wrath  yes exclaimed he here on this very spot i took leave of him i wished him success and honor you have your instructions from the secretary of war said i i had a strict eye to them and will add but one word beware of a surprise you know how the indians fight us i repeat it beware of a surprise he went off with that my last warning thrown into his ears and yet to suffer that army to be cut to pieces hacked butchered tomahawked by a surprisethe very thing i guarded him againsto god o god exclaimed he throwing up his hands and while his very frame shook with emotion hes worse than a murderer how can he answer it to his country the blood of the slain is upon himthe curse of widows and orphansthe curse of heaven  mr lear remained speechless awed into breathless silence by the appalling tones in which this torrent of invective was poured forth the paroxysm passed by washington again sat down on the sofahe was silentapparently uncomfortable as if conscious of the ungovernable burst of passion which had overcome him this must not go beyond this room said he at length in a subdued and altered tonethere was another and a longer pause then in a tone quite low general st clair shall have justice said he i looked hastily through the despatches saw the whole disaster but not all the particulars i will receive him without displeasure i will hear him without prejudice he shall have full justice                                       in the course of the present session of congress a bill was introduced for apportioning representatives among the people of the several states according to the first enumeration the constitution had provided that the number of representatives should not exceed one for every thirty thousand persons and the house of representatives passed a bill allotting to each state one member for this amount of population this ratio would leave a fraction greater or less in each state its operation was unequal as in some states a large surplus would be unrepresented and hence in one branch of the legislature the relative power of the state be affected that too was the popular branch which those who feared a strong executive desired to provide with the counterpoise of as full a representation as possible  to obviate this difficulty the senate adopted a new principle of apportionment they assumed the total population of the united states and not the population of each state as the basis on which the whole number of representatives should be ascertained this aggregate they divided by thirty thousand the quotient gave one hundred and twenty as the number of representatives and this number they apportioned upon the several states according to their population allotting to each one member for every thirty thousand and distributing the residuary members to make up the one hundred and twenty among the states having the largest fractions  after an earnest debate the house concurred and the bill came before the president for his decision the sole question was as to its constitutionality that being admitted it was unexceptionable washington took the opinion of his cabinet jefferson and randolph considered the act at variance with the constitution knox was undecided hamilton thought the clause of the constitution relating to the subject somewhat vague and was in favor of the construction given to it by the legislature after weighing the arguments on both sides and maturely deliberating the president made up his mind that the act was unconstitutional he accordingly returned the bill with his objections being the first exercise of the veto power a new bill was substituted and passed into a law giving a representative for every thirtythree thousand to each state  great heat and asperity were manifested in the discussions of congress throughout the present session washington had observed with pain the political divisions which were growing up in the country and was deeply concerned at finding that they were pervading the halls of legislation the press too was contributing its powerful aid to keep up and increase the irritation two rival papers existed at the seat of government one was fennos gazette of the united states the other was the national gazette edited by philip freneau freneau had been editor of the new york daily advertiser but had come to philadelphia in the autumn of 1791 to occupy the post of translating clerk in mr jeffersons office and had almost immediately oct 31 published the first number of his gazette notwithstanding his situation in the office of the secretary of state freneau became and continued to be throughout the session a virulent assailant of most of the measures of government excepting such as originated with mr jefferson or were approved by him  heartweary by the political strifes and disagreements which were disturbing the country and marring the harmony of his cabinet the charge of government was becoming intolerably irksome to washington and he longed to be released from it and to be once more master of himself free to indulge those rural and agricultural tastes which were to give verdure and freshness to his future existence he had some time before this expressed a determination to retire from public life at the end of his presidential term but one more year of that term remained to be endured and he congratulated himself with the thought he had confidential conversations with mr madison on the subject and asked him to think what would be the proper time and mode of announcing his intention to the public and intimating a wish that mr madison would prepare for him the announcement mr madison remonstrated in the most earnest manner against such a resolution setting forth in urgent language the importance to the country of his continuing in the presidency washington listened to his reasoning with profound attention but still clung to his resolution  in consequence of st clairs disastrous defeat and the increasing pressure of the indian war bills had been passed in congress for increasing the army by adding three regiments of infantry and a squadron of cavalry which additional force was to serve for three years unless sooner discharged also for establishing a uniform militia system st clair resigned his commission and was succeeded in his western command by general wayne the mad anthony of the revolution still in the vigor of his days being fortyseven years of age  washingtons first thought was that a decisive expedition conducted by this energetic man of the sword might retrieve the recent frontier disgrace and put an end to the persevering hostility of the indians in deference however to the clamors which had been raised against the war and its expenses and to meet what appeared to be the prevalent wish of the nation he reluctantly relinquished his more energetic policy and gave in to that which advised further negotiations for peace though he was far from anticipating a beneficial result  in regard to st clair we will here add that a committee of the house of representatives ultimately inquired into the cause of the failure of his expedition and rendered a report in which he was explicitly exculpated his adjutant general also winthrop sargent in his private diary testifies to st clairs coolness and bravery though debilitated by illness public sentiment however remained for a long time adverse to him but washington satisfied with the explanations which had been given continued to honor him with his confidence and friendship  congress adjourned on the 8th of may and soon afterward washington set off on a short visit to mount vernon the season was in all its beauty and never had this rallying place of his affections appeared to him more attractive how could he give up the prospect of a speedy return to its genial pursuits and pleasures from the harassing cares and janglings of public life on the 20th of may he wrote to mr madison on the subject of their late conversation he now renewed the request he had made him for advice as to the proper time and mode for announcing his intention of retiring and for assistance in preparing the announcement in revolving this subject myself writes he my judgment has always been embarrassed on the one hand a previous declaration to retire not only carries with it the appearance of vanity and selfimportance but it may be construed into a manoeuvre to be invited to remain and on the other hand to say nothing implies consent or at any rate would leave the matter in doubt and to decline afterwards might be deemed as bad and uncandid  i would fain carry my request to you further adds he as the recess of congress may afford you leisure and i flatter myself you have dispositions to oblige me i will without apology desire if the measure in itself should strike you as proper or likely to produce public good or private honor that you would turn your thoughts to a valedictory address from me to the public he then went on to suggest a number of the topics and ideas which the address was to contain all to be expressed in plain and modest terms but in the main he left it to mr madison to determine whether in the first place such an address would be proper if so what matters it ought to contain and when it ought to appear whether at the same time with his washingtons declaration of his intention to retire or at the close of his career  madison in reply approved of the measure and advised that the notification and address should appear together and be promulgated through the press in time to pervade every part of the union by the beginning of november with the letter he sent a draft of the address you will readily observe writes he that in executing it i have aimed at that plainness and modesty of language which you had in view and which indeed are so peculiarly becoming the character and the occasion and that i had little more to do as to the matter than to follow the just and comprehensive outline which you had sketched i flatter myself however that in everything which has depended on me much improvement will be made before so interesting a paper shall have taken its last form before concluding his letter madison expressed a hope that washington would reconsider his idea of retiring from office and that the country might not at so important a conjuncture be deprived of the inestimable advantage of having him at the head of its councils  on the 23d of may jefferson also addressed a long letter to washington on the same subject stating that when washington first mentioned to him his purpose of retiring he was silent although he felt all the magnitude of the event because he reflected that as the nation would some day have to walk alone if the essay should be made while he were alive and looking on they would derive confidence from that circumstance and resource if it failed the public mind moreover was then calm and confident and in a favorable state for making the experiment this was now changed the public mind had become disturbed and excited there was a determined purpose in many by the funding system and other plans to prepare the way for a change from the present republican form of government to that of a monarchy of which the english constitution is to be the model he concluded by declaring the continuance of washington at the head of affairs to be of the last importance the confidence of the whole union was centred in him north and south would hang together if they had him to hang on and his being at the helm would be an answer to every argument which might be used from any quarter to lead the people into violence or secession  the letter of jefferson was not received by washington until after his return to philadelphia and the purport of it was so painful to him that he deferred from day to day having any conversation with that statesman on the subject in regard to the suspicions and apprehensions which were haunting jeffersons mind hamilton expressed himself roundly in one of his cabinet papers the idea of introducing a monarchy or aristocracy into this country by employing the influence and force of a government continually changing hands towards it is one of those visionary things that none but madmen could meditate and that no wise man will believe if it could be done at all which is utterly incredible it would require a long series of time certainly beyond the life of any individual to effect itwho then would enter into such a plot for what purpose of interest or ambition  on the 10th of july washington had a conversation with jefferson on the subject of the letter and endeavored with his usual supervising and moderating assiduity to allay the jealousies and suspicions which were disturbing the mind of that ardent politician these he intimated had been carried a great deal too far there might be desires he said among a few in the higher walks of life particularly in the great cities to change the form of government into a monarchy but he did not believe there were any designs and he believed the main body of the people in the eastern states were as steadily for republicanism as in the southern  hamilton was equally strenuous with jefferson in urging upon washington the policy of a reelection as it regarded the public good and wrote to him fully on the subject it was the opinion of every one he alleged with whom he had conversed that the affairs of the national government were not yet firmly established that its enemies generally speaking were as inveterate as ever that their enmity had been sharpened by its success and all the resentments which flow from disappointed predictions and mortified vanity that a general and strenuous effort was making in every state to place the administration of it in the hands of its enemies as if they were its safest guardians that the period of the next house of representatives was likely to prove the crisis of its national character that if washington continued in office nothing materially mischievous was to be apprehended but if he should quit much was to be dreaded  mr edmund randolph also after a long letter on the jeopardy of the union which seemed to him at the eve of a crisis adds the fuel which has been already gathered for combustion wants no addition but how awfully might it be increased were the violence which is now suspended by a universal submission to your pretensions let loose by your resignation not the cabinet merely divided as it was in its political opinions but all parties however discordant in other points concurred in a desire that washington should continue in officeso truly was he regarded as the choice of the nation  but though the cabinet was united in feeling on this one subject in other respects its dissensions were increasing in virulence washington had noticed this growing feud with excessive pain and at length found it necessary to interfere and attempt a reconciliation between the warring parties in the course of a letter to jefferson aug 23d on the subject of indian hostilities and the possibility of their being furnished by foreign agents to check as far as possible the rapid increase extension and consequence of the united states how unfortunate then observes he and how much to be regretted that while we are encompassed on all sides with armed enemies and insidious friends internal dissensions should be harrowing and tearing our vitals the latter to me is the most serious the most alarming and the most afflicting of the two and without more charity for the opinions and acts of one another in governmental matters or some more infallible criterion by which the truth of speculative opinions before they have undergone the test of experience are to be prejudged than has yet fallen to the lot of fallibility i believe it will be difficult if not impracticable to manage the reins of government or to keep the parts of it together for if instead of laying our shoulders to the machine after measures are decided on one pulls this way and another that before the utility of the thing is fairly tried it must inevitably be torn asunder and in my opinion the fairest prospect of happiness and prosperity that ever was presented to man will be lost perhaps forever  admonitions to the same purport were addressed by him to hamilton having premised these things adds he i would fain hope that liberal allowances will be made for the political opinions of each other and instead of those wounding suspicions and irritating charges with which some of our gazettes are so strongly impregnated and which cannot fail if persevered in of pushing matters to extremity and thereby tearing the machine asunder that there may be mutual forbearance and temporizing yielding on all sides without these i do not see how the reins of government are to be managed or how the union of the states can be much longer preserved  washingtons solicitude for harmony in his cabinet had been rendered more anxious by public disturbances in some parts of the country the excise law on ardent spirits distilled within the united states had from the time of its enactment by congress in 1791 met with opposition from the inhabitants of the western counties of pennsylvania it had been modified and rendered less offensive within the present year but the hostility to it had continued combinations were formed to defeat the execution of it and the revenue officers were riotously opposed in the execution of their duties determined to exert all the legal powers with which he was invested to check so daring and unwarrantable a spirit washington on the 15th of september issued a proclamation warning all persons to desist from such unlawful combinations and proceedings and requiring all courts magistrates and officers to bring the infractors of the law to justice copies of which proclamation were sent to the governors of pennsylvania and of north and south carolina     chapter lxxiii washingtons second termdifficulties with the french ambassador   it was after a long and painful conflict of feelings that washington consented to be a candidate for a reelection there was no opposition on the part of the public and the vote for him in the electoral college was unanimous in a letter to a friend he declared himself gratefully impressed by so distinguished and honorable a testimony of public approbation and confidence george clinton of new york was held up for the vicepresidency in opposition to john adams but the latter was reelected by a majority of twentyseven electoral votes  the session of congress opened on the 5th of november the continuance of the indian war formed a painful topic in the presidents address efforts at pacification had as yet been unsuccessful two brave officers colonel hardin and major trueman who had been sent to negotiate with the savages had been severally murdered vigorous preparations were therefore making for an active prosecution of hostilities in which wayne was to take the field the factious and turbulent opposition which had been made in some parts of the country to the collection of duties on spirituous liquors distilled in the united states was likewise adverted to by the president and a determination expressed to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws in a part of the speech addressed to the house of representatives he expressed a strong hope that the state of the national finances was now sufficiently matured to admit of an arrangement for the redemption and discharge of the public debt  the address was well received by both houses and a disposition expressed to concur with the presidents views and wishes the discussion of the subjects to which he had called their attention soon produced vehement conflicts of opinion in the house marking the growing virulence of parties the secretary of the treasury in reporting at the request of the house a plan for the annual reduction of so much of the national debt as the united states had a right to redeem spoke of the expenses of the indian war and the necessity of additional internal taxes the consideration of the report was parried or evaded and a motion made to reduce the military establishment this gave an opportunity for sternly criticising the mode in which the indian war had been conducted for discussing the comparative merits and cost of regular and militia forces and for inveighing against standing armies as dangerous to liberty these discussions while they elicited much heat led to no present result and gave way to an inquiry into the conduct of the secretary of the treasury in regard to certain loans which the president in conformity to acts of congress had authorized him to make but concerning the management of which he had not furnished detailed reports to the legislature the subject was opened by mr giles of virginia who moved in the house of representatives a series of resolutions seeking information in the matter and who followed his resolutions by a speech charging the secretary of the treasury with official misconduct and intimating that a large balance of public money had not been accounted for a report of the secretary gave all the information desired but the charges against him continued to be urged with great acrimony to the close of the session when they were signally rejected not more than sixteen members voting for any one of them  washington though he never courted popularity was attentive to the signs of public opinion and disposed to be guided by them when right the time for entering upon his second term of presidency was at hand there had been much cavilling at the parade attending his first installation to guide him on the coming occasion washington called the heads of departments together and desired they would consult with one another and agree on any changes they might consider for the better assuring them he would willingly conform to whatever they should advise  they held such consultation and ultimately gave their individual opinions in writing with regard to the time manner and place of the presidents taking the oath of office as they were divided in opinion and gave no positive advice as to any change no change was made on the 4th of march the oath was publicly administered to washington by mr justice cushing in the senate chamber in presence of the heads of departments foreign ministers such members of the house of representatives as were in town and as many other spectators as could be accommodated  it was under gloomy auspices a divided cabinet an increasing exasperation of parties a suspicion of monarchial tendencies and a threatened abatement of popularity that washington entered upon his second term of presidency it was a portentous period in the history of the world for in a little while came news of that tragical event the beheading of louis xvi an event followed hard upon it to shake the quiet of the world early in april intelligence was received that france had declared war against england popular excitement was now wound up to the highest pitch what it was asked were americans to do in such a juncture could they remain unconcerned spectators of a conflict between their ancient enemy and republican france should they fold their arms and look coldly on a war begun it is true by france but threatening the subversion of the republic and the reestablishment of a monarchial government  many in the wild enthusiasm of the moment would at once have precipitated the country into a war fortunately this belligerent impulse was not general and was checked by the calm controlling wisdom of washington he was at mount vernon when he received news of the war and understood that american vessels were already designated and some even fitting out to serve in it as privateers hastening back to philadelphia he held a cabinet council on the 19th of april to deliberate on the measures proper to be observed by the united states in the present crisis and to determine upon a general plan of conduct for the executive  in this council it was unanimously determined that a proclamation should be issued by the president forbidding the citizens of the united states to take part in any hostilities on the seas and warning them against carrying to the belligerents any articles deemed contraband according to the modern usages of nations and forbidding all acts and proceedings inconsistent with the duties of a friendly nation towards those at war it was unanimously agreed also that should the republic of france send a minister to the united states he should be received  no one at the present day questions the wisdom of washingtons proclamation of neutrality it was our true policy to keep aloof from european war in which our power would be inefficient our loss certain the measure however was at variance with the enthusiastic feelings and excited passions of a large portion of the citizens they treated it for a time with some forbearance out of longcherished reverence for washingtons name but his popularity hitherto unlimited was no proof against the inflamed state of public feeling the proclamation was stigmatized as a royal edict a daring assumption of power an open manifestation of partiality for england and hostility to france washington saw that a deadly blow was aimed at his influence and his administration and that both were at hazard but he was convinced that neutrality was the true national policy and he resolved to maintain it whatever might be his immediate loss of popular favor his resolution was soon put to the test  the french republic had recently appointed edmond charles genet or citizen genet as he was styled minister to the united states he was represented as a young man of good parts very well educated and of an ardent temper a letter from gouverneur morris at that time minister to france apprised mr jefferson that the executive council had furnished genet with three hundred blank commissions for privateers to be given clandestinely to such persons as he might find in america inclined to take them  genets conduct proved the correctness of this information he had landed at charleston south carolina from the french frigate the ambuscade on the 8th of april a short time before the proclamation of neutrality and was received with great rejoicing and extravagant demonstrations of respect his landing at a port several hundred miles from the seat of government was a singular move for a diplomat but his object in so doing was soon evident it is usual for a foreign minister to present his credentials to the government to which he comes and be received by it in form before he presumes to enter upon the exercise of his functions citizen genet however did not stop for these formalities confident in his nature heated in his zeal and flushed with the popular warmth of his reception he could not pause to consider the proprieties of his mission and the delicate responsibilities involved in diplomacy the contiguity of charleston to the west indies made it a favorable port for fitting out privateers against the trade of these islands and during genets short sojourn there he issued commissions for arming and equipping vessels of war for that purpose and manning them with americans  in the latter part of april genet set out for the north by land as he proceeded on his journey the newspapers teemed with accounts of the processions and addresses with which he was greeted and the festivities which celebrated his arrival at each place on the 16th of may he arrived at philadelphia his belligerent operations at charleston had already been made a subject of complaint to the government by mr hammond the british minister but they produced no abatement in the public enthusiasm  on the following day various societies and a large body of citizens waited upon him with addresses recalling with gratitude the aid given by france in the achievement of american independence and extolling and rejoicing in the success of the arms of the french republic on the same day before genet had presented his credentials and been acknowledged by the president he was invited to a grand republican dinner at which we are told the company united in singing the marseilles hymn on the 18th of may genet presented his letter of credence to the president by whom notwithstanding his late unwarrantable proceedings at charleston he was well received washington taking the occasion to express his sincere regard for the french nation  the acts of this diplomatic personage at charleston had not been the sole ground of the complaint preferred by the british minister the capture of the british vessel the grange by the frigate ambuscade formed a graver one occurring within our waters it was a clear usurpation of national sovereignty and a violation of neutral rights the british minister demanded a restitution of the prize and the cabinet were unanimously of opinion that restitution should be made nor was there any difficulty with the french minister on this head but restitution was likewise claimed of other vessels captured on the high seas and brought into port by the privateers authorized by genet in regard to these there was a difference of sentiment in the cabinet hamilton and knox were of opinion that the government should interpose to restore the prizes it being the duty of a neutral nation to remedy any injury sustained by armaments fitted out in its ports jefferson and randolph contended that the case should be left to the decision of the courts of justice if the courts adjudged the commissions issued by genet to be invalid they would of course decide the captures made under them to be void and the property to remain in the original owners if on the other hand the legal right to the property had been transferred to the captors they would so decide  seeing this difference of opinion in the cabinet washington reserved the point for further deliberation but directed the secretary of state to communicate to the ministers of france and britain the principles in which they concurred these being considered as settled circular letters also were addressed to the governors of several states requiring their cooperation with force if necessary to carry out the rules agreed upon  genet took umbrage at these decisions of the government and expressed his dissatisfaction in a letter complaining of them as violations of natural right and subversive of the existing treaties between the two nations his letter though somewhat wanting in strict decorum of language induced a review of the subject in the cabinet and he was informed that no reason appeared for changing the system adopted he was further informed that in the opinion of the executive the vessels which had been illegally equipped should depart from the ports of the united states  genet was not disposed to acquiesce in these decisions he was aware of the grateful feelings of the nation to france of the popular disposition to go all lengths short of war in her favor of the popular idea that republican interests were identical on both sides of the atlantic that a royal triumph over republicanism in europe would be followed by a combination to destroy it in this country the people he thought were with him if washington was not and he believed the latter would not dare to risk his popularity in thwarting their enthusiasm he persisted therefore in disregarding the decisions of the government and spoke of them as a departure from the obligations it owed to france a cowardly abandonment of friends when danger menaced  another event added to the irritation of genet two american citizens whom he had engaged at charleston to cruise in the service of france were arrested on board of the privateer conducted to prison and prosecutions commenced against them the indignant feelings of genet were vented in an extraordinary letter to the secretary of state when speaking of their arrest the crime laid to their charge writes hethe crime which my mind cannot conceive and which my pen almost refuses to stateis the serving of france and defending with her children the common glorious cause of liberty the lofty and indignant tone of this letter had no effect in shaking the determination of government or obtaining the release of the prisoners washington confesses however that he was very much hurried and perplexed by the disputes memorials and what not with which he was pestered by one or other of the powers at war it was a sore trial of his equanimity his impartiality and his discrimination and wore upon his spirits and his health  in the latter part of july washington was suddenly called to mount vernon by the death of mr whiting the manager of his estates during his brief absence from the seat of government occurred the case of the little sarah this was a british merchant vessel which had been captured by a french privateer and brought into philadelphia where she had been armed and equipped for privateering manned with one hundred and twenty men many of them americans and her name changed into that of le petit democrat this of course was in violation of washingtons decision which had been communicated to genet  general mifflin now governor of pennsylvania being informed on the 6th of july that the vessel was to sail the next day sent his secretary mr dallas at midnight to genet to persuade him to detain her until the president should arrive intimating that otherwise force would be used to prevent her departure genet flew into one of the transports of passion to which he was prone contrasted the treatment experienced by him from the officers of government with the attachment to his nation professed by the people at large declared that the president was not the sovereign of the country and had no right without consulting congress to give such instructions as he had issued to the state governors threatened to appeal from his decision to the people and to repel force by force should an attempt be made to seize the privateer  apprised of this menace governor mifflin forthwith ordered out one hundred and twenty of the militia to take possession of the privateer and communicated the circumstances of the case to the cabinet  mr jefferson now took the matter in hand and on the 7th of july in an interview with genet repeated the request that the privateer be detained until the arrival of the president genet he writes instantly took up the subject in a very high tone and went into an immense field of declamation and complaint jefferson made a few efforts to be heard but finding them ineffectual suffered the torrent of vituperation to pour on when genet had subsided into coolness jefferson pressed the detention of the little sarah until the presidents return intimating that her previous departure would be considered a very serious offence genet made no promise but expressed himself very happy to be able to inform mr jefferson that the vessel was not in a state of readiness she had to change her position that day he said and fall down the river somewhere about the lower end of the town for the convenience of taking some things on board and would not depart yet jefferson was accordingly impressed with the belief that the privateer would remain in the river until the president should decide on her case and on communicating this conviction to the governor the latter ordered the militia to be dismissed  washington arrived at philadelphia on the 11th of july when papers requiring instant attention were put into his hands they related to the case of the little sarah and were from jefferson who being ill with fever had retired to his seat in the country nothing could exceed the displeasure of washington when he examined these papers in a cabinet council held the next day it was determined to detain in port all privateers which had been equipped within the united states by any of the belligerent powers no time was lost in communicating this determination to genet but in defiance of it the vessel sailed on her cruise it must have been a severe trial of washingtons spirit to see his authority thus braved and insulted and to find that the people notwithstanding the indignity thus offered to their chief magistrate sided with the aggressors and exulted in their open defiance of his neutral policy  fresh mortifications awaited him from the distempered state of public sentiment the trial came on of gideon henfield an american citizen prosecuted under the advice of the attorneygeneral for having enlisted at charleston on board of a french privateer which had brought prizes into the port of philadelphia the populace took part with henfield he had enlisted before the proclamation of neutrality had been published and even if he had enlisted at a later date was he to be punished for engaging with their ancient ally france in the cause of liberty against the royal despots of europe his acquittal exposed washington to the obloquy of having attempted a measure which the laws would not justify it showed him moreover the futility of attempts at punishment for infractions of the rules proclaimed for the preservation of neutrality while the clamorous rejoicing by which the acquittal of henfield had been celebrated evinced the popular disposition to thwart that line of policy which he considered most calculated to promote the public good nothing however could induce him to swerve from that policy  hitherto washington had exercised great forbearance toward the french minister notwithstanding the little respect shown by the latter to the rights of the united states but the official communications of genet were becoming too offensive and insulting to be longer tolerated meetings of the heads of departments and the attorneygeneral were held at the presidents on the 1st and 2d of august in which the whole of the official correspondence and conduct of genet was passed in review and it was agreed that his recall should be desired it was proposed that a publication of the whole correspondence and a statement of the proceedings should be made by way of appeal to the people this produced animated debates hamilton spoke with great warmth in favor of an appeal jefferson opposed it genet said he will appeal also it will become a contest between the president and genet  washington already weary and impatient under the incessant dissensions of his cabinet was stung by the suggestion that he might be held up as in conflict with genet and subjected as he had been to the ribaldry of the press at this unlucky moment knox blundered forth with a specimen of the scandalous libels already in circulation a pasquinade lately printed called the funeral of george washington wherein the president was represented as placed upon a guillotine a horrible parody on the late decapitation of the french king the president writes jefferson now burst forth into one of those transports of passion beyond his control inveighed against the personal abuse which had been bestowed upon him and defied any man on earth to produce a single act of his since he had been in the government that had not been done on the purest motives he had never repented but once the having slipped the moment of resigning his office and that was every moment since in the agony of his heart he declared that he had rather be in his grave than in his present situation that he had rather be on his farm than to be made emperor of the worldand yet said he indignantly they are charging me with wanting to be a king  all were silent during this burst of feelinga pause ensuedit was difficult to resume the question washington however who had recovered his equanimity put an end to the difficulty there was no necessity he said for deciding the matter at present perhaps events would show whether the appeal would be necessary or not  washington had hitherto been annoyed and perplexed by having to manage a divided cabinet he was now threatened with that cabinets dissolution mr hamilton had informed him by letter that private as well as public reasons had determined him to retire from office towards the close of the next session probably with a view to give congress an opportunity to examine into his conduct now came a letter from mr jefferson dated july 31st in which he announced his intention to withdraw at the close of the ensuing month of september i shall beg leave to retire to scenes of greater tranquillity from those for which i am every day more and more convinced that neither my talents tone of mind nor time of life fit me  washington was both grieved and embarrassed by this notification full of concern he called upon jefferson at his country residence near philadelphia pictured his deep distress at finding himself in the present perplexing juncture of affairs about to be deserted by those of his cabinet on whose counsel he had counted and whose places he knew not where to find persons competent to supply and in his chagrin again expressed his repentance that he himself had not resigned as he had once meditated the public mind he went on to observe was in an alarming state of ferment political combinations of various kinds were forming where all this would end he knew not a new congress was to assemble more numerous than the last perhaps of a different spirit the first expressions of its sentiments would be important and it would relieve him considerably if jefferson would remain in office if it were only until the end of the session  washington had the highest opinion of jeffersons abilities his knowledge of foreign affairs his thorough patriotism and it was his earnest desire to retain him in his cabinet through the whole of the ensuing session of congress before the close of which he trusted the affairs of the country relating to foreign powers indian disturbances and internal policy would have taken a more decisive and it was to be hoped agreeable form than they then had a compromise was eventually made according to which jefferson was to be allowed a temporary absence in the autumn and on his return was to continue in office until january  in the meantime genet had proceeded to new york which was just then in a great agitation the frigate ambuscade while anchored in the harbor had been challenged to single combat by the british frigate boston captain courtney which was cruising off the hook the challenge was accepted a severe action ensued courtney was killed and the boston much damaged was obliged to stand for halifax the ambuscade returned triumphant to new york and entered the port amid the enthusiastic cheers of the populace on the same day a french fleet of fifteen sail arrived from the chesapeake and anchored in the hudson river the officers and crews were objects of unbounded favor with all who inclined to the french cause in the midst of this excitement the ringing of bells and the firing of cannon announced that citizen genet was arrived at powles hook ferry directly opposite the city there was an immediate assemblage of the republican party in the fields now called the park a committee was appointed to escort genet into the city he entered it amid the almost frantic cheerings of the populace addresses were made to him expressing devoted attachment to the french republic and abjuring all neutrality in regard to its heroic struggle  in the midst of his selfgratulation and complacency however he received a letter from mr jefferson sept 15 acquainting him with the measures taken to procure his recall and inclosing a copy of the letter written for that purpose to the american minister at paris it was added that out of anxious regard lest the interests of france might suffer the executive would in the meantime receive his m genets communications in writing and admit the continuance of his functions so long as they should be restrained within the law as theretofore announced to him and should be of the tenor usually observed towards independent nations by the representative of a friendly power residing with them  the letter of the secretary of state threw genet into a violent passion and produced a reply sept 18 written while he was still in a great heat unfortunately for genets ephemeral popularity a rumor got abroad that he had expressed a determination to appeal from the president to the people the spirit of audacity thus manifested by a foreign minister shocked the national pride meetings were held in every part of the union to express the public feeling in the matter in these meetings the proclamation of neutrality and the system of measures flowing from it were sustained partly from a conviction of their wisdom and justice but more from an undiminished affection for the person and character of washington for many who did not espouse his views were ready to support him in the exercise of his constitutional functions     chapter lxxiv neutralitywhiskey insurrectionwaynes success against the indians   while the neutrality of the united states so jealously guarded by washington was endangered by the intrigues of the french minister it was put to imminent hazard by illadvised measures of the british cabinet there was such a scarcity in france in consequence of the failure of the crops that a famine was apprehended england availing herself of her naval ascendency determined to increase the distress of her rival by cutting off all her supplies from abroad in june 1793 therefore her cruisers were instructed to detain all vessels bound to france with cargoes of corn flour or meal take them into port unload them purchase the cargoes make a proper allowance for the freight and then release the vessels or to allow the masters of them on a stipulated security to dispose of their cargoes in a port in amity with england this measure gave umbrage to all parties in the united states and brought out an earnest remonstrance from the government as being a violation of the law of neutrals and indefensible on any proper construction of the law of nations  another grievance which helped to swell the tide of resentment against great britain was the frequent impressment of american seamen a wrong to which they were particularly exposed from national similarity to these may be added the persistence of great britain in holding the posts to the south of the lakes which according to treaty stipulations ought to have been given up washington did not feel himself in a position to press our rights under the treaty with the vigorous hand that some would urge questions having risen in some of the state courts to obstruct the fulfilment of our part of it which regarded the payment of british debts contracted before the war  the hostilities of the indians north of the ohio by many attributed to british wiles still continued the attempts at an amicable negotiation had proved as fruitless as washington had anticipated the troops under wayne had therefore taken the field to act offensively but from the lateness of the season had formed a winter camp near the site of the present city of cincinnati whence wayne was to open his campaign in the ensuing spring  congress assembled on the 2d of december 1793 with various causes of exasperation at work the intrigues of genet and the aggressions of england uniting to aggravate to a degree of infatuation the partiality for france and render imminent the chance of a foreign war washington in his opening speech after expressing his deep and respectful sense of the renewed testimony of public approbation manifested in his reelection proceeded to state the measures he had taken in consequence of the war in europe to protect the rights and interests of the united states and maintain peaceful relations with the belligerent parties still he pressed upon congress the necessity of placing the country in a condition of complete defence one part of his speech conveyed an impressive admonition to the house of representatives no pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt in none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable the necessity of augmenting the public revenue in a degree commensurate with the objects suggested was likewise touched upon  the choice of speaker showed that there was a majority of ten against the administration in the house of representatives yet it was manifest from the affectionate answer on the 6th of the two houses to washingtons speech and the satisfaction expressed at his reelection that he was not included in the opposition which from this act appeared to await his political system notwithstanding the popular ferment in favor of france both houses seem to have approved the course pursued by washington in regard to that country and as to his proclamation of neutrality while the house approved of it in guarded terms the senate pronounced it a measure welltimed and wise manifesting a watchful solicitude for the welfare of the nation and calculated to promote it  early in the session mr jefferson in compliance with a requisition which the house of representatives had made feb 23 1791 furnished an able and comprehensive report of the state of trade of the united states with different countries the nature and extent of exports and imports and the amount of tonnage of the american shipping specifying also the various restrictions and prohibitions by which our commerce was embarrassed and in some instances almost ruined two methods he said presented themselves by which these impediments might be removed modified or counteracted friendly arrangement or countervailing legislation friendly arrangements were preferable with all who would come into them and we should carry into such arrangements all the liberality and spirit of accommodation which the nature of the case would admit but he adds should any nation continue its system of prohibitive duties and regulations it behooves us to protect our citizens their commerce and navigation by counter prohibitions duties and regulations  with this able and elaborate report jefferson closed his labors as secretary of state washington had been especially sensible of the talents and integrity displayed by jefferson during the closing year of his secretaryship and particularly throughout this french perplexity and had recently made a last attempt but an unsuccessful one to persuade him to remain in the cabinet the place thus made vacant was filled by mr edmond randolph whose office of attorneygeneral was conferred on mr william bradford of pennsylvania  the report of mr jefferson on commercial intercourse was soon taken up in the house in a committee of the whole a series of resolutions based on it and relating to the privileges and restrictions of the commerce of the united states were introduced by mr madison and became the subject of a warm and acrimonious debate the report upheld the policy of turning the course of trade from england to france by discriminations in favor of the latter and the resolutions were to the same purport the idea was to oppose commercial resistance to commercial injury to enforce a perfect commercial equality by retaliating impositions assuming that the commercial system of great britain was hostile to the united statesa position strongly denied by some of the debaters  though the subject was or might seem to be of a purely commercial nature it was inevitably mixed up with political considerations according as a favorable inclination to england or france was apprehended the debate which had commenced on the 13th of january 1794 was protracted to the 3d of february when the question being taken on the first resolution it was carried by a majority of only five so nearly were parties divided the further consideration of the remaining resolutions was postponed to march when it was resumed but in consequence of the new complexion of affairs was suspended without a decision  the next legislative movement was also productive of a warm debate though connected with a subject which appealed to the sympathies of the whole nation algerine corsairs had captured eleven american merchant vessels and upwards of one hundred prisoners and the regency manifested a disposition for further outrages a bill was introduced into congress proposing a force of six frigates to protect the commerce of the united states against the cruisers of this piratical power the bill met with strenuous opposition but was eventually passed by both houses  in the course of this session fresh instances had come before the government of the mischievous activity and audacity of genet showing that not content with compromising the neutrality of the united states at sea he was attempting to endanger it by land from documents received it appeared that in november he had sent emissaries to kentucky to enroll american citizens in an expedition against new orleans and the spanish possessions furnishing them with blank commissions for the purpose it was an enterprise in which the adventurous people of that state were ready enough to embark through enthusiasm for the french nation and impatience at the delay of spain to open the navigation of the mississippi another expedition was to proceed against the floridas men for the purpose to be enlisted at the south to rendezvous in georgia and to be aided by a body of indians and by a french fleet should one arrive on the coast a proclamation from governor moultrie checked all such enlistments in south carolina  documents relating to these transactions were communicated to congress by washington early in january but though the expedition set on foot in south carolina had been checked it was subsequently reported that the one in kentucky against louisiana was still in progress and about to descend the ohio these schemes showed such determined purpose on the part of genet to undermine the peace of the united states that washington without waiting a reply to the demand for his recall resolved to keep no further terms with that headlong diplomat in a cabinet council it was determined to supersede his diplomatic functions deprive him of the consequent privileges and arrest his person a message to congress avowing such determination was prepared but at this critical juncture came despatches from gouverneur morris announcing his recall mr fauchet secretary of the executive council was appointed to succeed him  about this time vigilance was required to guard against wrongs from an opposite quarter we have noticed the orders issued by great britain to her cruisers in june 1793 and the resentment thereby excited in the united states on the 6th of the following month of november she had given them additional instructions to detain all vessels laden with the produce of any colony belonging to france or carrying supplies to any such colony and to bring them with their cargoes to british ports for adjudication in the british courts of admiralty captures of american vessels were taking place in consequence of these orders and heightening public irritation they were considered indicative of determined hostility on the part of great britain and they produced measures in congress preparatory to an apprehended state of war an embargo was laid prohibiting all trade from the united states to any foreign place for the space of thirty days and vigorous preparations for defence were adopted with but little opposition  on the 27th of march resolutions were moved that all debts due to british subjects be sequestered and paid into the treasury as a fund to indemnify citizens of the united states for depredations sustained from british cruisers and that all intercourse with great britain be interdicted until she had made compensation for these injuries and until she should make surrender of the western posts  the popular excitement was intense meetings were held on the subject of british spoliations peace or war was the absorbing question while the public mind was in this inflammable state washington received advices from mr pinckney the american minister in london informing him that the british ministry had issued instructions to the commanders of armed vessels revoking those of the 6th of november 1793 lord grenville also in conversation with mr pinckney had explained the real motives for that order showing that however oppressive in its execution it had not been intended for the special vexation of american commerce washington laid pinckneys letter before congress on the 4th of april it had its effect on both parties federalists saw in it a chance of accommodating difficulties and therefore opposed all measures calculated to irritate the other party did not press their belligerent propositions to any immediate decision but showed no solicitude to avoid a rupture  the war cry however is too obvious a means of popular excitement to be readily given up busy partisans saw that the feeling of the populace was belligerent and every means were taken by the press and the democratic societies to exasperate this feeling according to them the crisis called not for moderation but for decision for energy still to adhere to a neutral position would argue tamenesscowardice washington however was too morally brave to be clamored out of his wise moderation by such taunts he resolved to prevent a war if possible by an appeal to british justice to be made through a special envoy who should represent to the british government the injuries we had sustained from it in various ways and should urge indemnification  the measure was decried by the party favorable to france as an undue advance to the british government but they were still more hostile to it when it was rumored that hamilton was to be chosen for the mission a member of the house of representatives addressed a strong letter to the president deprecating the mission but especially the reputed choice of the envoy hamilton aware of the collateral obstacles which existed with respect to himself had resolved to advise washington to drop him from the consideration and to fix upon another character and recommended john jay the chief justice of the united states as the man whom it would be advisable to send  mr jay was the person ultimately chosen washington in his message thus nominating an additional envoy to great britain expressed undiminished confidence in the minister actually in london but a mission like this observes he while it corresponds with the solemnity of the occasion will announce to the world a solicitude for a friendly adjustment of our complaints and a reluctance to hostility the nomination was approved by a majority of ten senators  the french government having so promptly complied with the wishes of the american government in recalling citizen genet requested as an act of reciprocity the recall of gouverneur morris whose political sympathies were considered highly aristocratical the request was granted accordingly but washington in a letter to morris notifying him of his being superseded assured him of his own undiminished confidence and friendship james munroe was appointed in his place  the discontents in the western part of pennsylvania excited by the excise law now broke out into open insurrection we have already mentioned the riotous opposition this law had experienced bills of indictment had been found against some of the rioters the marshal when on the way to serve the processes issued by the court was fired upon by armed men and narrowly escaped with his life he was subsequently seized and compelled to renounce the exercise of his official duties the house of general nevil inspector of the revenue was assailed but the assailants were repulsed they assembled in greater numbers the magistrates and militia officers shrank from interfering lest it should provoke a general insurrection a few regular soldiers were obtained from the garrison at fort pitt there was a parley the insurgents demanded that the inspector and his papers should be given up and the soldiers march out of the house and ground their arms the demand being refused the house was attacked the outhouses set on fire and the garrison was compelled to surrender the marshal and inspector finally escaped out of the country descended the ohio and by a circuitous route found their way to the seat of government bringing a lamentable tale of their misadventures  it was intimated that the insurgent district could bring seven thousand men into the field delay would only swell the growing disaffection on the 7th of august washington issued a proclamation warning the insurgents to disperse and declaring that if tranquillity were not restored before the 1st of september force would be employed to compel submission to the laws to show that this was not an empty threat he on the same day made a requisition on the governors of new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia for militia to compose an army of twelve thousand men  the insurgents manifesting a disposition to persevere in their rebellious conduct the president issued a second proclamation on the 25th of september describing in forcible terms the perverse and obstinate spirit with which the lenient propositions of government had been met and declaring his fixed purpose to reduce the refractory to obedience shortly after this he left philadelphia for carlisle to join the army then on its march to suppress the insurrection in the western part of pennsylvania on the 10th the pennsylvania troops set out from carlisle for their rendezvous at bedford and washington proceeded to williamsport thence to go on to fort cumberland the rendezvous of the virginia and maryland troops he arrived at the latter place on the 16th of october and found a respectable force assembled from those states and learnt that fifteen hundred more from virginia were at hand all accounts agreed that the insurgents were greatly alarmed at the serious appearance of things at bedford washington arranged matters and settled a plan of military operations the governors of virginia maryland and pennsylvania were at the head of the troops of their respective states but governor lee was to have the general command this done washington prepared to shape his course for philadelphia  washington pushed on for philadelphia through deep roads and a three days rain and arrived there about the last of october governor lee marched with the troops in two divisions amounting to fifteen thousand men into the western counties of pennsylvania this great military array extinguished at once the kindling elements of a civil war by making resistance desperate at the approach of so overwhelming a force the insurgents laid down their arms and gave assurance of submission and craved the clemency of government it was extended to them a few were tried for treason but were not convicted but as some spirit of discontent was still manifest majorgeneral morgan was stationed with a detachment for the winter in the disaffected region  it was with great satisfaction that washington had been able to announce in his speech at the opening of congress nov 9th favorable intelligence of the campaign of general wayne against the hostile indians west of the ohio that brave commander had conducted it with a judgment and prudence little compatible with the harebrained appellation he had acquired by his rash exploits during the revolution leaving his winter encampment on the ohio in the spring of 1794 he had advanced cautiously into the wild country west of it skirmishing with bands of lurking savages as he advanced and establishing posts to keep up communication and secure the transmission of supplies it was not until the 8th of august that he arrived at the junction of the rivers au glaize and miami in a fertile and populous region where the western indians had their most important villages here he threw up some works which he named fort defiance being strengthened by eleven hundred mounted volunteers from kentucky his force exceeded that of the savage warriors who had collected to oppose him which scarcely amounted to two thousand men these however were strongly encamped in the vicinity of fort miami a british post about thirty miles distant and far within the limits of the united states and seemed prepared to give battle expecting possibly to be aided by the british garrison  on the 20th being arrived near the enemys position his advanced guard was fired upon by an ambush of the enemy concealed in a thicket and was compelled to retreat the general now ordered an attack of horse and foot upon the enemys position the indians were roused from their lair with the point of the bayonet driven fighting for more than two miles through thick woods and pursued with great slaughter until within gunshot of the british fort  in his official address to congress washington had urged the adoption of some definite plan for the redemption of the public debt a plan was reported by mr hamilton 20th january 1795 which he had digested and prepared on the basis of the actual revenues for the further support of public credit the report embraced a comprehensive view of the system which he had pursued and made some recommendations which after much debate were adopted  so closed mr hamiltons labors as secretary of the treasury he had long meditated a retirement from his post the pay of which was inadequate to the support of his family but had postponed it first on account of the accusations brought against him in the second congress and of which he awaited the investigation secondly in consequence of events which rendered the prospect of a continuance of peace precarious but these reasons no longer operating he gave notice that on the last day of the ensuing month of january he should give in his resignation  hamilton was succeeded in office by oliver wolcott of connecticut a man of judgment and ability who had served as comptroller and was familiar with the duties of the office knox likewise had given in his resignation at the close of the month of december after having served my country nearly twenty years writes he to washington the greatest portion of which under your immediate auspices it is with extreme reluctance that i find myself constrained to withdraw from so honorable a station but the natural and powerful claims of a numerous family will no longer permit me to neglect their essential interests knox was succeeded in the war department by colonel timothy pickering at that time postmastergeneral     chapter lxxv jays treatyparty claimsdifficulties with francefarewell address   washington had watched the progress of the mission of mr jay to england with an anxious eye he was aware that he had exposed his popularity to imminent hazard by making an advance toward a negotiation with that power but what was of still greater moment with him he was aware that the peace and happiness of his country were at stake on the result of that mission it was moreover a mission of great delicacy from the many intricate and difficult points to be discussed and the various and mutual grounds of complaint to be adjusted mr jay in a letter dated august 5th 1794 had informed him confidentially that the ministry were prepared to settle the matters in dispute upon just and liberal terms still what those terms which they conceived to be just and liberal might prove when they came to be closely discussed no one could prognosticate  at length on the 7th of march 1795 four days after the close of the session of congress a treaty arrived which had been negotiated by mr jay and signed by the ministers of the two nations on the 19th of november and was sent out for ratification washington immediately made the treaty a close study some of the provisions were perfectly satisfactory of others he did not approve on the whole believing the advantages to outweigh the objections and that it was the best treaty attainable he made up his mind to ratify it should it be approved by the senate  as a system of predetermined hostility to the treaty however was already manifested and efforts were made to awaken popular jealousy concerning it washington kept its provisions secret that the public mind might not be preoccupied on the subject in the course of a few days however enough leaked out to be seized upon by the opposition press to excite public distrust though not enough to convey a distinct idea of the merits of the instrument  in the course of this month arrived mr adet who had been appointed by the french government to succeed mr fauchet as minister to the united states  illustration from houdons bust vol iv  the senate was convened by washington on the 8th of june and the treaty of mr jay was laid before it with its accompanying documents the session was with closed doors discussions were long and arduous and the treaty underwent a scrutinizing examination the twelfth article met with especial objections  this article provided for a direct trade between the united states and the british west india islands in american vessels not exceeding seventy tons burden conveying the produce of the states or of the islands but it prohibited the exportation of molasses sugar coffee cocoa or cotton in american vessels either from the united states or the islands to any part of the world under this article it was a restricted intercourse but mr jay considered the admission even of small vessels to the trade of these islands an important advantage to the commerce of the united states he had not sufficiently adverted to the fact that among the prohibited articles cotton was also a product of the southern states its cultivation had been but recently introduced there so that when he sailed for europe hardly sufficient had been raised for domestic consumption and at the time of signing the treaty very little if any had been exported still it was now becoming an important staple of the south and hence the objection of the senate to this article of the treaty on the 24th of june twothirds of the senate the constitutional majority voted for the ratification of the treaty stipulating however that an article be added suspending so much of the twelfth article as respected the west india trade and that the president be requested to open without delay further negotiation on this head  in the meantime the popular discontent which had been excited concerning the treaty was daily increasing the secrecy which had been maintained with regard to its provisions was wrested into a cause of offence such was the irritable condition of the public mind when on the 29th of june a senator of the united states mr mason of virginia sent an abstract of the treaty to be published in a leading opposition paper in philadelphia the whole country was immediately in a blaze beside the opposition party a portion of the cabinet was against the ratification of course it received but a faltering support while the attack upon it was vehement and sustained the assailants seemed determined to carry their point by storm meetings to oppose the ratification were held in boston new york philadelphia baltimore and charleston the smaller towns throughout the union followed their example in new york a copy of the treaty was burnt before the governors house in philadelphia it was suspended on a pole carried about the streets and finally burnt in front of the british ministers house amid the shoutings of the populace the whole country seemed determined by prompt and clamorous manifestations of dissatisfaction to make washington give way  he saw their purpose he was aware of the odious points of view on which the treaty might justly be placed his own opinion was not particularly favorable to it but he was convinced that it was better to ratify it in the manner the senate had advised and with the reservation already mentioned than to suffer matters to remain in their present unsettled and precarious state before he could act upon this conviction a new difficulty arose to suspend his resolution news came that the order of the british government of the 8th of june 1793 for the seizure of provisions in vessels going to french ports was renewed washington instantly directed that a strong memorial should be drawn up against this order as it seemed to favor a construction of the treaty which he was determined to resist while this memorial was in course of preparation he was called off to mount vernon  the opposition made to the treaty from meetings in different parts of the union gave him the most serious uneasiness from the effect it might have on the relations with france and england his reply july 28th to an address from the selectmen of boston contains the spirit of his replies to other addresses of the kind without a predilection for my own judgment i have weighed with attention every argument which has at any time been brought into view but the constitution is the guide which i never can abandon it has assigned to the president the power of making treaties with the advice and consent of the senate it was doubtless supposed that these two branches of government would combine without passion and with the best means of information those facts and principles upon which the success of our foreign relations will always depend that they ought not to substitute for their own conviction the opinions of others or to seek truth through any channel but that of a temperate and wellinformed investigation under this persuasion i have resolved on the manner of executing the duty before me to the high responsibility of it i freely submit and you gentlemen are at liberty to make these sentiments known as the grounds of my procedure while i feel the most lively gratitude for the many instances of approbation from my country i can no otherwise deserve it than by obeying the dictates of my conscience never during his administration had he seen a crisis in his judgment so pregnant with interesting events nor one from which whether viewed on one side or the other more was to be apprehended it was a crisis he said that most eminently called upon the administration to be wise and temperate as well as firm the public clamor continued and induced a reiterated examination of the subject but did not shake his purpose  the difficult and intricate questions pressing upon the attention of government left washington little mood to enjoy the retirement of mount vernon being constantly in doubt whether his presence in philadelphia were not necessary in his letters to randolph he requested to be kept continually advised on this head i do not require more than a days notice to repair to the seat of government his promptness was soon put to the test early in august came a mysterious letter dated july 31 from mr pickering the secretary of war on the subject of the treaty writes pickering i confess i feel extreme solicitude and for a special reason which can be communicated to you only in person i entreat therefore that you will return with all convenient speed to the seat of government in the meanwhile for the reason above referred to i pray you to decide on no important political measure in whatever form it may be presented to you  the receipt of this enigmatical letter induced washington to cut short his sojourn at mount vernon and hasten to philadelphia he arrived there on the 11th of august and on the same day received a solution of the mystery a despatch written by fauchet the french minister to his government in the preceding month of november was placed in washingtons hands with a translation of it made by mr pickering the despatch had been found on board of a french privateer captured by a british frigate and had been transmitted to the ministry lord grenville finding it contained passages relating to the intercourse of mr randolph the american secretary of state with mr fauchet had sent it to mr hammond the british minister in philadelphia he had put it into the hands of mr wolcott the secretary of the treasury who had shown it to the secretary of war and the attorneygeneral and the contents had been considered so extraordinary as to call forth the mysterious letter entreating the prompt return of washington  the following passages in fauchets intercepted despatch related to the western insurrection and the proclamation of washington two or three days before the proclamation was published and of course before the cabinet had resolved on its measures the secretary of state came to my house all his countenance was grief he requested of me a private conversation it is all over he said to me a civil war is about to ravage our unhappy country four men by their talents their influence and their energy may save it but debtors of english merchants they will be deprived of their liberty if they take the smallest step could you lend them instantaneously funds to shelter them from english prosecution this inquiry astonished me much it was impossible for me to make a satisfactory answer you know my want of power and deficiency in pecuniary means thus with some thousands of dollars the republic could have decided on civil war or peace thus the consciences of the pretended patriots of america have already their price  the perusal of the letter gave washington deep perplexity and concern he revolved the matter in his mind in silence the predominant object of his thoughts recently had been to put a stop to the public agitation on the subject of the treaty and he postponed any new question of difficulty until decided measures had laid the other at rest on the next day therefore 12th he brought before the cabinet the question of immediate ratification it was finally agreed to ratify the treaty immediately but to accompany the ratification with a strong memorial against the provision order the ratification was signed by washington on the 18th of august  his conduct towards randolph in the interim had been as usual but now that the despatch of public business no longer demanded the entire attention of the cabinet he proceeded to clear up the doubts occasioned by the intercepted despatch accordingly on the following day as randolph entered the cabinet washington who was conversing with pickering and wolcott rose and handed to him the letter of fauchet asking an explanation of the questionable parts randolph appears to have been less agitated by the production of the letter than hurt that the inquiry concerning it had not first been made of him in private he postponed making any specific reply until he should have time to examine the letter at his leisure and observed on retiring that after the treatment he had experienced he could not think of remaining in office a moment longer  in a letter to the president the same day he writes your confidence in me sir has been unlimited and i can truly affirm unabused my sensations then cannot be concealed when i find that confidence so suddenly withdrawn without a word or distant hint being previously dropped to me this sir as i mentioned in your room is a situation in which i cannot hold my present office and therefore i hereby resign it it will not however be concluded from hence that i mean to relinquish the inquiry no sir very far from it i will also meet any inquiry and to prepare for it if i learn there is a chance of overtaking mr fauchet before he sails i will go to him immediately i have to beg the favor of you to permit me to be furnished with a copy of the letter and i will prepare an answer to it which i perceive that i cannot do as i wish merely upon the few hasty memoranda which i took with my pencil  i here most solemnly deny that any overture came from me which was to produce money to me or any others for me and that in any manner directly or indirectly was a shilling ever received by me nor was it ever contemplated by me that one shilling should be applied by mr fauchet to any purpose relative to the insurrection  washington in reply observes whilst you are in pursuit of means to remove the strong suspicions arising from this letter no disclosure of its contents will be made by me and i will enjoin the same on the public officers who are acquainted with the purport of it no man would rejoice more than i to find that the suspicions which have resulted from the intercepted letter were unequivocally and honorably removed  mr fauchet in the meantime having learnt previous to embarkation that his despatch had been intercepted wrote a declaration denying that mr randolph had ever indicated a willingness to receive money for personal objects and affirming that he had had no intention to say anything in his letter to his government to the disadvantage of mr randolphs character  mr randolph now set to work to prepare a pamphlet in explanation of his conduct while thus occupied he addressed several notes to washington requiring information on various points and received concise answers to all his queries on one occasion where he had required a particular paper he published in the gazette an extract from his note to washington as if fearing the request might be denied lest the paper in question should lay open many confidential and delicate matters  in reply washington writes that you may have no cause to complain of the withholding of any paper however private and confidential which you shall think necessary in a case of so serious a nature  you are at full liberty to publish without reserve any and every private and confidential letter i ever wrote to you nay more every word i ever uttered to you or in your hearing from whence you can derive any advantage in your vindication  the vindication which mr randolph had been preparing appeared in december in this he gave a narrative of the principal events relating to the case his correspondence with the president and the whole of the french ministers letter he endeavored to explain those parts of the letter which had brought the purity of his conduct in question but as has been observed he had a difficult task to perform as he was obliged to prove a negative and to explain vague expressions and insinuations connected with his name in fauchets letter  fauchet himself furnished the best vindication in his certificate above mentioned but it is difficult to reconcile his certificate with the language of his official letter to his government we are rather inclined to attribute to misconceptions and hasty inferences of the french minister the construction put by him in his letter on the conversation he had held with mr randolph the latter injured his cause by the embittered feelings manifested in his vindication and the asperity with which he spoke of washington there and elsewhere he deeply regretted it in after life  after a considerable interval from the resignation of randolph colonel pickering was transferred to the department of state and mr james mchenry was appointed secretary of war the office of attorneygeneral becoming vacant by the death of mr bradford was offered to mr charles lee of virginia and accepted by him on the last day of november  during the late agitations george washington lafayette the son of the general had arrived at boston under the name of motier accompanied by his tutor m frestel and had written to washington apprising him of his arrival it was an embarrassing moment to washington the letter excited his deepest sensibility bringing with it recollections of lafayettes merits services and sufferings and of their past friendship and he resolved to become father friend protector and supporter to his son but he must proceed with caution on account of his own official character as executive of the united states and of the position of lafayette in regard to the french government caution also was necessary not to endanger the situation of the young man himself and of his mother and friends whom he had left behind philadelphia would not be an advisable residence for him at present until it was seen what opinions would be excited by his arrival as washington would for some time be absent from the seat of government while all the foreign functionaries were residing there particularly those of his own nation washington suggested therefore that he should enter for the present as a student at the university in cambridge massachusetts and engaged to pay all the expenses for the residence there of himself and his tutor it was subsequently thought best that young lafayette should proceed to new york and remain in retirement at the country house of a friend in its vicinity pursuing his studies with his tutor until washington should direct otherwise                                       in his speech at the opening of the session of congress in december washington presented a cheerful summary of the events of the year first he announced that a treaty had been concluded provisionally by general wayne with the indians northwest of the ohio by which the termination of the long expensive and distressing war with those tribes was placed at the option of the united states  a letter from the emperor of morocco recognizing a treaty which had been made with his deceased father insured the continuance of peace with that power  the terms of a treaty with the dey and regency of algiers had been adjusted in a manner to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace in that quarter and the liberation of a number of american citizens from a long and grievous captivity  a speedy and satisfactory conclusion was anticipated of a negotiation with the court of madrid which would lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship said washington we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cherish  adverting to the treaty with great britain and its conditional ratification the result on the part of his britannic majesty was yet unknown but when ascertained would immediately be placed before congress  in regard to internal affairs every part of the union gave indications of rapid and various improvement with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived with resources fully adequate to present exigencies with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty and with mild and wholesome laws was it too much to say that our country exhibited a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed if ever before equalled  there was as usual a cordial answer from the senate but in the present house of representatives as in the last one the opposition were in the majority in the response reported by a committee one clause expressing undiminished confidence in the chief magistrate was demurred to some members affirmed that with them it had been considerably diminished by a late transaction after a warm altercation to avoid a direct vote the response was recommitted and the clause objected to modified the following is the form adopted in contemplating that spectacle of national happiness which our country exhibits and of which you sir have been pleased to make an interesting summary permit us to acknowledge and declare the very great share which your zealous and faithful services have contributed to it and to express the affectionate attachment which we feel for your character  in february the treaty with great britain as modified by the advice of the senate came back ratified by the king of great britain and on the last of the month a proclamation was issued by the president declaring it to be the supreme law of the land  the opposition in the house of representatives were offended that washington should issue this proclamation before the sense of that body had been taken on the subject and denied the power of the president and senate to complete a treaty without its sanction they were bent on defeating it by refusing to pass the laws necessary to carry it into effect and as a preliminary passed a resolution requesting the president to lay before the house the instruction to mr jay and the correspondence and other documents relative to the treaty  washington believing that these papers could not be constitutionally demanded resolved he said from the first moment and from the fullest conviction of his mind to resist the principle which was evidently intended to be established by the call of the house he only deliberated on the manner in which this could be done with the least bad consequences after mature deliberation and with the assistance of the heads of departments and the attorneygeneral he prepared and sent in to the house an answer to their request in this he dwelt upon the necessity of caution and secrecy in foreign negotiations as one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties in the president with the advice and consent of the senate the principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number of members to admit a right in the house of representatives to demand and have all the papers respecting a foreign negotiation would he observed be to establish a dangerous precedent  after various further remarks he concludes as therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding that the assent of the house of representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty as the treaty with great britain exhibits itself in all the objects requiring legislative provision and on these the papers called for can throw no light and as it is essential to the due administration of the government that the boundaries fixed by the constitution between the different departments should be observed a just regard to the constitution and to the duty of my office under all the circumstances of this case forbid a compliance with your request  a resolution to make provision for carrying the treaty into effect gave rise to an animated and protracted debate meanwhile the whole country became agitated on the subject meetings were held throughout the united states and it soon became apparent that the popular feeling was with the minority in the house of representatives who favored the making of the necessary appropriations the public will prevailed and on the last day of april the resolution was passed though by a close vote of fiftyone to fortyeight  for some months past mr thomas pinckney had been solicitous to be relieved from his post of ministerplenipotentiary at london but the doubtful issue of the above dispute and the difficulty of finding a fit substitute for him had caused delay in the matter such a man at length presented in mr rufus king of new york mr king was nominated to the senate on the 19th of may and his nomination was confirmed on the 1st of june this session of congress terminated  shortly after the recess of congress another change was made in the foreign diplomacy mr monroe when sent envoy to france had been especially instructed to explain the views and conduct of the united states in forming the treaty with england and had been amply furnished with documents for the purpose from his own letters however it appeared that he had omitted to use them whether this rose from undue attachment to france from mistaken notions of american interests or from real dislike to the treaty the result was the very evil he had been instructed to prevent the french government misconceived the views and conduct of the united states suspected their policy in regard to great britain and when aware that the house of representatives would execute the treaty made by jay became bitter in their resentment symptoms of this appeared in the capture of an american merchantman by a french privateer under these circumstances it was deemed expedient by washington and his cabinet to recall mr monroe and appoint another american citizen in his stead the person chosen was charles cotesworth pinckney of south carolina elder brother of the late minister to london  the period for the presidential election was drawing near and great anxiety began to be felt that washington would consent to stand for a third term no one it was agreed had greater claim to the enjoyment of retirement in consideration of public services rendered but it was thought the affairs of the country would be in a very precarious condition should he retire before the wars of europe were brought to a close  washington however had made up his mind irrevocably on the subject and resolved to announce in a farewell address his intention of retiring such an instrument it will be recollected had been prepared for him from his own notes by mr madison when he had thought of retiring at the end of his first term as he was no longer in confidential intimacy with mr madison he turned to mr hamilton as his adviser and coadjutor and appears to have consulted him on the subject early in the present year  we forbear to go into the vexed question concerning this address how much of it is founded on washingtons original notes and heads of topics how much was elaborated by madison and how much is due to hamiltons recasting and revision the whole came under the supervision of washington and the instrument as submitted to the press was in his handwriting with many ultimate corrections and alterations washington had no pride of authorship his object always was to effect the purpose in hand and for that he occasionally invoked assistance to ensure a plain and clear exposition of his thoughts and intentions the address certainly breathes his spirit throughout is in perfect accordance with his words and actions it was published in september in a philadelphia paper called the daily advertiser  congress formed a quorum on the 5th day of december the first day of the session which succeeded the publication of the farewell address on the 7th washington met the two houses of congress for the last time in his speech he recommended an institution for the improvement of agriculture a military academy a national university and a gradual increase of the navy the disputes with france were made the subject of the following remarks while in our external relations some serious inconveniences and embarrassments have been overcome and others lessened it is with much pain and deep regret i mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive injuries in the west indies from the cruisers and agents of the french republic and communications have been received from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority and which are in other respects far from agreeable it has been my constant sincere and earnest wish in conformity with that of our nation to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly understanding with that republic  in concluding his address he observes the situation in which i now stand for the last time in the midst of the representatives of the people of the united states naturally recalls the period when the administration of the present form of government commenced and i cannot omit the occasion to congratulate you and my country on the success of the experiment nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the supreme ruler of the universe and sovereign arbiter of nations that his providential care may be still extended to the united states that the virtue and happiness of the people may be preserved and that the government which they have instituted for the protection of their liberties may be perpetual  the senate in their reply to the address after concurring in its views of the national prosperity as resulting from the excellence of the constitutional system and the wisdom of the legislative provisions added that they would be deficient in gratitude and justice did they not attribute a great portion of these advantages to the virtue firmness and talents of his administration conspicuously displayed in the most trying times and on the most critical occasions the reply of the house after premising attention to the various subjects recommended to their consideration in the address concluded by a warm expression of gratitude and admiration inspired by the virtues and services of the president by his wisdom firmness moderation and magnanimity and testifying to the deep regret with which they contemplated his intended retirement from office  the reverence and affection expressed for him in both houses of congress and their regret at his intended retirement were in unison with testimonials from various state legislatures and other public bodies which were continually arriving since the publication of his farewell address  during the actual session of congress washington endeavored to prevent the misunderstandings which were in danger of being augmented between the united states and the french government in the preceding month of november mr adet the french minister had addressed a letter to the secretary of state recapitulating the complaints against the government of the united states made by his predecessors and himself denouncing the insidious proclamation of neutrality and the wrongs growing out of it and using language calculated to inflame the partisans of france a copy of which letter had been sent to the press for publication one of the immediate objects he had in view in timing the publication was supposed by washington to be to produce an effect on the presidential election his ultimate object to establish such an influence in the country as to sway the government and control its measures early in january 1797 therefore washington requested mr pickering the secretary of state to address a letter to mr pinckney united states minister to france stating all the complaints alleged by the french minister against the government examining and reviewing the same and accompanying the statement with a collection of letters and papers relating to the transaction therein adverted to the letter to mr pinckney with its accompanying documents was laid before congress on the 19th of january 1797 to be transmitted to that minister  in the month of february the votes taken at the recent election were opened and counted in congress when mr adams having the highest number was declared president and mr jefferson having the next number vicepresident their term of four years to commence on the 4th of march next ensuing  washington now began to count the days and hours that intervened between him and his retirement on the day preceding it he writes to his old fellowsoldier and political coadjutor henry knox to the wearied traveller who sees a resting place and is bending his body to lean thereon i now compare myself the remainder of my life which in the course of nature cannot be long will be occupied in rural amusements and though i shall seclude myself as much as possible from the noisy and bustling world none would more than myself be regaled by the company of those i esteem at mount vernon more than twenty miles from which after i arrive there it is not likely that i shall ever be  on the 3d of march he gave a kind of farewell dinner to the foreign ministers and their wives mr and mrs adams mr jefferson and other conspicuous personages of both sexes during the dinner much hilarity prevailed says bishop white who was present when the cloth was removed washington filled his glass ladies and gentlemen said he this is the last time i shall drink your health as a public man i do it with sincerity wishing you all possible happiness the gayety of the company was checked in an instant all felt the importance of this leavetaking  on the 4th of march an immense crowd had gathered about congress hall at eleven oclock mr jefferson took the oath as vicepresident in the presence of the senate and proceeded with that body to the chamber of the house of representatives which was densely crowded many ladies occupying chairs ceded to them by members after a time washington entered amidst enthusiastic cheers and acclamations and the waving of handkerchiefs  at the close of the ceremony as washington moved toward the door to retire there was a rush from the gallery to the corridor that threatened the loss of life or limb so eager were the throng to catch a last look of one who had so long been the object of public veneration when washington was in the street he waved his hat in return for the cheers of the multitude his countenance radiant with benignity his gray hairs streaming in the wind the crowd followed him to his door there turning round his countenance assumed a grave and almost melancholy expression his eyes were bathed in tears his emotions were too great for utterance and only by gestures could he indicate his thanks and convey his farewell blessing  in the evening a splendid banquet was given to him by the principal inhabitants of philadelphia in the amphitheatre which was decorated with emblematical paintings all the heads of departments the foreign ministers several officers of the late army and various persons of note were present among the paintings one represented the home of his heart the home to which he was about to hastenmount vernon     chapter lxxvi washingtons retirement and death   the limitations of this volume render it necessary to condense the remaining portions of washingtons biography into as few sentences as possible  washingtons official career being terminated he set off for mount vernon accompanied by mrs washington her granddaughter miss nelly custis and george washington lafayette with his preceptor once more at mount vernon that haven of repose to which he had so often turned a wistful eye he surrendered himself to those agricultural and rural pursuits for which he had a fondness he was beset with many visitors and as a relief from some of the duties of hospitality he persuaded his nephew lawrence lewis to become an inmate of mount vernon an attachment grew up between young lewis and miss nelly custis which eventuated in their union  the fate of lafayette who had been thrown into prison at olmutz had awakened the earnest solicitude of washington but in the autumn of this year 1797 letters were received by young lafayette that his father had been released and was on his way to paris george lafayette anxious to join his fathers family immediately sailed from new york with his tutor on the 26th of october  the differences between france and america were now assuming an alarming aspect the french government in the recall of mr monroe had refused to receive his successor in view of this fact and of the capture of american vessels by french cruisers president adams convened an extra session of congress on the 15th of may three special envoys to france were appointed by mr adams who it was hoped would be able to adjust all differences by a treaty between the two powers their mission was unsuccessful the directory now believing that the people of america would not sustain their government in a war against france enacted a law subjecting to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter was of british production although the entire property belonged to neutrals as the united states were at this time the great neutral carriers this decree struck at a vital point in their maritime power when this act became known the spirit of the nation was aroused and war with france seemed inevitable the government resolved on vigorous measures the president was authorized to enlist ten thousand men and the senate nominated washington commanderinchief of all the armies raised or to be raised the secretary of war bore the commission to washington in person who accepted the commission with great reluctance with the condition that he should not be called into the field until the army was in a situation to require his presence hamilton pinckney and knox were appointed majorgenerals knox indignant at being placed below those who were his juniors in the war of the revolution refused to serve  these military measures soon had their effect on french policy president adams received intimations that whatever plenipotentiary the united states might send to france to put an end to the existing differences between the two countries would be received with the respect due to the representative of a free independent and powerful nation mr adams glad to escape from his belligerent difficulties laid these facts before the senate on the 18th of february 1799 and nominated mr murray as envoy oliver ellsworth and mr davie were ultimately associated with him in the mission they sailed on the 3d of the following november  washington continued to superintend from a distance the concerns of the army as his ample and minute correspondence manifests and he was at the same time earnestly endeavoring to bring the affairs of his rural domain into order it was a period of incessant activity and toil therefore both mental and bodily he was for hours in his study occupied with his pen and for hours on horseback riding the rounds of his extensive estate visiting the various farms and superintending the works in operation all this he did with unfailing vigor though now in his sixtyseventh year  winter had now set in with occasional wind and rain and frost yet washington still kept up his active round of indoor and outdoor avocations as his diary records he was in full health and vigor dined out occasionally and had frequent guests at mount vernon for some time past he had been occupied in digesting a complete system on which his estate was to be managed for several succeeding years specifying the cultivation of the several farms with tables designating the rotations of the crops it occupied thirty folio pages and was executed with that clearness and method which characterized all his business papers this was finished on the 10th of december and was accompanied by a letter of that date to his manager or steward  according to his diary the morning on which these voluminous instructions to his steward were dated was clear and calm but the afternoon was lowering the next day 11th he notes that there was wind and rain and at night a large circle round the moon the morning of the 12th was overcast about ten oclock he mounted his horse and rode out as usual to make the rounds of the estate the ominous ring round the moon which he had observed on the preceding night proved a fatal portent about one oclock he notes it began to snow soon after to hail and then turned to a settled cold rain having on an overcoat he continued his ride without regarding the weather and did not return to the house until after three his secretary approached him with letters to be franked that they might be taken to the postoffice in the evening washington franked the letters but observed that the weather was too bad to send a servant out with them mr lear perceived that snow was hanging from his hair and expressed fears that he had got wet but he replied no his great coat had kept him dry as dinner had been waiting for him he sat down to table without changing his dress in the evening writes his secretary he appeared as well as usual  on the following morning the snow was three inches deep and still falling which prevented him from taking his usual ride he complained of a sore throat and had evidently taken cold the day before in the afternoon the weather cleared up and he went out on the grounds between the house and the river to mark some trees which were to be cut down a hoarseness which had hung about him through the day grew worse towards night but he made light of it he was very cheerful in the evening as he sat in the parlor with mrs washington and mr lear amusing himself with the papers which had been brought from the postoffice  on retiring to bed mr lear suggested that he should take something to relieve the cold no replied he you know i never take anything for a cold let it go as it came in the night he was taken extremely ill with ague and difficulty of breathing between two and three oclock in the morning he awoke mrs washington who would have risen to call a servant but he would not permit her lest she should take cold at daybreak when the servant woman entered to make a fire she was sent to call mr lear he found the general breathing with difficulty and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly washington desired that dr craik who lived in alexandria should be sent for and that in the meantime rawlins one of the overseers should be summoned to bleed him before the doctor could arrive  a gargle was prepared for his throat but whenever he attempted to swallow any of it he was convulsed and almost suffocated rawlins made his appearance soon after sunrise but when the generals arm was ready for the operation became agitated dont be afraid said the general as well as he could speak rawlins made an incision the orifice is not large enough said washington the blood however ran pretty freely and mrs washington uncertain whether the treatment was proper and fearful that too much blood might be taken begged mr lear to stop it when he was about to untie the string the general put up his hand to prevent him and as soon as he could speak murmured moremore but mrs washingtons doubts prevailed and the bleeding was stopped after about half a pint of blood had been taken external applications were now made to the throat and his feet were bathed in warm water but without affording any relief his old friend dr craik arrived between eight and nine and two other physicians drs dick and brown were called in various remedies were tried and additional bleeding but all of no avail  about halfpast four oclock writes mr lear he desired me to call mrs washington to his bedside when he requested her to go down into his room and take from his desk two wills which she would find there and bring them to him which she did upon looking at them he gave her one which he observed was useless as being superseded by the other and desired her to burn it which she did and took the other and put it into her closet  in the course of the afternoon he appeared to be in great pain and distress from the difficulty of breathing and frequently changed his posture in the bed about five oclock his old friend dr craik came again into the room and approached the bedside doctor said the general i die hard but i am not afraid to go i believed from my first attack that i should not survive itmy breath cannot last long the doctor pressed his hand in silence retired from the bedside and sat by the fire absorbed in grief  between five and six the other physicians came in and he was assisted to sit up in his bed i feel i am going said he i thank you for your attentions but i pray you to take no more trouble about me let me go off quietly i cannot last long he lay down again all retired excepting dr craik the general continued uneasy and restless but without complaining frequently asking what hour it was further remedies were tried without avail in the evening he took whatever was offered him did as he was desired by the physicians and never uttered sigh or complaint  about ten minutes before he expired which was between ten and eleven oclock mr lear further writes his breathing became easier he lay quietly he withdrew his hand from mine and felt his own pulse i saw his countenance change i spoke to dr craik who sat by the fire he came to the bedside the generals hand fell from his wrist i took it in mine and pressed it to my bosom dr craik put his hands over his eyes and he expired without a struggle or a sigh  we add from mr lears account a few particulars concerning the funeral the old family vault on the estate had been opened the rubbish cleared away and a door made to close the entrance which before had been closed with brick the funeral took place on the 18th of december about eleven oclock the people of the neighborhood began to assemble the corporation of alexandria with the militia and freemasons of the place and eleven pieces of cannon arrived at a later hour a schooner was stationed off mount vernon to fire minute guns about three oclock the procession began to move passing out through the gate at the left wing of the house proceeding round in front of the lawn and down to the vault on the right wing of the house minute guns being fired at the time the troops horse and foot formed the escort then came four of the clergy then the generals horse with his saddle holsters and pistols led by two grooms in black the body was borne by the freemasons and officers several members of the family and old friends among the number dr craik and some of the fairfaxes followed as chief mourners the corporation of alexandria and numerous private persons closed the procession the rev mr davis read the funeral service at the vault and pronounced a short address after which the masons performed their ceremonies and the body was deposited in the vault  on opening the will which he had handed to mrs washington shortly before his death it was found to have been carefully drawn up by himself in the preceding july and by an act in conformity with his whole career one of its first provisions directed the emancipation of his slaves on the decease of his wife it had long been his earnest wish that the slaves held by him in his own right should receive their freedom during his life but he had found that it would be attended with insuperable difficulties on account of their intermixture by marriage with the dower negroes whom it was not in his power to manumit under the tenure by which they were held with provident benignity he also made provision in his will for such as were to receive their freedom under this devise but who from age bodily infirmities or infancy might be unable to support themselves and he expressly forbade under any pretence whatsoever the sale or transportation out of virginia of any slave of whom he might die possessed  a deep sorrow spread over the nation on hearing that washington was no more congress which was in session immediately adjourned for the day the next morning it was resolved that the speakers chair be shrouded with black that the members and officers of the house wear black during the session and that a joint committee of both houses be appointed to consider on the most suitable manner of doing honor to the memory of the man first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his fellowcitizens  public testimonials of grief and reverence were displayed in every part of the union nor were these sentiments confined to the united states when the news of washingtons death reached england lord bridport who had command of a british fleet of nearly sixty sail of the line lying at torbay lowered his flag halfmast every ship following the example and bonaparte first consul of france on announcing his death to the army ordered that black crape should be suspended from all the standards and flags throughout the public service for ten days  the character of washington may want some of those poetical elements which dazzle and delight the multitude but
