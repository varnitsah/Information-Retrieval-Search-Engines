98304973	personal narrative of a pilgrimage to almadinah  meccah  by  captain sir richard f burton  kcmg frgs c c c  edited by his wife isabel burton  our notions of mecca must be drawn from the arabians as no unbeliever is permitted to enter the city our travellers are silentgibbon chap 50  memorial edition  in two volumes  volume i  pxii arabic text  dark and the desert and destriers me ken and the glaive and the joust and paper and pen  almutanabbi  pxv  preface to the memorial edition  after my beloved husband had passed away from amongst us after the funeral had taken place and i had settled in england i began to think in what way i could render him the most honour a material monument to his memory has already been erected by his countrymen in the shape of a handsome contribution to the beautiful mausoleumtent in stone and marble to contain his remains but i also hoped to erect a less material but more imperishable monument to his name by making this unique hero better known to his countrymen by his works which have hitherto not been sufficiently known not extensively enough published and issued perhaps at a prohibitive price viewing the long list of works written by him between 1842 and 1890 many of which are still unpublished i was almost disheartened by the magnitude of the work until the publishers messrs tylston and edwards fully appreciating the interest with which the british public had followed my husbands adventurous career and fearless enterprise arranged to produce this uniform memorial edition at their own expense  pxvimr leonard smithers a man of great literary talent and of indefatigable energy who admired and collaborated with my husband in the traduction of latin classics for two years before he died has also kindly volunteered to be my working assistant and to join with me in the editing  my part is to give up all my copyrights and to search out such papers annotations and latest notes and corrections as will form the most complete work also to write all the prefaces and to give every assistance in my power as editress  the memorial edition commences with the present pilgrimage to almadinah and meccah which will be followed at intervals by others of my husbands works since this memorial edition was arranged and the prospectus issued i have parted with the copyright of my husbands famous translation of the arabian nights to the publishers and they are arranging to bring out that work at an early date and as nearly as possible uniform in appearance with the memorial edition  the ornamentations on the binding are a figure of my husband in his arab costume his monogram in arabic and on the back of the book the tent which is his tomb  both the publishers and myself have to thank mr smithers for the infinite trouble he has taken in collating the first second third and fourth editions of the ‘pilgrimage with sir richards own original annotated copies all the lengthy notes and appendices of the first edition have been retained and these are supplemented by the notes and appendices in the later editions as well as by the authors ms notes he has adopted sir richards latest and  pxviimost correct orthography of arabic words and has passed the sheets through the press following my husbands plan in the thousand nights and a night he has put the accents on arabic words only the first time of their appearance to show how they ought to be thinking it unnecessary to preserve throughout what is an eyesore to the reader and a distress to the printer so it is with arabic booksthe accents are only put for the early student afterwards they are left to the practical knowledge of the reader all the original coloured illustrations of the first edition and also the wood engravings of the later issues are reproduced for the first time in one uniform edition the map and plans are facsimilies of those in the latest fourth edition in fact everything has been done to make this book worthy of its author and of the publics appreciation  for those who may not know the import of a pilgrimage to almadinah and meccah in 1853 they will not take it amiss when i say that there are holy shrines of the moslem world in the faraway desert where no white man european or christian could enter save as a moslem or even approach without certain death they are more jealously guarded than the holy grail and this work narrates how this pilgrimage was accomplished my husband had lived as a dervish in sind which greatly helped him and he studied every separate thing until he was master of it even apprenticing himself to a blacksmith to learn how to make horseshoes and to shoe his own horses it meant living with his life in his hand amongst the strangest and wildest companions adopting their unfamiliar manners living for nine months in the hottest and most unhealthy climate upon  pxviiirepulsive food it meant complete and absolute isolation from everything that makes life tolerable from all civilisation from all his natural habits the brain at high tension but the mind never wavering from the role he had adopted but he liked it he was happy in it he felt at home in it and in this book he tells you how he did it and what he saw  sir richard burton died at the age of 70 on the 20th october 1890 during the last 48 years of his life he lived only for the benefit and for the welfare of england and of his countrymen and of the human race at large let us reverently raise up this monument aere perennius to his everlasting memory  isabel burton may 24 1893  pxixpreface to the third edition  after a lapse of twentyfive years a third edition of my pilgrimage has been called for by the public to whom i take this opportunity of returning thanks messrs mullan have chosen the very best opportunity my two publications concerning the khedival expeditions to midian the gold mines of midian and the land of midian revisited are as i have stated in the preface sequels and continuations of this pilgrimage from which the adventures forming their subject may be said to date  the text has been carefully revised and the baggage of notes has been materially lightenedfn1 from the appendix i have removed matter which though useful to the student is of scant general interest the quaint and interesting narrative and voyages of ludovicus vertomannus gentleman of rome need no longer be read in extracts when the whole has been printed by the hakluyt society the travels of ludovico di varthema in egypt syria arabia deserta and arabia felix in persia india and ethiopia ad 1503 to 1508 translated from the original italian edition of 1510 with a preface by john winter jones esq fsa and edited  pxxwith notes and an introduction by george percy badger late government chaplain in the presidency of bombay london on the other hand i have inserted after the appendix with the permission of the author two highly interesting communications from dr aloys sprenger the wellknown orientalist and arabist concerning the routes of the great caravans my friend supports his suspicions that an error of direction has been made and geographers will enjoy the benefit of his conscientious studies topographical and linguistic  the truculent attacks made upon pilgrims and darwayshes call for a few words of notice even that learned and amiable philanthropist the late dr john wilson of bombay lands of the bible vol ii p 302 alludes in the case of the spaniard badia alias ali bey alabbasi to the unjustifiable fanciful disguise of a mohammedan pilgrim the author of the ruddy goose theory voice of israel from mount sinai and compiler of the historical geography of arabia has dealt a foul blow to the memory of burckhardt the energetic and inoffensive swiss traveller whose name has ever been held in the highest repute and now the government chaplain indites introduction p xxvii the following invidious remarks touching the travels of ludovico di varthemathe vir deo carus be it remarked of the learned and laical julius caesar scaliger  this is not the place to discuss the morality of an act involving the deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a matter so sacred as that of religion such a violation of conscience is not justifiable by the end which the renegade  may have in view however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false the conclusion is inevitable that nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith or a  pxxiconscientious disbelief in them can fairly relieve the christian who conforms to islamism without a corresponding persuasion of its verity of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy  the reply to this tirade is simply judge not especially when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging perhaps also the writer may ask himself is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility the second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it the author of the narrative of a years journey through central and eastern arabia vol i pp 25859 thus expresses his opinions  passing oneself off for a wandering darweesh as some european explorers have attempted to do in the east is for more reasons than one a very bad plan it is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the proceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds to feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe to perform with scrupulous exactitude as of the highest and holiest import practices which he inwardly ridicules and which he intends on his return to hold up to the ridicule of others to turn for weeks and months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery not to mention other and yet darker touchesall this seems hardly compatible with the character of a european gentleman let alone that of a christian  this comes admirably a propos from a traveller who born a protestant of jewish descent placed himself in connection with in plain words took the vows of the order of the jesuits an order wellknown in the annals of philanthropic daring a popular preacher who declaimed openly at bayrut and elsewhere against his own nation till the proceedings of a certain father michael  pxxiicohen were made the subject of an official report by mr consulgeneral moore bayrut november 11 1857 an englishman by birth who accepted french protection a secret mission and the liberality of the present emperor of the french a military officer travelling in the garb of what he calls a native syrian quack with a comrade who by a slight but necessary fiction passed for his brotherinlawfn2 a gentleman who by return to protestantism violated his vows and a traveller who was proved by the experiment of colonel now sir lewis pelly to have brought upon himself all the perils and adventures that have caused his charming work to be considered so little worthy of trust truly such attack argues a sublime daring it is the principle of vieille coquette nouvelle devote it is satan preaching against sin both writers certainly lack the giftie to see themselves as others see them  in noticing these extracts my object is not to defend myself i recognize no mans right to interfere between a human being and his conscience but what is there i would ask in the moslem pilgrimage so offensive to christianswhat makes it a subject of inward ridicule do they not also venerate abraham the father of the faithful did not locke and even greater names hold mohammedans to be heterodox christians in fact arians who till the end of the fourth century represented the mass of northeuropean christianity did mr lane neverconform by praying at a mosque in cairo did he ever fear to confess it has he been called an apostate for so doing did not father michael cohen prove himself an excellent moslem at wahhabiland  the fact is there are honest men who hold that alislam  pxxiiiin its capital tenets approaches much nearer to the faith of jesus than do the pauline and athanasian modifications which in this our day have divided the indoeuropean mind into catholic and roman greek and russian lutheran and anglican the disciples of dr daniel schenkels school a sketch of the character of jesus longmans 1869 will indeed find little difficulty in making this admission practically a visit after arab meccah to angleindian aden with its priests after the order of melchisedeck suggested to me that the moslem may be more tolerant more enlightened more charitable than many societies of selfstyled christians  and why rage so furiously against the disguise of a wandering darwaysh in what point is the darwaysh more a mummer or in what does he show more of betise than the quack is the darwaysh anything but an oriental freemason and are freemasons less christians because they pray with moslems and profess their belief in simple unitarianism  i have said and now to conclude  after my return to europe many inquired if i was not the only living european who has found his way to the head quarters of the moslem faith i may answer in the affirmative so far at least that when entering the penetralia of moslem life my eastern origin was never questioned and my position was never what cagots would describe as in loco apostatae  on the other hand any jew christian or pagan after declaring before the kazi and the police authorities at cairo or even at damascus that he embraces alislam may perform without fear of the socalled mosaic institution alsunnah his pilgrimage in all safety it might be dangerous to travel down the desertline between meccah and almadinah during times of popular excitement but the coast route is always safe to the new moslem however the old moslem is rarely  pxxiv well affected and the former as a rule returns home unpleasantly impressed by his experiences  the eastern world moves slowlyeppur si muove half a generation ago steamers were first started to jeddah now we hear of a projected railroad from that port to meccah the shareholders being all moslems and the example of jerusalem encourages us to hope that long before the end of the century a visit to meccah will not be more difficult than a trip to hebron  ziyadeh haddiadab  richard f burton  london 31st march 1879   arabic text  pxxvpreface to the first edition  the interest just now felt in everything that relates to the east would alone be sufficient to ensure to the author of el medinah and meccah the favourable consideration of the reading public but when it is borne in mind that since the days of william pitts of exeter ad 16781688 no european travellers with the exception of burckhardtfn3 and lieut burtonfn4 have been able to send us back an account of their travels there it cannot be doubted but that the present work will be hailed as a welcome addition to our knowledge of these hitherto mysterious penetralia of mohammedan superstition in fact el madinah may be considered almost a virgin theme for as burckhardt was prostrated by sickness throughout the period of his stay in the northern hejaz he was not able to describe it as satisfactorily or minutely as he did the southern countryhe could not send a plan of the mosque or correct the popular but erroneous ideas which prevail concerning it and the surrounding city  the reader may question the propriety of introducing  pxxviin a work of description anecdotes which may appear open to the charge of triviality the authors object however seems to be to illustrate the peculiarities of the peopleto dramatise as it were the dry journal of a journeyand to preserve the tone of the adventures together with that local colouring in which mainly consists leducation dun voyage for the same reason the prayers of the visitation ceremony have been translated at length despite the danger of inducing tedium they are an essential part of the subject and cannot be omitted nor be represented by specimens  the extent of the appendix requires some explanation few but literati are aware of the existence of lodovico bartemas naive recital of the quaint narrative of jos pitts or of the wild journal of giovanni finati such extracts have been now made from these writers that the general reader can become acquainted with the adventures and opinions of the different travellers who have visited el hejaz during a space of 350 years thus with the second volume of burckhardts travels in arabia the geographer curious concerning this portion of the moslems holy land possesses all that has as yet been written upon the subject  the editor to whom the author in his absence has intrusted his work had hoped to have completed it by the simultaneous publication of the third volume containing the pilgrimage to meccah the delay however in the arrival from india of this portion of the ms has been such as to induce him at once to publish el misr and el medinah the concluding volume on meccah is now in the hands of the publisher and will appear in the autumn of the present year meanwhile the public will not lose sight of the subject of arabia part of el hejaz has lately been inspected by m charles didier an eminent name in french literature and by the abbe hamiltonpersuaded it is believed by our author to  pxxviivisit taif and wady laymum though entirely unconnected with the subjects of meccah and el medinah the account of the sherifs court where these gentlemen were received with distinction and of the almost unknown regions about jebel kora will doubtless be welcomed by the orientalists and geographers of europe  mr burton is already known by his history of sindh and as if to mark their sense of the spirit of observation and daring evinced by him when in that country and still more during his late journeyings in arabia and east africa the geographical society through their learned secretary dr norton shaw have given valuable aid to this work in its progress through the press supplying maps where necessary to complete the illustrations supplied by the authorwho it will be perceived is himself no mean draughtsman  it was during a residence of many years in india that mr burton had fitted himself for his late undertaking by acquiring through his peculiar aptitude for such studies a thorough acquaintance with various dialects of arabia and persia and indeed his eastern cast of features vide frontispiece vol ii seemed already to point him out as the very person of all others best suited for an expedition like that described in the following pages  it will be observed that in writing arabic hindoostannee persian or turkish words the author has generally adopted the system proposed by sir william jones and modified by later orientalistsfn5 but when a word like fatihah for fathah has been stamped by general popular use the conversational form has been  pxxviiipreferred and the same too may be said of the common corruptions cairo kadi c which in any other form would appear to us pedantic and ridiculous still in the absence of the author it must be expected that some trifling errors and inaccuracies will have here and there have crept in in justice to others and himself the editor however feels bound to acknowledge with much gratitude that where such or even greater mistakes have been avoided it has been mainly due to the continued kindness of an eastern scholar of more than european reputationwho has assisted in revising the sheets before finally consigning them to the printer  let us hope that the proofs now furnished of untiring energy and capacity for observation and research by our author as well as his ability to bear fatigue and exposure to the most inclement climate will induce the governments of this country and of india to provide him with men and means evidently all that is required for the purpose to pursue his adventurous and useful career in other countries equally difficult of access and if possible of still greater interest than the eastern shores of the red sea  thomas l wolley  hampton court palace  june 1855  pxxix to colonel william sykes frsoc mrgsoc mrasoc  and lord rector of the marischal college aberdeen  i do not parade your

geographical society of london for the purpose of removing that opprobrium to modern adventure the huge white blot which in our maps still notes the eastern and the central regions of arabia sir roderick i murchison colonel p yorke and dr shaw a deputation from that distinguished body with their usual zeal for discovery and readiness to encourage the discoverer honoured me by warmly supporting in a personal interview with the then chairman of the then court of directors to the then honourable east india company my application for three years leave of absence on special duty from india to maskat but they were unable to prevail upon the said chairman the late sir james hogg whofn1 remembering the fatalities which of late years have befallen sundry soldiertravellers in the east refused his sanction alleging as a reasonfn1  p2that the contemplated journey was of too dangerous a nature in compensation however for the disappointment i was allowed the additional furlough of a year in order to pursue my arabic studies in lands where the language is best learned  what remained for me but to prove by trial that what might be perilous to other travellers was safe to me the experimentum crucis was a visit to alhijaz at once the most difficult and the most dangerous point by which a european can enter arabia i had intended had the period of leave originally applied for been granted to land at maskata favourable startingplaceand there to apply myself slowly and surely to the task of spanning the deserts but now i was to hurry in the midst of summer after a four years sojourn in europe during which many things oriental had faded away from my memory andafter passing through the ordeal of egypt a country where the police is curious as in rome or milanto begin with the moslems holy land the jealously guarded and exclusive harim however being liberally supplied with the means of travel by the royal geographical society thoroughly tired of progress and of civilisation curious to see with my eyes what others are content to hear with ears namely moslem inner life in a really mohammedan country and longing if truth be told to set foot on that mysterious spot which no vacation tourist has yet described measured sketched and photographed i resolved to resume my old character of a persian wandererfn2 a darwaysh and to make the attempt  p3the principal object with which i started was this to cross the unknown arabian peninsula in a direct line from either almadinah to maskat or diagonally from meccah to makallah on the indian ocean by what circumstance the miscreator my plans were defeated the reader will discover in the course of these volumes the secondary objects were numerous i was desirous to find out if any market for horses could be opened between central arabia and india where the studs were beginning to excite general dissatisfaction to obtain information concerning the great eastern wilderness the vast expanse marked ruba alkhai the empty abode in our maps to inquire into the hydrography of the hijaz its watershed the disputed slope of the country and the existence or nonexistence of perennial streams and finally to try by actual observation the truth of a theory proposed by colonel w sykes namely that if tradition be true in the population of the vast peninsula there must exist certain physiological differences sufficient to warrant our questioning the common origin of the arab family as regards horses i am satisfied that from the eastern coast something might be donenothing on the western where the animals though thoroughbred are mere weeds of a foolish price and procurable only by chance of the ruba alkhali i have heard enough from credible relators to conclude that its horrid depths swarm with a large and halfstarving population that it abounds in wadys valleys gullies and ravines partially fertilised by intermittent torrents and therefore that the land is open to the adventurous traveller moreover i am satisfied that in spite of all geographers from ptolemy to jomard arabia which abounds in fiumarasfn3 possesses not  p4a single perennial stream worthy the name of riverfn4 and the testimony of the natives induces me to think with wallin contrary to ritter and others that the peninsula falls instead of rising towards the south finally i have found proof to be produced in a future part of this publication for believing in three distinct races 1 the aborigines of the country driven like the bhils and other autochthonic indians into the eastern and southeastern wilds bordering upon the ocean 2 a syrian or mesopotamian stock typified by shem and joktan that drove the indigenae from the choicest tracts of country these invaders still enjoy their conquests representing the great arabian people and 3 an impure syroegyptian clanwe personify it by ishmael by his son nabajoth and by edom esau the son of isaacthat populated and still populates the sinaitic peninsula and in most places even in the heart of meccah i met with debris of heathenry proscribed by mohammed yet still popular while the ignorant observers of the old customs assign to them a modern and a rationalistic origin  i have entitled this account of my summers tour through alhijaz a personal narrative and i have laboured to make its nature correspond with its name simply because it is the personal that interests mankind many may not follow my examplefn5 but some  p5perchance will be curious to see what measures i adopted in order to appear suddenly as an eastern upon the stage of oriental life and as the recital may be found useful by future adventurers i make no apology for the egotistical semblance of the narrative those who have felt the want of some silent friend to aid them with advice when it must not be asked will appreciate what may appear to the uninterested critic mere outpourings of a mind full of selffn6  on the evening of april 3 1853 i left london for southampton by the advice of a brother officer captain now colonel henry grindlay of the bengal cavalrylittle thought at that time the adviser or the advised how valuable was the suggestionmy eastern dress was called into requisition before leaving town and all my impedimenta were taught to look exceedingly oriental early the next day a persian prince accompanied by captain grindlay embarked on board the peninsular and oriental companys magnificent screw steamer bengal  p6a fortnight was profitably spent in getting into the train of oriental manners for what polite chesterfield says of the difference between a gentleman and his reversenamely that both perform the same offices of life but each in a several and widely different wayis notably as applicable to the manners of the eastern as of the western man look for instance at that indian moslem drinking a glass of water with us the operation is simple enough but his performance includes no fewer than five novelties in the first place he clutches his tumbler as though it were the throat of a foe secondly he ejaculates in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful before wetting his lips thirdly he imbibes the contents swallowing them not sipping them as he ought to do and ending with a satisfied grunt fourthly before setting down the cup he sighs forth praise be to allahof which you will understand the full meaning in the desert and fifthly he replies may allah make it pleasant to thee in answer to his friends polite pleasurably and health also he is careful to avoid the irreligious action of drinking the pure element in a standing position mindful however of the three recognised exceptions the fluid of the holy well zemzem water distributed in charity and that which remains after wuzu the lesser ablution moreover in europe where both extremities are used indiscriminately one forgets the exclusive use of the right hand the manipulation of the rosary the abuse of the chairyour genuine oriental gathers up his legs looking almost as comfortable in it as a sailor upon the back of a hightrotting the rolling gait with the toes straight to the front the grave look and the habit of pious ejaculations  our voyage over the summer sea was eventless in a steamer of two or three thousand tons you discover  p7the once dreaded now contemptible stormy waters only by the banda standing nuisance be it remarkedperforming  there we lay all the day in the bay of biscay o  the sight of glorious trafalgarfn7 excites none of the sentiments with which a tedious sail used to invest it gib is probably better known to you by theophile gautier and eliot warburton than the regions about cornhill besides which you anchor under the rock exactly long enough to land and to breakfast malta too wears an old familiar face which bids you order a dinner and superintend the iceing of claret beginning of oriental barbarism instead of galloping about on donkeyback through fiery air in memory of st paul and whitecross knights but though our journey might be called monotonous there was nothing to complain of the ship was in every way comfortable the cook strange to say was good and the voyage lasted long enough and not too long on the evening of the thirteenth day after our start the bigtrowsered pilot so lovely in his deformities to western eyes made his appearance and the good screw bengal found herself at anchor off the headland of clayfn8  having been invited to start from the house of a kind friend john w larking i disembarked with him and  p8rejoiced to see that by dint of a beard and a shaven head i had succeeded like the lord of geesh in misleading the inquisitive spirit of the populace the mingled herd of spectators before whom we passed in review on the landingplace hearing an audible alhamdolillahfn9 whispered muslim the infant population spared me the compliments usually addressed to hatted heads and when a little boy presuming that the occasion might possibly open the hand of generosity looked in my face and exclaimed bakhshishfn10 he obtained in reply a mafishfn11 which convinced the bystanders that the sheepskin covered a real sheep we then mounted a carriage fought our way through the donkeys and in half an hour found ourselves chibuk in mouth and coffeecup in hand seated on the diwan of my friend larkings hospitable home  wonderful was the contrast between the steamer and that villa on the mahmudiyah canal startling the sudden change from presto to adagio life in thirteen days we had passed from the clammy grey fog that atmosphere  p9of industry which kept us at anchor off the isle of wight through the loveliest air of the inland sea whose sparkling blue and purple haze spread charms even on n africas beldame features and now we are sitting silent and still listening to the monotonous melody of the eastthe soft nightbreeze wandering through starlit skies and tufted trees with a voice of melancholy meaning  and this is the arabs kayf the savouring of animal existence the passive enjoyment of mere sense the pleasant languor the dreamy tranquillity the airy castlebuilding which in asia stand in lieu of the vigorous intensive passionate life of europe it is the result of a lively impressible excitable nature and exquisite sensibility of nerve it argues a facility for voluptuousness unknown to northern regions where happiness is placed in the exertion of mental and physical powers where ernst ist das leben where niggard earth commands ceaseless sweat of face and damp chill air demands perpetual excitement exercise or change or adventure or dissipation for want of something better in the east man wants but rest and shade upon the banks of a bubbling stream or under the cool shelter of a perfumed tree he is perfectly happy smoking a pipe or sipping a cup of coffee or drinking a glass of sherbet but above all things deranging body and mind as little as possible the trouble of conversations the displeasures of memory and the vanity of thought being the most unpleasant interruptions to his kayf no wonder that kayf is a word untranslatable in our mothertonguefn12  laudabunt alii claram rhodon aut mytelenen  let others

recollections of religious ablutions read the koran and again became an adept in the art of prostration my leisure hours were employed in visiting the baths and coffeehouses in attending the bazars

made in fact in pitting your patience against that of your adversary the vendor i found time for a short excursion to a country village on the banks of the canal nor was an opportunity of seeing

bones have been found for him alexandria also boasts of two celebrated walisholy men one is mohammed albusiri the author of a poem called alburdah universally read by the world of islam and locally recited at funerals and on other solemn occasions the other is abu abbas alandalusi a sage and saint of the first water at whose tomb prayer is never breathed in vain  it is not to be supposed that the people of alexandria could look upon my phials and pillboxes without a yearning for their contents an indian doctor too was a novelty to them franks they despisedbut a man who had come so far from east and west then there was something infinitely seducing in the character of a magician doctor and fakir each admirable of itself thus combined to make great medicine men women and children besieged my door by which means i could see the people face to face and especially the fair sex of which europeans generally speaking know only the worst specimens even respectable natives after witnessing a performance of mandal and the magic mirrorfn19 opined that the stranger was a holy man gifted  p13with supernatural powers and knowing everything one old person sent to offer me his daughter in marriage he said nothing about dowrybut i thought proper to decline the honour and a middleaged lady proffered me the sum of one hundred piastres nearly one pound sterling if i would stay at alexandria and superintend the restoration of her blind left eye  but the reader must not be led to suppose that i acted carabin or sangrado without any knowledge of my trade from youth i have always been a dabbler in medical and mystical study moreover the practice of physic is comparatively easy amongst dwellers in warm latitudes uncivilised peoples where there is not that complication of maladies which troubles more polished nations and further what simplifies extremely the treatment of the sick in these parts is the undoubted periodicity of disease reducing almost all to one typeaguefn20 many of the complaints of tropical climates as medical men well know display palpably intermittent symptoms little known to colder countries and speaking from individual experience i may safely assert that in all cases of suffering from a wound to ophthalmia this phenomenon has forced itself upon my notice so much by way of excuse i therefore considered myself as well qualified for the work as if i had taken out a buono per lestero diploma at padua and not more likely to do active harm than most of the regularly graduated young surgeons who start to finish themselves upon the frame of the british soldier  after a months hard work at alexandria i prepared to assume the character of a wandering darwaysh after  p14reforming my title from mirzafn21 to shaykh abdullahfn22 a reverend man whose name i do not care to quote some time ago initiated me into his order the kadiriyah under the highsounding name of bismillahshahfn23 and after a due period of probation he graciously elevated me to the proud position of a murshidfn24 or master in the mystic craft i was therefore sufficiently well acquainted with the tenets and practices of these oriental freemasons no character in the moslem world is so proper for disguise as that of the darwaysh it is assumed by all ranks ages and creeds by the nobleman who has been disgraced at court and by the peasant who is too idle to till the ground by dives who is weary of life and by lazarus who begs his bread from door to door further the darwaysh is allowed to ignore ceremony and politeness as one who ceases to appear upon the stage of life he may pray or not marry or remain single as he pleases be respectable in cloth of frieze as in cloth of gold and no one asks himthe chartered vagabond  p15why he comes here or wherefore he goes there he may wend his way on foot alone or ride his arab mare followed by a dozen servants he is equally feared without weapons as swaggering through the streets armed to the teeth the more haughty and offensive he is to the people the more they respect him a decided advantage to the traveller of choleric temperament in the hour of imminent danger he has only to become a maniac and he is safe a madman in the east like a notably eccentric character in the west is allowed to say or do whatever the spirit directs add to this character a little knowledge of medicine a moderate skill in magic and a reputation for caring for nothing but study and books together with capital sufficient to save you from the chance of starving and you appear in the east to peculiar advantage the only danger of the mystic pathfn25 is that the darwayshs ragged coat not unfrequently covers the cutthroat and if seized in the society of such a brother you may reluctantly become his companion under the stick or on the stake for be it known darwayshes are of two orders the sharai or those who conform to religion and the bisharai or luti whose practices are hinted at by their own tradition that he

to send his wife back to her papa and to accompany me in the capacity of private chaplain to the other side of kaf fn3 i politely accepted the bruderschaft but many reasons induced me to decline his society and services in the first place he spoke the detestable egyptian jargon secondly it was but prudent to lose the spoor between alexandria and suez and thirdly my brother had shifting eyes symptoms of fickleness close together indices of cunning a flatcrowned head and large illfitting lips signs which led me to think lightly of his honesty firmness and courage phrenology and physiognomy

sprung up or rather has revived in egypt with peculiar vigourfn4 its good effects claim for it our respect still we cannot but lament its inconvenience by we i mean real easterns as strangerseven those whose beards have whitened in the landknow absolutely nothing of what unfortunate natives must endure i am tempted to subjoin a short  p19sketch of my adventures in search of a tazkirah or passport at alexandria  through ignorance which might have cost me dear but for friend larkings weight with the local authorities i had neglected to provide myself with a passport in england and it was not without difficulty involving much unclean dressing and an unlimited expenditure of broken english that i obtained from hbms consul at alexandria a certificate declaring me to be an indobritish subject named abdullah by profession a doctor aged thirty and not distinguishedat least so the frequent blanks seemed to denoteby any remarkable conformation of eyes nose or cheek for this i disbursed a dollar and here let me record the indignation with which i did it that mighty britainthe mistress of the seasthe ruler of onesixth of mankindshould charge five shillings to pay for the shadow of her protecting wing that i cannot speak my modernised civis sum romanus without putting my hand into my pocket in order that these officers of the great queen may not take too ruinously from a revenue of seventy millions o the meanness of our magnificence the littleness of our greatness  my new passport would not carry me without the zabit or police magistrates countersignature said hbms consul next day i went to the zabit who referred me to the muhafiz governor of alexandria at whose gate i had the honour of squatting at least three hours till a more compassionate clerk vouchsafed the information that the proper place to apply to was the diwan kharijiyah the foreign office thus a second day was utterly lost on the morning of the third i started as directed for the palace which crowns the headland of clay it is a huge and couthless shell of building in parallelogrammic form containing all kinds of public offices in glorious confusion looking with their glaring  p20whitewashed faces upon a central court where a few leafless windwrung trees seem struggling for the breath of life in an eternal atmosphere of claydust and sunblazefn5  the first person i addressed was a kawwasfn6 or police officer who coiled comfortably up in a bit of shade fitting his person like a robe was in full enjoyment of the asiatic kayf having presented the consular certificate and briefly stated the nature of my business i ventured to inquire what was the right course to pursue for a visa  they have little respect for darwayshes it appears at alexandria  madridont know growled the man of authority without moving any thing but the quantity of tongue absolutely necessary for articulation  now there are three ways of treating asiatic officialsby bribe by bullying or by bothering them with a dogged perseverance into attending to you and your concerns the latter is the peculiar province of the poor moreover this time i resolved for other reasons to be patient i repeated my question in almost the same words ruh be off was what i obtained for all reply but this time the questioned went so far as to open his eyes still i stood twirling the paper in my hands and looking very humble and very persevering till a loud ruh ya kalb go o dog converted into a responsive curse the little speech i was preparing about  p21the brotherhood of alislam and the mutual duties obligatory on true believers i then turned away slowly and fiercely for the next thing might have been a cut with the kurbajfn7 and by the hammer of thor british flesh and blood could never have stood that  after which satisfactory scenefor satisfactory it was in one sense proving the complete fitness of the darwayshs costumei tried a dozen other promiscuous sources of informationpolicemen grooms scribes donkeyboys and idlers in general at length wearied of patience i offered a soldier some pinches of tobacco and promised him an oriental sixpence if he would manage the business for me the man was interested by the tobacco and the pence he took my hand and inquiring the while he went along led me from place to place till mounting a grand staircase i stood in the presence of abbas effendi naib or deputy to the governor  it was a little wheyfaced blackbearded turk coiled up in the usual conglomerate posture upon a calicocovered diwan at the end of a long bare large windowed room without deigning even to nod the head which hung over his shoulder with transcendent listlessness and affectation of pride in answer to my salams and benedictions he eyed me with wicked eyes and faintly ejaculated min entfn8 then hearing that i was a darwaysh and doctorhe must be an osmanli voltairean that little turkthe official snorted a contemptuous snort he condescendingly added however that the proper source to seek was taht which meaning simply below conveyed to an utter stranger rather imperfect information from a topographical point of view  at length however my soldier guide found out that  p22a room in the customhouse bore the honourable appellation of foreign office accordingly i went there and after sitting at least a couple of hours at the bolted door in the noonday sun was told with a fury which made me think i had sinned that the officer in whose charge the department was had been presented with an olive branch in the morning and consequently that business was not to be done that day the angryfaced official communicated the intelligence to a large group of anadolian caramanian bosniac and roumelian turkssturdy undersized broadshouldered barelegged splayfooted hornyfisted darkbrowed honestlooking mountaineers who were lounging about with long pistols and yataghans stuck in their broad sashes headgear composed of immense tarbushes with proportionate turbands coiled round them and bearing two or three suits of substantial clothes even at this season of the year upon their shoulders  like myself they had waited some hours but they were not so patient under disappointment they bluntly told the angry official that he and his master were a pair of idlers and the curses that rumbled and gurgled in their hairy throats as they strode towards the door sounded like the growling of wild beasts  thus was another day truly orientally lost on the morrow however i obtained permission in the character of dr abdullah to visit any part of egypt i pleased and to retain possession of my dagger and pistols  and now i must explain what induced me to take so much trouble about a passport the home reader naturally inquires why not travel under your english name  for this reason in the generality of barbarous countries you must either proceed like bruce preserving the dignity of manhood and carrying matters with a high hand or you must worm your way by timidity and  p23subservience in fact by becoming an animal too contemptible for man to let or injure but to pass through the moslems holy land you must either be a born believer or have become one in the former case you may demean yourself as you please in the latter a path is ready prepared for you my spirit could not bend to own myself a burmafn9 a renegadeto be pointed at and shunned and catechised an object of suspicion to the many and of contempt to all moreover it would have obstructed the aim of my wanderings the convert is always watched with argus eyes and men do not willingly give information to a new moslem especially a frank they suspect his conversion to be feigned or forced look upon him as a spy and let him see as little of life as possible firmly as was my heart set upon travelling in arabia by heaven i would have given up the dear project rather than purchase a doubtful and partial success at such a price consequently i had no choice but to appear as a born believer and part of my birthright in that respectable character was toil and trouble in obtaining a tazkirahfn10  then i had to provide myself with certain necessaries for the way these were not numerous the silvermounted dressingbag is here supplied by a rag containing a miswakfn11 or toothstick a bit of soap and a comb wooden for bone and tortoiseshell are not religiously speaking correct equally simple was my wardrobe p24a change or two of clothing it is a great mistake to carry too few clothes and those who travel as orientals should always have at least one very grand suit for use on critical occasions throughout the east a badly dressed man is a pauper and as in england a pauperunless he belongs to an order having a right to be pooris a scoundrel the only article of canteen description was a zemzemiyah a goatskin waterbag which especially when new communicates to its contents a ferruginous aspect and a wholesome though hardly an attractive flavour of tannogelatine this was a necessary to drink out of a tumbler possibly fresh from pigeating lips would have entailed a certain loss of reputation for bedding and furniture i had a coarse persian rugwhich besides being couch acted as chair table and oratorya cottonstuffed chintzcovered pillow a blanket in case of cold and a sheet which did duty for tent and mosquito curtains in nights of heatfn12 as shade is a convenience not always procurable another necessary was a huge cotton umbrella of eastern make brightly yellow suggesting the idea of an overgrown marigold i had also a substantial housewife the gift of a kind relative miss elizabeth stisted it was a roll of canvas carefully soiled and garnished with needles and thread cobblers wax buttons and other such articles these things were most useful in lands where tailors abound not besides which the sight of a man darning his coat or patching his slippers teems with pleasing ideas of humility a daggerfn13 a brass inkstand and penholder  p25stuck in the belt and a mighty rosary which on occasion might have been converted into a weapon of offence completed my equipment i must not omit to mention the proper method of carrying money which in these lands should never be entrusted to box or bag a common cotton purse secured in a breast pocket for egypt now abounds in that civilised animal the pickpocket contained silver pieces and small changefn14 my gold of which i carried twentyfive sovereigns and papers were committed to a substantial leathern belt of maghrabi manufacture made to be strapped round the waist under the dress this is the asiatic method of concealing valuables and one more civilised than ours in the last century when roderic random and his companion sewed their money between the lining and the waistband of their breeches except some loose silver for immediate  p26expense on the road the great inconvenience of the belt is its weight especially where dollars must be carried as in arabia causing chafes and discomfort at night moreover it can scarcely be called safe in dangerous countries wary travellers will adopt surer precautions fn16  a pair of common native khurjin or saddlebags contained my wardrobe the bed was readily rolled up into a bundle and for a medicine chestfn17 i bought a peagreen box with red and yellow flowers capable of standing falls from a camel twice a day  p27the next step was to find out when the local steamer would start for cairo and accordingly i betook myself to the transit office no vessel was advertised i was directed to call every evening till satisfied at last the fortunate event took place a weekly departure which by the bye occurred once every fortnight or so was in orders for the next day i hurried to the office but did not reach it till past noonthe hour of idleness a little dark gentlemanmr greenso formed and dressed as exactly to resemble a liverandtan bullterrier who with his heels on the table was dosing cigar in mouth over the last galignani positively refused after a timefor at first he would not speak at allto let me take my passage till three in the afternoon i inquired when the boat started upon which he referred me as i had spoken bad italian to the advertisement i pleaded inability to read or write whereupon he testily cried alle nove alle noveat nine at nine still appearing uncertain i drove him out of his chair when he rose with a curse and read 8 am an unhappy eastern depending upon what he said would have been precisely one hour too late  thus were we lapsing into the real good old eastindian style of doing business thus angloindicus orders his first clerk to execute some commission the senior having work upon his hands sends a junior the junior finds the sun hot and passes on the word to a peon the peon charges a porter with the errand and the porter quietly sits or doses in his place trusting that fate will bring him out of the scrape but firmly resolved though the shattered globe fall not to stir an inch  the reader i must again express a hope will pardon the length of these descriptionsmy object is to show him how business is carried on in these hot countries business generally for had i been not abdullah the darwaysh but a rich native merchant it would have been  p28the same how many complaints of similar treatment have i heard in different parts of the eastern world and how little can one realise them without having actually experienced the evil for the future i shall never see a nigger squatting away half a dozen mortal hours in a broiling sun patiently waiting for something or for some one without a lively remembrance of my own cooling of the calces at the customhouse of alexandria  at length about the end of may 1853 all was ready not without a feeling of regret i left my little room among the white myrtle blossoms and the rosy oleander flowers with the almond smell i kissed with humble ostentation my good hosts hand in presence of his servantshe had become somewhat unpleasantly anxious of late to induce in me the true oriental feeling by a slight administration of the bastinadoi bade adieu to my patients who now amounted to about fifty shaking hands with all meekly and with religious equality of attention and mounted in a trap which looked like a cross between a wheelbarrow and a dogcart drawn by a kicking jibbing and biting mule i set out for the steamer

passports seems to have been adopted by the egyptians at a very early period its present rigours which have lasted since the european troubles in 1848 and 1849 have a twofold object in the first place to act as a clog upon the dangerous emigrants which germany italy and greece have sent out into the world and secondly to confine the subjects of the present pasha of egypt to their fatherland and the habit of paying taxes the enlightened ruler this was written during the rule of abbas pasha knows his own interests and never willingly parts with a subject liable to cess at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage law we on the other hand in india allow a freedom of emigration in my humble opinion highly injurious to us for not only does this exodus thin the population and tend to impoverish the land it also serves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands at another time i shall discuss this subject more fully fn5 the glare of alexandria has become a matter of fable in the east the stucco employed in overlaying its walls erected by zulkarnayn was so exquisitely tempered and so beautifully polished that the inhabitants in order to protect themselves from blindness

soft wood chewed at one end it is generally used throughout the east where brushes should be avoided as the natives always suspect hogs bristles fn12 almost all easterns sleep under a sheet which becomes a kind of respirator defending them from the dews and mosquitoes by night and the flies by day the rough and ready traveller will learn to follow the example remembering that nature is founder of customs in savage countries whereas amongst the soidisant civilised nature has no deadlier enemy than custom fn13 it is strictly forbidden to carry arms in egypt this however does not prevent their being as necessaryespecially in places like alexandria where greek and italian ruffians aboundas they ever were in rome or leghorn during the glorious times of italian liberty fn14 in the azhar mosque immediately after friday service a fellow once put his hand into my pocket which fact alone is ample evidence of progress fn15 as a general rule always produce when travelling the minutest bit of coin at present however small change is dear in egypt the sarrafs or moneychangers create the dearth in order to claim a high agio the traveller must prepare himself for a most unpleasant task in learning the different varieties of currency which appear all but endless the result of deficiency in the national circulating medium there are however few copper coins the pieces of ten or five faddah or parahs whereas silver and gold abound as regards the latter metal strangers should mistrust all small pieces turkish as well as egyptian the greater part are either cut or cracked or perhaps both and worn down to mere spangles after taking them it will not be possible to pass them without considerable loss above all things the traveller must be careful never to change gold except in large towns where such a display of wealth would not arouse suspicion or cupidity and on no occasion when travelling even to pronounce the illomened word kis purse many have lost their lives by neglecting these simple precautions fn16 some prefer a long chain of pure gold divided into links and covered with leather so as to resemble the twisted girdle which the arab fastens round his waist it is a precaution well known to the wandering knights of old others again in very critical situations open with a lancet the shoulder or any other fleshy part of the body and insert a precious stone which does not show in its novel purse fn17 any companion to the medicine chest will give to those that require such information the names of drugs and instruments necessary for a journey but it must be borne in mind that hot countries require double quantities of tonics and half the allowance of cathartics necessary in cold climates sonnini however is right when he says of the egyptian fellahs that their stomachs accustomed to digest bread badly baked acrid and raw vegetables and other green and unwholesome nourishment require doses fit only for horses advisable precautions are in the first place to avoid if travelling as a native any signs of european manufacture in knives scissors weights scales and other such articles secondly glass bottles are useless the drugs should be stowed away in tin or wooden boxes such as the natives of the country use and when a phial is required it must be fitted into an etui of some kind by this means ground glass stoppers and plentiful cotton stuffing the most volatile essences may be carried about without great waste after six months of the driest heat in egypt and arabia not more than about onefourth of my prussic acid and chloroform had evaporated and thirdly if you travel in the east a few bottles of tincture of cantharideshighly useful as a rubefacient excitant et ceteramust never be omitted i made the mistake of buying my drugs in england and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the journey both at alexandria and cairo they are to be found in abundance cheaper than in london and good enough for all practical purposes  p29chapter iii  the nile steamboatthe little asthmatic    in the days of the pitts we have invariably a relation of egyptian travellers who embark for a place called roseet on the river nilus wanderers of the brucean age were wont to record their impressions of voyage upon land subjects observed between alexandria and cairo a little later we find every one inditing rhapsodies about and descriptions of his or her dahabiyah barge on the canal after this came the steamer and after the steamer will come the railroad which may disappoint the author tourist but will be delightful to that

civilised lands he had settled at cairo  my second friend haji wali i will introduce to the reader in a future chapter and my two expeditions to midian have brought him once more into noticefn7  long conversations in persian and hindustani abridged the tediousness of the voyage and when we arrived at bulak the polite khudabakhsh insisted upon my making his house my home i was unwilling to accept the mans civility disliking his looks but he advanced cogent reasons for changing my mind his servant cleared my luggage through the customhouse and a few minutes after our arrival i found myself in his abode near the azbakiyah gardens sitting in a cool mashrabiyahfn8 that gracefully projected over a garden and sipping the favourite glass of pomegranate syrup  as the wakalahs or caravanserais were at that time full of pilgrims i remained with khudabakhsh ten days or a fortnight but at the end of that time my patience was thoroughly exhausted my host had become a civilised man who sat on chairs who ate with a fork who talked european politics and who had learned to admire if not to understand libertyliberal ideas and was i not flying from such things besides which we english have a

an utter want of solitude when one cannot retire into oneself an instant without being asked some puerile question by a companion or look into a book without a servant peering over ones shoulder when from the hour you rise to the time you rest you must ever be talking or listening you must converse yourself to sleep in a public dormitory and give ear to your companions snores and mutterings at midnightfn10  the very essence of oriental hospitality however is this family style of reception which costs your host neither coin nor trouble i speak of the rare tracts in which the old barbarous hospitality still lingers you make one more at his eating tray and an additional mattress appears in the sleepingroom when you depart you leave if you like a little present merely for a memorial with your entertainer he would be offended if you offered it him openly as a remuneration and you give  p37some trifling sums to the servants thus you will be welcome wherever you go if perchance you are detained perforce in such a situationwhich may easily happen to you medical manyou have only to make yourself as disagreeable as possible by calling for all manner of impossible things shame is a passion with eastern nations your host would blush to point out to you the indecorum of your conduct and the laws of hospitality oblige him to supply the every want of a guest even though he be a

victorsfn11 he will sit in the presence of a  p38magistrate or an officer the very picture of cringing submissiveness but after leaving the room he is as different from his former self as a counsel in court from a counsel at a concert a sea captain at a club dinner from a sea captain on his quarterdeck then he will discover that the english are not brave nor clever nor generous nor civilised nor anything but surpassing rogues that every official takes bribes that their manners are utterly offensive and that they are rank infidels then he will descant complacently upon the probability of a general bartholomews day in the east and look forward to the hour when enlightened young india will arise and drive the foul invader from the landfn12 then he will submit his political opinions nakedly that india should be wrested from the company and given to the queen or taken from the queen and given to the french if the indian has been a european traveller so much the worse for you he has blushed to ownexplaining however  conquest by briberythat 50000 englishmen hold 150000000 of his compatriots in thrall and for aught you know republicanism may have become his idol he has lost all fear of the white face and having been accustomed to unburden his mind in  the land where girt by friend or foe a man may say the thing he will  he pursues the same course in other lands where it is exceedingly misplaced his doctrines of liberty and  p39equality he applies to you personally and practically by not rising when you enter or leave the roomat first you could scarcely induce him to sit

hard to bear but a useful deduction may be drawn from such observations and as few have had greater experience than myself i venture to express my opinion with confidence however unpopular or unfashionable it may be  i am convinced that the natives of india cannot respect a european who mixes with them familiarly or especially who imitates their customs manners and dress the tight pantaloons the authoritative voice the pococurante manner and the broken hindustani impose upon themhave a weight which learning and honesty which wit and courage have not this is to them the masters

cairo as at constantinople a massive pile of buildings surrounding a quadrangular hosh or courtyard on the groundfloor are rooms like caverns for merchandise and shops of different kindstailors cobblers bakers tobacconists fruiterers and others a roofless gallery or a covered verandah into which all the apartments open runs round the first and sometimes the second story the latter however is usually exposed to the sun and wind the accommodations consist of sets of two or three rooms generally an inner one and an outer the latter contains a hearth for cooking a bathingplace and similar necessaries the staircases are high narrow and exceedingly dirty dark at night and often in bad repair a goat or donkey is tethered upon the different landings here and there a fresh skin is stretched in process of tanning and the smell reminds the veteran traveller of those closets in the old french  p42inns where cat used to be prepared for playing the part of jugged hare the interior is unfurnished even the pegs upon which clothes are hung have been pulled down for firewood the walls are bare but for stains thick cobwebs depend in festoons from the blackened rafters of the ceiling and the stone floor would disgrace a civilised prison the windows are huge apertures carefully barred with wood or iron and in rare places show remains of glass or paper pasted over the framework in the courtyard the poorer sort of travellers consort with tethered beasts of burden beggars howl and slaves lie basking and scratching themselves upon mountainous heaps of cotton bales and other merchandise  this is not a tempting picture yet is the wakalah a most amusing place presenting a succession of scenes which would delight lovers of the dutch schoola rich exemplification of the grotesque and what is called by artists the dirty picturesque  i could find no room in the wakalah khan khalil the longs or meurices of native cairo i was therefore obliged to put up with the jamaliyah a greek quarter swarming with drunken christians and therefore about as fashionable as oxford street or covent garden even for this i had to wait a week the pilgrims were flocking to cairo and to none other would the prudent hotel keepers open their doors for the following sufficient reasons when you enter a wakalah the first thing you have to do is to pay a small sum varying from two to five shillings for the miftah the key this is generally equivalent to a months rent so the sooner you leave the house the better for it i was obliged to call myself a turkish pilgrim in order to get possession of two most comfortless rooms which i afterwards learned were celebrated for making travellers ill and i had to pay eighteen piastres for the key and eighteen ditto per mensem for  p43rent besides five piastres to the man who swept and washed the place so that for this month my househire amounted to nearly four pence a day  but i was fortunate enough in choosing the jamaliyah wakalah for i found a friend there on board the steamer a fellowvoyager seeing me sitting alone and therefore as he conceived in discomfort placed himself by my side and opened a hot fire of kind inquiries he was a man about fortyfive of middle size with a large round head closely shaven a bullneck limbs sturdy as a saxons a thin red beard and handsome features beaming with benevolence a curious dry humour he had delighting in quizzing but in so quiet solemn and quaint a way that before you knew him you could scarcely divine his drift  thank allah we carry a doctor said my friend more than once with apparent fervour of gratitude after he had discovered my profession i was fairly taken in by the pious ejaculation and some days elapsed before the drift of his remark became apparent  you doctors he explained when we were more intimate what do you do a man goes to you for ophthalmia it is a purge a blister and a drop in the eye is it for fever well a purge and kinakina quinine for dysentery a purge and extract of opium wallahi i am as good a physician as the best of you he would add with a broad grin if i only knew the dirhambirhamsfn1drams and drachmsand a few breakjaw arabic names of diseases  haji walifn2 therefore emphatically advised me to  p44make bread by honestly teaching languages we are doctorridden said he and i found it was the case  when we lived under the same roof the haji and i became fast friends during the day we called on each other frequently we dined together and passed the evening in a mosque or some other place of public pastime coyly at first but less guardedly as we grew bolder we smoked the forbidden weed hashishfn3 conversing lengthily the while about that world of which i had seen so much originally from russia he also had been a traveller and in his wanderings he had cast off most of the prejudices of his people i believe in allah and his prophet and in nothing else was his sturdy creed he rejected alchemy jinnis and magicians and truly he had a most unoriental distaste for tales of wonder when i entered the wakalah he constituted himself my cicerone and especially guarded me against the cheating of tradesmen by his advice i laid aside the darwayshs gown the large blue pantaloons and the short shirt in fact all connection with persia and the persians if you persist in being an ajami said the haji you will get yourself into trouble in egypt you will be cursed in arabia you will be beaten because you are a heretic you will pay the treble of what other travellers do and if you fall sick you may die by the roadside after long deliberation about  p45the choice of nations i became a pathanfn4 born in india of afghan parents who had settled in the country educated at rangoon and sent out to wander as men of that race frequently are from early youth i was well guarded against the danger of detection by a fellowcountryman to support the character requires a knowledge of persian hindustani and arabic all of which i knew sufficiently well to pass muster any trifling inaccuracy was charged upon my long residence at rangoon this was an important step the first question at the shop on the camel and in the mosque is what is thy name the second whence comest thou this is not generally impertinent or intended to be annoying if however you see any evil intention in the questioner you may rather roughly ask him what may be his maternal parents nameequivalent to enquiring anglice in what church his mother was marriedand escape your difficulties under cover of the storm but this is rarely necessary i assumed the polite pliant manners of an indian physician and the dress of a small effendi or gentleman still however representing myself to be a darwaysh and frequenting the places where darwayshes congregate what business asked the haji have those reverend men with politics or statistics or any of the information which you are collecting call yourself a religious wanderer if you like and let those who ask the object of your peregrinations know that you are under a vow to visit all the holy places in alislam thus you will persuade them that you are a  p46man of rank under a cloud and you will receive much more civility than perhaps you deserve concluded my friend with a dry laugh the remark proved his sagacity and after ample experience i had not to repent having been guided by his advice  haji wali by profession a merchant at alexandria had accompanied khudabakhsh the indian to cairo on lawbusiness he soon explained his affairs to me and as his case brought out certain oriental peculiarities in a striking light with his permission i offer a few of its details  my friend was defendant in a suit instituted against him in hbms consular court cairo by one mohammed shafia a scoundrel of the first water this man lived and lived well by setting up in business at places where his name was not known he enticed the unwary by artful displays of capital and after succeeding in getting credit he changed residence carrying off all he could lay hands upon but swindling is a profession of personal danger in uncivilised countries where law punishes pauper debtors by a short imprisonment and where the cheated prefer to gratify their revenge by the cudgel or the knife so mohammed shafia after a few narrow escapes hit upon a prime expedient though known to be a native of bokharahe actually signed himself so in his letters and his appearance at once bespoke his originhe determined to protect himself by a british passport our officials are sometimes careless enough in distributing these documents and by so doing they expose themselves to a certain loss of reputation at eastern courtsfn5 still mohammed shafia  p47found some difficulties in effecting his fraud to recount all his reynardisms would weary the reader suffice it to say that by proper management of the subalterns in the consulate he succeeded without ruining himself armed with this new defence he started boldly for jeddah on the arabian coast having entered into partnership with haji wali whose confidence he had won by prayers fastings and pilgrimages he openly trafficked in slaves sending them to alexandria for sale and writing with matchless impudence to his correspondent that he would dispose of them in person but for fear of losing his british passport and protection  presently an unlucky adventure embroiled this worthy british subject with faraj yusuf the principal merchant of jeddah and also an english protege fearing so powerful an adversary mohammed shafia packed up his spoils and departed for egypt presently he quarrels with his former partner thinking him a soft man and claims from him a debt of l165 he supports his pretensions by a document and four witnesses who are ready to swear that the receipt in question was signed sealed and delivered by haji wali the latter adduces his books to show that accounts have been settled and can prove that the witnesses in question are paupers therefore not legal moreover that each has received from the plaintiff two dollars the price of perjury  p48now had such a suit been carried into a turkish court of justice it would very sensibly have been settled by the bastinado for haji wali was a respectable merchant and mohammed shafia a notorious swindler but the latter was a british subject which notably influenced the question the more to annoy his adversary he went up to cairo and began proceedings there hoping by this acute step to receive part payment of his demand  arrived at cairo mohammed shafia applied himself stoutly to the task of bribing all who could be useful to him distributing shawls and piastres with great generosity he secured the services of an efficient lawyer and determining to enlist heaven itself in his cause he passed the ramazan ostentatiously he fasted and he slaughtered sheep to feed the poor  meanwhile haji wali a simple truthtelling man who could never master the rudiments of that art which teaches man to blow hot and to blow cold with the same breath had been persuaded to visit cairo by khudabakhsh the wily indian who promised to introduce him to influential persons and to receive him in his house till he could provide himself with a lodging at the wakalah but mohammed shafia who had once been in partnership with the indian and who possibly knew more than was fit to meet the public ear found this out and partly by begging partly by bullying persuaded khudabakhsh to transfer the influential introductions to himself then the hakimfn6 abdullahyour humble servantappears upon the scene he has travelled in feringistan he has seen many men and their cities he becomes an intimate and an adviser of the haji and he finds out evil passages in mohammed shafias life upon which khudabakhsh ashamed or rather afraid of his duplicity collects his indian friends the hakim abdullah draws up a petition  p49addressed to mr walne hbms consul by the indian merchants and others resident at cairo informing him of mohammed shafias birth character and occupation as a vendor of slaves offering proof of all assertions and praying him for the sake of their good name to take away his passport and all the indians affix their seals to this paper then mohammed shafia threatens to waylay and to beat the haji the haji not loud or hectoringly but with a composed smile advises his friends to hold him off  one would suppose that such a document would have elicited some inquirybut haji wali was a persian protege and proceedings between the consulates had commenced before the petition was presented the pseudobritish subject having been acknowledged as a real one must be supported consuls like kings may err but must not own to error no notice was taken of the indian petition worse still no inquiry into the slaveaffair was set on footfn7 and it was discovered that the passport having been granted by a consulgeneral could not with official etiquette be resumed by a consulfn8  p50thus matters were destined to proceed as they began mohammed shafia had offered 5000 piastres to the persian consuls interpreter this of course was refused but still somehow or other all the hajis affairs seemed to go wrong his statements were mistranslated his accounts were misunderstood and the suit was allowed to drag on to a suspicious length when i left cairo in july haji wali had been kept away nearly two months from his business and family though both partiesfor the plaintiffs purse was rapidly thinningappeared eager to settle the difference by arbitration when i returned from arabia in october matters were almost in statu quo ante and when i started for india in january the proceedings had not closed  such is a brief history but too common of a case in which the subject of an eastern state has to contend against british influence it is doubtless a point of honour to defend our proteges from injustice but the higher principle should rest upon the base of common honesty the worst part of such a case is that the injured party has no redress  fiat injustitia ruat coelum  is the motto of his natural protectors who would violate every law to gratify the false pride of a petty english official and saving the rare exceptions where rank or wealth command consideration with what face to use the native phrase would a hapless turk appeal to the higher powers our ministers or our parliament  after lodging myself in the wakalah my first object was to make a certain stir in the world in europe your travelling doctor advertises the loss of a diamond ring the gift of a russian autocrat or he monopolises a whole column in a newspaper feeing perhaps a title for the use of a signature the large brass plate the goldheaded cane the rattling chariot and the summons from the sermon complete the work here there is no such royal  p51road to medical fame you must begin by sitting with the porter who is sure to have blear eyes into which you drop a little nitrate of silver whilst you instil into his ear the pleasing intelligence that you never take a fee from the poor he recovers his report of you spreads far and wide crowding your doors with paupers they come to you as though you were their servant and when cured they turn their backs upon you for ever hence it is that european doctors generally complain of ingratitude on the part of their oriental patients it is true that if you save a mans life he naturally asks you for the means of preserving it moreover in none of the eastern languages with which i am acquainted is there a single term conveying the meaning of our gratitude and none but germansfn9 have ideas unexplainable by words but you must not condemn this absence of a virtue without considering the cause an oriental deems that he has the right to your surplus daily bread is divided by heaven he asserts and eating yours he considers it his own thus it is with other things he is thankful to allah for the gifts of the creator but he has a claim to the good offices of a fellowcreature in rendering him a service you have but done your duty and he would not pay you so poor a compliment as to praise you for the act he leaves you his benefactor with a short prayer for the length of your days thank you being expressed by allah increase thy weal or the selfish wish that your shadow with which you protect him and his fellows may never be less and this is probably the last you hear of him  there is a discomfort in such proceedings a reasonable  p52a metaphysical coldness uglily contrasting in theory with the genial warmth which a little more heart would infuse into them in theory i say not in practice human nature feels kindness is displayed to return it in kind but easterns do not carry out the idea of such obligations as we do what can be more troublesome than when you have obliged a man to run the gauntlet of his and his familys thanksgivings to find yourself become a master from being a friend a great man when you were an equal not to be contradicted where shortly before every one gave his opinion freely you must be unamiable if these considerations deter you from benefiting your friend yet i humbly opine you still may fear his gratefulness  to resume when the mob has raised you to fame patients of a better class will slowly appear on the scene after some coquetting about etiquette whether you are to visit them or they are to call upon you they make up their minds to see you and to judge with their eyes whether you are to be trusted or not whilst you on your side set out with the determination that they shall at once cross the rubiconin less classical phrase swallow your drug if you visit the house you insist upon the patients servants attending you he must also provide and pay an ass for your conveyance no matter if it be only to the other side of the street your confidential man accompanies you primed for replies to the fifty searching questions of the servants hall you are lifted off the saddle tenderly as nurses dismount their charges when you arrive at the gate and you waddle upstairs with dignity arrived at the sick room you salute those present with a general peace be upon you to which they respond and upon thee be the peace and the mercy of allah and his blessing to the invalid you say there is nothing the matter please allah except the health to which the proper answerfor here every  p53sign of ceremony has its countersignfn10is may allah give thee health then you sit down and acknowledge the presence of the company by raising your right hand to your lips and forehead bowing the while circularly each individual returns the civility by a similar gesture then inquiry about the state of your health ensues then you are asked what refreshment you will take you studiously mention something not likely to be in the house but at last you rough it with a pipe and a cup of coffee then you proceed to the patient who extends his wrist and asks you what his complaint is then you examine his tongue you feel his pulse you look learned andhe is talking all the timeafter hearing a detailed list of all his ailments you gravely discover them taking for the same as much praise to yourself as does the practising phrenologist for a similar simple exercise of the reasoning faculties the disease to be respectable must invariably be connected with one of the four temperaments or the four elements or the humours of hippocrates cure is easy but it will take time and you the doctor require attention any little rudeness it is in your power to punish by an alteration in the pill or the powder and so unknown is professional honour that none will brave your displeasure if you would pass for a native practitioner you must finally proceed to the most uncomfortable part of your visit bargaining for fees nothing more effectually arouses suspicion than disinterestedness in a doctor i once cured a rich hazramaut merchant of rheumatism and neglected to make him pay for treatment he carried off one of my coffee cups and was unceasingly wondering where i came from so i made him produce five piastres a shilling which he threw upon the carpet cursing indian avarice you will bring on  p54another illness said my friend the haji when he heard of it properly speaking the fee for a visit to a respectable man is 20 piastres but with the rich patient you begin by making a bargain he complains for instance of dysentery and sciatica you demand l10 for the dysentery and l20 for the sciatica but you will rarely get it the eastern pays a doctors bill as an oirishman does his rint making a grievance of it your patient will show indisputable signs of convalescence he will laugh and jest half the day but the moment you appear groans and a lengthened visage and pretended complaints welcome you then your way is to throw out some such hint as  the world is a carcass and they who seek it are dogs  and you refuse to treat the second disorder which conduct may bring the refractory one to his senses dat galenus opes however is a western apothegm the utmost jalinus can do for you here is to provide you with the necessaries and comforts of life whatever you prescribe must be solid and material and if you accompany it with something painful such as rubbing to scarification with a horsebrush so much the better easterns like our peasants in europe wish the doctor to give them the value of their money besides which rough measures act beneficially upon their imagination so the hakim of the king of persia cured fevers by the bastinado patients are beneficially baked in a breadoven at baghdad and an egyptian at alexandria whose quartan resisted the strongest appliances of european physic was effectually healed by the actual cautery which a certain arab shaykh applied to the crown of his head when you administer with your own hand the remedyhalfadozen huge bread pills dipped in a solution of aloes or cinnamon water flavoured with assafoetida which in the case of the dyspeptic rich often suffice if they will but  p55diet themselvesyou are careful to say in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful and after the patient has been dosed praise be to allah the curer the healer you then call for pen ink and paper and write some such prescription as this  afn11  in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful and blessings and peace be upon our lord the apostle and his family and his companions one and all but afterwards let him take beeshoney and cinnamon and album graecum of each half a part and of ginger a whole part which let him pound and mix with the honey and form boluses each bolus the weight of a miskal and of it let him use every day a miskal on the salivafn12 verily its effects are wonderful and let him abstain from flesh fish vegetables sweetmeats flatulent food acids of all descriptions as well as the major ablution and live in perfect quiet so shall he be cured by the help of the king the healerfn13 and the peacefn14  the diet i need scarcely say should be rigorous nothing has tended more to bring the european system of medicine into contempt among orientals than our inattention to this branch of the therapeutic art when an hindi or a hindu takes medicine he prepares himself for it by diet and rest two or three days before adhibition and as gradually after the dose he relapses into his usual habits if he break through the regime it is concluded that fatal results must ensue the ancient egyptians we learn from herodotus devoted a certain number of days in each month to the use of alteratives and the  p56period was consecutive doubtless in order to graduate the strength of the medicine the persians when under salivation shut themselves up in a warm room never undress and so carefully guard against cold that they even drink tepid water when the afghan princes find it necessary to employ chobchini the jinseng fn15 or china  p57root so celebrated as a purifier tonic and aphrodisiac they choose the spring season they remove to a garden where flowers and trees and bubbling streams soothe their senses they carefully avoid fatigue and trouble of all kinds and will not even hear a letter read lest it should contain bad news  when the prescription is written out you affix an impression of your ring seal to the beginning and to the end of it that no one may be able to add to or take from its contents and when you send medicine to a patient of rank who is sure to have enemies you adopt some similar precaution against the box or the bottle being opened one of the pashas whom i attendeda brave soldier who had been a favourite with mohammed ali and therefore was degraded by his successorkept an impression of my ring in wax to compare with that upon the phials men have not forgotten how frequently in former times those who became obnoxious to the state were seized with sudden and fatal cramps in the stomach in the case of the doctor it is common prudence to adopt these precautions as all evil consequences would be charged upon him and he would be exposed to the familys revenge  cairo though abounding in medical practitioners can still support more but to thrive they must be indians chinese or maghrabis the egyptians are thoroughly disgusted with european treatment which is here about as efficacious as in indiathat is to say not at all but they are ignorant of the medicine of hind and therefore great is its name deservedly perhaps for skill in simples and dietetics besides which the indian  p58may deal in charms and spellsthings to which the

of the land and there are not wanting old angloindians intelligent men that place firm trust in tales and tenets too puerile even for the hindus to believe as a hindi i could use animal magnetism taking care however to give the science a specious supernatural appearance haji wali who professing positive scepticism showed the greatest interest in the subject as a curiosity advised me not to practise pure mesmerism otherwise that i should infallibly become a companion of devils you must call this an indian secret said my friend for it is clear that you are no mashaikhfn17 and people will ask where are your drugs and what business have you with charms it is useless to say that i followed his counsel yet patients would consider themselves my  p59murids disciples and delighted in kissing the hand of the sahib nafasfn18 or minor saint  the haji repaid me for my docility by vaunting me everywhere as the very phoenix of physicians my first successes were in the wakalah opposite to me there lived an arab slave dealer whose abyssinians constantly fell sick a tender race they suffer when first transported to egypt from many complaints especially consumption dysentery and varicose veins i succeeded in curing one girl as she was worth at least fifteen pounds the gratitude of her owner was great and i had to dose half a dozen others in order to cure them of the pernicious and pricelowering habit of snoring living in rooms opposite these slave girls and seeing them at all hours of the day and night i had frequent opportunities of studying them they were average specimens of the steatopygous abyssinian breed broadshouldered thinflanked finelimbed and with haunches of a prodigious size none of them had handsome features but the short curly hair that stands on end being concealed under a kerchief there was something pretty in the brow eyes and upper part of the nose coarse and sensual in the pendent lips large jowl and projecting mouth whilst the whole had a combination of piquancy with sweetness their style of flirtation was peculiar  how beautiful thou art o maryamwhat eyeswhat  p60then whywould respond the ladydont you buy me  we are of one faithof one

not the plainspoken maryams reply without its moral how often is it our fate in the west as in the east to see in bright eyes and to hear from rosy lips an implied if not an expressed why dont you buy me or worse still why cant you buy me  all i required in return for my services from the slavedealer whose brutal countenance and manners were truly repugnant was to take me about the town and explain to me certain mysteries in his craft which knowledge might be useful in time to come little did he suspect who his interrogator was and freely in his unsuspiciousness he entered upon the subject of slave hunting in the somali country and zanzibar of all things the most interesting to me i have however nothing new to report concerning the present state of bondsmen in egypt england has already learned that slaves are not necessarily the most wretched and degraded of men some have been bold enough to tell the british public that in the generality of oriental countriesfn19 the serf fares far  p61better than the servant or indeed than the poorer orders of freemen the laws of mahomet enjoin his followers to treat slaves with the greatest mildness and the moslems are in general scrupulous observers of the apostles recommendation slaves are considered members of the family and in houses where free servants are also kept they seldom do any other work than filling the pipes presenting the coffee accompanying their master when going out rubbing his feet when he takes his nap in the afternoon and driving away the flies from him when a slave is not satisfied he can legally compel his master to sell him he has no care for food lodging clothes and washing and has no taxes to pay he is exempt from military service and soccage and in spite of his bondage is freer than the freest fellah in egyptfn20 this is i believe a true statement but of course it in no wise affects the question of slavery in the abstract a certain amount of reputation was the consequence of curing the abyssinian girls my friend haji wali carefully told the news to all the town and before fifteen days were over i found myself obliged to decline extending a practice which threatened me with fame  servants are most troublesome things to all englishmen in egypt but especially to one travelling as a respectable native and therefore expected to have slaves after much deliberation i resolved to take a berberifn21  p62and accordingly summoned a shaykhthere is a shaykh for everything down to thieves in the east in egypt since the days of diodorus siculus and made known my want the list of sine qua nons was necessarily rather an extensive onegood health and a readiness to travel anywhere a little skill in cooking sewing and washing willingness to fight and a habit of regular prayers after a days delay the shaykh brought me a specimen of his choosing a broadshouldered bandylegged fellow with the usual bulldog expression of the berberis in his case rendered doubly expressive by the drooping of an eyelidan accident brought about with acrid juice in order to avoid conscription he responded sturdily to all my questions some egyptian donkey boys and men were making a noise in the room at the time and the calm ferocity with which he ejected them commanded my approval when a needle thread and an unhemmed napkin were handed to him he sat down held the edge of the cloth between his big toe and its neighbour and finished the work in quite a superior style walking out he armed himself with a kurbaj which he used now lightly then heavily upon all laden animals biped and quadruped that came in the way his conduct proving equally satisfactory in the kitchen after getting security from him and having his name registered by the shaykhfn22 i closed with him for eighty piastres a  p63month but ali the berberi and i were destined to part before a fortnight he stabbed his fellow servanta surat lad who wishing to return home forced his services upon meand for this trick he received with his dismissal 400 blows on the feet by order of the zabit or police magistrate after this failure i tried a number of servants egyptians saidisfn23 and clean and unclean eatingfn24 berberis recommended by different shaykhs all had some fatal defect one cheated recklessly another robbed me a third drank a fourth was always in scrapes for infringing the julian edict and the last a longlegged nubian after remaining two days in the house dismissed me for expressing  p64a determination to travel by sea from suez to yambu i kept one man he complained that he was worked to death twothey did nothing but fight and threethey left me as mr elwes said of old to serve myself at last thoroughly tired of egyptian domestics and one servant being really sufficient for comfort as well as suitable to my assumed rank i determined to keep only the indian boy he had all the defects of his nation a brave at cairo he was an arrant coward at almadinah the badawin despised him heartily for his effeminacy in making his camel kneel to dismount and he could not keep his hands from picking and stealing but the choice had its advantages his swarthy skin and chubby features made the arabs always call him an abyssinian slave which as it favoured my disguise i did not care to contradict he served well he was amenable to discipline and being completely dependent upon me he was therefore less likely to watch and especially to prate about my proceedings as master and man we performed the pilgrimage together but on my return to egypt after the pilgrimage shaykh become haji nur finding me to be a sahibfn25 changed for the worse he would not work and reserved all his energy for the purpose of pilfering which he practised so audaciously upon my friends as well as upon myself that he could not be kept in the house  perhaps the reader may be curious to see the necessary expenses of a bachelor residing at cairo he must observe however in the following list that i was not a

conform to popular custom and accordingly after having secured a servant my efforts were directed to finding a teacher the pretext being that as an indian doctor i wanted to read arabic works on medicine as well as to perfect myself in divinity and pronunciationfn26 my theological studies were in the shafei school for two reasons in the first place it is the least rigorous of the four orthodox and secondly it most resembles the shiah heresy with which long intercourse  p67with persians had made me familiarfn27 my choice of doctrine however confirmed those around me in their conviction that i was a rank heretic for the ajami taught by his religion to conceal offensive tenetsfn28 in lands where the open expression would be dangerous always represents himself to be a shafei this together with the original mistake of appearing publicly at alexandria as a mirza in a persian dress caused me infinite small annoyance at cairo in spite of all precautions and contrivances and throughout my journey even in arabia though i drew my knife every time an offensive hint was thrown out the illfame clung to me like the shirt of nessus  it was not long before i happened to hit upon a proper teacher in the person of shaykh mohammed alattar or the druggist he had known prosperity having once been a khatib preacher in one of mohammed alis mosques but his highness the late pasha had dismissed him which disastrous event with its subsequent train of misfortunes he dates from the melancholy day when he took to himself a wife he talks of her abroad as a stern and rigid master dealing with a naughty slave though by the look that accompanies his rhodomontade i am convinced that at home he is the very model of managed men his dismissal was the reason that compelled him to fall back

face and hands must be frequently washed preparatory to devotion still they have the quality of looking always unclean it is wonderful how fierce and gruff he is to the little boys and girls who flock to him grasping farthings for pepper and sugar on such occasions i sit admiring to see him when forced to exertion wheel about on his place making a pivot of that portion of our organisation which mainly distinguishes our species from the other families of the simiadae to reach some distant drawer or to pull down a case from its accustomed shelf how does he manage to say his prayers to kneel and to prostrate himself upon that two feet of ragged rug scarcely sufficient for a british infant to lie upon he hopelessly owns that he knows nothing of his craft and the seats before his shop are seldom occupied his great pleasure appears to be when the haji and i sit by him a few minutes in the evening bringing with us pipes which he assists us to smoke and ordering coffee which he insists upon sweetening with a lump of sugar from his little store there we make him talk and laugh and occasionally quote a few lines strongly savouring of the jovial we provoke him to long stories about the love borne him in his studentdays by the great and holy shaykh abd alrahman and the antipathy with which he was regarded by the equally  p70great and holy shakh nasr aldin his memorable single imprisonment for contumacyfn32 and the temperate but effective lecture beginning with o almost entirely destitute of shame delivered on that occasion in presence of other undergraduates by the right

his cottage was burned by an accident in the ashes he found roasted meat which looked tempting to a hungry man he called his neighbours and all sat down to make merry over the mishap presently they came to the head which proved to be that of a dog some enemy having doubtless stolen the sheep and put the impure animal in its place whereupon sadly perplexed all the berberis went to their priest and dolefully related the circumstance expecting absolution as the offence was involuntary you have eaten filth said the man of allah well replied the berberis falling upon him with their fists filth or not we have eaten it the berberi i must remark is the paddy of this part of the world celebrated for bulls and blunders fn25 the generic name given by indians to english officials fn26 there are four kinds of tobacco smoked in egypt the first and best is the wellknown latakia generally called jabali either from a small seaport town about three hours journey south of latakia or more probably because grown on the hills near the ancient laodicea pure it is known by its blackish colour fine shredding absence of stalk and an undescribable odour to me resembling that of creosote the leaf too is small so that when made into cigars it must be covered over with a slip of the yellow turkish tobacco called bafra except at the highest houses unadulterated latakia is not to be had in cairo yet mixed as it is no other growth exceeds it in flavour and fragrance miss martineau smoked it we are told without inconvenience and it differs from our shag birdseye and returns in degree as does chateau margeau from a bottle of cheap strong spanish wine to bring out its flavour the connoisseur smokes it in long pipes of cherry jasmine maple or rosewood and these require a servant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them the best jabali at cairo costs about seven piastres the pound after which a small sum must be paid to the farram or chopper who prepares it for use 2nd suri tyrian or shami or suryani grown in syria an inferior growth of a lighter colour than latakia and with a greenish tinge when cut its value is about three piastres per pound some smokers mix this leaf with jabali which to my taste spoils the flavour of the latter without improving the former the strongest kind called korani or jabayl is generally used for cigarettes it costs when of firstrate quality about five piastres per pound 3rd tumbak or persian tobacco called hijazi because imported from the hijaz where everybody smokes it and supposed to come from shiraz kazerun and other celebrated places in persia it is all but impossible to buy this article unadulterated except from the caravans returning after the pilgrimage the egyptians mix it with native growths which ruins its flavour and gives it an acridity that catches the throat whereas good tumbak never yet made a man cough yet the taste of this tobacco even when secondrate is so fascinating to some smokers that they will use no other to be used it should be wetted and squeezed and it is invariably inhaled through water into the lungs almost every town has its favourite description of pipe and these are of all kinds from the paupers rough cocoanut mounted with two reeds to the princes golden bowl set with the finest stones tumbak is cheap costing about four piastres a pound but large quantities of it are used 4th hummi as the word signifies a hot variety of the tumbak grown in alyaman and other countries it is placed in the tile on the buri or cocoanut pipe unwetted and has a very acrid flavour being supposed to produce intoxication or rather a swimming in the head hummi gives its votaries a bad name respectable men would answer no with rage if asked whether they are smoking it and when a fellow tells you that he has seen better days but that now he smokes hummi in a buri you understand him that his misfortunes have affected either his brain or his morality hence it is that this tobacco is never put into pipes intended for smoking the other kinds the price of hummi is about five piastres per pound fn26 a study essential to the learned as in some particular portions of the koran a

the hammam or hot bath being a kind of religious establishment is one of the class of thingsso uncomfortably numerous in eastern countriesleft ala judak to thy generosity consequently you are pretty sure to have something disagreeable there which you would vainly attempt to avoid by liberality the best way to deal with all such extortioners with the lawingi undresser of a cairo hammam or the jarvey of a london hansom is to find out the fare and never to go beyond itnever to be generous the hammam has been too often noticed to bear another description one point however connected with it i must be allowed to notice mr lane modern egyptians asserts that a moslem should not pray nor recite the koran in it as the bath is believed to be a favourite resort of jinnis or genii on the contrary it is the custom of some sects to recite a rukatayn twobow prayer immediately after religious ablution in the hot cistern this however is makruh or improper without being sinful to the followers of abu hanifah as a general rule throughout alislam the farz obligatory prayers may be recited everywhere no matter how impure the place may be but those belonging to the classes sunnat traditionary and nafilah supererogatory are makruh though not actually unlawful in certain localities i venture this remark on account of the extreme accuracy of the work referred to a wonderful contrast to the generality of oriental books it amply deserves a revision in the rare places requiring care fn34 europeans so seldom see the regular old shaykh whose place is now taken by polite young men educated in

unamiable for the space of sixteen consecutive hours and a quarter we were forbidden to eat drink smoke snuff and even to swallow our saliva designedly i say forbidden for although the highest orders

season however arduous with exceeding zeal of all who suffered severely from such total abstinence i found but one patient who would eat even to save his life and among the vulgar sinners who habitually drink when they should pray will fast and perform their devotions through the ramazan  like the italian the anglocatholic and the greek fasts the chief effect of the blessed month upon true

and otherwise injured the bodies of their lords the mosques are crowded with a sulky grumbling population making themselves offensive to one another on earth whilst working their way to heaven and in the shade under the outer walls the little boys who have been expelled the church attempt to forget their miseries in spiritless play in the bazars and streets pale longdrawn faces looking for the

fn1 of course all quarrelling abuse and evil words are strictly forbidden to the moslem during ramazan if one believer insult another the latter should repeat i am fasting three times before venturing

worship moslems of the shafei faith must perform the niyat of fasting every night for the ensuing day the malikis on the other hand purpose abstinence but once for the thirty days of ramazan lane

followers still clap their hands when we should ring for a servant the symbolical meaning of the bell as shown in the sistrum of isis seems to be the movement and mixture of the elements which is denoted by clattering noise hence observes a learned antiquary the ringing of bells and clattering of plates of metal were used in all lustrations sacrifices c we find them amongst the jews worn by

object to have his ground floor occupied by the corpse of a holy man the reader will not forget that in europe statues have the whims which dead bodies exhibit in egypt so according to the abbe marche

the learned suspecting him to be at heart an infidel examined his person and found the formula of the mohammedan faith written in token of abhorrence upon the soles of his feet thereupon the principal of the mosque in a transport of holy indignation did decapitate him with one blow of the sword it only remains to be observed that nothing can be more ridiculous than the popular belief except it be

the byzantine christians after overthrowing the temples of paganism meditated rebuilding and remodelling them poverty of invention and artistic impotence reduced them to group the spoils in a heterogeneous massfn1 the seaports of egypt and the plains and mountains of syria abounding in pillars of granite syenite and precious marbles in pharaonic grecian and roman statuary and in all manner of structural ornaments the architects were at no loss for material their syncretism the result of chance and precipitancy of extravagance and incuriousness fell under eyes too ignorant to be hurt by the hybrid irregularity it was perpetuated in the socalled saracenic style a plagiarism from the byzantinefn2 and it was reiterated in the gothic an offshoot from the saracenicfn3 this fact accounts in the gothic style for its manifold incongruities of architecture and for the phenomenonnot solely attributable to the buildings  p91having been erected piecemealof its most classic period being that of its greatest irregularity  such architectural lawlessness such disregard for symmetrythe result i believe of an imperfect amalgamation and enrichmentmay doubtless be defended upon the grounds both of cause and of effect architecture is of the imitative arts and nature the myriomorphous everywhere delighting in variety appears to abhor nothing so much as perfect similarity and precise uniformity to copy her exactly we must therefore seek that general analogy compatible with individual variety in fact we should avoid the overdisplay of order and regularity and again it may be asserted that however incongruous these disorderly forms may appear to the conventional eye we find it easy to surmount our first antipathy perhaps we end in admiring them the more as we love those faces in which irregularity of feature is compensated for by diversity and piquancy of expression  there is nothing i believe new in the arab mosque it is an unconscious revival of the forms used from the earliest ages to denote by symbolism the worship of the generative and the creative gods the reader will excuse me if i only glance at a subject of which the investigation would require a volume and which discussed at greater length would be out of place in such a narrative as this  the first mosque in alislam was erected by mohammed at kuba near almadinah shortly afterwards when he entered meccah as a conqueror he destroyed the three hundred and sixty idols of the arab pantheon and thus purified that venerable building from its abominations he had probably observed in syrian bostra the two forms appropriated by the christians to their places of worship the cross and the parallelogramic basilica he therefore preferred for the prayers of the saving faith a squaresome authors say with others  p92without a cloister at length in the reign of alwalid ah 90 the cupola the niche and the minaret made their appearance and what is called the saracenic style became for ever the order of the moslem world  the hindus i believe to have been the first who symbolised by an equilateral triangle their peculiar cult the yonilinga in their temple architecture it became either a conoid or a perfect pyramid egypt denoted it by the obelisk peculiar to that country and the form appeared in different parts of the world thus in england it was a mere upright stone and in ireland a round tower this we might expect to see dhancarville and brotier have successfully traced the worship itself in its different modifications to all people the symbol would therefore be found everywhere the old arab minaret is a plain cylindrical or polygonal tower without balcony or stages widely different from the turkish modern egyptian and hijazi combinations of tube and prism happily compared by a french traveller to une chandelle coiffee dun eteignoir and finally the ancient minaret made solid as all gothic architecture is and provided with a belfry became the spire and steeple of our ancestors  from time immemorial in hot and rainy lands a hypaethral court either round or square surrounded by a covered portico was used for the double purpose of church and marta place where god and mammon were worshipped turn by turn in some places we find rings of stones like the persian pyroetheia in others circular concave buildings representing the vault of heaven where fire the divine symbol was worshipped and in arabia columnar aisles which surmounted by the splendid blue vault resemble the palmgrove the greeks adopted this idea in the fanes of creator bacchus and at pozzuoli near naples it may be seen in the building vulgarly called the temple of serapis it was equally well known  p93to the kelts in some places the temenos was a circle in others a quadrangle and such to the present day is the mosque of alislam  even the riwak or porches surrounding the area in the mosque are revivals of older forms the range of square buildings which enclose the temple of serapis are not properly speaking parts of the fane but apartments of the priests places for victims and sacred utensils and chapels dedicated to subordinate deities introduced by a more complicated and corrupt worship and probably unknown to the founders of the original edifice the cloisters in the mosque became cells used as lecture rooms and stores for books bequeathed to the college they are unequal because some are required to be of larger others to be of smaller dimensions the same reason causes difference of size when the building is distributed into four hyposteles opening upon the area the porch in the direction of the kaabah where worshippers mostly congregate demands greater depth than the other three the wings were not unfrequently made unequal either from want of building materials or because the same extent of accommodation was not required in both the columns were of different substances some of handsome marble others of rough stone meanly plastered over with dissimilar capitals vulgarly cut shafts of various sizes here with a pediment there without now turned upside down then joined together by halves in the centre and almost invariably nescient of intercolumnar rule this is the result of byzantine syncretism carelessly and ignorantly grafted upon arab ideas of the natural and the sublime loving and admiring the great or rather the big in planfn4 they care  p94little for the execution of mere details and they have not the acumen to discern the effect which clumsy workmanship crooked lines and visible jointsparts apparently insignificantexercise upon the whole of an edifice their use of colours was a false taste commonly displayed by mankind in their religious houses and statues of the gods the hindus paint their pagodas inside and outside and rub vermilion in token of honour over their deities the persian colossi of kaiomars and his consort on the balkh road and the sphinx of egypt as well as the temples of the nile still show traces of artificial complexion the fanes in classic greece have been dyed in the forum romanum one of the finest buildings still bears stains of the tyrian purple and to mention no other instances in the churches and belfries of modern italy we see alternate bands of white and black material so disposed as to give them the appearance of giant zebras the origin of arabesque ornament must be referred to one of the principles of alislam the moslem forbidden by his law to decorate his mosque with statuary and picturesfn5 supplied their place with quotations from the koran and inscriptions plastic metaphysics of marvellous perplexity  p95his alphabet lent itself to the purpose and hence probably arose that almost inconceivable variety of lacelike fretwork of incrustations of arabesques and of geometric flowers in which his eye delights to lose itselffn6  the meccan mosque became a model to the world of alislam and the nations that embraced the new faith copied the consecrated building as religiously as christendom produced imitations of the holy sepulchrefn7 the mosque of omar at jerusalem of amru at babylon on the nile and of taylun at cairo were erected with some trifling improvements such as arched cloisters and inscribed cornices upon the plan of the kaabah from egypt and palestine the ichnography spread far and wide it was modified as might be expected by national taste what in arabia was simple and elegant became highly ornate in spainfn8 florid in turkey sturdy in syria and effeminate in india still divergence of detail had not even after the lapse of twelve centuries materially altered the fundamental form  p96perhaps no eastern city affords more numerous or more accessible specimens of mosque architecture than cairo between 300 and 400 places of worshipfn9 some stately piles others ruinous hovels many new more decaying and earthquakeshaken with minarets that rival in obliquity the pisan monster are open to the travellers inspection and europeans by following the advice of their hotelkeeper have penetrated and can penetrate into any one they pleasefn10 if architecture be really what i believe it to be the highest expression of a peoples artistic feelinghighest because it includes all othersto compare the several styles of the different epochs to observe how each monarch building his own mosque and calling it by his own name identified the manner of the monument with himself and to trace the gradual decadence of art through one thousand two hundred years down to the present day must be a work of no ordinary interest to orientalists the limits of my plan however compel me to place only the heads of the argument before the reader may i be allowed to express a hope that it will induce some learned traveller to investigate a subject in every way worthy his attention  the desecrated jami taylun ninth century is simple and massive yet elegant and in some of its details peculiarfn11 one of the four colonnadesfn12 still remains unoccupied  p97by paupers to show the original magnificence of the building the other porches are walled up and inhabited in the centre of a quadrangle about 100 paces square is a domed building springing from a square which occupies the proper place of the kaabah this jamifn13 cathedral is interesting as a point of comparison if it be an exact copy of the meccan temple as it stood in ad 879 it shows that the latter has greatly altered in this our modern day  next in date to the taylun mosque is that of the sultan alhakim third caliph of the fatimites and founder of the druze mysteries the minarets are remarkable in shape as well as size they are unprovided with the usual outer gallery they are based upon a cube of masonry and they are pierced above with apertures apparently meaningless a learned cairene informed me that these spires were devised by the eccentric monarch to disperse like large censers fragrant smoke over the city during the hours of prayer the azhar and hasanaynfn14 mosques are simple and artless piles celebrated for sanctity but remarkable for nothing save ugliness few buildings however are statelier in appearance  p98or give a nobler idea of both founder and architect than that which bears sultan hasans name the stranger stands awestruck before walls high towering without a single break a hypaethral court severe in masculine beauty a gateway that might suit the palace of the titans and a lofty minaret of massive grandeur this mosque finished about ad 1363 with its fortress aspect owns no more relationship to the efforts of a later age than does canterbury cathedral to an angloindian gothic for dignified beauty and refined taste the mosque and tomb of kaid bey and the other mamluk kings are admirable even in their present state picturesqueness presides over decay and the traveller has seldom seen aught more striking than the rich light of the stained glass pouring through the first shades of evening upon the marble floor  the modern mosques must be visited to see egyptian architecture in its decline and fall that of sittna zaynab our lady zaynab founded by murad bey the mamluk and interrupted by the french invasion shows even in its completion some lingering traces of taste but nothing can be more offensive than the building which every tourist flogs donkey in his hurry to seeold mohammed alis folly in the citadel its greek architect has toiled to caricature a mosque to emulate the glories of our english oriental pavilion outside as monckton milnes sings  the shining minarets thin and high  are so thin so high above the lumpy domes that they  p99look like the spindles of crouching crones and are placed in full sight of sultan hasan the giant so as to derive all the disadvantages of the contrast is the pointed arch forgotten by man that this hapless building should be disgraced by large and small parallelograms of glass and woodfn15 so placed and so formed as to give its exterior the appearance of a european theatre coiffe with oriental cupolas outside as well as inside money has been lavished upon alabaster full of flaws round the bases of pillars run gilt bands in places the walls are painted with streaks to resemble marble and the woodwork is overlaid with tinsel gold after a glance at these abominations one cannot be surprised to hear the old men of egypt lament that in spite of european education and of prizes encouraging geometry and architecture modern art offers a melancholy contrast to antiquity it is said that h h abbas pasha proposes to erect for himself a mosque that shall far surpass the boast of the last generation i venture to hope that his architect will light the sacred fire from sultan hasans not from mohammed alis turcogrecian splendours the former is like the genuine osmanli of past ages fierce cold with a stalwart frame index of a strong mindthere was a sullen grandeur about the man the latter is the pert and puny modern turk in pantaloons frock coat and fez illdressed illconditioned and illbred body and soul  p100we will now enter the mosque alazhar at the dwarf wooden railing we take off our slippers hold them in the left hand sole to sole that no dirt may fall from them and cross the threshold with the right foot ejaculating bismillah c next we repair to the mayzaah or large tank for ablution without which it is unlawful to appear in the house of allah we then seek some proper place for devotion place our slippers on some other object in front of us to warn the lounger and perform a twobow prayer in honour of the mosquefn16 this done we may wander about and inspect the several objects of curiosity  the moon shines splendidly upon a vast open court paved with stones which are polished like glass by the feet of the faithful there is darkness in the body of the building a large oblong hall at least twice too lengthy for its height supported by a forest of pillars thin poorlooking crooked marble columns planted avenuelike upon torn and dirty matting a few oil lamps shed doubtful light over scanty groups who are debating some point of grammar or are listening to the words of wisdom that fall from the mouth of a waizfn17 presently they will leave the hypostyle and throw themselves upon the flags of the quadrangle where they may enjoy the open air and avoid some fleas it is now long vacation so the holy building has become a kind of caravanserai for travellers  p101perhaps a score of nations meet in it there is a confusion of tongues and the din at times is deafening around the court runs a tolerably wellbuilt colonnade whose entablature is garnished with crimson arabesques and in the inner wall are pierced apartments now closed with plank doors of the riwak as the porches are called the azhar contains twentyfour one for each recognised nation in alislam and of these fifteen are still open to studentsfn18 inside them we find nothing but matting and a pile of large dingy wooden boxes which once contained the college library they are now generally speaking emptyfn19  there is nothing worth seeing in the cluster of little dark chambers that form the remainder of the azhar even the zawiyat alumyan or the blind mens oratory a place where so many town and gown rows have emanated is rendered interesting only by the fanaticism of its inmates and the certainty that if recognised in this  p102sanctum we shall run the gauntlet under the staves of its proprietors the angry blind  the azhar is the grand collegiate mosque of this citythe christ church in fact of cairoonce celebrated throughout the world of alislam it was built i was told originally in poor style by one jauhar alkaidfn20 originally the slave of a moorish merchant in consequence of a dream that ordered him to erect a place whence the light of science should shine upon alislam  it gradually increased by wakffn21 entailed bequests of lands money and books and pious rulers made a point of adding to its size and wealth of late years it has considerably declined the result of sequestrations and of the diminished esteem in which the purely religious sciences are now held in the land of egyptfn22 yet it is calculated that between 2000 and 3000 students of all nations and ages receive instruction here gratis  p103each one is provided with bread in a quantity determined by the amount of endowment at the riwak set apart for his nationfn23 with some article of clothing on festival days and a few piastres once a year the professors who are about 150 in number may not take fees from their pupils some lecture on account of the religious merit of the action others to gain the high title of teacher in al azharfn24 six officials receive stipends from the governmentthe shaykh aljami or dean the shaykh alsakka who regulates the provision of water for ablution and others that may be called heads of departments  the following is the course of study in the azhar the schoolboy of four or five years standing has been taught by a liberal application of the maxim the green rod is of the trees of paradise to chant the koran without understanding it the elementary rules of arithmetic and if he is destined to be a learned man the art of writingfn25 he then registers his name in alazhar and applies  p104himself to the branches of study most cultivated in alislam namely nahw syntax fikh the law hadis the traditions of the prophet and tafsir or exposition of the koran  the young egyptian reads at the same time sarf or inflexion and nahw syntax but as arabic is his mothertongue he is not required to study the former so deeply as are the turks the persians and the indians if he desire however to be a proficient he must carefully peruse five books in sarffn26 and six in nahwfn27  p105master of grammar our student now applies himself to its proper end and purpose divinity of the four schools those of abu hanifah and alshafei are most common in cairo the followers of ibn malik abound only in southern egypt and the berberah country and the hanbali is almost unknown the theologian begins with what is called a matn or text a short dry and often obscure treatise a mere string of precepts in fact the skeleton of the subject this he learns by repeated perusal till he can quote almost every passage literatim he then passes to its sharh or commentary generally the work of some other savant who explains the difficulty of the text amplifies its laconicisms enters into exceptional cases and deals with principles and reasons as well as with mere precept a difficult work will sometimes require hashiyah or marginal notes but this aid has a bad name  who readeth with note but learneth by rote  says a popular doggrel the reason is that the students reasoning powers being little exercised he learns to depend upon the dixit of a master rather than to think for himself it also leads to the neglect of another practice highly advocated by the eastern pedagogue  the lecture is one the dispute upon the subject of the lecture is one thousand  in order to become a fakih or divine of distinguished fame the follower of abu hanifah must peruse about ten volumesfn28 some of huge size written in a diffuse style  p106the shafeis reading is not quite so extensivefn29 theology is much studied because it leads directly to the gaining of daily bread as priest or tutor and other scientific pursuits are neglected for the opposite reason  the theologian in egypt as in other parts of alislam must have a superficial knowledge of the prophets traditions of these there are eight well known collectionsfn30 but only the first three are generally read  schoolboys are instructed almost when in their infancy to intone the koran at the university they are  p107taught a more exact system of chanting the style called hafs is most common in egypt as it is indeed throughout the moslem world and after learning to read the holy volume some savans are ambitious enough to wish to understand it under these circumstances they must dive into the ilm altafsirfn31 or the exegesis of the koran  our student is now a perfect fakih or mullafn32 but  p108the poor fellow has no scholarship or fellowshipno easy tutorshipno fat living to look forward to after wasting  p109seven years or twice seven years over his studies and reading till his brain is dizzy his digestion gone and his eyes half blind he must either starve upon college alms or squat like my old shaykh mohammed in a druggists shop or become pedagogue and preacher in some country place on the pay of l8 per annum with such prospects it is wonderful how the azhar can present any attractions but the southern man is essentially an idler and many become olema like capuchins in order to do nothing a favoured few rise to the degree of mudarris professors and thence emerge kazis and muftis this is another inducement to matriculate every undergraduate having an eye upon the kaziship with as much chance of obtaining it as the country parocco has of becoming a cardinal others again devote themselves to laical pursuits degenerate into wakils lawyers or seek their fortunes as katibspublic or private accountants  to conclude this part of the subject i cannot agree with dr bowring when he harshly says upon the subject of moslem education the instruction given by the doctors of the law in the religious schools for the formation of the mohammedan priesthood is of the most worthless characterfn33 his opinion is equally open to  p110objection with that of those who depreciate the law itself because it deals rather in precepts than in principle in ceremonies and ordinances rather than in ethics and aesthetics both are what eastern faiths and eastern training have ever beenboth are eminently adapted for the oriental mind when the people learn to appreciate ethics and to understand psychics and aesthetics the demand will create a supply meanwhile they leave transcendentalism to their poets and philosophers and they busy themselves with preparing for heaven by practising the only part of their faith now intelligible to themthe material  it is not to be supposed that a nation in this stage of civilisation could be so fervently devout as the egyptians are without the bad leaven of bigotry the same tongue which is employed in blessing allah is it is conceived doing its work equally well in cursing allahs enemies wherefore the kafir is denounced by every sex age class and condition by the man of the worldfn34 as by the boy at school and out of as well as in the mosque if you ask your friend who is the person with a black turband he replies  a christian allah make his countenance cold  if you inquire of your servant who are the people singing in the next house it is ten to one that his answer will be  jews may their lot be jahannam  it appears unintelligible still it is not less true that egyptians who have lived as servants under european roofs for years retain the liveliest loathing for the manners  p111and customs of their masters few franks save those who have mixed with the egyptians in oriental disguise are aware of their repugnance to and contempt for europeansso well is the feeling veiled under the garb of innate politeness and so great is their reserve when conversing with those of strange religions i had a good opportunity of ascertaining the truth when the first rumour of a russian war arose almost every ablebodied man spoke of hastening to the jihada crusade or holy warand the only thing that looked like apprehension was the too eager depreciation of their foes all seemed delighted with the idea of french cooperation for somehow or other the frenchman is everywhere popular when speaking of england they were not equally easy heads were rolled pious sentences were ejaculated and finally out came the old eastern cry of a truth they are shaytans those englishfn35 the austrians are despised because the east knows nothing of them since the days when osmanli hosts threatened the gates of vienna the greeks are hated as clever scoundrels ever ready to do alislam a mischief the maltese the greatest of cowards off their own ground are regarded with a profound contempt these are the proteges which bring the british nation into disrepute at cairo and italians are known chiefly as istruttori and distruttorifn36doctors druggists and pedagogues  yet egyptian human nature is like

european nation secures egypt will win a treasure moated on the north and south by seas with a glacis of impassable deserts to the eastward and westward capable of supporting an army of 180000 men of

the present state of popular feeling would offer p114even less difficulty to an invader or a foreign ruler than the olema briefly egypt is the most tempting prize which the east holds out to the ambition of europe not excepted even the golden horn  fn1 in the capitals of the columns for instance fn2 this direct derivation is readily detected in the mosques at old cairo fn3 the roof supported by arches resting on pillars was unknown to classic antiquity and in the earliest ages of alislam the cloisters were neither arched nor domed a modern writer justly observes a compound of arcade and colonnade was suggested to the architects of the middle ages by the command that ancient buildings gave them of marble columns fn4 the oriental mind says a clever writer on indian subjects has achieved everything save real greatness of aim and execution that the arab mind always aimed and still aims at the physically great is sufficiently evident nothing affords the meccans greater pride than the vast size of their temple nothing is more humiliating to the people of almadinah than the comparative smallness of their mosque still with a few exceptions arab greatness is the vulgar great not the grand fn5 that is to say imitations of the human form all the doctors of alislam however differ on this head some absolutely forbidding any delineation of what has life under pain of being cast into hell others permitting pictures even of the bodies though not of the faces of men the arabs are the strictest of misiconists yet even they allow plans and pictures of the holy shrines other nations are comparatively lax the alhambra abounds in paintings and frescoes the persians never object to depict in books and on walls the battles of rustam and the turks preserve in the seraglio treasury of constantinople portraits by greeks and other artists of their sultans in regular succession fn6 this is at least a purer taste than that of our gothic architects who ornamented their cathedrals with statuary so inappropriate as to suggest to the antiquary remains of the worship of the hellespontine god fn7 at bruges bologna st stefano and nurnberg there are if i recollect right imitations of the holy sepulchre although the palmer might not detect the resemblance at first sight that in the church of jerusalem at bruges was built by a merchant who travelled three times to palestine in order to ensure correctness and totally failed arab art says a writer in the athenaeum sprang from the koran as the gothic did from the bible he should have remembered that arab art in its present shape was borrowed by alwalid from the greeks and perhaps in part from the persians and the hindus but that the model buildings existed at meccah and in alyaman centuries before the people had luxurious shawls and weavings of cashmere to suggest mural decoration fn8 see theophile gautiers admirable description of the mosque at cordova fn9 joseph pitts of exeter declares that cairo

young egyptians who will readily receive a pair of common green persiennes in exchange for fine old windows of elaborately carved wood they are as sensible in a variety of other small matters natives of a hot climate generally wear slippers of red and yellow leather because they are cool and comfortable on the banks of the nile the old chaussure is gradually yielding to black shoes which blister the feet with heat but are european and therefore bon ton it must however be confessed that the fine old carved woodwork of the windows was removed because it was found to be dangerous in cases of fire fn16 irreligious men neglect this act of propriety there are many in egypt who will habitually transgress one of the fundamental orders of their faith namely never to pray when in a state of religious impurity in popular argot prayer without ablution is called salat mamlukiyah or slaves prayers because such men perform their devotions only in order to avoid the masters staff others will

religious zeal has encouraged the unprincipled to steal and sell mss marked with the warning words the hijaz in particular has been inundated with books from egypt cairo has still some large libraries but most of them are private property and the proprietors will not readily lend or give access to their treasures the principal opportunity of buying books is during the month ramazan when they are

for mnemonic purposes but thereby rendered so difficult as to require the lengthy commentary of alashmumi the fifth is the wellknown work called the katr alnida the dew drop celebrated from cairo to kabul and last of all the azhari fn28 i know little of the hanafi school but the name of the following popular works were given to me by men upon whose learning i could depend the book first read is the text called marah alfalah containing about twenty pages and its commentary which is about six times longer then comes the matn alkanz a brief text of from 35 to 40 pages followed by three long sharh the shortest of these altai contains 500 pages the next mulla miskin at least 900 and the sharh ayni nearly 2000 to these succeeds the text aldurar the work of the celebrated khusraw 200 pages with a large commentary by the same author and last is the matn tanwir alabsar containing about 500 pages and its sharh a work upwards of four times the size many of these books may be foundespecially when the ms is an old onewith hashiyah or marginal notes but most men write them for themselves so that there is no generally used collection the abovementioned are the works containing a full course of theological study it is rare however to find a man who reads beyond the alkanz with the shortest of its commentaries the altai fn29 he begins with a little text called after the name of its author abu shujaa of isfahan and proceeds to its commentary a book of about 250 pages by ibn kasim of ghazzah gaza there is another sharh neatly four times larger than this alkhatib it is seldom read then comes altahrir the work of zakariya alansaria celebrated divine buried in the mosque of alshafeiand its commentary by the same author a goodly ms of 600 pages most students here cry enough the ambitious pass on to alminhaj and its commentary 1600 pages nor need they stop at this point a man may addle his brains over moslem theology as upon aristotles schoolmen till his eyesight fails himboth subjects are all but interminable fn30 the three best known are the arbain alnawawi and the sahihaynthe two universally acknowledged to be trustworthyby almuslim and albokhari celebrated divines the others are aljami alsaghir the smaller collection so called to distinguish it from a rarer book aljami alkabir the greater collection both are the work of alsiyuti the full course concludes with alshifa shamail and the labours of kazi ayyaz fn31 two tafsirs are known all over the modern world the smaller one is called jalalani the two jalals ie the joint work of jalal alsiyuti and jalal almahalli and fills two stout volumes octavo the larger is the exposition of albayzawi which is supposed to contain the whole subject some few divines read alkhazin fn32 to conclude the list of moslem studies not purely religious almantik or logic is little valued it is read when judged advisable after alnahw from which it flows and before maani bayan rhetoric to which it leads in egypt students are generally directed to fortify their memories and give themselves a logical turn of mind by application to aljabr algebra the only logical works known are the isaghuji the greek text of porphyry alshamsiyah the book alsullam with its sharh alakhzari and lastly kazi mir equally neglected are the tawarikh history and the hikmat or philosophy once so ardently cultivated by moslem savans indeed it is now all but impossible to get books upon these subjects for upwards of six weeks i ransacked the stalls and the bazar in order to find some one of the multitudinous annals of alhijaz without seeing for sale anything but the fourth volume of a large biographical work called alakd alsamin fi tarikh albalad alamin the ilm alaruz or prosody is not among the arabs as with us a chapter hung on to the tail of grammar it is a long and difficult study prosecuted only by those who wish to distinguish themselves in arabiyatthe poetry and the eloquence of the ancient and modern arabs the poems generally studied with the aid of commentaries which impress every verse upon the memory are the burdah and the hamziyah wellknown odes by mohammed of abusir they abound in obsolete words and are useful at funerals as on other solemn occasions the banat suadi by kaab alahbar or akhbar a companion of the apostle and the diwan umar ibn fariz a celebrated mystic are also learned compositions few attempt the bulky volume of almutanabbithough many place it open upon the sofafewer still the tenebrous compositions of alhariri nor do the modern egyptians admire those fragments of ancient arab poets which seem so sweetly simple to the european ear the change of faith has altered the national taste to such an extent that the decent bard must now sing of woman in the masculine gender for which reason a host of modern poetasters can attract the public ear which is deaf to the voices of the golden song in the exact sciences the egyptian moslems a backward race according to european estimation are far superior to the persians and the moslems of india some of them become tolerable arithmeticians though very inferior to the coptic christians they have good and simple treatises on algebra and still display some of their ancestors facility in the acquisition of geometry the ilm almikat or calendarcalculating was at one time publicly taught in the azhar the printingpress has doomed that study to death the natural sciences find but scant favour on the banks of the nile astronomy is still astrology geography a heap of names and natural history a mass of fables alchemy geomancy and summoning of fiends are pet pursuits but the former has so bad a name that even amongst friends it is always alluded to as ilm alkafthe science of k so called from the initial letter of the word kimiya of the state of therapeutics i have already treated at length aided by the finest of ears and flexible organs of articulation the egyptian appears to possess many of the elements of a good linguist the stranger wonders to hear a cairene donkeyboy shouting sentences in three or four european dialects with a pronunciation as pure as his own how far this people succeed in higher branches of language my scanty experience does not enable me to determine but even for students of arabic nothing can be more imperfect than those useful implements vocabularies and dictionaries the cairenes have it is true the kamus of fayruzabadi but it has never been printed in egypt it is therefore rare and when found lost pages and clerical errors combined with the intrinsic difficulty of the style exemplify the saying of golius that the most learned orientalist must act the part of a diviner before he can perform that of interpreter they have another lexicon the sihah and an abbreviation of the same the sihah alsaghir or the lesser both of them liable to the same objections as the kamus for the benefit of the numerous students of turkish and persian short grammars and vocabularies have been printed at a cheap price but the former are upon the model of arabic a language essentially different in formation and the latter are mere strings of words as a specimen of the state of periodical literature i may quote the history of the bulak independent as europeans facetiously call it when mohammed ali determining to have an organ directed an officer to be editor of a weekly paper the officer replied that no one would read it and consequently that no one would pay for it the pasha remedied this by an order that a subscription should be struck off from the pay of all employes european and egyptian whose salary amounted to a certain sum upon which the editor accepted the task but being paid before his work was published he of course never supplied his subscribers with their copies fn33 would not a superficial hasty and somewhat prejudiced egyptian or persian say exactly the same thing about the systems of christ church and trinity college fn34 and when the man of the world as sometimes happens professes to see no difference in the forms of faith or whispers that his residence in europe has made him friendly to the christian religion you will be justified in concluding his opinions to be latitudinarian fn35 i know only one class in egypt favourable to the englishthe donkey boysand they found our claim to the possession of the country upon a base scarcely admissible by those skilled in casuistry namely that we hire more asses than any other nation fn36 the story is that mohammed ali used to offer his flocks of foreigners their choice of two professionsdestruction that is to say physic or instruction fn37 of this instances abound lately an order was issued to tax the villages of the badawin settled upon the edge of the western desert who even in mohammed alis time were allowed to live free of assessment the aulad ali inhabitants of a little village near the pyramids refused to pay and turned out with their matchlocks defying the pasha the government then insisted upon their leaving their houses and living under haircloth like badawin since they claimed the privileges of badawin the sturdy fellows at once pitched their tents and when i returned to cairo in december 1853 they had deserted their village i could offer a score of such cases proving the present debased condition of egypt fn38 at constantinople the french were the first to break through the shameful degradation to which the ambassadors of infidel powers were bribed by 300 or 400 rations a day to submit m de saint priest refused to give up his sword general sebastiani insisted upon wearing his military boots and the republican aubert dubajet rejected the dinner and the rich dress with which the naked and hungry barbarian who ventured to rub his brow upon the sublime porte was fed and clothed before being admitted to the presence saying that the ambassadors of france wanted neither this nor that at cairo m sabatier the french consulgeneral has had the merit of doing away with some customs prejudicial to the dignity of his nation the next english envoy will if anxious so to distinguish himself have an excellent opportunity it is usual after the first audience for the pasha to send in token of honour a sorry steed to the new comer this custom is a mere relic of the days when mohammed the second threatened to stable his charger in st peters and when a ride through the streets of cairo exposed the inspectorgeneral tott and his suite to lapidation and an avanie to send a good horse is to imply degradation but to offer a bad one is a positive insult fn39 as this canal has become a question of national interest its advisability is surrounded with all the circumstance of unsupported assertion and bold denial the english want a railroad which would confine the use of egypt to themselves the french desire a canal that would admit the hardy cruisers of the mediterranean into the red sea the cosmopolite will hope that both projects may be carried out even in the seventh century omar forbade amru to cut the isthmus of suez for fear of opening arabia to christian vessels as regards the feasibility of the shipcanal i heard m linant de bellefondsthe best authority upon all such subjects in egyptexpressly assert after levelling and surveying the line that he should have no difficulty in making it the canal is now a fact as late as april 1864 lord palmerston informed the house of commons that labourers might be more usefully employed in cultivating cotton than in digging a canal through a sandy desert and in making two harbours in deep mud and shallow water it is however understood that the premier was the only one of his cabinet who took this view mr robert stephenson ce certainly regretted before his death the opinion which he had been induced to express by desire fn40 there are at present about eighteen influential shaykhs at cairo too fanatic to listen to reason these it would be necessary to banish good information about what goes on in each mosque especially on fridays when the priests preach to the people and a guard of honour placed at the gates of the kazi the three muftis and the shaykh of the azhar are simple precautions sufficient to keep the olema in order fn41 these rakaiz alusab as they are called are the most influential part of the immense mass of dark intrigue which cairo like most oriental cities conceals beneath the light surface they generally appear in the ostensible state of barbers and dyers secretly they preside over their different factions and form a kind of small vehm the french used to pay these men but napoleon detecting them in stirring up the people whilst appearing to maintain public tranquillity shot eighteen or twenty about half their number and thereby improved the conduct of the rest they are to be managed as sir charles napier governed sindby keeping a watchful eye upon them a free administration of military law disarming the population and forbidding large bodies of men to assemble  p115chapter vii  preparations to quit cairo  at length the slow month of blessings passed away we rejoiced like romans finishing their quaresima when a salvo of artillery from the citadel announced the end of our lenten woes on the last day of ramazan all gave alms to the poor at the rate of a piastre and a half for each member of the householdslave servant and master the next day first of the three composing the bayram or idfn1 the lesser festival we arose before dawn performed our ablutions and repaired to the mosque to recite the peculiar prayer of the season and to hear the sermon which bade us be merry and wise after which we ate and drank heartily then with pipes and tobaccopouches in hand we sauntered out to enjoy the contemplation of smiling faces and street scenery  the favourite resort on this occasion is the large cemetery beyond the bab alnasrfn2that stern old massive gateway which opens upon the suez road there we found a scene of jollity tents and ambulant coffeehouses were full of men equipped in theiranglice  p116sunday best listening to singers and musicians smoking chatting and looking at jugglers buffoons snakecharmers darwayshes apeleaders and dancing boys habited in womens attire eatingstalls and lollipopshops booths full of playthings and sheds for lemonade and syrups lined the roads and disputed with swings and merrygorounds the regards of the little moslems and moslemahs the chief item of the crowd fair cairenes carried in their hands huge palm branches intending to ornament therewith the tombs of parents and friends yet even on this solemn occasion there is they say not a little flirtation and lovemaking parties of policemen are posted with orders to interrupt all such irregularities with a long cane but their vigilance is notoriously unequal to the task i could not help observing that frequent pairs doubtless cousins or other relations wandered to unusual distances among the sandhills and that sometimes the confusion of a distant bastinado struck the ear these trifles did not however by any means interfere with the general joy every one wore something new most people were in the fresh suits of finery intended to last through the year and so strong is personal vanity in the breasts of orientals men and women young and old that from cairo to calcutta it would be difficult to find a sad heart under a handsome coat the men swaggered the women minced their steps rolled their eyes and were eternally arranging and coquetting with their headveils the little boys strutting about foully abused any one of their number who might have a richer suit than his neighbours and the little girls ogled every one in the ecstacy of conceit and glanced contemptuously at other little girls their rivals  weary of the country the haji and i wandered about the city paying visits which at this time are like newyear calls in continental europe i can describe the   p117operation of calling in egypt only as the discussion of pipes and coffee in one place and of coffee and pipes in another but on this occasion whenever we meet a friend we throw ourselves upon each others breast placing right arms over left shoulders and vice versa squeezing like wrestlers with intermittent hugs then laying cheek to cheek delicately at the same time making the loud noise of many kisses in the airfn3 the compliment of the season is kullam antum bil khayrevery year may you be wellin fact our many happy returns of the day after this come abundant good wishes and kindly prophecies and from a religious person a blessing and a short prayer to complete the resemblance between a moslem and a christian festival we have dishes of the day fish shurayk the crossbun and a peculiarly indigestible cake called in egypt kahkfn4 the plumpudding of alislam  this years id was made gloomy comparatively speaking by the state of politics report of war with russia with france with england who was going to land three million men at suez and with infideldom in general rang through egypt and the city of marsfn5 became unusually martial the government armouries arsenals and manufactories were crowded with kidnapped workmen those who purposed a pilgrimage feared forcible detention wherever men gathered together in the mosques for instance or the coffeehouses the police  p118closed the doors and made forcible capture of the ablebodied this proceeding almost as barbarous as our impressment law filled the main streets with detachments of squalidlooking wretches marching to be made soldiers with collars round their necks and irons on their wrists the dismal impression of the scene was deepened by crowds of women who habited in mourning and scattering dust and mud over their rent garments followed their sons brothers and husbands with cries and shrieks the deathwail is a peculiar way of cheering on the patriot departing pro patria mori and the origin of the custom is characteristic of the people the principal public amusements allowed to oriental women are those that come under the general name of fantasiabirthfeasts marriage festivals and funerals and the early campaigns of mohammed alis family in syria and alhijaz having in many cases deprived the bereaved of their sexright to keen for the dead they have now determined not to waste the opportunity but to revel in the luxury of woe at the live mans wakefn6  another cloud hung over cairo rumours of conspiracy were afloat the jews and christianshere as ready to take alarm as the english in italytrembled at the fancied preparations for insurrection massacre and plunder and even the moslems whispered that some hundred desperadoes had resolved to fire the city beginning with the bankers quarter and to spoil the wealthy egyptians of course hh abbas pasha was absent at the time and even had he been at cairo his presence would have been of little use the ruler can do nothing  p119towards restoring confidence to a panicstricken oriental nation  at the end of the id as a counterirritant to political excitement the police magistrates began to bully the people there is a standing order in the chief cities of egypt that all who stir abroad after dark without a lantern shall pass the night in the stationhousefn7 but at cairo in certain quarters the azbakiyahfn8 for instance a little laxity is usually allowed before i left the capital the licence was withdrawn and the sudden strictness caused many ludicrous scenes  if by chance you clad in oriental garb had sent on your lantern to a friends house by your servant and had leisurely followed it five minutes after the hour of eight you were sure to be met stopped collared questioned and captured by the patrol you probably punched three or four of them but found the dozen too strong for you held tightly by the sleeves skirts and collar of your wide outer garment you were hurried away on a plane of about nine inches above the ground your feet mostly treading the air you were dragged along with a rapidity which scarcely permitted you to answer strings of questions concerning your name nation dwelling faith profession and self in generalespecially concerning the present state of your purse if you lent an ear to the voice of the charmer that began by asking a crown to release you and gradually came down to twopence halfpenny you fell into a simple trap the buttend of a musket applied a posteriori immediately after the transfer of property convicted you of wilful waste but if more sensibly you pretended to have forgotten your purse you  p120were reviled and dragged with increased violence of shaking to the office of the zabit or police magistrate you were spun through the large archway leading to the court every fellow in uniform giving you as you passed a kafa cuff on the back of the neck despite your rage you were forced up the stairs to a long gallery full of people in a predicament like your own again your name nationi suppose you to be masqueradingoffence and other particulars were asked and carefully noted in a folio by a ferociouslooking clerk if you knew no better you were summarily thrust into the hasil or condemned cell to pass the night with pickpockets or ruffians pellmell but if an adept in such matters you insisted upon being conducted before the pasha of the night and the clerk fearing to refuse you were hurried to the great mans office hoping for justice and dealing out ideal vengeance to your captorsthe patrol here you found the dignitary sitting with pen ink and paper before him and pipe and coffeecup in hand upon a wide diwan of dingy chintz in a large dimlylit room with two guards by his side and a semicircle of recent seizures vociferating before him when your turn came you were carefully collared and led up to the presence as if even at that awful moment you were mutinously and murderously disposed the pasha looking at you with a vicious sneer turned up his nose ejaculated ajami and prescribed the bastinado you observed that the mere fact of being a persian did not give mankind a right to capture imprison and punish you you declared moreover that you were no persian but an indian under british protection the pasha a man accustomed to obedience then stared at you to frighten you and you we will suppose stared at him till with an oath he turned to the patrol and asked them your offence they all simultaneously sworeby allahthat you had been found without a lantern deaddrunk beating respectable people  p121breaking into houses invading and robbing harims you openly told the pasha that they were eating abominations upon which he directed one of his guards to smell your breaththe charge of drunkenness being tangible the fellow a comrade of your capturers advanced his nose to your lips as might be expected cried kikh contorted his countenance and answered by the beard of effendinafn9 that he perceived a pestilent odour of distilled waters this announcement probably elicited a grim grin from the pasha of the night who loves curaçoa and who is not indifferent to the charms of cognac then by his favour for you improved the occasion you were allowed to spend the hours of darkness on a wooden bench in the adjacent long gallery together with certain little parasites for which polite language has no namefn10 in the morning the janissary of your consulate was sent for he came and claimed you you were led off criminally again you gave your name and address and if your offence was merely sending on your lantern you were dismissed with advice to be more careful in future and assuredly your first step was towards the hammam  but if on the other hand you had declared yourself a european you would either have been dismissed at once or sent to your consul who is here judge jury and jailor egyptian authority has of late years lost half its prestige when mr lane first settled at cairo all europeans accused of aggression against moslems were he tells us surrendered to the turkish magistrates now the native powers have no jurisdiction over strangers  p122nor can the police enter their houses if the west would raise the character of its eastern coreligionists it will be forced to push the system a point further and to allow all bonafide christian subjects to register their names at the different consulates whose protection they might prefer this is what russia has so unwarrantably and outrageously attempted we confine ourselves to a lesser injustice which deprives eastern states of their right as independent powers to arrest and to judge foreigners who for interest or convenience settle in their dominions but we still shudder at the right of arrogating any such claim over the born lieges of oriental powers what however would be the result were great britain to authorise her sons resident at paris or florence to refuse attendance at a french or an italian court of justice and to demand that the police should never force the doors of an english subject i commend this consideration to all those who stickle for abstract rights when the interest and progress of others are concerned and who become somewhat latitudinarian and concrete in cases where their own welfare and aggrandisement are at stake  besides patients i made some pleasant acquaintances at cairo antun zananire a young syrian of considerable attainments as a linguist paid me the compliment of permitting me to see the fair face of his harim mr hatchadur nury an armenian gentleman well known in bombay amongst other acts of kindness introduced me to one of his compatriots khwajah yusuf whose advice was most useful to me the khwajah had wandered far and wide picking up everywhere some scrap of strange knowledge and his history was a romance expelled from cairo for a youthful peccadillo he started upon his travels qualified himself for sanctity at meccah and almadinah became a religious beggar at baghdad studied french at paris and finally settled  p123down as a professor of languagesfn11 under an amnesty at cairo in his house i saw an armenian marriage the occasion was memorable after the gloom and sameness of moslem society nothing could be more gladdening than the unveiled face of a pretty woman some of the guests were undeniably charming brunettes with the blackest possible locks and the brightest conceivable eyes only one pretty girl wore the national costumefn12 yet they all smoked chibuks and sat upon the diwans and as they entered the room they kissed with a sweet simplicity the hands of the priest and of the other old gentlemen present   among the number of my acquaintances was a meccan boy mohammed albasyuni from whom i bought the pilgrimgarb called alihram and the kafan or shroud with which the moslem usually starts upon such a journey as mine he being in his way homewards after a visit to constantinople was most anxious to accompany me in the character of a companion but he had travelled too much to suit me he had visited india he had seen englishmen and he had lived with the nawab balu of surat moreover he showed signs of overwisdom he had been a regular visitor till i cured one of his friends of an ophthalmia after which  p124he gave me his address at meccah and was seen no more haji wali described him and his party to be nas jarrar extractors and certainly he had not misjudged them but the sequel will prove how der mensch denkt und gott lenkt and as the boy mohammed eventually did become my companion throughout the pilgrimage i will place him before the reader as summarily as possible  he is a beardless youth of about eighteen chocolatebrown with high features and a bold profile his bony and decided meccan cast of face is lit up by the peculiar egyptian eye which seems to descend from generation to generationfn13 his figure is short and broad with a tendency to be obese the result of a strong stomach and the power of sleeping at discretion he can read a little write his name and is uncommonly clever at a bargain meccah had taught him to speak excellent arabic to understand the literary dialect to be eloquent in abuse and to be profound at prayer and pilgrimage constantinople had given him a taste for anacreontic singing and female society of the questionable kind a love of strong watersthe hypocrite looked positively scandalised when i first suggested the subjectand an offhand latitudinarian mode of dealing with serious subjects in general i found him to be the youngest son of a widow whose doting fondness had moulded his disposition he was selfish and affectionate as spoiled children usually are volatile easily offended and as easily pacified the oriental coveting other mens goods and profuse of his own the arab with a matchless intrepidity of countenance the traveller brazen lunged not more than half brave exceedingly astute with an acute sense of honour especially where his  p125relations were concerned the individual i have seen him in a fit of fury because some one cursed his father and he and i nearly parted because on one occasion i applied to him an epithet which etymologically considered might be exceedingly insulting to a highminded brother but which in popular parlance signifies nothing this point dhonneur was the boy mohammeds strong point  during the ramazan i laid in my stores for the journey these consisted of tea coffee loafsugar rice dates biscuit oil vinegar tobacco lanterns and cooking pots a small bellshaped tent costing twelve shillings and three waterskins for the desertfn14 the provisions were placed in a kafas or hamper artistically made of palm sticks and in a huge sahharah or wooden box about three feet each way covered with leather or skin and provided with a small lid fitting into the topfn15 the  p126former together with my green box containing medicines and saddlebags full of clothes hung on one side of the camel a counterpoise to the big sahharah on the other flank the badawin like muleteers always requiring a balance of weight on the top of the load was placed transversely a shibriyah or cot on which shaykh nur squatted like a large crow this worthy had strutted out into the streets armed with a pair of horsepistols and a sword almost as long as himself no sooner did the mischievous boys of cairothey are as bad as the gamins of paris and londoncatch sight of him than they began to scream with laughter at the sight of the hindi indian in arms till like a vagrant owl pursued by a flight of larks he ran back into the caravanserai  having spent all my ready money at cairo i was obliged to renew the supply my native acquaintances advised me to take at least eighty pounds sterling and considering the expense of outfit for desert travelling the sum did not appear excessive i should have found some difficulty in raising the money had it not been for the kindness of a friend at alexandria john thurburn now i regret to say no more and mr sam shepheard then of shepheards hotel cairo presently a landed proprietor near rugby and now also gone my indians scrutinised the diminutive square of paperfn16the  p127letter of creditas a raven may sometimes be seen peering with head askance into the interior of a suspected marrowbone can this be a bonafide draft they mentally inquired and finally they offered politely to write to england for me to draw the money and to forward it in a sealed bag directed almadinah i need scarcely say that such a style of transmission would in the case of precious metals have left no possible chance of its safe arrival when the difficulty was overcome i bought fifty pounds worth of german dollars maria theresas and invested the rest in english and turkish sovereignsfn17 the gold i myself carried part of the silver i sewed up in shaykh nurs leather waistbelt and part was packed in the boxes for this reasonwhen badawin begin plundering a respectable man if they find a certain amount of ready money in his baggage they do not search his person if they find none they proceed to a bodily inspection and if his waistbelt be empty they are rather disposed to rip open his stomach in the belief that he must have some peculiarly ingenious way of secreting valuables having passed through this trouble i immediately fell into another my hardlyearned alexandrian passport required a double visa one at the police office the other at the consuls after returning to egypt i found it was the practice of travellers  p128who required any civility from dr walne then the english official at cairo to enter the presence furnished with an order from the foreign office  i had neglected the precaution and had ample reason to regret having done so failing at the british consulate and unwilling to leave cairo without being en reglethe egyptians warned me that suez was a place of obstacles to pilgrimsfn18i was obliged to look elsewhere for protection my friend haji wali was the first consulted after a long discussion he offered to take me to his consul the persian and to find out for what sum i could become a temporary subject of the shah we went to the sign of the lion and the sun and we found the dragomanfn19 a subtle syrian christian who  p129after a rigid inquiry into the state of my purse my country was no consideration at allfn20 introduced me to the great man i have described this personage once already and he merits not a second notice the interview was truly ludicrous he treated us with exceeding hauteur motioned me to sit almost out of hearing and after rolling his head in profound silence for nearly a quarter of an hour vouchsafed the information that though my father might be a shirazi and my mother an afghan he had not the honour of my acquaintance his companion a large old persian with polyphemean eyebrows and a mulberry beard put some gruff and discouraging questions i quoted the verses  he is a man who benefits his fellow men not he who says ‘why and ‘wherefore and ‘how much  upon which an imperious wave of the arm directed me to return to the dragoman who had the effrontery to ask me four pounds sterling for a persian passport i offered one he derided my offer and i went away perplexed on my return to cairo some months afterwards he sent to say that had he known me as an englishman i should have had the document gratisa civility for which he was duly thanked  at last my shaykh mohammed hit upon the plan thou art said he an afghan i will fetch hither the principal of the afghan college at the azhar and he if  p130thou make it worth his while this in a whisper will be thy friend the case was looking desperate my preceptor was urged to lose no time  presently shaykh mohammed returned in company with the principal a little thin raggedbearded oneeyed harelipped divine dressed in very dirty clothes of nondescript cut born at maskat of afghan parents and brought up at meccah he was a kind of cosmopolite speaking five languages fluently and full of reminiscences of toil and travel he refused pipes and coffee professing to be ascetically disposed but he ate more than half my dinner to reassure me i presume should i have been fearful that abstinence might injure his health we then chatted in sundry tongues i offered certain presents of books which were rejected such articles being valueless and the shaykh abd alwahhab having expressed his satisfaction at my account of myself told me to call for him at the azhar mosque next morning  accordingly at six pm shaykh mohammed and abdullah khanfn21the latter equipped in a gigantic spriggedmuslin turband so as to pass for a student of theologyrepaired to alazhar passing through the open quadrangle we entered the large hall which forms the body of the mosque in the northern wall was a dwarf door leading by breakneck stairs to a pigeonhole the study of the learned afghan shaykh we found him ensconced behind piles of musty and greasy manuscripts surrounded by scholars and scribes with whom he was cheapening books he had not much business to transact but long before he was ready the stifling atmosphere drove us out of the study and we repaired to the hall presently the shaykh joined us and we all rode on to the citadel and waited in a mosque till the office hour struck when the doors were opened we went into the  p131diwan and sat patiently till the shaykh found an opportunity of putting in a word the officials were two in number one an old invalid very thin and sicklylooking dressed in the turcoeuropean style whose hand was being severely kissed by a troop of religious beggars to whom he had done some small favours the other was a stout young clerk whose duty it was to engross and not to have his hand kissed  my name and other essentials were required and no objections were offered for who holier than the shaykh abd alwahhab ibn yunus alsulaymani the clerk filled up a printed paper in the turkish language apparent1y borrowed from the european method for spoiling the traveller certified me upon the shaykhs security to be one abdullah the son of yusuf joseph originally from kabul described my person and in exchange for five piastres handed me the document i received it with joy  with bows and benedictions and many wishes that allah might make it the officials fate to become pilgrims we left the office and returned towards alazhar when we had nearly reached the mosque shaykh mohammed lagged behind and made the sign i drew near the afghan and asked for his hand he took the hint and muttering it is no matterit is not necessaryby allah it is not required extended his fingers and brought the musculus guineorum to bear upon three dollars  poor man i believe it was his necessity that consented to be paid for the doing a common act of moslem charity he had a wife and children and the calling of an alimfn22 is no longer worth much in egypt  my departure from cairo was hastened by an accident i lost my reputation by a little misfortune that happened in this wise  p132at haji walis room in the caravanserai i met a yuzbashi or captain of albanian irregulars who was in egypt on leave from alhijaz he was a tall bony and broadshouldered mountaineer about forty years old with the large bombe brow the fierce eyes thin lips lean jaws and peaky chin of his race his mustachios were enormously long and tapering and the rest of his face like his head was close shaven his fustanfn23 was none of the cleanest nor was the red cap which he wore rakishly pulled over his frowning forehead quite free from stains not permitted to carry the favourite pistols he contented himself with sticking his right hand in the empty belt and stalking about the house with a most military mien yet he was as little of a bully as carpet knight that same ali agha his body showed many a grisly scar and one of his shin bones had been broken by a turkish bullet when he was playing tricks on the albanian hillsan accident inducing a limp which he attempted to conceal by a heavy swagger when he spoke his voice was affectedly gruff he had a sad knack of sneering and i never saw him thoroughly sober  our acquaintance began with a kind of storm which blew over and left fine weather i was showing haji wali my pistols with damascene barrels when ali agha entered the room he sat down before me with a grin which said intelligibly enough what business have you with weaponssnatched the arm out of my hand and began to inspect it as a connoisseur not admiring this procedure i wrenched it away from him and addressing myself to haji wali proceeded quietly with my dissertation the captain of irregulars and i then looked at each other he cocked his cap on one side in token of excited pugnacity i twirled my moustachios to display a kindred emotion had he been armed and in alhijaz  p133we should have fought it out at once for the arnauts are terribili colla pistola as the italians say meaning that upon the least provocation they pull out a horsepistol and fire it in the face of friend or foe of course the only way under these circumstances is to anticipate them but even this desperate prevention seldom saves a stranger as whenever there is danger these men go about in pairs i never met with a more reckless brood upon the line of march albanian troops are not allowed ammunition for otherwise there would be half a dozen duels a day when they quarrel over their cups it is the fashion for each man to draw a pistol and to place it against his opponents breast the weapons being kept accurately clean seldom miss fire and if one combatant draw trigger before the other he would immediately be shot down by the bystandersfn24 in egypt these menwho are used as irregulars and are often quartered upon the hapless villagers when unable or unwilling to pay taxeswere the terror of the population on many occasions they have quarrelled with foreigners and insulted european women in alhijaz their recklessness awes even the badawin the townspeople say of them that tripesellers and bathservants at stambul they become pharaohs tyrants ruffians in arabia at jeddah the arnauts have amused themselves with firing at the english consul mr ogilvie when he walked upon his terrace and this manshooting appears a favourite sport with them at cairo numerous stories illustrate the sang froid with which they used to knock over the cameldrivers if any one dared to ride past their barracks the albanians vaunt their skill in using weapons and their pretensions impose upon arabs as well as egyptians yet i have never found them wonderful with any arm  p134the pistol alone excepted and our officers who have visited their native hills speak of them as tolerable but by no means firstrate rifle shots  the captain of irregulars being unhappily debarred the pleasure of shooting me after looking fierce for a time rose and walked majestically out of the room a day or two afterwards he called upon me civilly enough sat down drank a cup of coffee smoked a pipe and began to converse but as he knew about a hundred arabic words and i as many turkish our conversation was carried on under difficulties presently he asked me in a whisper for arakifn25 i replied that there was none in the house which induced a sneer and an ejaculation sounding like himar ass the slang synonym amongst fast moslems for waterdrinker after rising to depart he seized me waggishly with an eye to a trial of strength thinking that an indian doctor and a temperance man would not be very dangerous he exposed himself to what is professionally termed a crossbuttock and had his nut come in contact with the stone floor instead of my bed he might not have drunk for many a day the fall had a good effect upon his temper he jumped up  p135patted my head called for another pipe and sat down to show me his wounds and to boast of his exploits i could not help remarking a ring of english gold with a bezel of bloodstone sitting strangely upon his coarse sunstained hand he declared that it had been snatched by him from a konsul consul at jeddah and he volubly related in a mixture of albanian turkish and arabic the history of his acquisition he begged me to supply him with a little poison that would not lie for the purpose of quieting a troublesome enemy and he carefully stowed away in his pouch five grains of calomel which i gave him for that laudable purpose before taking leave he pressed me strongly to go and drink with him i refused to do so during the day but wishing to see how these men sacrifice to bacchus promised compliance that night about nine oclock when the caravanserai was quiet i took a pipe and a tobaccopouchfn26 stuck my dagger in my belt and slipped into ali aghas room he was sitting on a bed spread upon the ground in front of him stood four wax candles all orientals hate drinking in any but a bright light and a tray containing a basin of stuff like soup maigre a dish of cold stewed meat and two bowls of salatahfn27 sliced cucumber and curds the materials peeped out of an iron pot filled with water one was a long thin whiteglass flask of araki the other a bottle of some strong  p136perfume both were wrapped up in wet rags the usual refrigerator  ali agha welcomed me politely and seeing me admire the preparations bade me beware how i suspected an albanian of not knowing how to drink he made me sit by him on the bed threw his dagger to a handy distance signalled me to do the same and prepared to begin the bout taking up a little tumbler in shape like those from which french postilions used to drink la goutte he inspected it narrowly wiped out the interior with his forefinger filled it to the brim and offered it to his guestfn28 with a bow i received it with a low salam swallowed its contents at once turned it upside down in proof of fair play replaced it upon the floor with a jaunty movement of the arm somewhat like a pugilist delivering a rounder bowed again and requested him to help himself the same ceremony followed on his part immediately after each glassand rapidly the cup went aboutwe swallowed a draught of water and ate a spoonful of the meat or the salatah in order to cool our palates then we reapplied ourselves to our pipes emitting huge puffs a sign of being fast men and looked facetiously at each otherdrinking being considered by moslems a funny and pleasant sort of sin  the albanian captain was at least half seas over when we began the bout yet he continued to fill and to drain without showing the least progress towards ebriety i in vain for a time expected the badmasti as the persians call it the horse play and the gross facetiae which generally  p137accompany southern and eastern tipsiness ali agha indeed occasionally took up the bottle of perfume filled the palm of his right hand and dashed it in my face i followed his example but our pleasantries went no further  presently my companion started a grand project namely that i should entice the respectable haji wali into the room where we might force him to drink the idea was facetious it was making a bowstreet magistrate polk at a casino i started up to fetch the haji and when i returned with him ali agha was found in a new stage of freshness he had stuck a greenleaved twig upright in the floor and had so turned over a gugglet of water that its contents trickled slowly in a tiny stream under the verdure whilst he was sitting before it mentally gazing with an outward show of grim quixotic tenderness upon the shady trees and the cool rills of his fatherland possibly he had peopled the place with young barbarians at play for verily i thought that a tear which had no business there was glistening in his stony eye  the appearance of haji wali suddenly changed the scene ali agha jumped up seized the visitor by the shoulder compelled him to sit down and ecstasied by the old mans horror at the scene filled a tumbler and with the usual grotesque grimaces insisted upon its being drunk off haji wali stoutly refused then ali agha put it to his own lips and drained it with a hurt feeling and reproachful aspect we made our unconvivial friend smoke a few puffs and then we returned to the charge in vain the haji protested that throughout life he had avoided the deadly sin in vain he promised to drink with us tomorrowin vain he quoted the koran and alternately coaxed and threatened us with the police we were inexorable at last the haji started upon his feet and rushed away regardless of any thing but escape  p138leaving his tarbush his slippers and his pipe in the hands of the enemy the host did not dare to pursue his recreant guest beyond the door but returning he carefully sprinkled the polluting liquid on the cap pipe and shoes and called the haji an ass in every tongue he knew  then we applied ourselves to supper and dispatched the soup the stew and the salatah a few tumblers and pipes were exhausted to obviate indigestion when ali agha arose majestically and said that he required a troop of dancing girls to gladden his eyes with a ballet  i represented that such persons are no longer admitted into caravanseraisfn29 he inquired with calm ferocity who hath forbidden it i replied the pasha upon which ali agha quietly removed his cap brushed it with his dexter forearm fitted it on his forehead raking forwards twisted his mustachios to the sharp point of a single hair shouldered his pipe and moved towards the door vowing that he would make the pasha himself come and dance before us  i foresaw a brawl and felt thankful that my boon companion had forgotten his dagger prudence whispered me to return to my room to bolt the door and to go to bed but conscience suggested that it would be unfair to abandon the albanian in his present helpless state i followed him into the outer gallery pulling him and begging him as a despairing wife might urge a drunken husband to return home and he like the british husband being greatly irritated by the unjovial advice instantly belaboured with his pipestickfn30 the first person  p139he met in the gallery and sent him flying down the stairs with fearful shouts of o egyptians o ye accursed o genus of pharaoh o race of dogs o egyptians  he then burst open a door with his shoulder and reeled into a room where two aged dames were placidly reposing by the side of their spouses who were basketmakers they immediately awoke seeing a stranger and hearing his foul words they retorted with a hot volley of vituperation  put to flight by the old womens tongues ali agha in spite of all my endeavours reeled down the stairs and fell upon the sleeping form of the night porter whose blood he vowed to drinkthe oriental form of threatening spiflication happily for the assaulted the aghas servant a sturdy albanian lad was lying on a mat in the doorway close by roused by the tumult he jumped up and found the captain in a state of fury apparently the man was used to the masters mood without delay he told us all to assist and we lending a helping hand half dragged and half carried the albanian to his room yet even in this ignoble plight he shouted with all the force of his lungs the old warcry o egyptians o race of dogs i have dishonoured all sikandariyahall kahirahall suwaysfn31 and in this vaunting frame of mind he was put to bed no welsh undergraduate at oxford under similar circumstances ever gave more trouble  you had better start on your pilgrimage at once  p140said haji wali meeting me the next morning with a goguenard smile  he was right throughout the caravanserai nothing was talked of for nearly a week but the wickedness of the captain of albanian irregulars and the hypocrisy of the staid indian doctor thus it was gentle reader that i lost my reputation of being a serious person at cairo and all i have to show for it is the personal experience of an albanian drinkingbout  i wasted but little time in taking leave of my friends telling them by way of precaution that my destination was meccah via jeddah and firmly determining if possible to make almadinah via yambu conceal says the arabs

accent and admirable phraseology besides their mother tongue turkish arabic persian and hindustani nor do they evince less aptitude for acquiring the occidental languages fn12 it has been too frequently treated of to leave room for a fresh description though pretty and picturesque it is open to the reproach of moslem dressing namely that the indoor toilette admits of a display of bust and is generally so scanty and flimsy that it is unfit to meet the eye of a stranger this probably the effect of secluding women has now become a cause for concealing them fn13 he was from the banks of

every one of the party at least as much as they did their owner my friends drank my coffee smoked my tobacco and ate my rice i bought better tea at meccah than at cairo and found as good sugar there it would have been wiser to lay in a small stock merely for the voyage to yambu in which case there might have been more economy but i followed the advice of those interested in setting me wrong turks and egyptians always go pilgrimaging with a large outfit as notably as the eastindian cadet of the present day and your outfitter at cairo as well as cornhill is sure to supply you with a variety of superfluities the tent was useful to me so were the waterskins which i preferred to barrels as being more portable and less liable to leak good skins cost about a dollar each they should be bought new and always kept half full of water fn15 this shape secures the lid which otherwise on account of the weight of the box would infallibly be torn off or burst open like the kafas the sahharah should be well padlocked and if the owner be a saving man he does not entrust his keys to a servant i gave away my kafas at yambu because it had been crushed during the seavoyage and i was obliged to leave the sahharah at almadinah as my badawi camelshaykh positively refused to carry it to meccah so that both these articles were well nigh useless to me the kafas cost four shillings and the sahharah about twelve when these large boxes are really strong and good they are worth about a pound sterling each fn16 at my final interview with the committee of the royal geographical society one member sir woodbine parish advised an order to be made out on the societys bankers another sir roderick murchison kindly offered to give me one on his own coutts  co but i having more experience in oriental travelling begged only to be furnished with a diminutive piece of paper permitting me to draw upon the society it was at once given by dr shaw the secretary and it proved of much use eventually it was purposely made as small as possible in order to fit into a talisman case but the traveller must bear in mind that if his letters of credit be addressed to orientals the sheet of paper should always be large and grandlooking these people have no faith in notescommercial epistolary or diplomatic fn17 before leaving cairo i bought english sovereigns for 112 and sold them in arabia for 122 piastres abu takahs pataks or spanish pillardollars as they are called in alhijaz cost me 24 piastres and in the holy city were worth 28 the sinku french five franc piece is bought for 22 piastres in egypt and sells at 24 in arabia the silver majidi costs 20 at cairo and is worth 22 in the red sea and finally i gained 3 piastres upon the gold ghazi of 19 such was the rate of exchange in 1853 it varies however perpetually and in 1863 may be totally different fn18 the reason of this will be explained in a future chapter fn19 the consular dragoman is one of the greatest abuses i know the tribe is for the most part levantine and christian and its connections are extensive the father will perhaps be interpreter to the english the son to the french consulate by this means the most privy affairs will become known to every member of the department except the head and eventually to that best of spytrainers the turkish government this explains how a subordinate whose pay is l200 per annum and who spends double that sum can afford after twelve or thirteen years service to purchase a house for l2000 and to furnish it for as much more besides which the condition the ideas and the very nature of these dragomans are completely oriental the most timid and cringing of men they dare not take the proper tone with a government to which in case of the expulsion of a consul they and their families would become subject and their prepossessions are utterly oriental hanna massara dragoman to the consulgeneral at cairo in my presence and before others advocated the secret murder of a moslem girl who had fled with a greek on the grounds that an adulteress must always be put to death either publicly or under the rose yet this man is an old and tried servant of the state such evils might be in part mitigated by employing english youths of whom an ample supply if there were any demand would soon be forthcoming this measure has been advocated by the best authorities but without success most probably the reason of the neglect is the difficulty how to begin or where to end the augean labour of consular reform fn20 in a previous chapter i have alluded to the species of protection formerly common in the east europe it is to be feared is not yet immaculate in this respect and men say that were a list of protected furnished by the different consulates at cairo it would be a curious

raki the cognac of egypt and turkey generically the word means any spirit specifically it is applied to that extracted from dates or dried grapes the latter is more expensive than the former and costs from 5 to 7 piastres the bottle it whitens the water like eau de cologne and being considered a stomachic is patronised by europeans as much as by asiatics in the azbakiyah gardens at cairo the traveller is astonished by perpetual shouts for sciroppo di gomma as if all the western population was afflicted with sore throat the reason is that spirituous liquors in a moslem land must not be sold in places of public resort so the infidel asks for a syrup of gum and obtains a dram of araki the favourite way of drinking it is to swallow it neat and to wash it down with a mouthful of cold water taken in this way it acts like the petit verre dabsinthe egyptian women delight in it and eastern topers of all classes and sexes prefer it to brandy and cognac the smell of which being strange is offensive to them fn26 when egyptians of the middle classes call upon one another the visitor always carries with him his tobaccopouch which he hands to the servant who fills his pipe fn27 the salatah is made as follows take a cucumber pare slice and place it in a plate sprinkling it over with salt after a few minutes season it abundantly with pepper and put it in a bowl containing some peppercorns and about a pint of curds when the dish is properly mixed a live coal is placed upon the top of the compound to make it bind as the arabs say it is considered a cooling dish and is esteemed by the abstemious as well as by the toper fn28 these albanians are at most half asiatic as regards manner in the east generally the host drinks of the cup and dips his hand into the dish before his guest for the same reason that the master of the house precedes his visitor over the threshold both actions denote that no treachery is intended and to reverse them as amongst us would be a gross breach of custom likely to excite the liveliest suspicions fn29 formerly these places like the coffeehouses were crowded with bad characters of late years the latter have been refused admittance but it would be as easy to bar the door to gnats and flies they appear as footpages as washerwomen as beggars in fact they evade the law with ingenuity and impunity fn30 ismail pasha was murdered by malik nimr chief of shendy for striking him with a chibuk across the face travellers would do well to remember that in these lands the pipestick and the slipper disgrace a man whereas a whip or a rod would not do so the probable reason of this is that the two articles of domestic use are applied slightingly not seriously to the purposes of punishment fn31 anglice alexandria cairo and suezan extensive field of operations  p141chapter viii  from cairo to suez  shaykh nassar a badawi of tur mount sinai being on his way homewards agreed to let me have two dromedaries for the sum of fifty piastres or about ten shillings eachfn1 being desirous to set out with a certain display of respectability i accepted these terms a man of humble pretensions would have travelled with a single animal and a camelman running behind him but besides ostentation i wanted my attendant to be mounted that we might make a forced march in order to ascertain how much a four years life of european effeminacy had impaired my powers of endurance the reader may believe the assertion that there are few better tests than an eightyfour mile ride in midsummer on a bad wooden saddle borne by a worse dromedary across the suez desert even the squire famed for being coppersheeted might not have disdained a trial of the kind  i started my indian boy and heavy luggage for suez two days before the end of the idladen camels generally taking fiftyfive or sixty hours to do the journey and i spent the intermediate time with haji wali he advised me to mount about 3 pm so that i might arrive at suez on the evening of the next day and assisted me  p142in making due preparations of water tobacco and provisions early on the morning of departure the afghan shaykh came to the caravanserai and breakfasted with us because allah willed it after a copious meal he bestowed upon me a stately benediction and would have embraced me but i humbly bent over his hand sad to relate immediately that his back was turned haji wali raised his forefinger to a right angle with the palm chaff and burst into a shout of irreverent laughter at three oclock nassar the badawi came to announce that the dromedaries were saddled i dressed myself sticking a pistol in my belt and passing the crimson silk cord of the hamail or pocket koran over my shoulder in token of being a pilgrim then distributing a few trifling presents to friends and servants and accompanied by the shaykh mohammed and haji wali i descended the stairs with an important gait in the courtyard squatted the camels dromedaries they could not be called and i found that a second driver was going to accompany us i objected to this as the extra badawi would of course expect to be fed by me but nassar swore that the man was his brother and as you rarely gain by small disputes with these people he was allowed to have his own way  then came the preparatory leavetakings haji wali embraced me heartily and so did my poor old shaykh who despite his decrepitude and my objections insisted upon accompanying me to the city gate i mounted the camel crossed my legs before the pommelstirrups are not used in egyptfn2and preceding my friend descended  p143the street leading towards the desert as we emerged from the huge gateway of the caravanserai all the bystanders except only the porter who believed me to be a persian and had seen me with the drunken captain exclaimed allah bless thee yalhajjfn3 and restore thee to thy country and thy friends and passing through the bab alnasr where i addressed the salutation of peace to the sentry and to the officer commanding the guard both gave me godspeed with great cordialityfn4the pilgrims blessing in asia like the old womans in europe being supposed to possess peculiar efficacy outside the gate my friends took a final leave of me and i will not deny having felt a tightening of heart as their honest faces and forms faded in the distance  but shaykh nassar switches his camels shoulder and appears inclined to take the lead this is a trial of manliness there is no time for emotion not a moment can be spared even for a retrospect i kick my dromedary who steps out into a jogtrot the badawin with a loud ringing laugh attempt to give me the goby i resist and we continue like children till the camels are at their speed though we have eightyfour miles before us and above us an atmosphere like a furnace blast the road is deserted at this hour otherwise grave moslem  p144travellers would have believed the police to be nearer than convenient to us  presently we drew rein and exchanged our pace for one more seasonable whilst the sun began to tell on man and beast high raised as we were above the ground the reflected heat struck us sensibly and the glare of a macadamized road added a few extra degrees of caloricfn5 the badawin to refresh themselves prepare to smoke they fill my chibuk light it with a flint and steel and cotton dipped in a solution of gunpowder and pass it over to mefn6 after a few puffs i return it to them and they use it turn by turn then they begin to while away the tedium of the road by asking questions which passetemps is not easily exhausted for they are never satisfied till they know as much of you as you do of yourself they next resort to talking about victuals for with this hungry race food as a topic of conversation takes the place of money in happier lands and lastly even this engrossing subject being exhausted for the moment  p145they take refuge in singing and monotonous and droning as it is their modinha has yet an artless plaintiveness which admirably suits the singer and the scenery if you listen to the words you will surely hear allusions to bright verdure cool shades bubbling rills or something which hereabouts man hath not and yet which his soul desires  and now while nassar and his brother are chaunting a duetthe refrain being  wal arz mablul bi matar and the earth wet with rain  i must crave leave to say a few words despite the triteness of the subject about the modern sinaitic race of arabs  besides the tribes occupying the northern parts of the peninsula five chief clans are enumerated by burckhardtfn7 nassar and other authorities at suez divided them into six namely  1  karashi who like the gara in eastern arabia claim an apocryphal origin from the great koraysh tribe 2  salihi the principal family of the sinaitic badawin 3  arimi according to burckhardt this clan is merely a subfamily of the sawalihahs 4  saidi burckhardt calls them walad said and derives them also from the sawalihahs 5  aliki  and lastly the 6  muzaynah generally pronounced mzaynah this clan claims to be an offshoot from the great juhaynah tribe inhabiting the coasts and inner barrens about yambu according to oral tradition five persons the ancestors of the present muzaynah race were forced by a bloodfeud to fly their native country they landed at the shurumfn8 or creekports and have now spread themselves  p146over the eastern parts of the socalled sinaitic peninsula in alhijaz the muzaynah is an old and noble tribe it produced kaab alahbar the celebrated poet to whom mohammed gave the cloak which the ottomans believe to have been taken by sultan salim from egypt and to have been converted under the name of khirkah sharif into the national oriflamme  there are some interesting ethnographical points about these sinaitic clansinteresting at least to those who would trace the genealogy of the great arabian family any one who knows the badawin can see that the muzaynah are pure blood their brows are broad their faces narrow their features regular and their eyes of a moderate size whereas the other tawarahfn9 sinaitic clans are as palpably egyptian they have preserved that roundness of face which may still be seen in the sphinx as in the modern copt and their eyes have that peculiar size shape and look which the old egyptian painters attempted to express by giving to the profile the form of the full organ upon this feature so characteristic of the nilotic race i would lay great stress no traveller familiar with the true egyptian eyelong almondshaped deeply fringed slightly raised at the outer corner and dipping in front like the chinesefn10can ever mistake it it is to be seen in halfcastes and as i have before remarked families originally from the banks of the nile but settled for generations in the holy land of alhijaz retain the peculiarity  i therefore believe the turi badawin to be an impure  p147race syroegyptianfn11 whereas their neighbour the hijazi is the pure syrian or mesopotamian  a wonderful change has taken place in the tawarah tribes whilome pourtrayed by sir john mandeville as folke fulle of alle evylle condiciouns niebuhr notes the trouble they gave him and their perpetual hankering for both murder and pillage even in the late mohammed alis early reign no governor of suez dared to flog or to lay hands upon a turi whatever offence he might have committed within the walls of the town now the wild mans sword is taken from him before he is allowed to enter the gatesfn12 and my old acquaintance jaafar bey would think no more of belabouring a badawi than of flogging a fellahfn13 such is the result of  p148mohammed alis vigorous policy and such the effects of even semicivilisation when its influence is brought to bear direct upon barbarism  to conclude this subject the tawarah still retain many characteristics of the badawi race the most goodhumoured and sociable of men they delight in a jest and may readily be managed by kindness and courtesy yet they are passionate nice upon points of honour revengeful and easily offended where their peculiar prejudices are misunderstood i have always found them pleasant companions and deserving of respect for their hearts are good and their courage is beyond a doubt those travellers who complain of their insolence and extortion may have been either ignorant of their language or offensive to them by assumption of superorityin the desert man meets manor physically unfitted to acquire their esteem  we journeyed on till near sunset through the wilderness without ennui it is strange how the mind can be amused by scenery that presents so few objects to occupy it but in such a country every slight modification of form or colour rivets observation the senses are sharpened and the perceptive faculties prone to sleep over a confused mass of natural objects act vigorously when excited by the capability of embracing each detail moreover desert views are eminently suggestive they  p149appeal to the future not to the past they arouse because they are by no means memorial to the solitary wayfarer there is an interest in the wilderness unknown to cape seas and

his breast at the thought of measuring his puny force with natures might and of emerging triumphant from the trial this explains the arabs proverb voyaging is victory in the desert even more than upon the ocean there is present death hardship is there and piracies and shipwreck solitary not in crowds where as the persians say death is a festivaland this sense of danger never absent invests the

most imaginative of minds the tamest citizen the parson the old maid the peaceful student the spoiled child of civilisation all feel their hearts dilate and their pulses beat strong as they look down from their dromedaries upon the glorious desert where do we hear of a traveller being disappointed by it it is another illustration of the ancient truth that nature returns to man however unworthily he has treated her and believe me when once your tastes have conformed to the tranquillity of such travel you will suffer real pain in returning to the turmoil of civilisation you will anticipate the bustle and the confusion of artificial life its luxury and its false pleasures with repugnance depressed in spirits you will for a time after your return feel incapable of mental or bodily exertion the air of cities will suffocate you and the careworn and cadaverous countenances of citizens will haunt you like a vision of judgmentfn16  as the black shadow mounted in the eastern skyfn17 i turned off the road and was suddenly saluted by a figure rising from a little hollow with an as salamu alaykum of truly arab soundfn18 i looked at the speaker for a moment without recognising him he then advanced with voluble expressions of joy invited me to sup seized  p152my camels halter without waiting for an answer nakhdfn19 it ie forced it to kneel led me hurriedly to a carpet spread in a sandy hollow pulled off my slippers gave me cold water for ablution told me that he had mistaken me at a distance for a sherif or prince of the arabs but was delighted to find himself in error and urged me to hurry over ablution otherwise that night would come on before we could say our prayers it was mohammed albasyuni the meccan boy of whom i had bought my pilgrimgarb at cairo there i had refused his companionship but here for reasons of his ownone of them was an utter want of money he would take no excuse when he prayed he stood behind mefn20 thereby proving pliancy of conscience for he suspected me from the first of being at least a heretic  after prayer he lighted a pipe and immediately placed the snakelike tube in my hand this is an argument which the tired traveller can rarely resist he then began to rummage my saddlebags he drew forth stores of provisions rolls watermelons boiled eggs and dates and whilst lighting the fire and boiling the coffee he managed to distribute his own stock which was neither plentiful nor firstrate to the camelmen shaykh nassar and his brother looked aghast at this movement but the boy was inexorable they tried a few rough hints which he noticed by singing a hindustani couplet that asserts the impropriety of anointing rats heads with jasmine oil they suspected abuse and waxed cross he acknowledged this by deriding them i have heard of nasrs and nasirs and mansurs but may allah spare me the  p153mortification of a nassar said the boy relying upon my support and i urged him on wanting to see how the city arab treats the countryman he then took my tobaccopouch from the angry badawin and in a stagewhisper reproved me for entrusting it to such thieves insisting at the same time upon drinking all the coffee so that the poor guides had to prepare some for themselves he improved every opportunity of making mischief we have eaten watermelon cried nassar patting its receptacle in token of repletion dost thou hear my lord how they grumblethe impudent ruffians remarked mohammedwe have eaten watermelon that is to say we ought to have eaten meat the badawin completely out of temper told him not to trust himself among their hills he seized a sword and began capering about after the fashion of the eastindian school of arms and boasted that he would attack singlehanded the whole clan which elicited an ironical allah allah from the hearers  after an hour most amusingly spent in this way i arose and insisted upon mounting much to the dissatisfaction of my guides who wished to sleep there shaykh nassar and his brother had reckoned upon living gratis for at least three days judging it improbable that a soft effendi would hurry himself when they saw the fair vision dissolve they began to finesse they induced the camelman who ran by the side of mohammeds dromedary to precede the animala favourite manoeuvre to prevent overspeed ordered to fall back the man pleaded fatigue and inability to walk the boy mohammed immediately asked if i had any objection to dismount one of my guides and to let his weary attendant ride for an hour or so i at once assented and the badawin obeyed me with ominous grumblings when we resumed our march the melancholy arabs had no song left in them whereas mohammed chaunted vociferously and quoted  p154bad hindustani and worse persian till silence was forcibly imposed upon him the camelmen lagged behind in order to prevent my dromedary advancing too fast and the boys guide after dismounting would stride along in front of us under pretext of showing the way and so we jogged on now walking then trotting till the dromedaries began to grunt with fatigue and the arabs clamoured for a halt  at midnight we reached the central station and lay down under its walls to take a little rest the dews fell heavily wetting the sheets that covered us but who cares for such trifles in the desert the moon shone brightfn21 the breeze blew coolly and the jackal sang a lullaby which lost no time in inducing the soundest sleep as the wolfs tailfn22 showed in the heavens we arose grey mists floating over the hills northwards gave the dar albaydafn23 the pashas palace the look of some old feudal castle there was a haze in the atmosphere which beautified even the face of desolation the swift flying katafn24 sprang in noisy coveys from the road and a stray gazelle paced daintily over the stony plain as we passed by the pilgrims tree i  p155added another rag to its coat of tattersfn25 we then invoked the aid of the holy saint aldakrurifn26 from his creamcoloured abode mounted our camels and resumed the march in real earnest the dawn passed away in its delicious coolness and sultry morning came on then day glared in its fierceness and the noontide sun made the plain glow with terrible heat still we pressed onwards  at 3 pm we turned off the road into a dry watercourse which is not far from no 13 station the sand was dotted with the driedup leaves of the datura and strongly perfumed by shih a kind of absinthe artemisiafn27 the sweetest herb of the desert a mimosa was there and although its shade at this season is little better than  p156a cocoa treesfn28 the badawin would not neglect it we lay down upon the sand to rest among a party of maghrabi pilgrims travelling to suez these wretches who were about a dozen in number appeared to be of the lowest class their garments consisted of a burnuscloak and a pair of sandals their sole weapon a long knife and their only stock a bag of dry provisions each had his large wooden bowl but none carried water with him it was impossible to help pitying their state nor could i eat seeing them hungry thirsty and wayworn so nassar served out about a pint of water and a little bread to each man then they asked for more none was to be had so they cried out that money would do as well i had determined upon being generous to the extent of a few pence custom as well as inclination was in favour of the act but when the alms became a demand and the demand was backed by fierce looks and a derisive sneer and a kind of reference to their knives gentle charity took the alarm and fled my pistols kept them at bay for they were only making an attempt to intimidate and though i took the precaution of sitting apart from them there was no real danger the suez road by the wise regulations of mohammed ali has become as safe to european travellers as that between hampstead and highgate and even easterns have little to fear but what their fears create my indian servant was full of the dangers he had run but i did not believe in them i afterwards heard that the place where the maghrabis attempted to frighten what they thought a timid turk was notorious for plunder and murder here the spurs of two opposite hills almost meet upon the plain a favourable ground for badawi ambuscade of the maghrabis  p157i shall have more to say when relating my voyage in the pilgrim ship they were the only travellers from whom we experienced the least annoyance numerous parties of turks arabs and afghans and a few eastindiansfn29 were on the same errand as ourselves all as we passed them welcomed us with the friendly salutation that becomes men engaged in a labour of religion  about half an hour before sunset i turned off the road leftwards and under pretext of watering the dromedaries rode up to inspect the fort alajrudifn30 it is a quadrangle with round towers at the gateway and at the corners newly built of stone and mortar the material is already full of crevices and would not stand before a twelvepounder without guns or gunners it is occupied by about a dozen fellahs who act as hereditary ghafirs guardians they were expecting at that time to be reinforced by a party of bashi buzuksirregulars from cairo the people of the country were determined that an english fleet would soon appear in the red sea and this fort is by them ridiculously considered the key of suez as usual in these vaubanlacking  p158lands the well supplying the stronghold is in a detached and distant building which can be approached by an enemy with the greatest security over the gateway was an ancient inscription reversed the water was brackish and of bad qualityfn31  we resumed our way suez now stood near in the blue distance rose the castellated peaks of jabal rahah and the wide sandtracts over which lies the landroute to alhijaz before us the sight ever dear to english eyesa strip of sea gloriously azure with a gallant steamer walking the waters on the righthand side the broad slopes of jabal mukattam a range of hills which flanks the road all the way from cairo it was at this hour a spectacle not easily to be forgotten the near range of chalk and sandstone wore a russet suit gilt where the last rays of the sun seamed it with light and the deep folds were shaded with the richest purple whilst the background of the higher hills jabal tawari generally known as abu daraj the father of steps was skyblue streaked with the lightest plum colour we drew up at a small building called bir suways well of suez and under pretext of watering the cattle i sat for half an hour admiring the charms of the desert the eye never tires of such loveliness of hue and the memory of the hideousness of this range when a sun in front exposed each gaunt and barren feature supplied the evening view with another element of attraction  it was already night when we passed through the tumbling sixwindowed gateway of suez and still remained the task of finding my servant and effects after  p159wandering in and out of every wakalah in the village during which peregrination the boy mohammed proved himself so useful that i determined at all risks to make him my companion we accidentally heard that a hindi had taken lodgings at a hostelry bearing the name of jirjis alzahrfn32 on arriving there our satisfaction was diminished by the intelligence that the same hindi after locking the door had gone out with his friends to a ship in the harbour in fact that he had made all preparations for running away i dismounted and tried to persuade the porter to break open the wooden bolt but he absolutely refused and threatened the police meanwhile mohammed had found a party of friends men of almadinah returning to the pilgrimage after a begging tour through egypt and turkey the meeting was characterised by vociferous inquiries loud guffaws and warm embraces i was invited to share their supper and their dormitoryan uncovered platform projecting from the gallery over the square court belowbut i had neither appetite nor spirits enough to be sociable the porter after much persuasion showed me an empty room in which i spread my carpet that was a sad night my eightyfour mile ride had made every bone ache i had lost epidermis and the sun had seared every portion of skin exposed to it so lamenting my degeneracy and the ill effects of four years domicile in europe and equally disquieted in mind about the fate of my goods and chattels i fell into an uncomfortable sleep  fnl the proper hire of a return dromedary from cairo to suez is forty piastres but every man is charged in proportion to his rank and europeans generally pay about double fn2 the tender traveller had better provide himself with a pair of stirrups but he will often find when on camel back that his legs are more numbed by hanging down than by the arab way of crossing them before and beneath the pommel he must however be careful to inspect his saddle and should bars of wood not suit him to have them covered with stuffed leather and again for my part i would prefer riding a camel with a noseringmongol and sindian fashionto holding him as the egyptians do with a halter or to guiding himwahhabiwisewith a stick fn3 o

produced a marked difference of apparent temperature whilst travelling over the sultry sand of the desert i have often remarked the same phenomenon the arabs doubtless for some reason of the kind always draw their headkerchiefs like hoods far over their brows and cover up their mouths even when the sun and wind are behind them inhabitants of the desert are to be recognised by the network of wrinkles traced in the skin round the orbits the result of halfclosing their eyelids but this is done to temper the intensity of the light fn6 their own pipetubes were of coarse wood in shape somewhat resembling the german porcelain pipe the bowl was of soft stone apparently steatite which when fresh is easily fashioned with a knife in arabia the badawin and even the townspeople use on journeys an earthen tube from five to six inches shorter than the english clay thicker in the tube with a large bowl and coloured yellowishred it contains a handful of tobacco and the smoker emits puffs like a chimney in some of these articles the bowl forms a rectangle with the tube in others the whole is an unbroken curve like the old turkish meerschaum fn7 see wallins papers published in the journals of

osmanlis have as usual a semireligious tradition to account for the superiority of their nation over the egyptians when the learned doctor abu abdullah mohammed bin idris alshafei returned from meccah to the banks of the nile he mounted it is said a donkey belonging to one of the asinarii of bulak arriving at the caravanserai he gave the man ample fare whereupon the egyptian putting forth his hand and saying hat give called for more the doctor doubled the fee still the double was demanded at last the divines purse was exhausted and the proprietor of the donkey waxed insolent a wandering turk

of an arabian oasis except it be the popular conception of an arabian desert one reads of isles of the sandy sea but one never sees them the real wady is generally speaking a rocky valley bisected by the bed of a mountain torrent dry during the hot season in such places the badawin love to encamp because they find food and drinkwater being always procurable by digging when the supply is perennial the wady becomes the site of a village the desert is as unaptly compared to a sandy sea most of the wilds of arabia resemble the tract between suez and cairo only the former are of primary formation whereas the others are of a later date sandheaps are found in every desert but sandplains are a local feature not the general face of the country the wilderness east of the nile is mostly a hard dry earth which requires only a monsoon to become highly productive even where silicious sand covers the plain the waters of a torrent depositing humus or vegetable mould bind the particles together and fit it for the reception of seed fn16 the intelligent reader will easily understand that i am speaking of the desert in the temperate season not during the summer heats when the whole is one vast

alislam and professed like mr lane ignorance of its origin and object in hucs travels we are told that the tartars worship mountain spirits by raising an obodry branches hung with bones and strips of cloth and planted in enormous heaps of stones park also in western africa conformed to the example of his companions in adding a charm or shred of cloth on a tree at the entrance of the wilderness which was completely covered with these guardian symbols and finally the tarikh tabari mentions it as a practice of the pagan arabs and talks of evil spirits residing in the datetree may not then the practice in alislam be one of the many debris of fetishworship which entered into the heterogeneous formation of the saving faith some believe that the prophet permitted the practice and explain the peculiar name of the expedition called zat alrikaa place of shreds of cloth by supposing it to be a term for a tree to which the moslems hung their exvoto rags fn26 the saint lies under a little

room supposed to contain my effects he asked my profession i replied the medical this led him to inquire if i had any medicine for the eyes and  p161being answered in the affirmative he sent a messenger with me to enforce obedience on the part of the porter the obnoxious measure was however unnecessary as we entered the caravanserai there appeared at the door the black face of shaykh nur looking though accompanied by sundry fellowcountrymen uncommonly as if he merited and expected the bamboo he had by his own account been seduced into the festivities of a coalhulk manned by lascars

becomes furious as a bengal tiger his parents have urged him to marry and he like kamar alzaman has informed his father that he is a person of great age but little sense urged moreover by a melancholy turn of mind and the want of leisure for study at almadinah he fled the paternal domicile and entered himself a pauper talib ilm student in the azhar mosque his disconsolate friends and afflicted relations sent a confidential man to fetch him home by  p162force should it be necessary he has yielded and is now awaiting the first opportunity of travelling gratis if possible to almadinah  that confidential man is a negroservant called saad notorious in his native city as aljinni the demon born and bred a slave in omar effendis family he obtained manumission became a soldier in alhijaz was

master omar effendi yet even him he will scold in a paroxysm of fury and steal from him whatever he can lay his hands on he is generous with his goods but is ever borrowing and never paying money he dresses like a beggar with the dirtiest tarbush upon his tufty poll and only a cotton shirt over his sooty skin whilst his two boxes are full of handsome apparel for himself and the three ladies his wives at almadinah he knows no fear but for those boxes frequently during our search for a vessel he forced himself into jaafar beys presence and there he demeaned himself so impudently that we expected to see him lamed by the bastinado his forwardness however only amused the dignitary he wanders all day about the bazar talking about freight and passage for he has resolved cost what it will

respectably than the descendant of the clarifiedbutterseller he affects the constantinople style of toilette and his light yellow complexion makes people consider him a superior person we were intimate enough on the road when he borrowed from me a little money but at almadinah he cut me pitilessly as a town man does a continental acquaintance accidentally met in hyde park and of course he tried though in vain to evade repaying his debt he had a tincture of letters and appeared to have studied critically the subject of largesse the generous is allahs friend aye though he be a sinner and the miser is allahs foe aye though he be a saint was a venerable saying always in his mouth he also informed me that pharaoh although the quintessence of impiety is mentioned by name in the koran by

at meccah and seldom have i seen a more honest and warmhearted fellow when we were embarking at suez he fell upon hamids bosom and both of them wept bitterly at the prospect of parting even for a few days  all the individuals above mentioned lost no time in opening the question of a loan it was a lesson in oriental metaphysics to see their condition they had a twelve days voyage and a four days journey before them boxes to carry customhouses to face and stomachs to fill yet the whole party could scarcely i believe muster two dollars of ready money their boxes were full of valuables arms clothes pipes slippers sweetmeats and other notions but nothing short of starvation would have induced them to pledge the smallest article  foreseeing that their company would be an advantage i

dollars saad the demon twoi gave the money to him at yambuand salih shakkar fifty piastres but since in these lands as a rule no one ever lends coins or borrowing ever returns them i took care to exact service from the first to take two rich coats from the second a handsome pipe from the third a bala or yataghan from the fourth and from the fifth an imitation cashmere shawl after which we sat down and drew  p166out the agreement it was favourable to me i lent them egyptian money and bargained for repayment in the currency of alhijaz thereby gaining the exchange which is sometimes sixteen

cloudperhaps my claims to being a darwaysh assisted them to this discoveryand declared that i should perforce be their guest at meccah and almadinah on all occasions precedence was forced upon me my opinion was the first consulted and no project was settled without my concurrence briefly abdullah the darwaysh suddenly found himself a person of consequence this elevation led me into an imprudence

p167afterwards learnedfn5 waited only my leaving the room to declare that the wouldbe haji was one of the infidels from india and a council sat to discuss the case fortunately for me omar effendi had looked over a letter which i had written to haji wali that morning and he had at various times received categorical replies to certain questions in high theology he felt himself justified in declaring ex cathedra the boy mohammeds position perfectly untenable and shaykh hamid who looked forward to being my host guide and debtor in general and probably cared scantily for catechism or creed swore that the light of alislam was upon my countenance and consequently that the boy mohammed was a pauper a fakir an owl a cutoff onefn6 a stranger and a wahhabi heretic for daring to impugn the faith of a brother believerfn7 the scene ended with a general abuse of the acute youth who was told on all sides that he had no shame and was directed to fear allah i was struck with the expression of my friends countenances when they saw the sextant and determining with a sigh to  p168leave it behind i prayed five times a day for nearly a week  we all agreed not to lose an hour in securing places on board some vessel bound for yambu and my companions hearing that my passport as a british indian was scarcely en regle earnestly advised me to have it signed by the governor without delay whilst they occupied themselves about the harbour they warned me that if i displayed the turkish tazkirah given me at the citadel of cairo i should infallibly be ordered to await the caravan and lose their society and friendship pilgrims arriving at alexandria be it known to the reader are divided into bodies and distributed by means of passports to the three great roads namely suez kusayr cosseir and the hajj route by land round the gulf of alakabah after the division has once been made government turns a deaf ear to the representations of individuals the bey of suez has an order to obstruct pilgrims as much as possible till the end of the season when they are hurried down that way lest they should arrive at meccah too latefn8 as most of the egyptian high officials have boats which sail up the nile laden with pilgrims and return freighted with corn the government naturally does its utmost to force the delays and discomforts of this line upon strangersfn9 and as those who travel by the hajj route must spend money in the egyptian territories at least fifteen days longer than they would if allowed to  p169embark at once from suez the bey very properly assists them in the former and obstructs them in the latter case knowing these facts i felt that a difficulty was at hand the first thing was to take shaykh nurs passport which was en regle and my own which was not to the bey for signature he turned the papers over and over as if unable to read them and raised false hopes high by referring me to his clerk the underofficial at once saw the irregularity of the document asked me why it had not been vise at cairo swore that under such circumstances nothing would induce the bey to let me proceed and when i tried persuasion waxed insolent i feared that it would be necessary to travel via cosseir for which there was scarcely time or to transfer myself on camelback to the harbour of tur and there to await the chance of finding a place in some halffilled vessel to alhijazwhich would have been relying upon an accident my last hope at suez was to obtain assistance from mr west then hbms viceconsul and since made consul i therefore took the boy mohammed with me choosing him on purpose and excusing the step to my companions by concocting an artful fable about my having been in afghanistan a benefactor to the british nation we proceeded to the consulate mr west who had been told by imprudent augustus bernal to expect me saw through the disguise despite jargon assumed to satisfy official scruples and nothing could be kinder than the part he took his clerk was directed to place himself in communication with the beys factotum and when objections to signing the alexandrian tazkirah were offered the viceconsul said that he would at his own risk give me a fresh passport as a british subject from suez to arabia his firmness prevailed on the second day the documents were returned to me in a satisfactory state i take a pleasure in owning this obligation to mr west in the course of my wanderings i have often  p170 received from him openhearted hospitality and the most friendly attentions  whilst these passport difficulties were being solved the rest of the party was as busy in settling about passage and passagemoney the peculiar rules of the port of suez require a few words of explanationfn10 about thirtyfive years ago ie about 1818 ad the shipowners proposed to the then government with the view of keeping up freight a farzah or system of rotation it might be supposed that the pasha whose object notoriously was to retain all monoplies in his own hands would have refused his sanction to such a measure but it so happened in those days that all the court had ships at suez ibrahim pasha alone owned four or five consequently they expected to share profits with the merchants and thus to be compensated for the want of portdues from that time forward all the vessels in the harbour were registered and ordered to sail in rotation this arrangement benefits the owner of the craft ‘en depart giving him in his turn a temporary monopoly with the advantage of a full market and freight is so high that a single trip often clears off the expense of building and the risk of losing the shipa sensible succedaneum for insurance companies on the contrary the public must always be a loser by the ‘farzah two of a trade do not agree elsewhere but at suez even the christian and the moslem shipowner are bound by a fraternal tie in the shape of this rotation system it injures the general merchant and the red sea trader not only by  p171 perpetuating high freightfn11 but also by causing at one period of the year a break in the routine of sales and in the supplies of goods for the great jeddah marketfn12 at this moment nov 1853 the vessel to which the turn belongs happens to be a large one there is a deficiency of export to alhijazher owner will of course wait any length of time for a full cargo consequently no vessel with merchandise has left suez for the last seventytwo days those who have bought goods for the jeddah market at three months credit will therefore have to meet their acceptances for merchandise still warehoused at the egyptian port this strange contrast to freetrade principle is another proof that protection benefits only one party the protected while it is detrimental to the interests of the other party the public to these remarks of mr levicks i have only to add that the government supports the farzah with all the energy of protectionists a letter from mr now sir john drummond hay was insufficient to induce the bey of suez to break through the rule of rotation in favour of certain princes from morocco the recommendations of lord stratford de redcliffe met with no better fate and all mr wests good will could not procure  p172me a vessel out of her turnfn13 we were forced to rely upon our own exertions and the activity of saad the demon this worthy after sundry delays and differences mostly caused by his own determination to travel gratis and to make us pay too much finally closed with the owner of the golden threadfn14 he took places for us upon the poopthe most eligible part of the vessel at this season of the year he premised that we should not be very comfortable as we were to be crowded with maghrabi pilgrims but that allah makes all things easy though not penetrated with the conviction that this would happen in our case i paid for two deck passages eighteen riyalsfn15 dollars and my companions seven each whilst saad secretly entered himself as an able seaman mohammed shiklibha we were obliged to leave behind as he could not or might not afford the expense and none of us might afford it for him had i known him to be the honest truehearted fellow he washis kindness at meccah quite won my hearti should not have grudged the small charity  p173nothing more comfortless than our days and nights in the george inn the ragged walls of our rooms were clammy with dirt the smoky rafters foul with cobwebs and the floor bestrewed with kit in terrible confusion was black with hosts of cockroaches ants and flies pigeons nestled on the shelf cooing amatory ditties the livelong day and cats like tigers crawled through a hole in the door making night hideous with their caterwaulings now a curious goat then an inquisitive jackass would walk stealthily into the room remark that it was tenanted and retreat with dignified demeanour and the mosquitos sang io paeans over our prostrate forms throughout the twentyfour hours i spare the reader the enumeration of the other egyptian plagues that infested the place after the first days trial we determined to spend the hours of light in the passages lying upon our boxes or rugs smoking wrangling and inspecting one anothers chests the latter occupation was a fertile source of disputes for nothing was more common than for a friend to seize an article belonging to another and to swear by the apostles beard that he admired it and therefore would not return it the boy mohammed and shaykh nur who had been intimates the first day differed in opinion on the second and on the third came to pushing each other against the wall sometimes we went into the bazar a shady street flanked with poor little shops or we sat in the coffeehousefn16 drinking hot saltish water tinged with burnt bean or we prayed in one of three tumbledown old mosques or we squatted upon the pier lamenting the want of hammams and bathing in the tepid seafn17 i presently came to the conclusion that  p174suez as a wateringplace is duller even than dover the only society we found excepting an occasional visitor was that of a party of egyptian women who with their husbands and families occupied some rooms adjoining ours at first they were fierce and used bad language when the boy mohammed and iwhilst omar effendi was engaged in prayer and the rest were wandering about the townventured to linger in the cool passage where they congregated or to address a facetious phrase to them but hearing that i was a hakimbashifor fame had promoted me to the rank of a physician general at suezall discovered some ailments they began prudently with requesting me to display the effects of my drugs by dosing myself but they ended submissively by swallowing the nauseous compounds to this succeeded a primitive form of flirtation which mainly consisted of the demand direct the most charming of the party was one fattumahfn18 a plumppersoned dame fast verging upon her thirtieth year fond of a little flattery and possessing like all her people a most voluble tongue the refrain of every conversation was marry me o fattumah o daughter o female pilgrim in vain the lady would reply with a coquettish movement of the sides a toss of the head and a flirting manipulation of her headveil  p175i am mated o young manit was agreed that she being a person of polyandrous propensities could support the weight of at least three matrimonial engagements sometimes the entrance of the male fellahsfn19 interrupted these little discussions but people of our respectability and nation were not to be imposed upon by such husbands in their presence we only varied the style of conversationinquiring the amount of mahr or marriage settlement deriding the cheapness of womanhood in egypt and requiring to be furnished on the spot with brides at the rate of ten shillings a headfn20 more often the amiable fattumahthe fair sex in this country though passing frail have the best tempers in the worldwould laugh at our impertinences sometimes vexed by our imitating her egyptian accent mimicking her gestures and depreciating her countrywomenfn21 she would wax wroth and order us to be gone and stretch out her forefingera sign that she wished to put out our eyes or adjure allah to cut the hearts out of our bosoms then  p176the marry me o fattumah o daughter o female pilgrim would give way to yal agoooz o old woman and decrepit o daughter of sixty sires and fit only to carry wood to marketwhereupon would burst a storm of wrath at the tail of which all of us like children starting upon our feet rushed out of one anothers way butqui se dispute sadorewhen we again met all would be forgotten and the old tale be told over de novo this was the amusement of the day at night we men assembling upon the little terrace drank tea recited stories read books talked of our travels and indulged in various pleasantries the great joke was the boy mohammeds abusing all his companions to their faces in hindustani which none but shaykh nur and i could understand the others however guessed his intention and revenged themselves by retorts of the style uncourteous in the purest hijazi  i proceed to offer a few more extracts from mr levicks letter about suez and the suezians it appears that the number of pilgrims who pass through suez to meccah has of late been steadily on the decrease when i first came here in 1838 the pilgrims who annually embarked at this port amounted to between 10000 and 12000 the shipping was more numerous and the merchants were more affluentfn22 i have ascertained from a special register kept in the government archives that in the moslem year 1268 ad 185152 the exact number that passed through was 4893  in 1269 ah ad 185253 it had shrunk to 3136 the natives assign the falling off to various causes which p177i attribute chiefly to the indirect effect of european civilisation upon the moslem powers immediately in contact with it the heterogeneous mass of pilgrims is composed of people of all classes colours and costumes one sees among them not only the natives of countries contiguous to egypt but also a large proportion of central asians from bokhara persia circassia turkey and the crimea who prefer this route by way of constantinople to the difficult expensive and dangerous caravanline through the desert from damascus and baghdad the west sends us moors algerines and tunisians and inner africa a mass of sable takrourifn23 and others from bornou the sudanfn24 ghadamah near the niger and jabarti from the habashfn25  the suez shipbuilders are an influential body of men originally candiots and alexandrians when mohammed ali fitted out his fleet for the hijaz war he transported a number of greeks to suez and the children now exercise their fathers craft there are at present three great builders at this place their principal difficulty  p178is the want of material teak comes from indiafn26 via jeddah and venetian boards owing to the expense of cameltransport are a hundred per cent dearer here than at alexandria trieste and turkey supply spars and jeddah canvas the sailmakers are suez men and the crews a mongrel mixture of arabs and egyptians the rais or captain being almost invariably if the vessel be a large one a yambu man there are two kinds of craft distinguished from each other by tonnage not by build the baghlahfn27 buggalow is a vessel above fifty tons burden the sambuk a classical term from fifteen to fifty the shipowner bribes the amir albahr or portcaptain and the nazir alsafayn or the captain commanding the government vessels to rate his ship as high as possible if he pay the price he will be allowed nine ardebs to the tonfn28 the number of ships belonging to the port of suez amounts to 92 they vary from 25 to 250 tons the departures in ah 1269 1852 and 1853 were 38 so that each vessel after returning from a trip is laid up for about two years throughout the passage of the pilgrimsthat is to say during four monthsthe departures average twice a week during the remainder of the year from six to ten vessels may leave the port the homeward trade is carried on principally in jeddah bottoms which are allowed to convey goods to suez but not to take in return cargo there they must not interfere with nor may they partake in any way of the benefits of the rotation systemfn29  p179during the present year the imports were contained in 41395 packages the exports in 15988 specie makes up in some manner for this preponderance of imports a sum of from l30000 to l40000 in crown or maria theresa dollars annually leaves egypt for arabia abyssinia and other parts of africa i value the imports at about l350000 the export trade to jeddah at l300000 per annum the former consists principally of coffee and gumarabic of these there were respectively 17460 and 15132 bales the aggregate value of each article being from l75000 to l80000 and the total amount l160000 in the previous year the

articles of dress and ornament  the average annual temperature of the year at suez is 67° fahrenheit the extremes of heat and cold are found in january and august during the former month the thermometer ranges from a minimum of 38° to a maximum of 68° during the latter the variation extends from 68° to 102° or even to 104° when the heat becomes oppressive departures from these extremes are rare i never remember to have seen the thermometer rise above 108° during the severest khamsin or to have sunk below 34° in the rawest wintry wind violent storms come up from the south in march rain is very variablefn32  p181 sometimes three years have passed without a shower whereas in 1841 torrents poured for nine successive days deluging the town and causing many buildings to fall  the population of suez now numbers about 4800 as usual in mohammedan countries no census is taken here some therefore estimate the population at 6000 sixteen years ago it was supposed to be under 3000 after that time it rapidly increased till 1850 when a fatal attack of cholera reduced it to about half its previous number the average mortality is about twelve a monthfn33 the endemic diseases are fevers of typhoid and intermittent types in spring when strong northerly winds cause the waters of the bay to recedefn34 and leave a miasmabreeding swamp exposed to the rays of the sun in the months of october and november febrile attacks are violent ophthalmia more so the eyedisease is not so general here as at cairo but the symptoms are more acute in some years it becomes a virulent epidemic which ends either in total blindness or in a partial opacity of the cornea inducing dimness of vision and a permanent weakness of the eyes in one month three of my acquaintances lost their sight dysenteries are also common and so are bad boils or rather ulcers the cold season is not unwholesome and at this period the  p182 pure air of the desert restores and invigorates the heatwasted frame  the walls gates and defences of suez are in a ruinous state being no longer wanted to keep out the sinaitic badawin the houses are about 500 in number but many of the natives prefer occupying the upper stories of the wakalahs the rooms on the ground floor serving for stores to certain merchandise wood dates cotton c the suezians live well and their bazar is abundantly stocked with meat and clarified butter brought from sinai and fowls corn and vegetables from the sharkiyah province fruit is supplied by cairo as well as by the sharkiyah and wheat conveyed down the nile in flood to the capital is carried on camelback across the desert at sunrise they eat the fatur or breakfast which in summer consists of a ‘fatirah a kind of muffin or of bread and treacle in winter it is more substantial being generally a mixture of lentils and ricefn35 with clarified butter poured over it and a ‘kitchen of pickled lime or stewed onions at this season they greatly enjoy the ‘ful mudammas boiled horsebeansfn36 eaten with an abundance of linseed oil into which they steep bits of bread the beans form with carbongenerating matter a highly nutritive diet which if the stomach can digest

fruits are preferred especially by those who have to face the sun ‘alasha or supper is served about half an hour after sunset at this meal all but the poorest classes eat meat their favourite flesh as usual in this part of the world is mutton beef and goat are little prizedfn37  the people of suez are a finer and fairer race than the cairenes the former have more the appearance of arabs their dress is more picturesque their eyes are carefully darkened with kohl and they wear sandals not slippers they are according to all accounts a turbulent and somewhat fanatic set fond of quarrels and slightly addicted to pronunciamentos the general programme of one of these latter diversions is said to be as follows the boys will first be sent by their fathers about the town in a disorderly mob and ordered to cry out long live the sultan with its usual sequel death to the infidels the infidels christians or others must hear and may happen to resent this or possibly the governor foreseeing a disturbance orders an ingenuous youth or two to be imprisoned or to be caned by the police whereupon some person rendered influential by wealth or religious reputation publicly complains that the christians are all in all and that in these evil days alislam is going to destruction on this occasion the speaker conducts himself with such insolence that the governor perforce consigns him to confinement which exasperates the populace still more secret meetings are now convened and in them the chiefs of corporations assume a prominent position if the disturbance be intended by its mainspring to subside quietly the conspirators are allowed to take their own way they will drink copiously become lions about midnight and recover their harehearts before noon next  p184 day but if mischief be intended a case of bloodshed is brought about and then nothing can arrest the torrent of popular ragefn38 the egyptian with all his good humour merriment and nonchalance is notorious for doggedness when as the popular phrase is his blood is up and this indeed is his chief merit as a soldier he has a certain mechanical dexterity in the use of arms and an egyptian regiment will fire a volley as correctly as a battalion at chobham but when the head and not the hands is required he notably fails the reason of his superiority in the field is his peculiar stubborness and this together with his powers of digestion and of enduring hardship on the line of march is the quality that makes him terrible to his old conqueror the turkfn39  fn1 when travelling the shushah is allowed to spread over the greatest portion of the scalp to act as a protection against the sun and the hair being shaved off about two inches all round the head leaves a large circular patch nothing can be uglier than such tonsure and it is contrary to the strict law of the apostle who ordered a clean shave or a general growth of the hair the arab however knows by experience that though habitual exposure of the scalp to a burning sun may harden the skull it seldom fails to damage its precious contents he therefore wears a shushah during his wanderings and removes it on his return home abu hanifah if i am rightly informed wrote a treatise advocating the growth of a long lock of hair on the nasiyah or crown of the head lest the decapitated moslems mouth or beard be exposed to defilement by an impure hand this would justify the comparing it to the chivalrylock by which the american brave facilitates the removal of his own scalp but i am at a loss to discover the origin of our old idea that the angel of death will on the last day bear all true believers by this important tuft of hair on the crown to paradise probably this office has been attributed to the shushah by the ignorance of the west fn2 makhichus equivalent to our skinflint fn3 a wellknown arab chieftain whose name has come to stand for generosity itself fn4 this being an indispensable instrument for measuring distances i had it divested of gold case and provided with a facing carefully stained and figured with arabic numerals in countries where few can judge of a watch by its works it is as well to secure its safety by making the exterior look as mean as possible the watches worn by respectable people in alhijaz are almost a1ways old silver pieces of the turnip shape with hunting cases and an outer etui of thick leather mostly they are of swiss or german manufacture and they find their way into arabia via constantinople and cairo fn5 on my return to cairo omar effendi whom i met accidentally in the streets related the story to me i never owned having played a part to avoid shocking his prejudices and though he must have suspected mefor the general report was that an englishman disguised as a persian had performed the pilgrimage measured the country and sketched the buildingshe had the gentlemanly feeling never to allude to the past we parted when i went to india on the best of terms fn6 munkatiaone cut off from the pleasures and comforts of life in alhijaz as in england any allusion to poverty is highly offensive fn7 the koran expressly forbids a moslem to discredit the word of any man who professes his belief in the saving faith the greatest offence of the wahhabis is their habit of designating all moslems that belong to any but their own sect by the opprobrious name of kafirs or infidels this however is only the koranic precept in practice a much less trustful spirit prevails fn8 towards the end of the season poor pilgrims are forwarded gratis by order of government but to make such liberality as inexpensive as possible the pasha compels shipowners to carry one pilgrim per 9 ardebs about 5 bushels each in small and 1 per 11 in large vessels fn9 i was informed by a prussian gentleman holding an official appointment under his highness the pasha at cairo that 300000 ardebs of grain were annually exported from kusayr to jeddah the rest is brought down the nile for consumption in lower egypt and export to europe fn10 the account here offered to the reader was kindly supplied to me by henry levick esq late viceconsul and afterwards postmaster at suez and it may be depended upon as coming from a resident of 16 years standing all the passages marked with inverted commas are extracts from a letter with which that gentleman favoured me the information is obsolete now but it may be interesting as

speedily be reduced by abolishing protection to 3 and 6 dollars note to second editionthe farzah i may here observe has been abolished by said pasha since the publication of these lines the effects of free trade are exactly what were predicted by mr levick fn12 the principal trade from suez is to jeddah kusayr supplying yambu the latter place however imports from suez wheat beans cheese biscuit and other provisions for return pilgrims fn13 my friends were strenuous in their exertions for me to make interest with mr west in the first place we should have paid less for the whole of a privileged vessel than we did for our wretched quarters on the deck of the pilgrimship and secondly we might have touched at any port we pleased so as to do a little business in the way of commerce fn14 afterwards called by sir r f burton the golden wireed fn15 for the sath or poop the sum paid by each was seven riyals i was therefore notably cheated by saad the demon the unhappy women in the kamrah or cabin bought suffocation at the rate of 6 dollars each as i was afterwards informed and the third class in the taht or amidships and forward contributed from 3 to 5 riyals but as usua1 on these occasions there was no prix fixe every man was either overcharged or undercharged according to his means or his necessities we had to purchase our own water but the ship was to supply us with fuel for cooking we paid nothing extra for luggage and we carried an old maghrabi woman gratis for good luck fn16 we were still at suez where we could do as we pleased but respectable arabs in their own country unlike egyptians are seldom to be seen in the places of public resort go to the coffeehouse and sing there is a reproach sometimes addressed to those who have a habit of humming in decent society fn17 it was only my prestige as physician that persuaded my friend to join me in these bathings as a general rule the western arabs avoid cold water from a belief that it causes fever when mr c cole hbms viceconsul arrived at jeddah the people of the place seeing that he kept up his indian habits advised him strongly to drop them he refused but unhappily he soon caught a fever which confirmed them all in their belief when arabs wish to cool the skin after a journey they wash with a kind of fullers earth called tafl or with a thin paste of henna and then anoint the body with oil or butter fn18 an incrementative form of the name fatimah very common in egypt fatimah would mean a weanerfattumah a great weaner by the same barbarism khadijah becomes khaddugah aminah ammunah and

the sind hindus believe that hiranyakasipu the demontyrant of multan finding magharaja the cloud king troublesome in his dominions bound him with chains and only released him upon his oath not to

turn over the volumes of their predecesors they will find almost every one complaining of the discomforts of rain in sind it appears certain that during the last few years there has been at times almost a monsoon this novel phenomenon the natives attribute to the presence of their conquerors concerning whom it cannot be said that they have wooded the country to any extent fn33 this may appear

towns by disarming the country people and by positively forbidding the carrying of weapons moreover with a wise severity it punishes all parties concerned in a quarrel where blood is drawn with a heavy fine and the bastinado de rigueur hence it is never safe except as a european to strike a man and the egyptians generally confine themselves to collaring and pushing each other against the walls

housesincluding the george inn whose front had been repairedi recognised only four and they looked mean by the side of the fine new buildings in a few years ancient suez will be no more the bazars are not so full of filth and flies now that pilgrims pass straight through and hardly even encamp the sweet water canal renders a hammam possible coffee is no longer hot saltish water and presently irrigation will cover with fields and gardens the desert plain extending to the feet of jabal atakah the noble works of the canal maritime which should in justice be called the lesseps canal shall soon transform clysma into a modern and civilised city the railway station close to the hotel the new british hospital the noisy greek casino the frankish shops the puffing steamers and the ringing of morning bells gave me a novel impression even the climate has been changed by filling up the timsch lakes briefly the hat is now at home in suez note to fourth 1879 editionthe forecast in the last paragraph has not been fulfilled i again visited suez in 187778 and found that it had been ruined by the canal leaving it out of line in fact another suez is growing up about the new docks while the old town is falling to pieces for this and other egyptian matters see the gold mines of midian by sir richard burton  p186chapter x  the pilgrim ship  the larger craft anchor some three or four miles from the suez pier so that it is necessary to drop down in a skiff or shoreboat  immense was the confusion at the eventful hour of our departure suppose us gathered upon the beach on the morning of a fiery july day carefully watching our hurriedlypacked goods and chattels surrounded by a mob of idlers who are not too proud to pick up waifs and strays whilst pilgrims are rushing about apparently mad and friends are weeping acquaintances are vociferating adieux boatmen are demanding fees shopmen are claiming debts women are shrieking and talking with inconceivable power and children are cryingin short for an hour or so we stand in the thick of a human storm to confound confusion the boatmen have moored their skiff half a dozen yards away from the shore lest the porters should be unable to make more than double their fare from the hajis again the turkish women make a hideous noise as they are carried off struggling vainly in brawny arms the children howl because their mothers howl and the men scold and swear because in such scenes none may be silent the moment we had embarked each individual found that he or she had missed something of vital importancea pipe a child a box or a watermelon and naturally all the servants were in the bazars when  p187 they should have been in the boat briefly despite the rage of the sailors who feared being too late for a second trip we stood for some time on the beach before putting off  from the shore we poled to the little pier where sat the bey in person to perform a final examination of our passports several were detected without the necessary document some were bastinadoed others were peremptorily ordered back to cairo and the rest were allowed to proceed at about 10 am 6th july we hoisted sail and ran down the channel leading to the roadstead on our way we had a specimen of what we might expect from our fellowpassengers the maghrabifn1 a boat crowded with these  p188 ruffians ran alongside of us and before we could organise a defence about a score of them poured into our vessel they carried things too with a high hand laughed at us and seemed quite ready to fight my indian boy who happened to let slip the word muarras narrowly escaped a blow with a palm stick which would have felled a camel they outnumbered us and they were armed so that on this occasion we were obliged to put up with their insolence  our pilgrim ship the silk alzahab or the golden wire was a sambuk of about 400 ardebs fifty tons with narrow wedgelike bows a clean waterline a sharp keel and undecked except upon the poop which was high enough to act as a sail in a gale of wind she carried two masts raking imminently forwards the main being considerably larger than the mizzen the former was provided with a huge triangular latine very deep in the tack but the second sail was unaccountably wanting she had no means of reefing no compass no log no sounding lines no spare ropes nor even the suspicion of a chart in her boxlike cabin and ribbed hold there was something which savoured of close connection between her model and that of the indian tonifn2 or dugout  p189 such probably were the craft which carried old sesostris across the red sea to deir such were the cruisers which once every three years left eziongeber for tarshish such the transports of which 130 were required to convey aelius gallus with his 10000 men bakhshish was the last as well as the first odious sound i heard in egypt the owner of the shoreboat would not allow us to climb the sides of our vessel before paying him his fare and when we did so he asked for bakhshish if easterns would only imitate the example of europeansi never yet saw an englishman give bakhshish to a soulthe nuisance would soon be done away with but on this occasion all my companions complied with the request and at times it is unpleasant to be singular the first look at the interior of our vessel showed a hopeless sight ali murad the greedy owner had promised to take sixty passengers in the hold but had stretched the number to ninetyseven piles of boxes and luggage in every shape and form filled the ship from stem to stern and a torrent of hajis were pouring over the sides like ants into the eastindian sugarbasin the poop too where we had taken our places was covered with goods and a number of pilgrims had established themselves there by might not by right  presently to our satisfaction appeared saad the demon equipped as an able seaman and looking most unlike the proprietor of two large boxes full of valuable merchandise this energetic individual instantly prepared for action with our little party to back him he speedily cleared the poop of intruders and their stuff by the simple process of pushing or rather throwing them off it into the pit below we then settled down as comfortably as we could three syrians a married turk with his wife and family the rais or captain of the vessel  p190 with a portion of his crew and our seven selves composing a total of eighteen human beings upon a space certainly not exceeding ten feet by eight the cabina miserable box about the size of the poop and three feet highwas stuffed like the hold of a slave ship with fifteen wretches children and women and the other ninetyseven were disposed upon the luggage or squatted on the bulwarks having some experience in such matters and being favoured by fortune i found a spare bedframe slung to the ships side and giving a dollar to its owner a sailorwho flattered himself that because it was his he would sleep upon iti instantly appropriated it preferring any hardship outside to the condition of a packed herring inside the place of torment  our maghrabis were finelooking animals from the deserts about tripoli and tunis so savage that but a few weeks ago they had gazed at the cockboat and wondered how long it would be growing to the size of the ship that was to take them to alexandria most of them were sturdy young fellows roundheaded broadshouldered tall and largelimbed with frowning eyes and voices in a perpetual roar their manners were rude and their faces full of fierce contempt or insolent familiarity a few old men were there with countenances expressive of intense ferocity women as savage and full of fight as men and handsome boys with shrill voices and hands always upon their daggers the women were mere bundles of dirty white rags the males were clad in burnusbrown or striped woollen cloaks with hoods they had neither turband nor tarbush trusting to their thick curly hair or to the prodigious hardness of their scalps as a defence against the sun and there was not a slipper nor a shoe amongst the party of course all were armed but fortunately for us none had anything more formidable than a cutandthrust dagger about ten inches long these maghrabis travel in hordes under  p191 a leader who obtains the temporary title of maulathe master he has generally performed a pilgrimage or two and has collected a stock of superficial information which secures for him the respect of his followers and the profound contempt of the heavenmade ciceroni of meccah and almadinah no people endure greater hardships when upon the pilgrimage than these africans who trust almost entirely to alms and to other such dispensations of providence it is not therefore to be wondered at that they rob whenever an opportunity presents itself several cases of theft occurred on board the golden wire and as such plunderers seldom allow themselves to be baulked by insufficient defence they are accused perhaps deservedly of having committed some revolting murders  the first thing to be done after gaining standingroom was to fight for greater comfort and never a holyhead packet in the olden time showed a finer scene of pugnacity than did our pilgrim ship a few turks ragged old men from anatolia and caramania were mixed up with the maghrabis and the former began the war by contemptuously elbowing and scolding their wild neighbours the maghrabis under their leader maula ali a burly savage in whom i detected a ridiculous resemblance to the rev charles delafosse an old and wellremembered schoolmaster retorted so willingly that in a few minutes nothing was to be seen but a confused mass of humanity each item indiscriminately punching and pulling scratching and biting butting and trampling with cries of rage and all the accompaniments of a proper fray whatever was obnoxious to such operations one of our party on the poop a syrian somewhat incautiously leapt down to aid his countrymen by restoring order he sank immediately below the surface of the living mass and when we fished him out his forehead was cut open half his beard had disappeared and a fine sharp set  p192 of teeth belonging to some maghrabi had left their mark in the calf of his leg the enemy showed no love of fair play and never appeared contented unless five or six of them were setting upon a single man this made matters worse the weaker of course drew their daggers and a few bad wounds were soon given and received in a few minutes five men were completely disabled and the victors began to dread the consequences of their victory  then the fighting stopped and as many could not find places it was agreed that a deputation should wait upon ali murad the owner to inform him of the crowded state of the vessel after keeping us in expectation at least three hours he appeared in a rowboat preserving a respectful distance and informed us that any one who pleased might quit the ship and take back his fare this left the case exactly as it was before none would abandon his party to go on shore so ali murad rowed off towards suez giving us a parting injunction to be good and not fight  to trust in allah and that allah would make all things easy to us his departure was the signal for a second fray which in its accidents differed a little from the first during the previous disturbance we kept our places with weapons in our hands this time we were summoned by the maghrabis to relieve their difficulties by taking about half a dozen of them on the poop saad the demon at once rose with an oath and threw amongst us a bundle of nabbutgoodly ashen staves six feet long thick as a mans wrist well greased and tried in many a rough bout he shouted to us defend yourselves if you dont wish to be the meat of the maghrabis and to the enemydogs and sons of dogs now shall you see what the children of the arab are i am omar of daghistan i am abdullah the son of joseph i am saad the demon we exclaimed renowning it by this display of name and patronymic to do our enemies justice they showed no  p193 sign of flinching they swarmed towards the poop like angry hornets and encouraged each other with cries of allaho akbar but we had a vantageground about four feet above them and their palmsticks and short daggers could do nothing against our terrible quarterstaves in vain the jacquerie tried to scale the poop and to overpower us by numbers their courage only secured them more broken heads  at first i began to lay on load with main morte really fearing to kill some one with such a weapon but it soon became evident that the maghrabis heads and shoulders could bear and did require the utmost exertion of strength presently a thought struck me a large earthen jar full of drinking waterfn3in its heavy frame of wood the weight might have been 100 lbsstood upon the edge of the poop and the thick of the fray took place beneath seeing an opportunity i crept up to the jar and without attracting attention rolled it down by a smart push with the shoulder upon the swarm of assailants the fall caused a shriller shriek to rise above the ordinary din for heads limbs and bodies were sorely bruised by the weight scratched by the broken potsherds and wetted by the sudden discharge a fear that something worse might be coming made the maghrabis slink off towards the end of the vessel after a few minutes we sitting in grave silence received a deputation of individuals in whitybrown burnus spotted and striped with what mephistopheles calls a curious juice they solicited peace which we granted upon the condition that they would pledge themselves to keep it our heads shoulders and hands were penitentially kissed and presently the fellows returned to bind up their hurts in dirty  p194 rags we owed this victory entirely to our own exertions and the meek omar was by far the fiercest of the party our rais as we afterwards learned was an old fool who could do nothing but call for the fatihahfn4 claim bakhshish at every place where we moored for the night and spend his leisure hours in the caccia del mediterraneo our crew consisted of half a dozen egyptian lads who not being able to defend themselves were periodically chastised by the maghrabis especially when any attempt was made to cook to fetch water or to prepare a pipefn5  at length about 3 pm on the 6th july 1853 we shook out the sail and as it bellied in the favourable wind we recited the fatihah with upraised hands which we afterwards drew down our facesfn6 as the golden wire started from her place i could not help casting one wistful look upon the british flag floating over the consulate but the momentary regret was stifled by the heartbounding which prospects of an adventure excite and by the real pleasure of leaving egypt i had lived there a stranger in the land and a hapless life it had been in the streets every mans face as he looked upon the persian was the face of a foe whenever i came in contact with the native officialsfn7 insolence marked the  p195 event and the circumstance of living within hail of my fellowcountrymen and yet finding it impossible to enjoy their society still throws a gloom over the memory of my first sojourn in egypt  the ships of the red seainfamous region of rocks reefs and shoalscruise along the coast by day and at night layto in the first cove they find they do not sail when it blows hard and as in winter time the weather is often stormy and the light of day does not last long the voyage is intolerably slowfn8 at sunset we stayed our adventurous course and still within sight of suez comfortably anchored under the lee of jabal atakah the mountain of deliverancefn9 the buttend of jabal joshi we were now on classic waters the eastern shore was dotted with the little grove of palmtrees which clusters around the uyun musa or moses wells and on the west between two towering ridges lay the mouth of the valley badiyah or wady tawarik or wady musa down which according to father sicardfn10 the israelites fled to  p196 the sea of sedgefn11 the view was by no means deficient in a sort of barbarous splendour verdure there was none but under the violet and orange tints of the sky the chalky rocks became heaps of topazes and the brownburnt ridges masses of amethyst the rising mists here silvery white there deeply rosy and the bright blue of the wavesfn12 lining long strips of golden sand compensated for the want of softness by a semblance of savage gorgeousness  next morning 7th july before the cerulean hue had vanished from the hills we set sail it was not long before we came to a proper sense of our position the box containing my store of provisions and worse still my opium was at the bottom of the hold perfectly unapproachable we had therefore the pleasure of breaking our fast on mares skinfn13 and a species of biscuit hard as a stone and quite as tasteless during the day whilst insufferable splendour reigned above the dashing of the waters below kept my nest in a state of perpetual drench at night rose a cold bright moon with dews falling so thick and clammy that the skin felt as though it would never be dry again it is also by no means pleasant  p197 to sleep upon a broken cot about four feet long by two broad with the certainty that a false movement would throw you overboard and a conviction that if you do fall from a sambuk under sail no mortal power can save you and as under all circumstances in the east dozing is ones chief occupation the reader will understand that the want of it left me in utter utter idleness  the gale was light that day and the sunbeams were fire our crew preferred crouching in the shade of the sail to taking advantage of what wind there was in spite of our impatience we made but little way near evening time we anchored on a tongue of sand about two miles distant from the wellknown and picturesque heights called by the arabs hammam faraunfn14 which  like giants stand to sentinel enchanted land  the strip of coarse quartz and sandstone gravel is obviously the offspring of some mountain torrent it stretches southwards being probably disposed in that direction by the currents of the sea as they receive the deposit the distance of the hammam bluffs prevented my visiting them which circumstance i regretted the less as they have been described by pens equal to the task  that evening we enjoyed ourselves upon clean sand whose surface drifted by the wind into small yellow waves was easily converted by a little digging and heaping up into the coolest and most comfortable of couches indeed after the canescent heat of the day and the tossing of our illconditioned vessel we should have been contented with lodgings far less luxurious fuel was readily collected and while some bathed others   p198 erected a hearththree large stones and a hole open to leewardlit the fire and put the pot on to boil shaykh nur had fortunately a line we had been successful in fishing a little rice also had been bought with this boiled and rockcod broiled upon the charcoal we made a dinner that caused every one to forget the sore grievance of mares skin and stonehard biscuit a few maghrabis had ventured on shore the rais having terrified the others by threatening them with those bogies the badawinand they offered us kuskusufn15 in exchange for fish as evening fell we determined before sleeping to work upon their morale as effectually as we had attacked their physique shaykh hamid stood up and indulged them with the azan or call to prayers pronounced after the fashion of almadinahfn16 they performed their devotions in lines ranged behind us as a token of respect and when worship was over we were questioned about the holy city till we grew tired of answering again our heads and shoulders our hands and kneesfn17 were kissed but this time in devotion not in penitence my companions could scarcely understand half the rugged words which the maghrabis usedfn18 as their dialect was fresh from the  p199 distant desert still we succeeded in making ourselves intelligible to them vaunting our dignity as the sons of the prophet and the sanctity of our land which should protect its children from every description of fraud and violence we benignantly promised to be their guides at almadinah and the boy mohammed would conduct their devotions at meccah always provided that they repented their past misdeeds avoided any repetition of the same and promised to perform the duties of good and faithful pilgrims presently the rais joined our party and the usual storytelling began the old man knew the name of each hill and had a legend for every nook and corner in sight he dwelt at length upon the life of abu zulaymah the patron saint of these seas whose little tomb stands at no great distance from our bivouac place and told us how he sits watching over the safety of pious mariners in a cave among the neighbouring rocks and sipping his coffee which is brought in a raw state from meccah by green birds and prepared in the usual way by the hands of ministering angels he showed us the spot where the terrible king of egypt when close upon the heels of the children of israel was whelmed in the hell of watersfn19 and he warned us that next day our way would be through breakers and reefs and dangerous currents over whose troubled depths since that awful day the ifrit of the storm has never ceased to flap his sable wing the wincing of the hearers proved that the shaft of the old mans words was sharp but as night was advancing we unrolled our rugs and fell asleep upon the sand all of us happy for we had fed and drunk and  p200the homo sapiens is a hopeful animalwe made sure that on the morrow the ifrit would be merciful and allow us to eat fresh dates at the harbour of tur  fair visions of dates doomed to the limbo of things which should have been the grey dawn 8th july looked down upon us in difficulties the water is deep near this coast we had anchored at high tide close to the shore and the ebb had left us high and dry when this fact became apparent a storm was upon the point of breaking the maghrabis but for our interference would have bastinadoed the rais who they said with some reason ought to have known better when this phase of feeling passed away they applied themselves to physical efforts all except the women and children who stood on the shore encouraging their relatives with shrill quaverings threw themselves into the water some pushed others applied their shoulders to the vessels side and all used their lungs with might and main but the golden wire was firmly fixed and their exertions were too irregular muscular force failed upon which they changed their tactics at the suggestion of their maula they prepared to burn incense in honour of the shaykh abu zulaymah the material not being forthcoming they used coffee which perhaps accounts for the shortcomings of that holy man after this the rais remembered that their previous exertions had not begun under the auspices of the fatihah therefore they prayed and then reapplied themselves to work still they failed finally each man called aloud upon his own particular saint or spiritual guide and rushed forward as if he alone sufficed for the exploit shaykh hamid unwisely quoted the name and begged the assistance of his great ancestor the clarifiedbutterseller the obdurate golden wire was not moved and hamid retired in momentary confusion  it was now about nine am and the water had risen  p201 considerably my morning had been passed in watching the influx of the tide and the grotesque efforts of the maghrabis when the vessel showed some symptoms of unsteadiness i arose walked gravely up to her ranged the pilgrims around her with their shoulders to the sides and told them to heave with might when they heard me invoke the revered name of my patron saint i raised my hands and voice ya piran pir ya abd alkadir jilanifm20 was the signal each maghrabi worked like an atlas the golden wire canted half over and sliding heavily through the sand once more floated off into deep water this was generally voted a minor miracle and the effendi was respectedfor a day or two  the wind was fair but we had all to reembark an operation which went on till noon after starting i remarked the natural cause which gives this birkat faraunpharaohs baya bad name here the gulf narrows and the winds which rush down the clefts and valleys of the lofty mountains on the eastern and western shores meeting tides and countercurrents cause a perpetual commotion that day the foamtipped waves repeatedly washed over my cot by no means diminishing its discomforts in the evening or rather late in the afternoon we anchored to our infinite disgust under a ridge of rocks behind which lies the plain of tur the rais deterred all from going on shore by terrible stories about the badawin that haunt the place besides which there was no sand to sleep upon we remained therefore on board that night and making sail early the next morning we threaded through reefs and sandbanks about noon into the intricate and dangerous entrance of tur  nothing can be meaner than the present appearance of the old phoenician colony although its position as a  p202 harbour and its plentiful supply of fruit and fresh water make it one of the most frequented places on the coast the only remains of any antiquityexcept the wellsare the fortifications which the portuguese erected to keep out the badawin the little town lies upon a plain that stretches with a gradual rise from the sea to the lofty mountainaxis of the sinaitic group the country around reminded me strongly of maritime sind a flat of clay and sand clothed with sparse turfs of salsolae and bearing strong signs of a geologically speaking recent origin the town is inhabited principally by greek and other christiansfn21 who live by selling water and provisions to ships a fleecy cloud hung lightly over the majestic head of jabal tur about eventide and the outlines of the giant hills stood picked out from the clear blue sky our rais weatherwise man warned us that these were indications of a gale and that in case of rough weather he did not intend to leave tur i was not sorry to hear this we had passed a pleasant day drinking sweet water and eating the dates grapes and pomegranates which the people of the place carry down to the beach for the benefit of hungry pilgrims besides which there were various sights to see and with these we might profitably spend the morrow we therefore pitched the tent upon the sand and busied ourselves with  p203 extricating a box of provisions the labour was rendered lighter by the absence of the maghrabis some of whom were wandering about the beach whilst others had gone off to fill their bags with fresh water we found their surliness insufferable even when we were passing from poop to forecastle landing or boarding they grumbled forth their dissatisfaction  our rais was not mistaken in his prediction the fleecy cloud on turs tops had given true warning when morning 9th july broke we found the wind strong and the sea white with foam most of us thought lightly of these terrors but our valorous captain swore that he dared not for his life cross in such a storm the mouth of illomened akabah we breakfasted therefore and afterwards set out to visit moses hot baths mounted on wretched donkeys with packsaddles ignorant of stirrups and without tails whilst we ourselves suffered generally from boils which as usual upon a journey make their appearance in localities the most inconvenient our road lay northward across the plain towards a long narrow strip of date ground surrounded by a ruinous mud wall after a ride of two or three miles we entered the gardens and came suddenly upon the hammam it is a prim little cockney bungalow built by abbas pasha of egypt for his own accommodation glaringly whitewashed and garnished with diwans and calico curtains of a gorgeous hue the guardian had been warned of our visit and was present to supply us with bathingcloths and other necessaries one by one we entered the cistern which is now in an inner room the water is about four feet deep warm in winter cool in summer of a saltishbitter taste but celebrated for its invigorating qualities when applied externally on one side of the calcareous rock near the ground is the hole opened for the spring by moses rod which must have been like the mast of some tall  p204 ammiralfn22 and near it are the marks of moses nailsdeep indentations in the stone which were probably left there by some extinct saurian our cicerone informed us that formerly the fingermarks existed and that they were long enough for a man to lie in the same functionary attributed the sanitary properties of the spring to the blessings of the prophet and when asked why moses had not made sweet water to flow informed us that the great lawgiver had intended the spring for bathing in not for drinking we sat with him eating the small yellow dates of tur which are delicious melting like honey in the mouth and leaving a surpassing arriere gout after finishing sundry pipes and cups of coffee we gave the bathman a few piastres and mounting our donkeys started eastward for the bir musafn23 which we reached in half an hour it is a fine old work built round and domed over with roughly squared stones very like what may be seen in some rustic parts of southern england the sides of the pit were so rugged that a man could climb down them and at the bottom was a pool of water sweet and abundant we had intended to stay there and to dine al fresco but the hated faces of our companions the maghrabis meeting us at the entrance nipped that project in the bud accordingly we retired from the burning  p205 sun to a neighbouring coffeehousea shed of palm leaves kept by a tur man and there seated on mats we demolished the contents of our basket whilst we were eating some badawin came in and joined us when invited so to do they were poorly dressed and all armed with knives and cheap sabres hanging to leathern bandoleers in language and demeanour they showed few remains of their old ferocity as late as mohammed alis time these people were noted wreckers and formerly they were dreaded pirates now they are lions with their fangs and claws drawn  in the even when we returned to our tent a syrian one of our party on the poop came out to meet us with the information that several large vessels had arrived from suez comparatively speaking empty and that the captain of one of them would land us at yambu for three dollars a head the proposal was tempting but presently it became apparent that my companions were unwilling to shift their precious boxes and moreover that i should have to pay for those who could not or would not pay for themselvesthat is to say for the whole party as such a display of wealth would have been unadvisable i dismissed the idea with a sigh amongst the large vessels was one freighted with persian pilgrims a most disagreeable race of men on a journey or a voyage they would not land at first because they feared the badawin they would not take water from the town people because some of these were christians moreover they insisted upon making their own call to prayer which heretical proceedingit admits five extra wordsour party orthodox moslems would rather have died than have permitted when their crier a small wizenfaced man began the azan with a voice  in quel tenore che fa il cappon quando talvolta canta  we received it with a shout of derision and some hastily  p206 snatching up their weapons offered him an opportunity of martyrdom the maghrabis too hearing that the persians were rafaz heretics crowded fiercely round to do a little jihad or fighting for the faith the longbearded men took the alarm they were twice the number of our small party and therefore they had been in the habit of strutting about with nonchalance and looking at us fixedly and otherwise demeaning themselves in an indecorous way but when it came to the point they showed the white feather these persians accompanied us to the end of our voyage as they approached the holy land visions of the nabbut caused a change for the better in their manners at mahar they meekly endured a variety of insults and at yambu they cringed to us like dogs  fn1 men of the maghrab or western africa the vulgar plural is maghrabin generally written mogrebyn may not the singular form of this word have given rise to the latin maurus by elision of the ghayn to italians an unpronounceable consonant from maurus comes the portuguese moro and our moor when vasco de gama reached calicut he found there a tribe of arab colonists who in religion and in language were the same as the people of northern africafor this reason he called them moors this was explained long ago by vincent periplus lib 3 and lately by prichard natural history of man i repeat it because it has been my fate to hear at a meeting of a learned society in london a gentleman declare that in eastern africa he found a people calling themselves moors maghrabinwesternsthen would be opposed to sharkiyin easterns the origin of our saracen from gibbon downwards many have discussed the history of this word but few expected in the nineteenth century to see a writer on eastern subjects assert with sir john mandeville that these people properly ben clept sarrazins of sarra the learned m jomard who never takes such original views of things asks a curious questionmais comment un son aussi distinct que le chine arabic text auraitil pu se confondre avec le syn arabic text et pour un mot aussi connu que charq comment auraiton pu se tromper a lomission des points simply because the word saracens came to us through the greeks ptolemy uses it who have no such sound as sh in their language and through the italian which hostile to the harsh sibilants of oriental dialects generally melts sh down into s so the historical word hashshashiyunhempdrinkercivilised by the italians into assassino became as all know an expression of european use but if any one adverse to etymological fancies objects to my deriving maurus from maghrab let him remember johnsons successfully tracing the course of the metamorphosis of dies into jour an even more peculiar change we may discover in the word elephant pilu in sanscrit became pil in old persian which ignores short final vowels fil and with the article alfil in arabic which supplies the place of p an unknown letter to it by f and elephas in greek which is fond of adding as to arabic words as in the cases of aretas haris and obodas obayd a name says humboldt often becoming a

insolence of demeanour and coarseness of language as far as my experience goes our roughness and brusquerie are mere politeness compared with what passes between easterns at the same time it must be owned that i have seen the worst of it fn8 it was far safer and more expeditious in aladrisis day ad 1154 when the captain used to sit on the poop furnished with numerous and useful instruments when

harshest and most guttural form of arabic it owes this unenviable superiority to its frequency of sukun or the quiescence of one or more consonantsklab for instance for kilab and msik for amsik thus it is that vowels the soft and liquid part of language disappear leaving in their place a barbarous sounding mass of consonants fn19 burckhardt mentions the arab legend that the spirits of the drowned

the 11th july 1853 about dawn we left tur after a pleasant halt with the unpleasant certainty of not touching ground for thirtysix hours i passed the time in steadfast contemplation of the web of my umbrella and in making the following meteorological remarks  morningthe air is mild and balmy as that of an italian spring thick mists roll down the valleys along the sea and a haze like motheropearl crowns the headlands the distant rocks show titanic walls lofty donjons huge projecting bastions and moats full of deep shade at their base runs a sea of amethyst and as earth receives the first touches of light their summits almost transparent mingle with the jasper tints of the sky nothing can be more delicious than this hour but as  les plus belles choses ont le pire destin  so lovely morning soon fades the sun bursts up from behind the main a fierce enemy a foe that will force every one to crouch before him he dyes the sky orange and the sea incarnadine where its violet surface is stained by his rays and he mercilessly puts to flight the mists and haze and the little agatecoloured masses of cloud that were before floating in the firmament the atmosphere is so clear that now and then a planet is visible for the two  p208 hours following sunrise the rays are endurable after that they become a fiery ordeal the morning beams oppress you with a feeling of sickness their steady glow reflected by the glaring waters blinds your eyes blisters your skin and parches your mouth you now become a monomaniac you do nothing but count the slow hours that must minute by before you can be relievedfn1  middaythe wind reverberated by the glowing hills is like the blast of a limekiln all colour melts away with the canescence from above the sky is a dead milkwhite and the mirrorlike sea so reflects the tint that you can scarcely distinguish the line of the horizon after noon the wind sleeps upon the reeking shore there is a deep stillness the only sound heard is the melancholy flapping of the sail men are not so much sleeping as halfsenseless they feel as if a few more degrees of heat would be death  sunsetthe enemy sinks behind the deep cerulean sea under a canopy of gigantic rainbow which covers half the face of heaven nearest to the horizon is an arch of tawny orange above it another of the brightest gold and based upon these a semicircle of tender seagreen blends with a score of delicate gradations into the sapphire sky across the rainbow the sun throws its rays in the form of giant wheelspokes tinged with a beautiful pink the eastern sky is mantled with a purple flush that picks out the forms of the hazy desert and the sharpcut hills language is a thing too cold too poor to express the harmony and the majesty of this hour which is as evanescent however as it is lovely night falls rapidly when suddenly the appearance of the zodiacal lightfn2 restores  p209 the scene to what it was again the grey hills and the grim rocks become rosy or golden the palms green the sands saffron and the sea wears a lilac surface of dimpling waves but after a quarter of an hour all fades once more the cliffs are naked and ghastly under the moon whose light falling upon this wilderness of white crags and pinnacles is most strangemost mysterious  nightthe horizon is all darkness and the sea reflects the white visage of the nightsun as in a mirror of steel in the air we see giant columns of pallid light distinct based upon the indigocoloured waves and standing with their heads lost in endless space the stars glitter with exceeding brilliancefn3 at this hour are  river and hill and wood with all the numberless goings on of life inaudible as dreams  while the planets look down upon you with the faces of smiling friends you feel the sweet influence of the pleiades you are bound by the bond of orion hesperus bears with him a thousand things in communion with them your hours pass swiftly by till the heavy dews warn you to cover up your face and sleep and with one look at a certain little star in the north under which lies all that makes life worth living throughsurely it is a venial superstition to sleep with your eyes towards that kiblahyou fall

exertion so altered him that he looked another man salih shakkar in despair ate dates till threatened with a dysentery saad the demon had rigged out for himself a cot three feet long which arched over

forgot to chatter to scold to smoke and to make himself generally disagreeable the turkish baby appeared to be dying and was not strong enough to wail how the poor mother stood her trials so well made every one wonder the most pleasant trait in my companions characters was the consideration they showed to her and their attention to her children whenever one of the party drew forth a little

those who sweepingly accuse easterns of want of gallantry to contrast this trait of character with the savage scenes of civilisation that take place among the overlands at cairo and suezfn4 no foreigner could be present for the first time without bearing away the lasting impression that the sons of great britain are model barbariansfn5 on board the golden wire salih shakkar was the sole base exception to the general geniality of my companions  as the sun starts towards the west falling harmlessly upon our heads we arise still faint and dizzy calling for waterwhich before we had not the strength  p211 to drinkand pipes and coffee and similar luxuries our primitive kitchen is a square wooden box lined with clay and filled with sand upon which three or four large stones are placed to form a hearth preparations are now made for the evening meal which is of the simplest description a little rice a few dates or an onion will keep a man alive in our position a single good dinner would justify long odds against his seeing the next evening moreover it is impossible in such cases to have an appetitefortunately as our store of provisions is a scanty one arabs consider it desirable on a journey to eat hot food once in the twentyfour hours so we determine to cook despite all difficulties the operation however is by no means satisfactory twenty expectants surround the single fire and there is sure to be a quarrel amongst them every five minutes  as the breeze cooled by the dew begins to fan our parched faces we recover our spirits amazingly songs are sung tales are told and rough jests are bandied about till not unfrequently oriental sensitiveness is sorely tried or if we see the prospect of storm or calm we draw forth and piously peruse a hizb albahr as this prayer is supposed to make all safe upon the ocean wave i will not selfishly withhold it from the british reader to draw forth all its virtues the reciter should receive it from the hands of his murshid or spiritual guide and study it during the chillah or forty days of fast of which i venture to observe few sons of bull are capable  o allah o exalted o almighty o allpitiful o allpowerful thou art my god and sufficeth to me the knowledge of it glorified be the lord my lord and glorified be the faith my faith thou givest victory to whom thou pleasest and thou art the glorious the merciful we pray thee for safety in our goings forth and our standings still in our words and our designs in our  p212 dangers of temptation and doubt and the secret designs of our hearts subject unto

and lastly we lie down upon our cribs wrapped up in thickly padded cotton coverlets we forget the troubles of the past day and we care nought for the discomforts of that to come  late on the evening of the 11th july we passed in sight of the narrow mouth of alakabah whose famosi rupes are a terror to the voyagers of these latitudes like the gulf of cambay here a tempest is said to be always brewing and men raise their hands to pray as they cross it we had no storm that day from without but a fierce one was about to burst within our ship the essence of oriental discipline is personal respect based upon fear therefore it often happens that the commanding officer  p213 if a mild old gentleman is the last person whose command is obeyedhis only privilege being that of sitting apart from his inferiors and such was the case with our rais on the present occasion irritated by the refusal of the maghrabis to stand out of the steermans way and excited by the prospect of losing sight of shore for a whole day he threatened one of the fellows with his slipper it required all our exertions even to a display of the dreaded quarterstaves to calm the consequent excitement after passing alakabah we saw nothing but sea and sky and we spent a weary night and day tossing upon the waters our only exercise every face brightened as about sunset on the 12th july we suddenly glided into the mooringplace  marsa anchorage damghahfn10 or rather dumayghah is scarcely visible from the sea an islet of limestone rock defends the entrance leaving a narrow passage to the south it is not before he enters that the mariner discovers the extent and the depth of this creek which indents far into the land and offers 15 to 20 feet of fine clear anchorage which no swell can reach inside it looks more like a lake and at night its colour is gloriously blue as geneva itself i could not help calling to mind after dinner the old school lines  est in secessu longo locus insula portum efficit objectu laterum quibus omnis ab alto frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos  nothing was wanted but the atrum nemus where however shall we find such luxuries in arid arabia  the rais as usual attempted to deter us from landing by romancing about the bedoynes and ascopards representing them to be folke ryghte felonouse and foule and of cursed kynde to which we replied by shouldering our nabbuts and scrambling into the cockboat  p214 on shore we saw a few wretchedlooking beings juhaynahfn11 or hutaym seated upon heaps of dried wood which they sold to travellers and three boatloads of syrian pilgrims who had preceded us we often envied them their small swift craft with their double latine sails disposed in hareears which about eventide in the far distance looked like a white gull alighting upon the purple wave and they justified our jealousy by arriving at yambu two days before us the pilgrims had bivouacked upon the beach and were engaged in drinking their afterdinner coffee they received us with all the rights of hospitality as natives of almadinah should everywhere be received we sat an hour with them ate a little fruit satisfied our thirst smoked their pipes and when taking leave blessed them then returning to the vessel we fed and lost no time in falling asleep  the dawn of the next day saw our sail flapping in the idle air and it was not without difficulty that in the course of the forenoon we entered wijh harbour distant from dumayghah but very few miles alwijh is also a natural anchorage in no way differing from that where we passed the night except in being smaller and shallower and less secure from this place to cairo the road is safe the town is a collection of round huts meanly built of round stones and clustering upon a piece of elevated rock on the northern side of the creek it is  p215 distant about six miles from the inland fort of the same name which receives the egyptian caravan and which thrives like its port by selling water and provisions to pilgrims the little bazar almost washed by every high tide provided us with mutton rice baked bread and the other necessaries of life at a moderate rate luxuries also were to be found a druggist sold me an ounce of opium at a chinese price  with reeling limbs we landed at alwijhfn12 and finding a large coffeehouse above and near the beach we installed ourselves there but the persians who preceded us had occupied all the shady places outside and were correcting their teeth with their case knives we were forced to content ourselves with the interior it was a building of artless construction consisting of little but a roof supported by wooden posts roughly hewn from date trees round the tamped earthen floor ran a raised bench of unbaked brick forming a diwan for mats and sleepingrugs in the centre a huge square mastabah or platform answered a similar purpose here and there appeared attempts at long and side walls but these superfluities had been allowed to admit daylight through large gaps in one corner stood the apparatus of the kahwahji an altarlike elevation also of earthenwork containing a hole for a charcoal fire upon which were three huge coffeepots dirtily tinned near it were ranged the shishas or egyptian hookahs old exceedingly unclean and worn by age and hard work a wooden framework pierced with circular apertures supported a number of porous earthenware gullehs gargoulettes or monkey jars full of cold sweet water the charge for each was as usual in alhijaz five paras such was the furniture of the cafe and the only relief to the barrenness of the view was a fine mellowing atmosphere composed of smoke steam  p216 flies and gnats in about equal proportions i have been diffuse in my description of the coffeehouse as it was a type of its class from alexandria to aden the traveller will everywhere meet with buildings of the same kind  our happiness in this paradisefor such it was to us after the golden wirewas nearly sacrificed by saad the demon whose abominable temper led him at once into a quarrel with the master of the cafe and the latter an illlooking squinteyed lowbrowed broadshouldered fellow showed himself nowise unwilling to meet the demon half way the two worthies after a brief bandying of bad words seized each others throats leisurely so as to give the spectators time and encouragement to interfere but when friends and acquaintances were hanging on to both heroes so firmly that they could not move hand or arm their wrath as usual rose till it was terrible to see the little village resounded with the war and many a sturdy knave rushed in sword or cudgel in hand so as not to lose the sport during the heat of the fray a pistol which was in omar effendis hand went offaccidentally of courseand the ball passed so close to the tins containing the black and muddy mocha that it drew the attention of all parties as if by magic the storm was lulled a friend recognised saad the demon and swore that he was no black slave but a soldier at almadinahno waiter but a knight templar this caused him to be looked upon as rather a distinguished man and he proved his right to the honour by insisting that his late enemy should feed with him and when the other decorously hung back by dragging him to dinner with loud cries  my alias that day was severely tried besides the persian pilgrims a number of nondescripts who came in the same vessel were hanging about the coffeehouse lying down smoking drinking water bathing and picking their teeth with their daggers one inquisitive man  p217 was always at my side he called himself a pathan afghan settled in india he could speak five or six languages he knew a number of people everywhere and he had travelled far and wide over central asia these fellows are always good detectors of an incognito i avoided answering his question about my native place and after telling him that i had no longer name or nation being a darwaysh i asked him when he insisted upon my having been born somewhere to guess for himself to my joy he claimed me for a brother pathan and in course of conversation he declared himself to be the nephew of an afghan merchant a gallant old man who had been civil to me at cairo we then sat smoking together with effusion becoming confidential he complained that he a sunni or orthodox moslem had been abused maltreated and beaten by his fellowtravellers the heretical persian pilgrims i naturally offered to arm my party to take up our cudgels and to revenge my compatriot this thoroughly sulaymanian style of doing business could not fail to make him sure of his man he declined however wisely remembering that he had nearly a fortnight of the persians society still to endure but he promised himself the gratification when he reached meccah of sheathing his charayfn13 in the chief offenders heart  at 8 am on the 14th july we left alwijh after passing a night tolerably comfortable by contrast in the coffeehouse we took with us the stores necessary for though our rais had promised to anchor under jabal hassani that evening no one believed him we sailed among ledges of rock golden sands green weeds and in some places through yellow lines of what appeared to me at a distance foam after a storm all day a sailor sat upon the masthead looking at the water which was transparent as blue glass and shouting out the direction this precaution was somewhat stultified by the roar of voices which never  p218 failed to mingle with the warning but we wore every half hour and we did not run aground about midday we passed by shaykh hasan almarabits tomb it is the usual domed and whitewashed building surrounded by the hovels of its guardians standing upon a low flat island of yellow rock vividly reminding me of certain scenes in sind its dreary position attracts to it the attention of passing travellers the dead saint has a prayer and a fatihah for the good of his soul and the live sinner wends his way with religious refreshment  near sunset the wind came on to blow freshly and we cast anchor together with the persian pilgrims upon a rock this was one of the celebrated coral reefs of the red sea and the sight justified forskals emphatic descriptionluxus lususque naturae it was a huge ledge or platform rising but little above the level of the deep the waterside was perpendicular as the wall of a fort and whilst a frigate might have floated within a yard of it every ripple dashed over the reef replenishing the little basins and hollows in the surface the colour of the waves near it was a vivid amethyst in the distance the eye rested upon what appeared to be meadows of brilliant flowers resembling those of earth only far brighter and more lovely nor was this land of the sea wholly desolate gulls and terns here swam the tide there seated upon the coral devoured their prey in the air troops of birds contended noisily for a dead flying fishfn14 and in the deep water they chased a shoal which in fright and hurry to escape the pursuers veiled the surface with  p219 spray and foam and as night came on the scene shifted displaying fresh beauties shadows clothed the background whose features dimly revealed allowed full scope to the imagination in the forepart of the picture lay the sea shining under the rays of the moon with a metallic lustre while its border where the wavelets dashed upon the reef was lit by what the arabs call the jewels of the deepfn15brilliant flashes of phosphoric light giving an idea of splendour which art would vainly strive to imitate altogether it was a bit of fairyland a spot for nymphs and seagods to disport upon you might have heard without astonishment old proteus calling his flocks with the writhed conch and aphrodite seated in her shell would have been only a fit and proper climax for its loveliness  butas philosophically remarked by sir cauline the knyghte  every whyte must have its blacke and every sweete its soure  this charming coral reef was nearly being the scene of an ugly accident the breeze from seaward set us slowly but steadily towards the reef a fact of which we soon became conscious our anchor was not dragging it had not rope enough to touch the bottom and vainly we sought for more in fact the golden wire was as disgracefully deficient in all the appliances of safety as any english merchantman in the nineteenth centurya circumstance which accounts for the shipwrecks and for the terrible loss of life perpetually occurring about the pilgrimageseason in these seas had she struck upon the razorlike edges of the coralreef she would have melted  p220 away like a sugarplum in the ripple for the tide was rising at the time having nothing better to do we began to make as much noise as possible fortunately for us the rais commanding the persians boat was an arab from jeddah and more than once we had treated him with great civility guessing the cause of our distress he sent two sailors overboard with a cable they swam gallantly up to us and in a few minutes we were safely moored to the stern of our useful neighbour which done we applied ourselves to the grateful task of beating our rais and richly had he deserved it before noon when the wind was shifting he had not once given himself the trouble to wear and when the breeze was falling he preferred dosing to taking advantage of what little wind remained with energy we might have been moored that night comfortably under the side of hassani island instead of floating about on an unquiet sea with a leeshore of coralreef within a few yards of our counter  at dawn the next day 15th july we started we made jabal hassanifn16 about noon and an hour or so before sunset we glided into marsa mahar our restingplace resembled marsa dumayghah at an humble distance the sides of the cove however were bolder and more precipitous the limestone rocks presented a peculiar appearance in some parts the base and walls had crumbled away leaving a coping to project like a canopy in others the wind and rain had cut deep holes and pierced the friable material with caverns that looked like the work of art there was a pretty opening of backwood at the bottom of the  p221 cove and palm trees in the blue distance gladdened our eyes which pined for the sight of something green the rais as usual would have terrified us with a description of the hutaym tribe that holds these parts and i knew from welsted and moresby that it is a debased race but fortyeight hours of cramps on board ship would make a man think lightly of a much more imminent danger  wading to shore we cut our feet with the sharp rocks i remember to have felt the acute pain of something running into my toe but after looking at the place and extracting what appeared to be a bit of thornfn17 i dismissed the subject little guessing the trouble it was to give me having scaled the rocky side of the cove we found some halfnaked arabs lying in the shade they were unarmed and had nothing about them except their villainous countenances wherewith to terrify the most timid these men still live in limestone caves like the thamud tribe of tradition also they are ichthyophagi existing without any other subsistence but what the sea affords they were unable to provide us with dates flesh or milk but they sold us a kind of fish called in india bui broiled upon the embers it proved delicious  after we had eaten and drunk and smoked we began to make merry and the persians who fearing to come on shore had kept to their conveyance appeared proper butts for the wit of some of our party one of us stood up and pronounced the orthodox call to prayer after which the rest joined in a polemical hymn exalting the virtues  p222 and dignity of the first three caliphsfn18 then as general on such occasions the matter was made personal by informing the persians in a kind of rhyme sung by the meccan gamins that they were the slippers of ali and the dogs of omar but as they were too frightened to reply my companions gathered up their cooking utensils and returned to the golden wire melancholy like disappointed candidates for the honours of donnybrook  our next day was silent and weary for we were all surly and heartily sick of being on board ship we should have made yambu in the evening but for the laziness of the rais having duly beaten him we anchored on the open coast insufficiently protected by a reef and almost in sight of our destination in the distance rose jabal radhwah or radhwafn19 one of the mountains of paradisefn20 in which honoured arabia abounds it is celebrated by poetry as well as by piety  did radhwah strive to support my woes radhwah itself would be crushed by the weight  says antarfn21 it supplies almadinah with hones i heard much of its valleys and fruits and bubbling springs but afterwards i learned to rank these tales with the superstitious legends which are attached to it gazing at its bare and ghastly heights one of our party whose wit was soured by the want of fresh bread surlily remarked that such a heap of ugliness deserved ejection from heavenan irreverence too public to escape general denunciation we waded on shore cooked there and  p223 passed the night we were short of fresh water which combined with other grievances made us as surly as bears saad the demon was especially vicious his eyes gazed fixedly on the ground his lips protruded till you might have held up his face by them his mouth was garnished with bad wrinkles and he never opened it but he grumbled out a wicked word he solaced himself that evening by crawling slowly on allfours over the boy mohammed taking scrupulous care to place one knee upon the sleepers face the youth awoke in a fiery rage we all roared with laughter and the sulky negro after savouring the success of his spite grimly as but half satisfied rolled himself like a hedgehog into a ball and resolving to be offensive even in his forgetfulness snored violently all night  we slept upon the sands and arose before dawn july 17 determined to make the rais start in time that day a slip of land separated us from our haven but the wind was foul and by reason of rocks and shoals we had to make a considerable detour  it was about noon on the twelfth day after our departure from suez when after slowly beating up the narrow creek leading to yambu harbour we sprang into a shoreboat and felt new life when bidding an eternal adieu to the vile golden wire  i might have escaped much of this hardship and suffering by hiring a vessel to myself there would then have been a cabin to retire into at night and shade from the sun moreover the voyage would have lasted five not twelve days but i wished to witness the scenes on board a pilgrim shipscenes so much talked of by the moslem palmer homereturned moreover the hire was exorbitant ranging from l40 to l50 and it would have led to a greater expenditure as the man who can afford to take a boat must pay in proportion during his lan  p224 journey in these countries you perforce go on as you begin to break ones expenditure that is to say to retrench expenses is considered all but impossible we have now

northern extremity of a narrow winding creek viewed from the harbour it is a long line of buildings whose painful whiteness is set off by a skylike cobalt and a sealike indigo behind it lies the flat here of a bistrebrown there of a lively tawny whilst the background is formed by dismal radhwah  barren and bare unsightly unadorned  outside the walls are a few little domes and tombs which by no means merit attention inside the streets are wide and each habitation is placed at an unsociable distance from its neighbour except near the port and the bazars where ground is valuable the houses are roughly built of limestone and coralline and their walls full of fossils crumble like almond cake they have huge  p227 hanging windows and look mean after those in the moslem quarters of cairo there is a suk or marketstreet of the usual form a long narrow lane darkened by a covering of palm leaves with little shops let into the walls of the houses on both sides the cafes which abound here have already been described in the last chapter they are rendered dirty in the extreme by travellers and it is impossible to sit in them without a fan to drive away the flies the customhouse fronts the landingplace upon the harbour it is managed by turkish officialsmen dressed in tarbushes who repose the livelong day upon the diwans near the windows in the case of us travellers they had a very simple way of doing business charging each person of the party three piastres for each large box but by no means troubling themselves to meddle with the contentsfn4 yambu also boasts of a hammam or hot bath a mere dateleaf shed tenanted by an old turk who with his surly albanian assistant lives by cleaning pilgrims and travellers some whitewashed mosques and minarets of exceedingly simple form a wakalah or two for the reception of merchants and a saints tomb complete the list of public buildings  in one point yambu claims superiority over most other towns in this part of alhijaz those who can afford the luxury drink sweet rainwater collected amongst the hills in tanks and cisterns and brought on camelback to the town two sources are especially praised the ayn albirkat and the ayn ali which suffice to supply the whole population the brackish water of the wells is confined to coarser purposes some of the old people here as at suez are said to prefer the drink to which  p228 years of habit have accustomed them and it is a standing joke that arrived at cairo they salt the water of the nile to make it palatable  the population of yambuone of the most bigoted and quarrelsome races in alhijazstrikes the eye after arriving from egypt as decidedly a new feature the shaykh or gentleman is overarmed and overdressed as fashion the tyrant of the desert as well as of the court dictates to a person of his consequence the civilised traveller from almadinah sticks in his waistshawl a loaded pistolfn5 garnished with crimson silk cord but he partially conceals the buttend under the flap of his jacket the irregular soldier struts down the street a small armoury of weapons one look at the mans countenance suffices to tell you what he is here and there stalk grim badawin wild as their native wastes and in all the dignity of pride and dirt they also are armed to the teeth and even the presence of the policemans quarterstafffn6 cannot keep their swords in their scabbards what we should call the peaceful part of the population never leave the house without the nabbut over the right shoulder and the larger the longer and the heavier the weapon is the more gallantry does the bearer claim the people of yambu practise the use of this implement diligently they become expert in delivering  p229 a headblow so violent as to break through any guard and with it they always decide their trivial quarrelsfn7 the dress of the women differs but little from that of the egyptians except in the face veilfn8 which is generally white there is an independent bearing about the yambu men strange in the east they are proud without insolence and they look manly without blustering their walk partakes somewhat of the nature of a swagger owing perhaps to the shape of the sandals not a little assisted by the selfesteem of the wearer but there is nothing offensive in it moreover the population has a healthy appearance and fresh from egypt i could not help noticing their freedom from ophthalmic disease the children too appear vigorous nor are they here kept in that state of filth to which fear of the evil eye devotes them in the valley of the nile  my companions found me in a coffeehouse where i had sat down to rest from the fatigue of halting on my wounded foot through the town they had passed their boxes through the customhouse and were now inquiring in all directions wheres the effendi after sitting for half an hour we rose to depart when an old arab merchant whom i had met at suez politely insisted  p230 upon paying for my coffee still a mark of attention in arabia as it was whilome in france we then went to a wakalah near the bazar in which my companions had secured an airy upper room on the terrace opposite the sea and tolerably free from yambus plague the flies it had been tenanted by a party of travellers who were introduced to me as omar effendis brothers he had by accident met them in the streets the day before their start for constantinople where they were travelling to receive the ikramfn9 the family was as i have said before from daghistan circassia and the male members still showed unequivocal signs of a northern origin in light yellowish skins grey eyes fringed with dark lashes red lips and a very scant beard they were broadshouldered largelimbed men distinguished only by a peculiar surliness of countenance perhaps their expression was the result of their suspecting me for i observed them narrowly watching every movement during wuzu and prayers this was a good opportunity for displaying the perfect nonchalance of a true believer and my efforts were i believe successful for afterwards they seemed to treat me as a mere stranger from whom they could expect nothing and who therefore was hardly worth their notice  on the afternoon of the day of our arrival we sent for a mukharrijfn10 hirer of conveyance and began to treat for camels one amm jamal a respectable native of almadinah who was on his way home undertook to be the spokesman after a long palaver for  p231 the shaykh of the camels and his attendant badawin were men that fought for farthings and we were not far inferior to them a bargain was struck we agreed to pay three dollars for each beast half in ready money the other half after reaching our destination and to start on the evening of the next day with a graincaravan guarded by an escort of irregular cavalry i hired two animals one for my luggage and servant the other for the boy mohammed and myself expressly stipulating that we were to ride the better beast and that if it broke down on the road its place should be supplied by another as good my friends could not dissemble their uneasiness when informed by the mukharrij that the hazimi tribe was out and that travellers had to fight every day the daghistanis also contributed to their alarm we met said they between 200 and 300 devils on a razzia near almadinah we gave them the salam but they would not reply although we were all on dromedaries then they asked us if we were men of almadinah and we replied ‘yes and lastly they wanted to know the end of our journey so we said bir abbasfn11 the badawin who had accompanied the daghistanis belonged to some tribe unconnected with the hazimi the spokesman rolled his head as much as to say allah has preserved us and a young indian of the partyi shrewdly suspect him of having stolen my penknife that nightdisplayed  p232 the cowardice of a miyanfn12 by looking aghast at the memory of his imminent and deadly risk sir said shaykh nur to me we must wait till all this is over i told him to hold his tongue and sharply reproved the boy mohammed upon whose manner the effect of finding himself suddenly in a fresh country had wrought a change for the worse why ye were lions at cairo and here at yambu you are catshensfn13 it was not long however before the youths impudence returned upon him with increased violence  we sat through the afternoon in the little room on the terrace whose reflected heat together with the fiery winds from the wilderness seemed to incommode even my companions after sunset we dined in the open air a body of twenty master servants children and strangers all the procurable rugs and pillows had been seized to make a diwan and we squatted together round a large cauldron of boiled rice containing square masses of mutton the whole covered with clarified butter saad the demon was now in his glory with what anecdotes the occasion supplied him his tongue seemed to wag with a perpetual motion for each man he had a boisterous greeting and to judge from his whisperings he must have been in every ones privacy and confidence conversation over pipes and coffee was prolonged to ten pm a late hour in these lands then we prayed the  p233 ishafn14 or vespers and spreading our mats upon the terrace slept in the open air  the forenoon of the next day was occupied in making sundry small purchases we laid in seven days provisions for the journey repacked our boxes polished and loaded our arms and attired ourselves appropriately for the road by the advice of amm jamalfn15 i dressed as an arab in order to avoid paying the jizyat a capitation tax fn16 which upon this road the settled tribes extort from stranger travellers and he warned me not to speak any language but arabic even to my slave in the vicinity of a village i bought for my own convenience a shugduf or litterfn17 for which i paid two dollars it is a  p234 vehicle appropriated to women and children fathers of families married men shelebisfn18 and generally to those who are too effeminate to ride my reason for choosing a litter was that notes are more easily taken in it than on a dromedarys back the excuse of lameness prevented it detracting from my manhood and i was careful when entering any populous place to borrow or hire a saddled beast  our party dined early that day for the camels had been sitting at the gate since noon we had the usual trouble in loading them the owners of the animals vociferating about the unconscionable weight the owners of the goods swearing that a child could carry such weight while the beasts taking part with their proprietors moaned piteously roared made vicious attempts to bite and started up with an agility that threw the halfsecured boxes or sacks headlong to the ground about 3 pm all was readythe camels formed into indian file were placed standing in the streets but as usual with oriental travellers all the men dispersed about the town we did not mount before it was late in the afternoon  i must now take the liberty of presenting to the reader an arab shaykh fully equipped for travellingfn19 nothing can be more picturesque than the costume and  p235 it is with regret that we see it exchanged in the towns and more civilised parts for any other the long locks or the shaven scalps are surmounted by a white cotton skullcap over which is a kufiyaha large square kerchief of silk and cotton mixed and generally of a dull red colour with a bright yellow border from which depend crimson silk twists ending in little tassels that reach the wearers waist doubled into a triangle and bound with an aakalfn20 or fillet of rope a skein of yarn or a twist of wool the kerchief fits the head close behind it projects over the forehead shading the eyes and giving a fierce look to the countenance on certain occasions one end is brought round the lower part of the face and is fastened behind the head this veiling the features is technically called lisam the chiefs generally fight so and it is the usual disguise when a man fears the avenger of blood or a woman starts to take her sarfn21 in hot weather it is supposed to keep the samun in cold weather the catarrh from the lungs  p236the body dress is simply a kamis or cotton shirt tight sleeved opening in front and adorned round the waist and collar and down the breast with embroidery like network it extends from neck to foot some wear wide trousers but the badawin consider such things effeminate and they have not yet fallen into the folly of socks and stockings over the kamis is thrown a longskirted and shortsleeved cloak of camels hair called an aba it is made in many patterns and of all materials from pure silk to coarse sheeps wool some prefer it brown others white others striped in alhijaz the favourite hue is white embroidered with goldfn22 tinsel or yellow thread in two large triangles capped with broad bands and other figures running down the shoulders and sides of the back it is lined inside the shoulders and breast with handsome stuffs of silk and cotton mixed and is tied in front by elaborate strings and tassels or acorns of silk and gold a sash confines the kamis at the waist and supports the silverhilted jambiyahfn23 or crooked dagger the picturesque arab sandalfn24 completes the costume finally the  p237 shaykhs arms are a sword and a matchlock slung behind his back in his right hand he carries a short javelinfn25 or a light crooked stick about two feet and a half long called a mashabfn26 used for guiding camels  the poorer clans of arabs twist round their waist p238 next to the skin a long plait of greasy leather to support the back and they gird the shirt at the middle merely with a cord or with a coarse sash the dagger is stuck in this scarf and a bandoleer slung over the shoulders carries the cartridgecase powderflask flint and steel priminghorn and other necessaries with the traveller the waist is an elaborate affair next to the skin is worn the moneypouch concealed by the kamis the latter is girt with a waist shawl over which is strapped a leathern beltfn27 the latter article should always be well garnished with a pair of longbarrelled and silvermounted flint pistolsfn28 a large and a small dagger and an  p239 iron ramrod with pincers inside a little leathern pouch fastened to the waiststrap on the right side contains cartridge wadding and flask of priming powder the sword hangs over the shoulder by crimson silk cords and huge tasselsfn29 welldressed men apply the same showy ornaments to their pistols in the hand may be borne a bellmouthed blunderbuss or better still a long singlebarrel gun with an ounce bore all these weapons must shine like silver if you wish to be respected for the knightly care of arms is here a sign of manliness  pilgrims especially those from turkey carry i have said a hamail to denote their holy errand this is a pocket koran in a handsome goldembroidered crimson velvet or red morocco case slung by red silk cords over the left shoulder it must hang down by the right side and should never depend below the waistbelt for this i substituted a most useful article to all appearance a hamail it had inside three compartments one for my watch and compass the second for ready money and the third contained penknife pencils and slips of paper which i could hold concealed in the hollow of my hand these were for writing and drawing opportunities of making a fair copy into the diarybookfn30 are never wanting to the acute traveller he  p240 must however beware of sketching before the badawin who would certainly proceed to extreme measures suspecting him to be a spy or a sorcererfn31 nothing so effectually puzzles these people as the frankish habit of putting everything on paper their imaginations are set at work and then the worst may be expected from them the only safe way of writing in presence of a badawi would be when drawing out a horoscope or preparing a charm he also objects not if you can warm his heart upon the subject to seeing you take notes in a book of genealogies you might begin with and you men of harb on what origin do you pride yourselves and while the listeners became fluent upon the to them allinteresting  p241 theme you could put down whatever you please upon the margin the townspeople are more liberal and years ago the holy shrines have been drawn surveyed and even lithographed by eastern artists still if you wish to avoid all suspicion you must rarely be seen with pen or with pencil in hand  at 6 pm descending the stairs of our wakalah we found the camels standing loaded in the street and shifting their ground in token of impatiencefn32 my shugduf perched upon the back of a tall strong animal nodded and swayed about with his every motion impressing me with the idea that the first step would throw it over the shoulders or the crupper the camelman told me i must climb up the animals neck and so creep into the vehicle but my foot disabling me from such exertion i insisted upon their bringing the beast to squat which they did grumblinglyfn33 we took leave of omar effendis brothers and their dependents who insisted upon paying us the compliment of accompanying us to the gate then we mounted and started which was a signal for all our party to disperse once more some heard the report of a vessel having arrived from suez with mohammed shiklibha and other friends on board these hurried down to the harbour for a parting word others declaring they had forgotten some necessaries for the way ran off to spend one last hour in gossip at the coffeehouse then the sun set and prayers must be said the brief twilight had almost faded away before all had mounted with loud cries of wassit ya hu  p242 go in the middle of the road o he and jannib yal jammalfn34keep to the side o camelman we threaded our way through long dusty narrow streets flanked with whitewashed habitations at considerable intervals and large heaps of rubbish sometimes higher than the houses we were stopped at the gate to ascertain if we were strangers in which case the guard would have done his best to extract a few piastres before allowing our luggage to pass but he soon perceived by my companions accent that they were sons of the holy cityconsequently that the case was hopeless while standing here shaykh hamid vaunted the strong walls and turrets of yambu which he said were superior to those of jeddahfn35 they kept saud the wahhabi at bay in ad 1802 but would scarcely i should say resist a field battery in ad 1853 the moon rose fair and clear dazzling us with light as we emerged from the shadowy streets and when we launched into the desert the sweet air delightfully contrasted with the close offensive atmosphere of the town my companions as arabs will do on such occasions began to sing  fn1 yanbua in arabic is a fountain yanbua of the sea is so called to distinguish it from yanbua of the palmgrounds a village at the foot of the mountains about 18 or 20 miles distant from the seaport ali bey places it one days journey e14ne from yanbua albahr and describes it as a pleasant place in a fertile valley it is now known as yambua alnakhil see the land of midian revisited fn2 the first quarter of the cairo caravan is alakabah the second is the manhal salmah salmahs place for watering camels the third is yambu and the fourth meccah fn3 the nizam as europeans now know is the regular turkish infantry in alhijaz these troops are not stationed in small towns like yambu at such places a party of irregular horse for the purpose of escorting travellers is deemed sufficient the yambu police seems to consist of the sharifs sturdy negroes in ali beys time yambu belonged to the sharif of meccah and was garrisoned by him fn4 this as far as i could learn is the only tax which the sultans government derives from the northern hijaz the people declare it to be as one might expect at this distance from the capital liable to gross peculation when the wahhabis held yambu they assessed it like all other places for which reason their name is held in the liveliest abhorrence fn5 civilians usually stick one pistol in the belt soldiers and fighting men two or more with all the necessary concomitants of pouches turnscrews and long iron ramrods which opening with a screw disclose a long thin pair of pincers wherewith fire is put upon the chibuk fn6 the weapons with which nations are to be managed form a curious consideration the englishman tamely endures a staff which would make a frenchman mad with anger and a frenchman respects a sabre which would fill an englishmans bosom with civilian spleen you order the egyptian to strip and be flogged he makes no objection to seeing his blood flow in this way but were a cutting weapon used his friends would stop at nothing in their fury fn7 in arabia generally the wound is less considered by justice and revenge than the instrument with which it was inflicted sticks and stones are held to be venial weapons guns and pistols swords and daggers are felonious fn8 europeans inveigh against this articlewhich represents the loup of louis xivs timefor its hideousness and jealous concealment of charms made to be admired it is on the contrary the most coquettish article of womans attire excepting perhaps the lisam of constantinople it conceals coarse skins fleshy noses wide mouths and vanishing chins whilst it sets off to best advantage what in these lands is almost always lustrous and liquidthe eye who has not remarked this at a masquerade ball fn9 a certain stipend allowed by the sultan to citizens of the haramayn meccah and almadinah it will be treated of at length in a future chapter fn10 the shaykh or agent of the camels without whose assistance it would be difficult to hire beasts he brings the badawin with him talks them over to fair terms sees the arbun or earnestmoney delivered to them and is answerable for their not failing in their engagement fn11 the not returning salam was a sign on the part of the badawin that they were out to fight and not to make friends and the dromedary riders who generally travel without much to rob thought this behaviour a declaration of desperate designs the badawin asked if they were almadinah men because the former do not like unless when absolutely necessary to plunder the people of the holy city and the daghistanis said their destination was bir abbas a neighbouring instead of yambu a distant post because those who travel on a long journey being supposed to have more funds with them are more likely to be molested fn12 miyan the hindustani word for sir is known to the badawin all over alhijaz they always address indian moslems with this word which has become contemptuous on account of the low esteem in which the race is held fn13 that is to say sneaks and cowards i was astonished to see our maghrabi fellowpassengers in the bazar at yambu cringing and bowing to us more like courtiers than badawin such however is the effect of a strange place upon orientals generally in the persians such humility was excusable in no part of alhijaz are they for a moment safe from abuse and blows fn14 the night prayer fn15 amm means literally a paternal uncle in the hijaz it is prefixed to the names of respectable men who may also be addressed ya amm jamal o uncle jamal to say ya ammi o my uncle is more familiar and would generally be used by a superior addressing an inferior fn16 jizyat properly means the capitation tax levied on infidels in this land of intense pride the badawin and even the townchiefs apply the opprobrious term to blackmail extorted from travellers even of their own creed fn17 the shugduf of alhijaz differs greatly from that used in syria and other countries it is composed of two corded cots 5 feet long slung horizontally about halfway down and parallel with the camels sides these cots have short legs and at the halt may be used as bedsteads the two are connected together by loose ropes attached to the inner long sides of the framework and these are thrown over the camels packsaddle thick twigs inserted in the ends and the outer long sides of the framework are bent over the top bowerfashion to support matting carpets and any other protection against the sun there is an opening in this kind of wickerwork in front towards the camels head through which you creep and a similar one behind creates a draught of wind outside towards the camels tail are pockets containing gullehs or earthenware bottles of cooled water inside attached to the wickerwork are large provision pouches similar to those used in oldfashioned travelling chariots at the bottom are spread the two beds the greatest disadvantage of the shugduf is the difficulty of keeping balance two men ride in it and their weights must be made to tally moreover it is liable to be caught and torn by thorn trees to be blown off in a gale of wind and its awkwardness causes the camel repeated falls which are most likely to smash it yet it is not necessarily an uncomfortable machine those for sale in the bazar are of course worthless being made of badly seasoned wood but private litters are sometimes pleasant vehicles with turned and painted framework silk cordage and valuable carpets the often described mahmil is nothing but a syrian shugduf royally ornamented fn18  exquisites fn19 it is the same rule with the arab on the road as at home the more he is dressed the greater is his respectability for this reason you see sharifs and other men of high family riding or walking in their warm camels hair robes on the hottest days another superstition of the arabs is this that thick clothes avert the evil effects of the suns beams by keeping out heat to the kindness of a friendthomas seddoni owe the admirable sketch of an arab shaykh in his travelling dress fn20 sharifs and other great men sometimes bind a white turband or a cashmere shawl round the kerchief to keep it in its place the aakal varies in every part of the country here it is a twist of dyed wool there a bit of common rope three or four feet long some of the arab tribes use a circlet of wood composed of little round pieces the size of a shilling joined side by side and inlaid with motherofpearl the eastern arabs wear a large circle of brown wool almost a turband in itself in barbary they twist brightcoloured cloth round a rope and adorn it with thick golden thread fn21 generally written thar the bloodrevenge right acknowledged by law and custom see chapter xxiv post fn22 gold however as well as silk i may be excused for repeating is a forbidden article of ornament to the moslem fn23 the silverhilted dagger is a sign of dignity i would silver my dagger in idiomatic hijazi means i would raise myself in the world fn24 niebuhr has accurately described this article it is still worn in the madras army though long discarded from the other presidencies the main difference between the indian and the arab sandal is that the former has a ring into which the big toe is inserted and the latter a thong which is clasped between the big toe and its neighbour both of them are equally uncomfortable and equally injurious to soldiers whose legs fight as much as do their arms they abrade the skin wherever the straps touch expose the feet to the sun wind and rain and admit thorns and flints to the toes and toenails in arabia the traveller may wear if he pleases slippers but they are considered townsmanlike and effeminate they must be of the usual colours red or yellow black shoes though almost universally worn by the turks at cairo and constantinople would most probably excite suspicion in alhijaz fn25 the mizrak as it is called is peculiar to certain tribes as the karashi and the lahyami and some like the hudayli near meccah make very pretty as well as very useful darts the head is 15 or 16 inches long nowhere broader than an inch and tapering gradually to a fine point its shape is two shallow prisms joined at their bases and its socket round like that of all lances measures a little less than 2 inches the lower third of the blade only is adorned with bars lozenges and cones of brass let into the iron in zigzag and other figures the shaft is of hard pliant woodi do not know of what treewell seasoned with grease and use it is 23 inches long and strengthened and adorned at distances of half an inch apart by bands of fine brass wire about one inch and a half long the heel of the weapon is a blunt spike 14 inches long used to stick it in the ground and this as well as the lower third of the blade is ornamented with brass work being well balanced the mizrak is a highly efficient weapon for throwing in hunting and by its handsome appearance adds not a little to the bearers dignity but the stranger must be careful how he so arms himself unless he be undistinguishable from a badawi by carrying a weapon peculiar to certain clans he will expose himself to suspicion or to laughter and to offend an arab of alhijaz mortally you have only to say bluntly sell me thy spear the proper style of address to the man whose necessities compel him to break through one of his points dhonneur is to say give me that javelin and i will satisfy thee after which he will haggle for each copper piece as though you were cheapening a sheep fn26 the mashab is of almond generally brought from syria at the thick end is a kind of crook formed by cutting off a bit of the larger branch from which the stick grows this crook is afterwards cut into the shape useful to seize a camels nosering or a horses bridle arabs of all degrees are fond of carrying these sticks it is also called maghin  fn27 this article the silahlik of the turks is composed of several oblong pieces of leather cut out to fit the front part of the body between each fold there is room enough to stick a weapon a substantial strap fastens it round the waist and it serves to defend the sash or the shirt from iron mould and the stains of gunpowder it is made of all kinds of material from plain morocco leather to the richest velvet embroidered with gold fn28 it is as well to have a good pair of turkish barrels and stocks fitted up with locks of european manufacture those made by natives of these countries can never be depended upon the same will apply to the gun or rifle upon the whole it is more prudent to have flint locks copper caps are now sold in the bazars of meccah and almadinah where a colts sixshooter might excite attention for a day but were the owner in a position to despise notoriety he might display it everywhere without danger one of our guards who was killed on the road had a doublebarrelled english fowlingpiece still when doubts must not be aroused the traveller will do well to avoid even in the civilised hijaz suspicious appearances in his weapons i carried in a secret pocket a small pistol with a spring dagger upon which dependence could be placed and i was careful never to show it discharging it and loading it always in the dark some men wear a little dagger strapped round the leg below the knee its use is this when the enemy gets you under he can prevent you bringing your hand up to the weapon in your waistbelt but before he cuts your throat you may slip your fingers down to the knee and persuade him to stop by a stab in the perineum this knee dagger is required only in very dangerous places the article i chiefly accused myself of forgetting was a stout english claspknife with a large handle a blade like an arkansas toothpick and possessing the other useful appliances of picker fleam tweezers lancet and punch fn29 called habak these cords are made in great quantities at cairo which possesses a special bazar for them and are exported to all the neighbouring countries where their price considerably increases a handsome pistolcord with its tassels costs about 12 shillings in egypt at meccah or almadinah the same would fetch upwards of a pound sterling fn30 my diarybook was made up for me by a cairene it was a long thin volume fitting into a breastpocket where it could be carried without being seen i began by writing notes in the arabic character but as no risk appeared my journal was afterwards kept in english more than once by way of experiment i showed the writing on a loose slip of paper to my companions and astonished them with the strange character derived from solomon and alexander the lord of the two horns which we afghans still use for a short trip a pencil suffices on long journeys ink is necessary the latter article should be english not eastern which is washed out clean the first time your luggage is thoroughly soaked with rain the traveller may use either the persian or the brass egyptian inkstand the latter however is preferable being stronger and less likely to break but unless he be capable of writing and reading a letter correctly it would be unadvisable to stick such an article in the waistbelt as this gives out publicly that he is a scribe when sketching the pencil is the best because the simplest and shortest mode of operation is required important lines should afterwards be marked with ink as fixing is impossible on such journeys for prudence sake when my sketches were made i cut up the paper into square pieces numbered them for future reference and hid them in the tin canisters that contained my medicines fn31 an accident of this kind happened not long ago in hazramaut to a german traveller who shall be nameless he had the mortification to see his sketchbook the labour of months summarily appropriated and destroyed by the arabs i was told by a hazramaut man at cairo and by several at aden that the gentleman had at the time a narrow escape with his life the badawin wished to put him to death as a spy sent by the frank to ensorceler their country but the shaykhs forbade bloodshed and merely deported the offender travellers caught sketching are not often treated with such forbearance fn32 all arabs assert that it pains the loaded camels feet to stand still and certainly the fidgettiness of the animal to start looks as if he had some reason to prefer walking fn33 it often strains the camel to rise with a full shugduf on his back besides which the motion is certain to destroy the vehicle in a few days those who are unable to climb up the camels neck usually carry with them a short ladder fn34 wassit means go in the middle of the road jannib keep clear of the sides these words are fair specimens of how much may be said by two arabic syllables ya hu o he is an address common in arabia as in egypt and yal jammal o camelman is perhaps a little more civil fn35 the rivalry between the sons of the two holy cities extends even to these parts the madanis contending for yambu the meccans for jeddah  p243chapter xiii  from yambu to bir abbas  on the 18th july about 7 pm we passed through the gate of yambu and took a due easterly course our route lay over the plain between the mountains of radhwah on the left and the sea on the right hand the land was desertthat is to say a hard level plain strewed with rounded lumps of granite and greenstone schist with here and there a dwarf acacia and a tuft of rank camel grass by the light of a glorious moon nearly at the full i was able to see the country tolerably well  our party consisted of twelve camels and we travelled in indian file head tied to tail with but one outrider omar effendi whose rank required him to mount a dromedary with showy trappings immediately in front of me was amm jamal whom i had to reprove for asking the boy mohammed where have you picked up that hindi indian are we the afghans the indianslayersfn1 become indians i vociferated with indignation and brought the thing home to his feelings by asking him how he an arab would like to be called an egyptiana fellah the rest of the party was behind sitting or dozing upon the rough platforms made by the lids of the two huge boxes slung to the sides of their camels only one old woman alsitt maryam the lady mary returning  p244 to almadinah her adopted country after a visit to a sister at cairo allowed herself the luxury of a halfdollar shibriyah or cot fastened crosswise over the animals load moreover all the party except omar effendi in token of poverty were dressed in the coarsest and dirtiest of clothesthe general suit consisting of a shirt torn in divers places and a bit of rag wrapped round the head they carried short chibuks without mouthpieces and tobaccopouches of greasy leather though the country hereabouts is perfectly safe all had their arms in readiness and the unusual silence that succeeded to the singing even saad the demon held his tonguewas sufficient to show how much they feared for their property after a slow march of two hours facing the moon we turned somewhat towards the northeast and began to pass over undulating ground in which a steady rise was perceptible we arrived at the haltingplace at three in the morning after a short march of about eight hours during which we could not have passed over more than sixteen milesfn2 the camels were nakhdfn3 the boxes were taken off and piled together as a precaution against invisible robbers my little tent the only one in the party was pitched we then spread our rugs upon the ground and lay down to sleep  we arose at about 9 am july 19 and after congratulating one another upon being once more in the dear desert we proceeded in exhilarated mood to light the fire for pipes and breakfast the meala biscuit a little rice and a cup of milkless teawas soon dispatched after which i proceeded to inspect our position  p245about a mile to the westward lay the little village almusahhalfn4 a group of miserable mud hovels on the south was a strip of bright blue sea and all around an iron plain producing naught but stones and grasshoppers and bounded northward by a grisly wall of blackish rock here and there a shrub fit only for fuel or a tuft of coarse grass crisp with heat met the eye all was sunparched the furious heat from above was drying up the sap and juice of the land as the simmering and quivering atmosphere showed moreover the heavy dews of these regions forming in large drops upon the plants and stones concentrate the morning rays upon them like a system of burningglasses after making these few observations i followed the example of my companions and returned to sleep  at two pm we were roused to a dinner as simple as the breakfast had been boiled rice with an abundance of the clarified butterfn5 in which easterns delight some fragments of kahkfn6 or soft biscuit and stale breadfn7 and a handful of stoned and pressed datepaste called ajwah formed the menu our potations began before dinner with a viletasted but wholesome drink called akitfn8  p246 dried sour milk dissolved in water at the meal we drank the leatherflavoured element and ended with a large cupful of scalding tea enormous quantities of liquid were consumed for the sun seemed to have got into our throats and the perspiration trickled as after a shower of rain whilst we were eating a badawi woman passed close by the tent leading a flock of sheep and goats seeing which i expressed a desire to drink milk my companions sent by one of the camelmen a bit of bread and asked in exchange for a cupful of labanfn9 thus i learned that the arabs even in this corrupt region still adhere to the meaningless custom of their ancestors who chose to make the term labbanfn10 milkseller an opprobrium and a disgrace possibly the origin of the prejudice  p247 might be the recognising of a travellers guestright to call for milk gratis however this may be no one will in the present day sell this article of consumption even at civilised meccah except egyptians a people supposed to be utterly without honour as a general rule in the hijaz milk abounds in the spring but at all other times of the year it is difficult to be procured the badawi woman managed however to send me back a cupful  at three pm we were ready to start and all saw with unspeakable gratification a huge black nimbus rise from the shoulder of mount radhwah and range itself like a good genius between us and our terrible foe the sun we hoped that it contained rain but presently a blast of hot wind like the breath of a volcano blew over the plain and the air was filled with particles of sand this is the dry storm of arabia it appears to depend upon some electrical phenomena which it would be desirable to investigatefn11 when we had loaded and mounted my camelmen two in number came up to the shugduf and demanded bakhshish which it appears they are now in the habit of doing each time the traveller starts i was at first surprised to find the word here but after a few days of badawi society my wonder diminished the men were beniharb of the great hijazi tribe which has kept its blood pure for the last thirteen centurieshow much more we know notbut they had been corrupted by intercourse with pilgrims retaining none of their ancestral qualities but greed of gain revengefulness pugnacity and a frantic kind of bravery displayed on rare occasions their nobility however did not prevent my quoting the prophets saying of a truth the worst names among the arabs are the benikalb  p248 kalb and the beniharbfn12 whilst i taunted them severely with their resemblance to the fellahs of egypt they would have resented this with asperity had it proceeded from their own people but the turkish pilgrimthe character in which they knew me despite my arab dressis a privileged person the outer man of these fightsons was contemptible small chocolatecoloured beings stunted and thin with mops of course bushy hair burned brown by the sun straggling beards vicious eyes frowning brows screaming voices and wellmade but attenuated limbs on their heads were kufiyahs in the last stage of wear a tattered shirt indigodyed and girt with a bit of common rope composed their clothing and their feet were protected from the stones by soles of thick leather kept in place by narrow thongs tied to the ankle both were armed one with a matchlock and a shintiyanfn13 in a leathern scabbard slung over the shoulder the other with a nabbut and both showed at the waist the arabs invariable companion the jambiyah dagger these ragged fellows however had their pride they would eat with me and not disdain like certain selfstyled caballeros to ask for more but of work they would do none no promise of bakhshish potent as  p249 the spell of that word is would induce them to assist in pitching my tent they even expected shaykh nur to cook for them and i had almost to use violence for even the just excuse of a sore foot was insufficient to procure the privilege of mounting my shugduf while the camel was sitting it was they said the custom of the country from time immemorial to use a ladder when legs would not act i agreed with them but objected that i had no ladder at last wearied with their thickheadedness i snatched the nosestring of the camel and by main force made it kneel  our party was now strong enough we had about 200 beasts carrying grain attended by their proprietors truculent looking as the contrabandistas of the pyrenees the escort was composed of seven irregular turkish cavalry tolerably mounted and supplied each with an armoury in epitome they were privily derided by our party who being arabs had a sneaking fondness for the badawin however loth they might be to see them amongst the boxes  for three hours we travelled in a southeasterly direction upon a hard plain and a sandy flat on which several waters from the highlands find a passage to the sea westward gradually we were siding towards the mountains and at sunset i observed that we had sensibly neared them we dismounted for a short halt and strangers being present my companions before sitting down to smoke said their prayersa pious exercise in which they did not engage for three days afterwards when they met certain acquaintances at alhamra as evening came on we emerged from a scrub of acacia and tamarisk and turned due east traversing an open country with a perceptible rise scarcely was it dark before the cry of harami thieves rose loud in the rear causing such confusion as one may see in a boat in the bay of naples when suddenly neared by a waterspout  p250 all the camelmen brandished their huge staves and rushed back vociferating in the direction of the robbers they were followed by the horsemen and truly had the thieves possessed the usual acuteness of the profession they might have driven off the camels in our van with safety and conveniencefn14 but these contemptible beings were only half a dozen in number and they had lighted their matchlocks which drew a bullet or two in their direction whereupon they ran away this incident aroused no inconsiderable excitement for it seemed ominous of worse things about to happen to us when entangled in the hills and the faces of my companions perfect barometers of fair and foul tidings fell to zero for nine hours we journeyed through a brilliant moonlight and as the first grey streak appeared in the eastern sky we entered a scanty misyalfn15 or fiumara strewed with pebbles and rounded stones about half a mile in breadth and flanked by almost perpendicular hills of primitive formation i began by asking the names of peaks and other remarkable spots when i found that a folio volume would not contain a three months collectionfn16 every hill and dale flat valley and  p251 watercourse here has its proper name or rather names the ingenuity shown by the badawin in distinguishing between localities the most similar is the result of a high organization of the perceptive faculties perfected by the practice of observing a recurrence of landscape features few in number and varying but little amongst themselves after travelling two hours up this torrent bed winding in an easterly direction and crossing some harrah or ridges of rock ria steep descentsfn17 kitaah patch of stony flat and bits of sahil dwarf plain we found ourselves about eight am after a march of about thirtyfour miles at bir said saids well our destination  i had been led to expect at the well a pastoral scene wild flowers flocks and flowing waters so i looked with a jaundiced eye upon a deep hole full of slightly brackish water dug in a tamped hollowa kind of punchbowl with granite walls upon whose grim surface a few thorns of exceeding hardihood braved the sun for a season not a house was in sightit was as barren and desolate a spot as the sun ever viewed in his wide career but this is what the arabian traveller must expect he is to traverse for instance the wady alwardthe vale of flowers he indulges in sweet recollections of indian lakes beautiful with the lotus and persian plains upon which narcissus is the meanest of grasses he sees a plain like swishwork where knobs of granite act daisies and where at every fifty yards some hapless bud or blossom is dying of inanition among the stones  the sun scorched our feet as we planted the tent and after drinking our breakfast we passed the usual day of perspiration and semilethargy in discomfort man naturally  p252 hails a change even though it be one from bad to worse when our enemy began slanting towards the west we felt ready enough to proceed on our journey the camels were laden shortly after 3 pm july 20th and we started with water jars in our hands through a storm of samun  we travelled five hours in a northeasterly course up a diagonal valleyfn18 through a country fantastic in its desolationa mass of huge hills barren plains and desert vales even the sturdy acacias here failed and in some places the camel grass could not find earth enough for its root the road wound among mountains rocks and hills of granite and over broken ground flanked by huge blocks and boulders piled up as if mans art had aided nature to disfigure herself vast clefts seamed like scars the hideous face of earth here they widened into dark caves there they were choked with glistening drift sand not a bird or a beast was to be seen or heard their presence would have argued the vicinity of water and though my companions opined that badawin were lurking among the rocks i decided that these badawin were the creatures of their fears above a sky like polished blue steel with a tremendous blaze of yellow light glared upon us without the thinnest veil of mist cloud below the brasscoloured circle scorched the face and dazzled the eyes mocking them the while with offers of water that was but air the distant prospect was more attractive than the near view because it borrowed a bright azure tinge from the intervening atmosphere but the jagged peaks and the perpendicular streaks of shadow down the flanks of the mountainous background  p253 showed that yet in store for us was no change for the better  between 10 and 11 pm we reached human habitationsa phenomenon unseen since we left almusahhalin the shape of a long straggling village it is called alhamra from the redness of the sands near which it is built or alwasitah the halfway because it is the middle station between yambu and almadinah it is therefore considerably out of place in burckhardts map and those who copy from him make it much nearer the seaport than it really is we wandered nearly an hour in search of an encamping station for the surly villagers ordered us off every flatter bit of ground without however deigning to show us where our jaded beasts might rest at last after long wrangling we found the usual spot the camels were unloaded the boxes and baggage were disposed in a circle for greater security against the petty pilferers in which this part of the road abounds and my companions spread their rugs so as to sleep upon their valuables i was invited to follow the general example but i absolutely declined the vicinity of so many steaming and snoring fellowtravellers some wonder was excited by the afghan hajis obstinacy and recklessness but resistance to these people is sometimes bien place and a man from kabul is allowed to say and to do strange things in answer to their warnings of nightly peril i placed a drawn sword by my sidefn19 and a cocked pistol under my pillow the saddlebag a carpet spread upon the cool loose sand formed by no means an uncomfortable couch and upon it i enjoyed a sound sleep till daybreak  rising at dawn july 21 i proceeded to visit the village it is built upon a narrow shelf at the top of a precipitous hill to the north and on the south runs a sandy  p254 fiumara about half a mile broad on all sides are rocks and mountains rough and stony so you find yourself in another of those punchbowls which the arabs seem to consider choice sites for settlementsfn20 the fiumara hereabouts very winding threads the high grounds all the way down from the plateau of almadinah during the rainy season it becomes a raging torrent carrying westwards to the red sea the drainage of a hundred hills water of good quality is readily found in it by digging a few feet below the surface at the angles where the stream forms the deepest hollows and in some places the stony sides give out bubbling springsfn21  alhamra itself is a collection of stunted houses or rather hovels made of unbaked brick and mud roofed over with palm leaves and pierced with airholes which occasionally boast a bit of plank for a shutter it appears thickly populated in the parts where the walls are standing but like all settlements in the holy land alhijazfn23 it abounds in ruins it is well supplied with provisions which are here cheaper than at almadinaha circumstance that induced saad the demon to overload his hapless camel with a sack of wheat in the village are a few shops where grain huge plantains readymade bread rice  p255 clarified butter and other edibles are to be purchased palm orchards of considerable extent supply it with dates the bazar is like the generality of such places in the villages of eastern arabia a long lane here covered with matting there open to the sun and the narrow streetsif they may be so calledare full of dust and glare near the encamping ground of caravans is a fort for the officer commanding a troop of albanian cavalry whose duty it is to defend the villagefn24 to hold the country and to escort merchant travellers the building consists of an outer wall of hewn stone loopholed for musketry and surmounted by shararif remparts coquets about as useful against artillery as the sugar gallery round a twelfthcake nothing would be easier than to take the place a false attack would draw off the attention of the defenders who in these latitudes know nothing of sentryduty whilst scalingladders or a bag full of powder would command a ready entrance into the other side around the alhamra fort are clusters of palmleaf huts where the soldiery lounge and smoke and near it is the usual coffeehouse a shed kept by an albanian these places are frequented probably on account of the intense heat inside the fort we passed a comfortless day at the red village large flocks of sheep and goats were being driven in and out of the place but their surly shepherds would give no milk even in exchange for bread and meat the morning was spent in watching certain badawin who matchlock in hand had climbed the hills in pursuit of a troop of cranes not one bird was hit of the many fired ata circumstance which did not say much for their vaunted marksmanship before breakfast i bought a moderately sized sheep for a dollar  p256 shaykh hamid halaledfn25 butchered it according to rule and my companions soon prepared a feast of boiled mutton but that sheep proved a bone of contention the boy mohammed had in a fit of economy sold its head to a badawi for three piastres and the others disappointed in their anticipations of haggis lost temper with the demons voluble tongue and impudent countenance in the van they opened such a volley of raillery and sarcasm upon the young tripeseller that he in his turn became excitedfurious i had some difficulty to keep the peace for it did not suit my interests that they should quarrel but to do the arabs justice nothing is easier for a man who knows them than to work upon their good feelings he is a stranger in your countrya guest acted as a charm they listened patiently to mohammeds gross abuse only promising to answer him when in his land that is to say near meccah but what especially soured our day was the report that saad the great robberchief and his brother were in the field consequently that our march would be delayed for some time every halfhour some fresh tattle from the camp or the coffeehouse added fuel to the fire of our impatience  a few particulars about this schinderhans of alhijazfn26 may not be unacceptable he is the chief of the sumaydah and the mahamid two influential subfamilies of the hamidah the principal family of the beniharb tribe of badawin he therefore aspired to rule all the hamidah and through them the beniharb in which case he would have been de facto monarch of the holy land but the sharif of meccah and ahmad pasha  p257 the turkish governor of the chief city for some political reason degraded him and raised up a rival in the person of shaykh fahd another ruffian of a similar stamp who calls himself chief of the beniamr the third subfamily of the hamidah family hence all kinds of confusion saads people who number it is said 5000 resent with arab asperity the insult offered to their chief and beat fahds who do not amount to 800 fahd supported by the government cuts off saads supplies both are equally wild and reckless andnowhere doth the glorious goddess liberty show a more brazen face than in this eastern  inviolate land of the brave and the free  both seize the opportunity of shooting troopers of plundering travellers and of closing the roads this state of things continued till i left the hijaz when the sharif of meccah proposed it was said to take the field in person against the archrobber and as will afterwards be seen in these pages saad had the audacity to turn back the sultans mahmil or litterthe ensign of imperial powerand to shut the road against its cortege because the pashas of almadinah and of the damascus caravan would not guarantee his restitution to his former dignity that such vermin is allowed to exist proves the imbecility of the turkish government the sultan pays pensions in corn and cloth to the very chiefs who arm their varlets against him and the pashas after purloining all they can hand over to their enemies the means of resistance it is more than probable that abd almajid has never heard a word of truth concerning alhijaz and that fulsome courtiers persuade him that men there tremble at his name his government however is desirous if report speaks truth of thrusting alhijaz upon the egyptian who on his side would willingly pay a large sum to avert such calamity the holy land drains off turkish gold and blood in abundance and the  p258 lords of the country hold in it a contemptible position if they catch a thief they dare not hang him they must pay blackmail and yet be shot at in every pass they affect superiority over the arabs hate them and are despised by them such in alhijaz are the effects of the charter of gulkhanah a panacea like holloways pills for all the evils to which turkish arab syrian greek egyptian persian armenian kurd and albanian flesh is heir to such the results of the tanzimat the silliest copy of europes follybureaucracy and centralisationthat the pen of empirical statecraft ever tracedfn27 under a stronghanded and stronghearted despotism like mohammed alis alhijaz in one generation might be purged of its pests by a proper use of the blood feud by vigorously supporting the weaker against the stronger classes by regularly defeating every badawi who earns a name for himself and above all by the exercise of unsparing unflinching justicefn28 the few thousands of halfnaked bandits who now make the land a fighting field would soon sink into utter insignificance  p259 but to effect such end the turks require the old stratocracy which bloody as it was worked with far less misery than the charter and the new code what milton calls  the solid rule of civil government  has done wonders for the race that nurtured and brought to perfection an idea spontaneous to their organisation the world has yet to learn that the admirable exotic will thrive amongst the country gentlemen of monomotapa or the ragged nobility of alhijazfn29 and it requires no prophetic eye to foresee the day when the wahhabis or the badawin rising en masse will rid the land of its feeble conquerorsfn30  saad the old man of the mountains was described to me as a little brown badawi contemptible in appearance but remarkable for courage and ready wit he has for treachery a keen scent which he requires to keep in exercise a blood feud with abd almuttalib the present sharif of meccah who slew his nephew and the hostility of several sultans has rendered his life eventful he lost all his teeth by poison which would have killed him had he not after swallowing the potion corrected it by drinking off a large potfull of clarified butter since that time he has lived entirely upon fruits which he gathers for himself and  p260 coffee which he prepares with his own hands in sultan mahmuds time he received from constantinople a gorgeous purse which he was told to open as it contained something for his private inspection suspecting treachery he gave it for this purpose to a slave bidding him carry it to some distance the bearer was shot by a pistol cunningly fixed like rob roys in the folds of the bag whether this farknown story be true or only well found it is certain that shaykh saad now fears the turks even when they bring gifts the sultan sends or is supposed to send him presents of fine horses robes of honour and a large quantity of grain but the shaykh trusting to his hills rather than to steeds sells them he gives away the dresses to his slaves and he distributes the grain amongst his clansmen of his character men as usual tell two tales some praise his charity and call him the friend of the poor as certainly as he is a foe to the rich others on the contrary describe him as cruel coldblooded and notably even among arabs revengeful and avaricious the truth probably lies between these two extremes but i observed that those of my companions who spoke most highly of the robber chief when at a distance seemed to be in the sudori freddi whilst under the shadow of his hills  alhamra is the third station from almadinah in the darb sultani the sultans or high road the westerly line leading to meccah along the seacoast when the robbers permit the pilgrims prefer this route on account of its superior climate the facility of procuring water and supplies the vicinity of the sea and the circumstance of its passing through badr the scene of the prophets principal military exploits ah 2 after midday on the 21st july when we had made up our minds that fate had determined we should halt at alhamra a caravan arrived from meccah and the new travellers had interest to procure an escort and permission  p261 to proceed without delay towards almadinah the good news filled us with joy a little after four pm we urged our panting camels over the fiery sands to join the meccans who were standing ready for the march on the other side of the torrent bed an hour afterwards we started in an easterly direction  my companions having found friends and relations in the meccan caravanthe boy mohammeds elder brother about whom more anon was of the numberwere full of news and excitement at sunset they prayed with unction even saad and hamid had not the face to sit their camels during the halt when all around were washing sanding themselvesfn31 and busy with their devotions we then ate our suppers remounted and started once more shortly after night set in we came to a sudden halt a dozen different reports rose to account for this circumstance which was occasioned by a band of badawin who had manned a gorge and sent forward a parliamentary ordering us forthwith to stop they at first demanded money to let us pass but at last hearing that we were sons of the holy cities they granted us transit on the sole condition that the militarywhom they like irish peasants hate and fearshould return to whence they came upon this our escort 200 men wheeled their horses round and galloped back to their barracks we moved onwards without however seeing any robbers my camelman pointed out their haunts and showed me a small bird hovering over a place where he supposed water trickled from the rock the fellow had attempted a sneer at my expense when the fray was impending why dont you load your pistols effendi  p262 he cried and get out of your litter and show fight because i replied as loudly in my country when dogs run at us we thrash them with sticks this stopped mansurs mouth for a time but he and i were never friends like the lowest orders of orientals he required to be illtreated gentleness and condescension he seemed to consider a proof of cowardice or of imbecility i began with kindness but was soon compelled to use hard words at first and then threats which though he heard them with frowns and mutterings produced manifest symptoms of improvement  oignez vilain il vous poindra poignez vilain il vous oindra  says the old french proverb and the axiom is more valuable in the east even than in the west  our nights journey had no other incident we travelled over rising ground with the moon full in our faces and about midnight we passed through another long straggling line of villages called jadaydahfn32 or alkhayffn33 the principal part of it lies on the left of the road going to almadinah it has a fort like that of alhamra springs of tolerable drinking water a nakhil or dateground and a celebrated dead saint abd alrahim alburai a little beyond it lies the bughazfn34 or defile where in ad 1811 tussun bey and his 8000 turks were totally defeated by 25000 harbi badawin and wahhabisfn35  p263 this is a famous attackingpoint of the beniharb in former times both jazzar pasha the celebrated butcher of syria and abdullah pasha of damascus were baffled at the gorge of jadaydahfn36 and this year the commander of the syrian caravan afraid of risking an attack at a place so illomened avoided it by marching upon meccah via the desert road of nijd at four am having travelled about twentyfour miles due east we encamped at bir abbas  fn1 alluding to the celebrated mountain the hindukush whence the afghans sallied forth to lay waste india fn2 throughout this work i have estimated the pace of a hijazi camel laden and walking in caravan line under ordinary circumstances at two geographical miles an hour a sandy plain or a rocky pass might make a difference of half a mile each way but not more fn3 see chap viii page 152 note 1 ante fn4 the reader must be warned that these little villages in arabia as in sind and baluchistan are continually changing their names whilst the larger settlements always retain the same the traveller too must beware of writing down the first answer he receives in one of our maps a village on the euphrates is gravely named madri dont know fn5 here called samn the indian ghee fn6 the kahk in this country is a light and pleasant bread made of ground wheat kneaded with milk leavened with sour bean flour and finally baked in an oven not as usual in the east upon an iron plate the kahk of egypt is a kind of cake fn7 stale unleavened bread is much relished by easterns who say that keeping it on journeys makes it sweet to prevent its becoming mouldy they cut it up into little bits and at the risk of hardening it to the consistence of wood they dry it by exposure to the air fn8 this akit has different names in all parts of arabia even in alhijaz it is known by the name of mazir as well as igt the corruption of akit when very sour it is called saribah and when dried without boiling jamidah the arabs make it by evaporating the serous part of the milk the remainder is then formed into cakes or lumps with the hand and spread upon hair cloth to dry they eat it with clarified butter and drink it melted in water it is considered a cooling and refreshing beverage but boasts few attractions to the stranger the baluchis and wild tribes of sindians call this preparation of milk krut and make it in the same way as the badawin do fn9 in arabic and hebrew milk the maltese give the word a very different signification and the egyptians like the syrians confine their use of it to sour milk or curdscalling sweet milk laban halib or simply halib fn10 in a previous work history of sind i have remarked that there exists some curious similarity in language and customs between the arabs and the various races occupying the broad ranges of hills that separate india from persia amongst these must be numbered the prejudice alluded to above the lamented dr stocks of bombay who travelled amongst and observed the brahui and the baluchi nomads in the pashin valley informed me that though they will give milk in exchange for other commodities yet they consider it a disgrace to make money by it this methinks is too conventional a point of honour to have sprung up spontaneously in two countries so distant and apparently so unconnected fn11 at aden as well as in sind these dry storms abound and there the work of meteorological investigation would be easier than in alhijaz fn12 benikalb or juhaynah chap x would mean the dogssonsbeniharb the sons of fight fn13 the shintiyan is the common swordblade of the badawin in western arabia it is called majar from the magyars and is said to be of german manufacture good old weapons of the proper curve marked like andrew ferraras with a certain number of lines down their length will fetch even in arabia from l7 to l8 the modern and cheap ones cost about 10s excellent weapons abound in this country the reason being that there is a perpetual demand for them and when once purchased they become heirlooms in the family i have heard that when the beni bu ali tribe near ras alkhaymah was defeated with slaughter by sir lionel smiths expedition the victors found many valuable old european blades in the hands of the slain fn14 the way of carrying off a camel in this country is to loosen him and then to hang on heavily to his tail which causes him to start at full gallop fn15 the arabic misyal masyal masil or masilah is the indian nullah and the sicilian fiumara a hill watercourse which rolls a torrent during and after rain and is either partially or wholly dry at other seasonsthe stream flowing slowly underground in england we want the feature and therefore there is no single word to express it our river is an imperfect way of conveying the idea fn16 generalisation is not the forte of the arabic language alkulzum the red sea for instance will be unintelligible to the native of jeddah call it the sea of jeddah and you at once explain yourself so the badawin will have names for each separate part but no single one to express the whole this might be explained by their ignorance of anything but details the same thing is observable however in the writings of the arabian geographers when they come to treat of the objects near home  fn17 about the classic harrah i shall have more to say at a future time the word ria in literary and in vulgar arabic is almost synonymous with akabah a steep descent a path between hills or a mountain road fn18 valleys may be divided into three kinds 1 longitudinal ie parallel to the axis of their ridges 2 transversal or perpendicular to the same and 3 diagonal which form an acute or an obtuse angle with the main chain of mountains fn19 this act by the bye i afterwards learned to be a greater act of imprudence than the sleeping alone nothing renders the arab thief so active as the chance of stealing a good weapon fn20 probably because water is usually found in such places in the wild parts of the country wells are generally protected by some fortified building for men consider themselves safe from an enemy until their supply of water is cut off fn22 near alhamra at the base of the southern hills within fire of the forts there is a fine spring of sweet water all such fountains are much prized by the people who call them rockwater and attribute to them tonic and digestive virtues fn23 as far as i could discover the reason of the ruinous state of the country at present is the effect of the old wahhabi and egyptian wars in the early part of the present century and the misrule of the turks in arabia the depopulation of a village or a district is not to be remedied as in other countries by an influx of strangers the land still belongs to the survivors of the tribe and trespass would be visited with a bloody revenge fn24 without these forts the turks at least so said my companions could never hold the country against the badawin there is a little amour propre in the assertion but upon the whole it is true there are no mohammed alis jazzars and ibrahim pachas in these days fn25 to halal is to kill an animal according to moslem rites a word is wanted to express the act and we cannot do better than to borrow it from the people to whom the practice belongs fn26 he is now dead and has been succeeded by a son worse than himself fn27 the greatest of all its errors was that of appointing to the provinces instead of the single pasha of the olden time three different governors civil military and fiscal all depending upon the supreme council at constantinople thus each province has three plunderers instead of one and its affairs are referred to a body that can take no interest in it fn28 ziyad bin abihi was sent by almuawiyah the caliph to reform albasrah a den of thieves he made a speech noticed that he meant to rule with the sword and advised all offenders to leave the city the inhabitants were forbidden under pain of death to appear in the streets after evening prayers and dispositions were made to secure the execution of the penalty two hundred persons were put to death by the patrol during the first night only five during the second and not a drop of blood was shed afterwards by similar severity the french put an end to assassination at naples and the austrians at leghorn we may deplore the necessity of having recourse to such means but it is a silly practice to salve the wound which requires the knife fn29 these remarks were written in 1853 i see no reason to change them in 1878 fn30 a weak monarch a degenerate government a state whose corruption is evidenced by moral decay a revenue bolstered up by a system of treasury paper which even the public offices discount at from three to six per cent an army accustomed to be beaten and disorganised provinces these together with the proceedings of a ruthless and advancing enemy form the points of comparison between the constantinople of the present day and the byzantine metropolis eight hundred years ago fate has marked upon the ottoman empire in europe delenda est we are now

a common name for places in this part of arabia the word literally means a declivity or a place built upon a declivity fn34 bughaz means in turkish the fauces the throat and signifies also here a

third year they levied 80000 men attacked the caravan pillaged it and slew every turk that fell into their hands  p264chapter xiv  from bir abbas to almadinah  the 22nd july was a grand trial of temper to our little party the position of bir abbas exactly resembles that of alhamra except that the bulge of the hillgirt fiumara is at this place about two miles wide there are the usual stoneforts and palmleaved hovels for the troopers stationed here to hold the place and to escort travellers with a coffeeshed and a hut or two called a bazar but no village our encamping ground was a bed of loose sand with which the violent samum filled the air not a tree or a bush was in sight a species of hardy locust and swarms of flies were the only remnants of animal life the scene was a caricature of sind although we were now some hundred feet to judge by the watershed above the level of the sea the midday sun scorched even through the tent our frail tenement was more than once blown down and the heat of the sand made the work of repitching it painful again my companions after breakfasting hurried to the coffeehouse and returned one after the other with dispiriting reports then they either quarrelled desperately about nothing or they threw themselves on their rugs pretending to sleep in very sulkiness the lady maryam soundly rated her surly son for refusing to fill her chibuk for the twelfth time that morning with the usual religious phrases allah direct thee into the right way o my sonmeaning that he was going to the bad and o my calamity thy mother is a lone woman o allahequivalent to the  p265 european parental plaint about grey hairs being brought down in sorrow to the grave before noon a small caravan which followed us came in with two dead bodiesa trooper shot by the badawin and an albanian killed by sunstroke or the fiery windfn1 shortly after midday a caravan travelling in an opposite direction passed by us it was composed chiefly of indian pilgrims habited in correct costume and hurrying towards meccah in hot haste they had been allowed to pass unmolested because probably a pound sterling could not have been collected from a hundred pockets and saad the robber sometimes does a cheap good deed but our party  p266 having valuables with them did not seem to gather heart from this event in the evening we all went out to see some arab shaykhs who were travelling to bir abbas in order to receive their salaries without such douceurs it is popularly said and believed no stone walls could enable a turk to hold alhijaz against the hillmen such was our system in afghanistanmost unwise teaching in limine the subject to despise rulers subject to blackmail besides which these highly paid shaykhs do no good when a fight takes place or a road is shut they profess inability to restrain their clansmen and the richer they are of course the more formidable they become the party looked well they were harb dignified old men in the picturesque arab costume with erect forms fierce thin features and white beards well armed and mounted upon highbred and handsomely equipped dromedaries from alsharkfn2 preceded by their halfnaked clansmen carrying spears twelve or thirteen feet long garnished with single or double tufts of black ostrich feathers and ponderous matchlocks which were discharged on approaching the fort they were not without a kind of barbaric pomp  immediately after the reception of these shaykhs there was a parade of the arnaut irregular horse about 500 of them rode out to the sound of the nakus or little kettledrum whose puny notes strikingly contrasted with this really martial sight the men it is true were mounted on lean arab and egyptian nags raggedlooking as their clothes and each trooper was armed  p267 in his own way though all had swords pistols and matchlocks or firelocks of some kind but they rode hard as galway buckeens and there was a gallant reckless look about the fellows which prepossessed me strongly in their favour their animals too though notable screws were well trained and their accoutrements were intended for use not show i watched their manoeuvres with curiosity they left their cantonments one by one and at the sound of the tomtom by degrees formed a plump or hersecolumnfn3 it could not be calledall huddled together in confusion presently the little kettledrum changed its note and the parade its aspect all the serried body dispersed as would light infantry now continuing their advance then hanging back then making a rush and all the time keeping up a hot fire upon the enemy at another signal they suddenly put their horses to full speed and closing upon the centre again advanced in a dense mass after threequarters of an hour parading sometimes charging singly often in bodies to the right to the left and straight in front halting when requisite and occasionally retreating parthianlike the arnauts turned en masse towards their lines as they neared them all broke off and galloped in ventre a terre discharging their shotted guns with much recklessness against objects assumed to denote the enemy but ballcartridge seemed to be plentiful hereabouts during the whole of this and the next day i remarked that bullets notched for noise were fired away in mere funfn4  p268 barbarous as these movements may appear to the cavalry martinet of the good old school yet to something of the kind will the tactics of that arm of the service i humbly opine return when the perfect use of the rifle the revolver and field artillery shall have made the present necessarily slow system fatal also if we adopt the common sense opinion of a modern writerfn5 and determine that individual prowess skill in single combats good horsemanship and sharp swords render cavalry formidable these semibarbarians are wiser in their generation than the civilised who never practise arms properly so called whose ridingdrill never made a good rider whose horses are overweighted and whose swords are worthless they have yet another point of superiority over us they cultivate the individuality of the soldier whilst we strive to make him a mere automaton in the days of european chivalry battles were a system of wellfought duels this was succeeded by the age of discipline when to use the language of rabelais men seemed rather a consort of organpipes or mutual concord of the wheels of a clock than an infantry and cavalry or army of soldiers our aim should now be to combine the merits of both systems to make men individually  p269 excellent in the use of weapons and still train them to act naturally and habitually in concert the french have given a model to europe in the chasseurs de vincennesa body capable of most perfect combination yet never more truly excellent than when each man is fighting alone we i suppose shall imitate them at some future timefn6  a distant dropping of firearms ushered in the evening of our first melancholy day at bir abbas this said my companions was a sign that the troops and the hillmen were fighting they communicated the intelligence as if it ought to be an effectual check upon my impatience to proceed it acted however in the contrary way i supposed that the badawin after battling out the night would be less warlike the next day the others however by no means agreed in opinion with me at yambu the whole party had boasted loudly that the people of almadinah could keep their badawin in order and had twitted the boy mohammed with their superiority in this respect to his townsmen the meccans but now that a trial was impending i saw none of the fearlessness so conspicuous when peril was only possible the change was charitably to be explained by the presence of their valuables the sahharahs like conscience making cowards of them all but the young meccan who having sent on his box by sea from yambu  p270 to jeddah felt merry like the empty traveller would not lose the opportunity to pay off old scores he taunted the madinites till they stamped and raved with fury at last fearing some violence and feeling answerable for the boys safety to his family i seized him by the nape of his neck and the upper posterior portion of his nether garments and drove him before me into the tent  when the hubbub had subsided and all sat after supper smoking the pipe of peace in the cool night air i rejoined my companions and found them talking as usual about old shaykh saad the scene was appropriate for the subject in the distance rose the blue peak said to be his eyrie and the place was pointed out with fearful meaning as it is inaccessible to strangers report has converted it into another garden of iram a glance however at its position and formation satisfied me that the bubbling springs the deep forests and the orchards of appletrees quinces and pomegranates with which my companions furnished it were a myth whilst some experience of arab ignorance of the art of defence suggested to me strong doubts about the existence of an impregnable fortress on the hilltop the mountains however looked beautiful in the moonlight and distance gave them a semblance of mystery well suited to the themes which they inspired  that night i slept within my shugduf for it would have been mere madness to sleep on the open plain in a place so infested by banditti the being armed is but a poor precaution near this robbers den if you wound a man in the very act of plundering an exorbitant sum must be paid for bloodmoney if you kill him even to save your life then adieu to any chance of escaping destruction roused three or four times during the night by jackals and dogs prowling about our little camp i observed that my companions who had agreed amongst themselves to keep watch by turns had all  p271 fallen into a sound sleep however when we awoke in the morning the usual inspection of goods and chattels showed that nothing was gone  the next day july 23rd was a forced halt a sore stimulant to the travellers illhumour and the sun the sand the dust the furious samum and the want of certain small supplies aggravated our grievance my sore foot had been inflamed by a dressing of onion skin which the lady maryam had insisted upon applying to itfn7 still being resolved to push forward by any conveyance that could be procured i offered ten dollars for a fresh dromedary to take me on to al madinah shaykh hamid also declared he would leave his box in charge of a friend and accompany me saad the demon flew into a passion at the idea of any member of the party escaping the general evil and he privily threatened mohammed to cut off the legs of any camel that ventured into camp this the boywho like a boy of the world as he was never lost an opportunity of making mischiefinstantly communicated to me and it brought on a furious dispute saad was reproved and apologised for by the rest of the party and presently he himself was pacified principally i believe by the intelligence that no camel was to be hired at bir abbas one of the arnaut garrison who had obtained leave to go to almadinah came to ask us if we could mount him as otherwise he should be obliged to walk the whole way with him we debated the propriety of attempting a passage through the hills by one of the many bypaths that traverse them the project was amply discussed and duly rejected  we passed the day in the usual manner all crowded  p272 together for shelter under the tent even maryam joined us loudly informing ali her son that his mother was no longer a woman but a man whilst our party generally cowering away from the fierce glances of the sun were either eating or occasionally smoking or were occupied in cooling and drinking water about sunsettime came a report that we were to start that night none could believe that such good was in store for us before sleeping however we placed each camels pack apart so as to be ready for loading at a moments notice and we took care to watch that our badawin did not drive their animals away to any distance at last about 11 pm as the moon was beginning to peep over the eastern wall of rock was heard the glad sound of the little kettledrum calling the albanian troopers to mount and march in the shortest possible time all made ready and hurriedly crossing the sandy flat we found ourselves in company with three or four caravans forming one large body for better defence against the dreaded hawamidfn8 by dint of much manoeuvring arms in handshaykh hamid and the demon took the prominent partswe though the last comers managed to secure places about the middle of the line on such occasions all push forward recklessly as an english mob in the strife of sightseeing the rear being left unguarded is the place of danger and none seeks the honour of occupying it  we travelled that night up the fiumara in an easterly direction and at early dawn july 24th found ourselves in an illfamed gorge called shuab alhajjfn9 the pilgrimage pass the loudest talkers became silent as we neared it and their countenances showed apprehension written in legible characters presently from the high precipitous  p273 cliff on our left thin blue curls of smokesomehow or other they caught every eyerose in the air and instantly afterwards rang the sharp cracks of the hillmens matchlocks echoed by the rocks on the right my shugduf had been broken by the camels falling during the night so i called out to mansur that we had better splice the framework with a bit of rope he looked up saw me laughing and with an ejaculation of disgust disappeared a number of badawin were to be seen swarming like hornets over the crests of the hills boys as well as men carrying huge weapons and climbing with the agility of cats they took up comfortable places on the cutthroat eminence and began firing upon us with perfect convenience to themselves the height of the hills and the glare of the rising sun prevented my seeing objects very distinctly but my companions pointed out to me places where the rock had been scarped and where a kind of rough stone breastworkthe sangah of afghanistanhad been piled up as a defence and a rest for the long barrel of the matchlock it was useless to challenge the badawin to come down and fight us like men upon the plain they will do this on the eastern coast of arabia but rarely if ever in alhijaz and it was equally unprofitable for our escort to fire upon a foe ensconced behind stones besides which had a robber been killed the whole country would have risen to a man with a force of 3000 or 4000 they might have gained courage to overpower a caravan and in such a case not a soul would have escaped as it was the badawin directed their fire principally against the albanians some of these called for assistance to the party of shaykhs that accompanied us from bir abbas but the dignified old men dismounting and squatting in council round their pipes came to the conclusion that as the robbers would probably turn a deaf ear to their words they had better spare themselves the trouble of speaking  p274 we had therefore nothing to do but to blaze away as much powder and to veil ourselves in as much smoke as possible the result of the affair was that we lost twelve men besides camels and other beasts of burden though the bandits showed no symptoms of bravery and confined themselves to slaughtering the enemy from their hilltop my companions seemed to consider this questionable affair a most gallant exploit  after another hours hurried ride through the wady sayyalah appeared shuhada to which we pushed on   like nighted swain on lonely road when close behind fierce goblins tread  shuhada is a place which derives its name the martyrs because here are supposed to be buried forty braves that fell in one of mohammeds many skirmishes some authorities consider it the cemetery of the people of wady sayyalahfn10 the once populous valley is now barren and one might easily pass by the consecrated spot without observing a few ruined walls and a cluster of rude badawin graves each an oval of rough stones lying beneath the thorn trees on the left of and a little off the road another half hour took us to a favourite haltingplace bir alhindifn11 so called from some forgotten indian  p275 who dug a well there but we left it behind wishing to put as much space as we could between our tents and the nests of the hamidah then quitting the fiumara we struck northwards into a welltrodden road running over stony rising ground the heat became sickening here and in the east generally at no time is the sun more dangerous than between eight and nine am still we hurried on it was not before eleven am that we reached our destination a rugged plain covered with stones coarse gravel and thorn trees in abundance and surrounded by inhospitable rocks pinnacleshaped of granite below and in the upper parts fine limestone the well was at least two miles distant and not a hovel was in sight a few badawi children belonging to an outcast tribe fed their starveling goats upon the hills this place is called suwaykah it is i was told that celebrated in the history of the arabsfn12 yet not for this reason did my comrades look lovingly upon its horrors their boxes were safe and with the eye of imagination they could now behold their homes that night we must have travelled about twentytwo miles the direction of the road was due east and the only remarkable feature in the ground was its steady rise  p276 we pitched the tent under a villainous mimosa the tree whose shade is compared by poetic badawin to the false friend who deserts you in your utmost need i enlivened the hot dull day by a final affair with saad the demon his alacrity at yambu obtained for him the loan of a couple of dollars he had bought grain at alhamra and now we were near almadinah still there was not a word about repayment and knowing that an oriental debtor discharges his debt as he pays his rent namely with the greatest unwillingnessand that on the other hand an oriental creditor will devote the labour of a year to recovering a sixpence i resolved to act as a native of the country placed in my position would and by dint of sheer dunning and demanding pledges to recover my property about noon saad the demon after a furious rush bareheaded through the burning sun flung the two dollars down upon my carpet however he presently recovered temper and as subsequent events showed i had chosen the right part had he not been forced to repay his debt he would have despised me as a freshman and would have coveted more as it was the boy mohammed bore the brunt of unpopular feeling my want of liberality being traced to his secret and perfidious admonitions he supported his burden the more philosophically because as he notably calculated every dollar saved at almadinah would be spent under his stewardship at meccah  at four pm july 24th we left suwaykah all of us in the crossest of humours and travelled in a ne direction so out of temper were my companions that at sunset of the whole party omar effendi was the only one who would eat supper the rest sat upon the ground pouting grumbling andthey had been allowed to exhaust my stock of latakiasmoking syrian tobacco as if it were a grievance such a game at naughty children i have seldom seen played even by oriental men the boy mohammed  p277 privily remarked to me that the camelmens beards were now in his fistmeaning that we were out of their kinsmen the harbs reach he soon found an opportunity to quarrel with them and because one of his questions was not answered in the shortest possible time he proceeded to abuse them in language which sent their hands flying in the direction of their swords despite however this threatening demeanour the youth knowing that he now could safely go to any lengths continued his ill words and mansurs face was so comically furious that i felt too much amused to interfere at last the camelmen disappeared thereby punishing us most effectually for our sport the road lay up rocky hill and down stony vale a tripping and stumbling dromedary had been substituted for the usual monture the consequence was that we had either a totter or a tumble once per mile during the whole of that long night in vain the now fiery mohammed called for the assistance of the camelmen with the full force of his lungs where be those owls those oxen of the oxen those beggars those cutoff ones those foreigners those sons of flightfn13 withered be their hands palsied be their fingers the foul mustachioed fellows basest of the arabs that ever hammered tentpeg sneaking cats goats of alakhfashfn14 truly i will torture them the torture of the oilfn15 the mines of infamy the cold of countenancefn16 the badawi brotherhood of the camelmen looked at him wickedly muttering the whileby allah and by allah  p278 and by allah o boy we will flog thee like a hound when we catch thee in the desert all our party called upon him to desist but his temper had got completely the upper hand over his discretion and he expressed himself in such classic and idiomatic hijazi that i had not the heart to stop him some days after our arrival at almadinah shaykh hamid warned him seriously never again to go such perilous lengths as the beni harb were celebrated for shooting or poniarding the man who ventured to use to them even the mild epithet o jackass and in the quiet of the city the boy mohammed like a sobered man shuddering at dangers braved when drunk hearkened with discomposure and penitence to his friends words the only immediate consequence of his abuse was that my broken shugduf became a mere ruin and we passed the dark hours perched like two birds upon the only entire bits of framework the cots contained  the sun had nearly risen july 25th before i shook off the lethargic effects of such a night all around me were hurrying their camels regardless of rough ground and not a soul spoke a word to his neighbour are there robbers in sight was the natural question no replied mohammed they are walking with their eyesfn17 they will presently see their homes rapidly we passed the wady alakikfn18 of which  o my friend this is akik then stand by it  endeavouring to be distracted by love if not really a loverfn19  p279 and a thousand other such pretty things have been said by the arab poets it was as dry as summers dust and its beautiful trees appeared in the shape of vegetable mummies half an hour after leaving the blessed valley we came to a huge flight of steps roughly cut in a long broad line of black scoriaceous basalt this is termed the mudarraj or flight of steps over the western ridge of the socalled alharrataynfn20 it is holy ground for the apostle spoke well of it arrived at the top we passed through a lane of dark lava with steep banks on both sides and after a few minutes a full view of the city suddenly opened upon usfn21  we halted our beasts as if by word of command all of us descended in imitation of the pious of old and sat down jaded and hungry as we were to feast our eyes with a view of the holy city  o allah this is the harim sanctuary of thy apostle make it to us a protection from hell fire and a refuge from eternal punishment o open the gates of thy mercy and let us pass through them to the land of joy and o allah bless the last of prophets the seal of prophecy with blessings in number  p280 as the stars of heaven and the waves of the sea and the sands of the wastebless him o lord of might and majesty as long as the cornfield and the dategrove continue to feed mankindfn22 and again live for ever o most excellent of prophetslive in the shadow of happiness during the hours of night and the times of day whilst the bird of the tamarisk the dove moaneth like the childless mother whilst the westwind bloweth gently over the hills of nijd and the lightning flasheth bright in the firmament of alhijaz  such were the poetical exclamations that rose all around me showing how deeply tinged with imagination becomes the language of the arab under the influence of strong passion or religious enthusiasm i now understood the full value of a phrase in the moslem ritual and when his the pilgrims eyes shall fall upon the trees of almadinah let him raise his voice and bless the apostle with the choicest of blessings in all the fair view before us nothing was more striking after the desolation through which we had passed than the gardens and orchards about the town it was impossible not to enter into the spirit of my companions and truly i believe that for some minutes my enthusiasm rose as high as theirs but presently when we remountedfn23 the traveller returned strong upon me i made a rough sketch of the town put questions about the principal buildings and in fact collected materials for the next chapter  p281 the distance traversed that night was about twentytwo miles in a direction varying from easterly to northeasterly we reached almadinah on the 25th july thus taking nearly eight days to travel over little more than 130 miles this journey is performed with camels in four days and a good dromedary will do it without difficulty in half that timefn24  fn1 the natives of alhijaz assured me that in their allahfavoured land the samum never kills a man i doubt the fact this arnauts body was swollen and decomposing rapidly the true diagnostic of death by the poisonwind see ibn batutas voyage kabul however as troopers drink hard the arabs may still be right the samum doing half the work arrack the rest i travelled during the months of july august and september and yet never found myself inconvenienced by the poisonwind sufficiently to make me tie my kufiyah badawifashion across my mouth at the same time i can believe that to an invalid it would be trying and that a man almost worn out by hunger and fatigue would receive from it a coup de grace niebuhr attributes the extraordinary mortality of his companions amongst other causes to a want of stimulants though these might doubtless be useful in the cold weather or in the mountains of alyaman for men habituated to them from early youth yet nothing i believe would be more fatal than strong drink when travelling through the desert in summer heat the common beverage should be water or lemonade the strongest stimulants coffee or tea it is what the natives of the country do and doubtless it is wise to take their example the duke of wellingtons dictum about the healthiness  of india to an abstemious man does not require to be quoted were it more generally followed we should have less of sunstroke and sudden death in our indian armies when soldiers fed with beef and brandy are called out to face the violent heat at the same time it must be remembered that foul and stagnant water abounding in organic matter is the cause of half the diarrhoea and dysentry which prove so fatal to travellers in these regions to the waterdrinker therefore a pocketfilter is indispensable fn2 alshark the east is the popular name in the hijaz for the western region as far as baghdad and bassorah especially nijd the latter province supplies the holy land with its choicest horses and camels the great heats of the parts near the red sea appear prejudicial to animal generation whereas the lofty tablelands and the broad pastures of nijd combined with the attention paid by the people to purity of blood have rendered it the greatest breeding country in arabia  fn3 i mean a civilised column herse is the old military name for a column opposed to haye a line so we read that at farfamed cressy the french fought en battaille a haye the english drawn up en herse this appears to have been the national predilection of that day in later times we and our neighbours changed style the french preferring heavy columns the english extending themselves into lines fn4 the albanians delighting in the noise of musketry notch the ball in order to make it sing the louder when fighting they often adopt the excellent planexcellent when rifles are not procurableof driving a long iron nail through the bullet and fixing its head into the cartridge thus the cartridge is strengthened the bullet is rifled and the wound which it inflicts is death round balls are apt to pass into and out of savages without killing them and many an afghan after being shot or run through the body has mortally wounded his english adversary before falling it is false philanthropy also to suppose that in battle especially when a campaign is commencing it is sufficient to maim not to kill the enemy nothing encourages men to fight so much as a good chance of escaping with a woundespecially a flesh wound i venture to hope that the reader will not charge these sentiments with cruelty he who renders warfare fatal to all engaged in it will be the greatest benefactor the world has yet known fn5 the late captain nolan fn6 the first symptom of improvement will be a general training to the bayonet exercise the british is and for years has been the only army in europe that does not learn the use of this weapon how long does it intend to be the sole authority on the side of ignorance we laughed at the calabrese levies who in the french war threw away their muskets and drew their stilettos and we cannot understand why the indian would always prefer a sabre to a rifle yet we read without disgust of our men being compelled by want of proper training to club their muskets in handtohand fightswhen they have in the bayonet the most formidable of offensive weaponsand of the kafirs and other savages wresting the piece after drawing off its fire from its unhappy possessors grasp fn7 i began to treat it hydropathically with a cooling bandage but my companions declared that the water was poisoning the wound and truly it seemed to get worse every day this idea is prevalent throughout alhijaz even the badawin after once washing a cut or a sore never allow air or water

valley sajasaj plural of sajsaj a temperate situation declared it was a valley of heaven that 70 prophets had prayed there before himself that moses with 70000 israelites had traversed it on his way

honours of the place fn11 the indians sink wells in arabia for the same reason which impels them to dig tanks at homenam ke wastefor the purpose of name thereby denoting together with a laudable desire for posthumous fame a notable lack of ingenuity in securing it for it generally happens that before the third generation has fallen the well and the tank have either lost their original names or have exchanged them for others newer and better known fn12 suwaykah derives its name from the circumstance that in the second or third year of the hijrah hegira mohammed here attacked abu sufiyan

sun arose out of the horizon of low hill blurred and dotted with small tufted trees which gained from the morning mists a giant stature and the earth was stained with purple and gold before us lay a spacious plain bounded in front by the undulating ground of nijd on the left was a grim pile of rocks the celebrated mount ohod with a clump of verdure and a white dome or two nestling at its base rightwards broad streaks of lilaccoloured mists here thick with gathered dew there pierced and thinned by the morning rays stretched over the date groves and the gardens of kuba which stood out in emerald green from the dull tawny surface of the plain below distant about two miles lay almadinah at first sight it appeared a large place but a closer inspection proved the impression to be erroneous a tortuous road from the harrah to the city wound across the plain and led to a tall rectangular gateway pierced in the ruinous mudwall which surrounds the suburb this is the ambari entrance

enceinte stood a conspicuous building in the turkish pavilion stylethe governors palace on the northwest angle of the townwall is a tall whitewashed fort partly built upon an outcropping mass of rock

green surface the tombs that adorn the venerable cemetery albakia from that point southwards begins the mass of palm groves celebrated in alislam as the trees of almadinah  p287 the foreground is well fitted to set off such a view fields of black basaltic scoriae showing clear signs of a volcanic origin are broken up into huge blocks and boulders through which a descent tolerably steep for camels winds down into the plain  after a few minutes rest i remounted and slowly rode on towards the gate even at this early hour the way was crowded with an eager multitude coming out to meet the caravan my companions preferred walking apparently for the better convenience of kissing embracing and shaking hands with relations and friends truly the arabs show more heart on these occasions than any oriental people i know they are of a more affectionate nature than the persians and their manners are far more demonstrative than those of the indians the respectable maryams younger son a pleasant contrast to her surly elder was weeping aloud for joy as he ran round his mothers camel he standing on tiptoe she bending double in vain attempts to exchange a kiss and generally when near relatives or intimates or school companions met the fountains of their eyes were opened friends and comrades greeted one another regardless of rank or fortune with affectionate embraces and an abundance of queries which neither party seemed to think of answering the general mode of saluting was to throw one arm over the shoulder and the other round the side placing the chin first upon the left and then upon the right collarbone and rapidly shifting till a jam satis suggested itself to both parties inferiors recognized their superiors by attempting to kiss hands which were violently snatched away whilst mere acquaintances gave each other a cordial poignee de mains and then raising the finger tips to their lips kissed them with apparent relish  passing through the bab ambari we defiled slowly down a broad dusty street and traversed the harat  p288 quarter alambariyah the principal in the manakhah suburb the thoroughfare is by no means remarkable after cairo only it is rather wider and more regular than the traveller is accustomed to in asiatic cities i was astonished to see on both sides of the way in so small a place so large a number of houses too ruinous to be occupied then we crossed a bridge a single little round arch of roughly hewn stone built over the bed of a torrent alsayhfn3 which in some parts appeared about fifty feet broad with banks showing a high and deeply indented watermark here the road abuts upon an open space called the barr almanakhahfn4 or more concisely albarr the plain straightforward a line leads directly into the bab almisri the egyptian gate of the city but we turned off to the right and after advancing a few yards we found ourselves at the entrance of our friend hamids house  the shaykh had preceded us early that morning in order to prepare an apartment for his guests and to receive the first loud congratulations and embraces of his mother and the daughter of his unclefn5 apparently he had not concluded this pleasing duty when we arrived for the camels were kneeling at least five minutes at his door before he came out to offer the usual hospitable salutation i stared to see the difference of his appearance this morning the razor had passed over his head  p289 and facefn6 the former was now surmounted by a muslin turband of goodly size wound round a new embroidered cap and the latter besides being clean boasted of neat little moustaches turned up like two commas whilst a welltrimmed goats beard narrowed until it resembled what our grammars call an exclamation point the dirty torn shirt with the bits of rope round the loins had been exchanged for a jubbah or outer cloak of light pink merinos a longsleeved caftan of rich flowered stuff a fine shirt of halailifn7 silk and cotton and a sash of plaid pattern elaborately fringed at both ends and for better display wound round twothirds of his body his pantaloons were also of halaili with tasteful edgings about the ankles like a pantilettes while his bare and sunburnt feet had undergone a thorough purification before being encased in new mizzfn8 inner slippers and papush outer slippers of bright lemoncoloured leather of the newest and most fashionable constantinopolitan cut in one of his now delicate hands the shaykh bore a motherofpearl rosary token of piety in the other a handsome pipe with a jasmine stick and an expensive amber mouthpiece his tobacco pouch dangling from his waist like the little purse in the bosom pocket of his coat was of broadcloth richly embroidered with gold in course of time i saw that all  p290 my companions had metamorphosed themselves in an equally remarkable manner as men of sense they appeared in tatters where they were or when they wished to be unknown and in fine linen where and when the world judged their prosperity by their attire their grand suits of clothes therefore were worn only for a few days after returning from the journey by way of proof that the wearer had wandered to some purpose they were afterwards laid up in lavender and reserved for choice occasions as old ladies in europe store up their state dresses  the shaykh whose manners had changed with his garments from the vulgar and boisterous to a certain staid courtesy took my hand and led me up to the majlis fn9 parlour which was swept and garnished with all due apparatus for the forthcoming receptionceremony and behind us followed the boy mohammed looking more downcast and ashamed of himself than i can possibly describe he was still in his rags and he felt keenly that every visitor staring at him would mentally inquire  who may that snob be  with the deepest dejectedness he squeezed himself into a corner and shaykh nur who was foully dirty as an indian en voyage always is would have joined him in his shame had i not ordered the slave to make himself generally useful  it is customary for all relations and friends to call upon the traveller the very day he returns that is to say if amity is to endure the pipes therefore stood ready filled the diwans were duly spread and the coffeefn10 was being boiled upon a brazier in the passage  p291 scarcely had i taken my place at the cool windowsillit was the best in the roomwhen the visitors began to pour in and the shaykh rose to welcome and embrace them they sat down smoked chatted politics asked all manner of questions about the other wayfarers and absent friends drank coffee and after half an hours visit rose abruptly and exchanging embraces took leave the little men entered the assembly after an accolade at the door noiselessly squatted upon the worst seats with polite conges to the rest of the assembly smoked took their coffee as it were under protest and glided out of the room as quietly as they crept in  the great people generally busy and consequential individuals upon whose countenances were writ large the words well to do in the world appeared with a noise that made each person in the room rise reverentially upon his feet sat down with importance monopolised the conversation and departing in a dignified manner expected all to stand on the occasion  the jihad holy war as usual was the grand topic of conversation the sultan had ordered the czar to become a moslem the czar had sued for peace and offered tribute and fealty but the sultan had exclaimed  no by allah alislam  p292 the czar could not be expected to take such a step without a little hesitation but allah smites the faces of the infidels abd almajid would dispose of the moskowfn11 in a short time after which he would turn his victorious army against all the idolaters of feringistan beginning with the english the french and the arwam or greeksfn12 amongst much of this nonsensewhen applied to for my opinion i was careful to make it populari heard news foreboding no good to my journey towards maskat the badawin had decided that there was to be an arab contingent and had been looking forward to the spoils of europe this caused quarrels as all the men wanted to go and not a tenyearold would be left behind the consequence was that this amiable people was fighting in all directions at least so said the visitors and i afterwards found out that they were not far wrong  the samman is a great family in numbers as in dignity from 8 am till midday therefore the majlis was crowded with people and politeness delayed our breakfasts until an unconscionable hour  to the plague of strangers succeeded that of children no sooner did the parlour become comparatively speaking vacant than they rushed in en masse treading upon our toes making the noise of a nursery of madlings pulling to pieces everything they could lay their hands upon and using language that would have alarmed an old manowarsmanfn13 in fact no one can conceive the plague but  p293 those who have studied the enfants terribles which india sends home in cargoes  one urchin scarcely three years old told me because i objected to his perching upon my wounded foot that his father had a sword at home with which he would cut my throat from ear to ear suiting the action to the word by a few taunts i made the little wretch furious with rage he shook his infant fist at me and then opening his enormous round black eyes to their utmost stretch he looked at me and licked his knee with portentous meaning shaykh hamid happening to come in at the moment stood aghast at the doorway chin in hand to see the effendi subject to such indignity and it was not without trouble that i saved the offender from summary nursery discipline another scamp caught up one of my loaded pistols before i could snatch it out of his hand and clapped it to his neighbours head fortunately it was on halfcock and the trigger was stiff then a serious and majestic boy about six years old with an inkstand in his belt in token of his receiving a literary education seized my pipe and began to smoke it with huge puffs i ventured laughingly to institute a comparison between the length of his person and the pipestick when he threw it upon the ground and stared at me fixedly with flaming eyes and features distorted by anger the cause of this bouldness soon appeared the boys instead of being well beaten were scolded with fierce faces a mode of punishment which only made them laugh  they had their redeeming points however they were manly angry boys who punched one another like anglosaxons in the house whilst abroad they were always  p294 fighting with sticks and stones and they examined our weaponsbefore deigning to look at anything elseas if eighteen instead of five had been the general age  at last i so far broke through the laws of arab politeness as to inform my host in plain wordshow inconceivably wretched the boy mohammed was thereby renderedthat i was hungry thirsty and sleepy and that i wanted to be alone before visiting the harim the goodnatured shaykh who was preparing to go out at once in order to pray before his fathers grave immediately brought me breakfast lighted a pipe spread a bed darkened the room turned out the children and left me to the society i most desiredmy own i then overheard him summon his mother wife and other female relatives into the storeroom where his treasures had been carefully stowed away during the forenoon in the presence of the visitors one of hamids uncles had urged him half jocularly to bring out the sahharah the shaykh did not care to do anything of the kind every time a new box is opened in this part of the world the owners generosity is appealed to by those whom a refusal offends and he must allow himself to be plundered with the best possible grace hamid therefore prudently suffered all to depart before exhibiting his spoils which to judge by the exclamations of delight which they elicited from feminine lips proved highly satisfactory to those most concerned  after sleeping we all set out in a body to the harim as this is a duty which must not be delayed by the pious the boy mohammed was in better spirits the effect of having borrowed from hamid amongst other articles of clothing an exceedingly gaudy embroidered coat as for shaykh nur he had brushed up his tarbush and by means of some castoff dresses of mine had made himself look like a respectable abyssinian slave in a nondescript toilette half turkish half indian i propose to reserve  p295 the ceremony of ziyarat or visitation for another chapter and to conclude this with a short account of our style of living at the shaykhs hospitable house  hamids abode is a small corner building open on the north and east to the barr almanakhah the ground floor shows only a kind of vestibule in which coarse articles like old shugdufs mats and bits of sacking are lying about the rest are devoted to purposes of sewerage ascending dark winding steps of ragged stone covered with hard black earth you come to the first floor where the men live it consists of two rooms to the front of the house one a majlis and another converted into a store behind them is a dark passage into which the doors open and the back part of the first story is a long windowless room containing a hanafiyahfn14 or large copper waterpot and other conveniences for purification on the second floor is the kitchen which i did not inspect it being as usual occupied by the harim  the majlis has dwarf windows or rather apertures in the northern and eastern walls with rude wooden shutters and reed blinds the embrasures being garnished with cushions where you sit morning and evening to enjoy the cool air the ceiling is of datesticks laid across palmrafters stained red and the walls are of rough scoriae burnt bricks and woodwork cemented with lime the only signs of furniture in the sittingroom are a diwanfn15 round the sides and a carpet in the centre a  p296 huge wooden box like a seamans chest occupies one of the corners in the southern wall there is a suffah or little shelf of common stone sunk under a single arch upon this are placed articles in hourly use perfumebottles coffeecups a stray book or two and sometimes a turband to be out of the childrens way two hooks on the western wall hung jealously high up hold a pair of pistols with handsome crimson cords and tassels and half a dozen cherrystick pipes the centre of the room is never without one or more shishasfn16 water pipes and in the corner is a large copper brazier containing fire with all the utensils for making coffee either disposed upon its broad brim or lying about the floor the passage like the stairs is spread over with hard black earth and is regularly watered twice a day during the hot weather  the household consisted of hamids mother wife some nephews and nieces small children who ran about in a halfwild and more than halfnude state and two african slave girls when the damascus caravan came  p297 in it was further reinforced by the arrival of his three younger brothers  though the house was not grand it was made lively by the varied views out of the majlis windows from the east you looked upon the square albarr the town walls and houses beyond it the egyptian gate the lofty minarets of the harim and the distant outlines of jabal ohodfn17 the north commanded a prospect of mohammeds mosque one of the khamsah masajidfn18 or the five suburban mosquesfn19 of part of the fortwall and when the damascus caravan came in of the gay scene of the prado beneath the majlis was tolerably cool during the early part of the day in the afternoon the sun shone fiercely upon it i have described the establishment at some length as a specimen of how the middle classes are lodged at almadinah the upper ranks affect turkish and egyptian luxuries in their homes as i had an opportunity of seeing at omar effendis house in the barr and in these countries the abodes of the poor are everywhere very similar  our life in shaykh hamids house was quiet but not disagreeable i never once set eyes upon the face of woman unless the african slave girls be allowed the title even these at first attempted to draw their ragged veils over their sable charms and would not answer the simplest question by degrees they allowed me to see them and they ventured their voices to reply to me still they never threw off a certain appearance of shamefn20  p298 i never saw nor even heard the youthful mistress of the household who stayed all day in the upper rooms the old lady hamids mother would stand upon the stairs and converse aloud with her son and when few people were about the house with me she never however as afterwards happened to an ancient dame at meccah came and sat by my side  when lying during midday in the gallery i often saw parties of women mount the stairs to the gynaeconitis and sometimes an individual would stand to shake a muffled handfn21 with hamid to gossip awhile and to put some questions concerning absent friends but they were most decorously wrapped up nor did they ever deign to deroger even by exposing an inch of cheek  at dawn we arose washed prayed and broke our fastfn22 upon a crust of stale bread before smoking a pipe and drinking a cup of coffeefn23 then it was time to dress to mount and to visit the harim or one of the holy places outside the city returning before the sun became intolerable we sat together and with conversation shishas and chibuksfn24 coffee and cold water perfumed with mastichsmokefn25 we whiled away the time till our  p299 ariston a dinner which appeared at the primitive hour of 11 am the meal here called alghada was served in the majlis on a large copper tray sent from the upper apartments ejaculating bismillahthe moslem gracewe all sat round it and dipped equal hands in the dishes set before us we had usually unleavened bread different kinds of meat and vegetable stews and at the end of the first course plain boiled rice eaten with spoons then came the fruits fresh dates grapes and pomegranates  after dinner i used invariably to find some excusesuch as the habit of a kaylulahfn26 midday siesta or the being a saudawifn27a person of melancholy temperamentto have a rug spread in the dark passage behind  p300 the majlis and there to lie reading dozing smoking or writing en cachette in complete deshabille all through the worst part of the day from noon to sunset  then came the hour for receiving or paying visits we still kept up an intimacy with omar effendi and saad the demon although salih skakkar and amm jamal either disliking our society or perhaps thinking our sphere of life too humble for their dignity did not appear once in hamids house the evening prayers ensued either at home or in the harim followed by our asha or deipnon another substantial meal like the dinner but more plentiful of bread meat vegetables plain rice and fruits concluding with the invariable pipes and coffee  to pass our soiree we occasionally dressed in common clothes shouldered a nabbutfn28 and went to the cafe sometimes on festive occasions we indulged in a taatumah or itmiyah a late supper of sweetmeats pomegranates and dried fruits usually we sat upon mattresses spread upon the ground in the open air at the shaykhs door receiving evening visits chatting telling stories and making merry till each as he felt the approach of the drowsy god sank down into his proper place and fell asleep  whatever may be the heat of the day the night at almadinah owing i suppose to its elevated position is cool and pleasant in order to allay the dust the ground before the shaykhs door was watered every evening and the evaporation was almost too great to be safethe boy mohammed suffered from a smart attack of lumbago  p301 which however yielded readily to frictions of olive oil in which ginger had been boiled  our greatest inconvenience at nighttime was the pugnacity of the animal creation the horses of the troopers tethered in the barr were sure to break loose once in twelve hours some hobbled old nag having slipped the headstall would advance with kangarooleaps towards a neighbour against whom it had a private grudge their heads would touch for a moment then came a snort and a whinny a furious kick and lastly a second horse loose and dashing about with head and tail viciously cocked this was the signal for a general breaking of halters and heelropes after which a stampede scoured the plain galloping rearing kicking biting snorting pawing and screaming with the dogs barking sympathetically and the horsekeepers shouting in hot pursuit  it was a strange sight to see by moonlight the forms of these demon steeds exaggerated by the shades and on more than one occasion we had all to start up precipitately from our beds and yield them to a couple of combatants who were determined to fight out their quarrel a loutrance wherever the battlefield might be  the dogs at almadinah are not less pugnacious than the horsesfn29 they are stronger and braver than those that haunt the streets at cairo like the egyptians they have amongst themselves a system of police regulations which brings down all the posse comitatus upon the unhappy straggler who ventures into a strange quarter of the town they certainly met in albarr upon common  p302 ground to decide the differences which must arise in so artificial a state of canine society  having had many opportunities of watching them i can positively assert that they were divided into two parties which fought with a skill and an acharnement that astounded me sometimes when one side gave way and as the retreat was degenerating into a sauve qui peut some proud warrior a doghero would sacrifice himself for the public weal and with gnashing teeth and howls of rage encounter the assaults of the insolent victors until his flying friends had time to recover heart such an one my companions called mubarizfn30 at other times some huge animal an ajax of his kind would plunge into the ring with frantic yells roll over one dog snap at a second worry a third for a minute or two and then dash off to a distant part where a thicker field required his presence this uncommon sagacity has been remarked by the arabs who look on amused at their battles current in alhijaz are also certain superstitions about the dog resembling ours only as usual more poetical and less grotesque most people believe that when the animal howls without apparent cause in the neighbourhood of a house it forbodes death to one of the inmates for the dog they say can distinguish the awful form of azrail the angel of death hovering over the doomed abode whereas mans spiritual sight is dull and dim by reason of his sins  when the damascus caravan entered almadinah our day became a little more amusing from the windows of shaykh hamids house there was a perpetual succession of strange scenes a persian nobleman also had pitched his tents so near the door that the whole course of his private life became public and patent to the boy mohammed  p303 who amused his companions by reporting all manner of ludicrous scenes the persians wife was rather a pretty woman and she excited the youths fierce indignation by not veiling her face when he gazed at herthereby showing that as his beard was not grown she considered him a mere boy  i will ask her to marry me said mohammed and thereby rouse her shame  he did so but unhappy youth the fair persian never even ceased fanning herself  the boy mohammed was for once confounded  fn1 in the east wherever there is a compound of fort and city that place has certainly been in the habit of being divided against itself surat in western india is a

egypt that beverage in the common coffeeshops isas required to be by the people who frequent those placesbitter as death black as satan and hot as jahannam to effect this desideratum therefore they toast the grain to blackness boil it to bitterness and then drink scalding stuff of the consistency of watergruel at almadinah on the contraryas indeed in the houses of the better classes even in egyptthe grain is carefully picked and that the flavour may be preserved it is never put upon the fire until required it is toasted too till it becomes yellow not black and afterwards is bruised not pounded to powder the water into which it is thrown is allowed to boil up three times after which a cold sprinkling is administered to clear it and then the fine lightdun infusion is poured off into

cause a distaste for society and a longing for solitude an unsettled habit of mind and a neglect of worldly affairs probably it is the effect of overworking the brain in a hot dry atmosphere i have remarked that in arabia students are subject to it and that amongst their philosophers and literary men there is scarcely an individual who was not spoken of as a saudawi my friend omar effendi used to complain that at times his temperament drove him out of the houseso much did he dislike the sound of the human voiceto pass the day seated upon some eminence in the vicinity of the city fn28 this habit of going out at night in common clothes with a nabbut upon ones shoulders is as far as i could discover popular at almadinah but confined to the lowest classes at meccah the boy mohammed always spoke of it with undisguised disapprobation during my stay at meccah i saw no such costume amongst respectable people there though oftentimes there was a suspicion of a disguise fn29 burckhardt travels in arabia vol ii p 268 remarks that almadinah is the only town in the east from which dogs are excluded this was probably as much a relic of wahhabiism that sect hating even to look at a dog

having performed the greater ablution and used the toothstick as directed and dressed ourselves in white clothes which the apostle loved we were ready to start upon our holy errand as my foot still gave me great pain shaykh hamid sent for a donkey a wretched animal appeared rawbacked lame of one leg and wanting an ear with accoutrements to match a packsaddle without stirrups and a halter instead of a bridle such as the brute was however i had to mount it and to ride through the misri gate to the wonder of certain badawin who like the indians despise the ass  honourable is the riding of a horse to the rider but the mule is a dishonour and the donkey a disgrace  says their song the turkish pilgrims however who appear to take a pride in ignoring all arab points of prejudice generally mount donkeys when they cannot walk the badawin therefore settled among themselves audibly enough that i was an osmanli who of course could not understand arabic and they put the question generally  by what curse of allah had they been subjected to assriders  but shaykh hamid is lecturing me upon the subject of the mosque the masjid alnabawi or the prophets mosque is one of the haramayn or the two sanctuaries of alislam  p305 and is the second of the threefn1 most venerable places of worship in the world the other two being the masjid alharim at meccah connected with abraham and the masjid alaksa of jerusalem the peculiar place of solomon a hadis or traditional saying of mohammed asserts one prayer in this my mosque is more efficacious than a thousand in other places save only the masjid alharimfn2 it is therefore the visitors duty as long as he stays at almadinah to pray there the five times per diem to pass the day in it reading the koran and the night if possible in watching and devotion  a visit to the masjid alnabawi and the holy spots within it is technically called ziyarat or visitationfn3 an essential difference is made between this rite and hajj or pilgrimage the latter is obligatory by koranic order upon every moslem once in his life the former is only a meritorious action tawaf or circumambulation of the house of allah at meccah must never be performed at the apostles tomb this should not be visited in the ihram or pilgrim dress men should not kiss it touch it with the hand or press the bosom against it as at the kaabah or rub the face with dust collected near the sepulchre and those who prostrate themselves before it like certain ignorant indians are held to be  p306 guilty of deadly sin on the other hand to spit upon any part of the mosque or to treat it with contempt is held to be the act of an infidel  thus the learned and religious have settled one would have thought accurately enough the spiritual rank and dignity of the masjid alnabawi but mankind especially in the east must always be in extremes the orthodox school of almalik holds almadinah on account of the sanctity of and the religious benefits to be derived from mohammeds tomb more honourable than meccah some declare that the apostle preferred his place of refuge blessing it as abraham did meccah moreover as a tradition declares that every mans body is drawn from the ground in which he is buried almadinah evidently had the honour of supplying materials for the apostles person others like omar were uncertain which to prefer the wahhabis on the other hand rejecting the intercession of the apostle on the day of judgment considering the grave of a mere mortal unworthy of notice and highly disgusted by the idolatrous respect paid to it by certain foolish moslems plundered the sacred building with sacrilegious violence and forbade visitors from distant countries to enter almadinahfn4  the general consensus of alislam admits the superiority of the bayt allah house of god at meccah to the whole world and declares almadinah to be more venerable than every part of meccah and consequently all the earth except only the bayt allah this last is a juste milieu view by no means in favour with the inhabitants of either place in the meanwhile the meccans claim unlimited superiority over the madani the madani over the meccans  p307passing through muddy streetsthey had been freshly watered before evening timei came suddenly upon the mosque like that at meccah the approach is choked up by ignoble buildings some actually touching the holy enceinte

the moslem world it is not like the meccan temple grand and simple the expression of a single sublime idea the longer i looked at it the more it suggested the resemblance of a museum of secondrate art an old curiosityshop full of ornaments that are not accessories and decorated with pauper splendour  the masjid alnabi is a parallelogram about four hundred and twenty feet in length by three hundred and forty broad the direction of the long walls being nearly north and south as usual in alislam it is a hypaethral building with a spacious central area called alsahn alhosh alhaswah or alramlahfn7 surrounded by a peristyle with numerous rows of pillars like the colonnades of an italian cloister the arcades or porticoes are flatceilinged domed above with the small media  p308 naranja or halforange cupola of spain and divided into four parts by narrow passages three or four steps below the level of the pavement along the whole inner length of the northern short wall runs the majidi riwak so called from the then reigning sultanfn8 the western long wall is occupied by the riwak of the rahmah gate the eastern by that of the bab alnisa the womens entrancefn9  embracing the inner length of the southern short wall and deeper by nearly treble the amount of columns than the other porticoes is the main colonnade called alrauzahfn10 the garden the adytum containing all that is venerable in the building these four riwaks arched externally are supported internally by pillars of different shape and material varying from fine porphyry to dirty plaster the southern where the sepulchre or cenotaph stands is paved with handsome slabs of white marble and marquetry work here and there covered with coarse matting and above this by unclean carpets well worn by faithful feetfn11  but this is not the time for tafarruj or lionising  p309 shaykh hamid warns me with a nudge that other things are expected of a zair visitor he leads me to the bab alsalam fighting his way through a troop of beggars and inquires markedly if i am religiously purefn12 then placing our hands a little below and on the left of the waist the palm of the right covering the back of the left in the position of prayer and beginning with the dexter feetfn13 we pace slowly forwards down the line called the muwajihat alsharifah or the illustrous fronting which divided off like an aisle runs parallel with the southern wall of the mosque on my right hand walks the shaykh who recites aloud the following prayer making me repeat it after himfn14 it is literally rendered as indeed are all the formulae and the reader is requested to excuse the barbarous fidelity of the translation  in the name of allah and in the faith of allahs apostle o lord cause me to enter the entering of truth and cause me to issue forth the issuing of truth and permit me to draw near to thee and make me a sultan victoriousfn15 then follow blessings upon the apostle and afterwards o allah open to me the doors of thy mercy and grant me entrance into it and protect me from the stoned devil  during this preliminary prayer we had passed down twothirds of the muwajihat alsharifah on the left hand is a dwarf wall about the height of a man painted with arabesques and pierced with four small doors which  p310 open into the muwajihat in this barrier are sundry small erections the niche called the mihrab sulaymanifn16 the mambar or pulpit and the mihrab alnabawifn17  the two niches are of beautiful mosaic richly worked with various coloured marbles and the pulpit is a graceful collection of slender columns elegant tracery and inscriptions admirably carved arrived at the western small door in the dwarf wall we entered the celebrated spot called alrauzah after a saying of the apostles between my tomb and my pulpit is a garden of the gardens of paradisefn18 on the north and west sides it is  p311 not divided from the rest of the portico on the south runs the dwarf wall and on the east it is limited by the west end of the latticework containing the tomb  accompanied by my muzawwir i entered the rauzah and was placed by him with the mukabbariyahfn19 behind me fronting meccah with my right shoulder opposite to and about twenty feet distant from the dexter pillar of the apostles pulpitfn20 there after saying the afternoon prayersfn21 i performed the usual two bows in honour of the templefn22 and at the end of them recited the hundred and ninth and the hundred and twelfth chapters of the koranthe kul ya ayyuhalkafiruna and the surat alikhlas called also the kul huw allah or the declaration of unity and may be thus translated  say he is the one god the eternal god he begets not nor is he begot  p312 and unto him the like is not  after which was performed a single sujdah prostration of thanksfn23 in gratitude to allah for making it my fate to visit so holy a spot  this being the recognised time to give alms i was besieged by beggars who spread their napkins before us on the ground sprinkled with a few coppers to excite generosity but not wishing to be distracted by them before leaving hamids house i had changed two dollars and had given the coin to the boy mohammed who accompanied me strictly charging him to make that sum last through the mosque  my answer to the beggars was a reference to my attendant backed by the simple action of turning my pockets inside out and whilst he was battling with the beggars i proceeded to cast my first coupdoeil upon the rauzah  the garden is the most elaborate part of the mosque little can be said in its praise by day when it bears the same relation to a secondrate church in rome as an english chapelofease to westminster abbey it is a space of about eighty feet in length tawdrily decorated so as to resemble a garden the carpets are flowered and the pediments of the columns are cased with bright green tiles and adorned to the height of a man with gaudy and unnatural vegetation in arabesque it is disfigured by handsome branched candelabras of cut crystal the work i believe of a london house and presented to the shrine by the late abbas pasha of egyptfn24  the only admirable feature of the view is the light  p313 cast by the windows of stained glassfn25 in the southern wall its peculiar background the railing of the tomb a splendid filigreework of green and polished brass gilt or made to resemble gold looks more picturesque near than at a distance when it suggests the idea of a gigantic birdcage but at night the eye dazzled by oillampsfn26 suspended from the roof by huge wax candles and by smaller illuminations falling upon crowds of visitors in handsome attire with the richest and the noblest of the city sitting in congregation when service is performedfn27 becomes less critical still the scene must be viewed with moslem bias and until a man is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the east the last place the rauzah will remind him of is that which the architect primarily intended it to resemblea garden  then with hamid professionally solemn i reassumed the position of prayer and retraced my steps after passing through another small door in the dwarf wall that bounds the muwajihah we did not turn to the right which would have led us to the bab alsalam our course was in an opposite direction towards the eastern wall of the temple meanwhile we repeated verily allah and his angelsfn28 bless the apostle o ye who believe bless him  p314 and salute him with honour at the end of this prayer we arrived at the mausoleum which requires some description before the reader can understand the nature of our proceedings there  the hujrahfn29 or chamber as it is called from the circumstance of its having been ayishahs room is an irregular square of from fifty to fiftyfive feet in the southeast corner of the building and separated on all sides from the walls of the mosque by a passage about twentysix feet broad on the south side and twenty on the east the reason of this isolation has been before explained and there is a saying of mohammeds o allah cause not my tomb to become an object of idolatrous adoration may allahs wrath fall heavy upon the people who make the tombs of their prophets places of prayerfn30  p315 inside there are or are supposed to be three tombs facing the south surrounded by stone walls without any aperture or as others say by strong plankingfn31 whatever this material may be it is hung outside with a curtain somewhat like a large fourpost bed the external railing is separated by a dark narrow passage from the inner which it surrounds and is of iron filigree painted of a vivid grass greenwith a view to the garden here carefully inserted in the verdure and doubly bright by contrast is the gilt or burnished brass work forming the long and graceful letters of the suls character and disposed into the moslem creed the profession of unity and similar religious sentences  on the south side for greater honour the railing is plated over with silver and silver letters are interlaced with it this fence which connects the columns and forbids passage to all men may be compared to the baldacchino of roman churches it has four gates that to the south is the bab almuwajihah eastward is the gate of our lady fatimah westward the bab altaubah of repentance opening into the rauzah or garden and to the north the bab alshami or syrian gate they are constantly kept closed except the fourth which admits into the dark narrow passage above alluded to the officers who have charge of the treasures there deposited and the eunuchs who sweep the floor light p316 the lamps and carry away the presents sometimes thrown in here by devoteesfn32  in the southern side of the fence are three windows holes about half a foot square and placed from four to five feet above the ground they are said to be between three and four cubits distant from the apostles head the most westerly of these is supposed to front mohammeds tomb wherefore it is called the shubak alnabi or the prophets window the next on the right as you front it is abu bakrs and the most easterly of the three is omars  above the hujrah is the green dome surmounted outside by a large gilt crescent springing from a series of globes the glowing imaginations of the moslems crown this gem of the building with a pillar of heavenly light which directs from three days distance the pilgrims steps towards almadinah but alas none save holy men and perhaps odylic sensitives whose material organs are piercing as their spiritual vision may be allowed the privilege of beholding this poetic splendour  arrived at the shubak alnabi hamid took his stand about six feet or so out of reach of the railing and at that respectful distance from and facingfn33 the hazirah or presence  p317 with hands raised as in prayer he recited the following supplication in a low voice telling me in a stage whisper to repeat it after him with awe and fear and love  peace be upon thee o apostle of allah and the mercy of allah and his blessings peace be upon thee o apostle of allah peace be upon thee o friend of allah peace be upon thee o best of allahs creation peace be upon thee o pure creature of allah peace be upon thee o chief of prophets  peace be upon thee o seal of the prophets peace be upon thee o prince of the pious peace be upon thee o apostle of the lord of the three worlds peace be upon thee and upon thy family and upon thy pure wives peace be upon thee and upon all thy companions peace be upon thee and upon all the prophets and upon those sent to preach allahs word peace be upon thee and upon all allahs righteous worshippers peace be upon thee o thou bringer of glad tidings peace be upon thee o bearer of threats peace be upon thee o thou bright lamp peace be upon thee o thou apostle of mercy peace be upon thee o ruler of thy faith peace be upon thee o opener of grief peace be upon thee and allah bless thee and allah repay thee for us o thou apostle of allah the choicest of blessings with which he ever blessed prophet allah bless thee as often as mentioners have mentioned thee and forgetters have forgotten thee and allah bless thee among the first and the last with the best the highest and the fullest of blessings ever bestowed on man even as we escaped error by means of thee and were made to see after blindness and after ignorance were directed  p318 into the right way i bear witness that there is no god but the god allah and i testify that thou art his servant and his apostle and his faithful follower and best creature and i bear witness o apostle of allah that thou hast delivered thy message and discharged thy trust and advised thy faith and opened grief and published proofs and fought valiantly for thy lord and worshipped thy god till certainty came to thee ie to the hour of death and we thy friends o apostle of allah appear before thee travellers from distant lands and far countries through dangers and difficulties in the times of darkness and in the hours of day longing to give thee thy rights ie to honour thee by benediction and visitation and to obtain the blessings of thine intercession for our sins have broken our backs and thou intercedest with the healer and allah saidfn34 ‘and though they have injured themselves they came to thee and begged thee to secure their pardon and they found god an acceptor of penitence and full of compassion o apostle of allah intercession intercession intercessionfn35 o allah bless mohammed and mohammeds family and give him superiority and high rank even as thou didst promise him and graciously allow us to conclude this visitation i deposit on this spot and near thee o apostle of god my everlasting profession of faith from this our day to the day of judgment that there is no god but allah and that our lord mohammed is his servant and his apostlefn36 amen o lord of the three worldsfn37  p319 after which performing ziyaratfn38 for ourselves we repeated the fatihah or opening chapter of the koran  in the name of allah the merciful the compassionate praise be to allah who the three worlds made the merciful the compassionate the king of the day of faith thee alone do we worship and of thee alone do we ask aid guide us to the path that is straight the path of those for whom thy love is great not those on whom is hate nor they that deviate amen o lord of angels jinnis and menfn39  after reciting this mentally with upraised hands the forefinger of the right hand being extended to its full length we drew our palms down our faces and did almsdeeds a vital part of the ceremony thus concludes the first part of the ceremony of visitation at the apostles tomb  p320 hamid then stepped about a foot and half to the right and i followed his example so as to place myself exactly opposite the second aperture in the grating called abu bakrs window there making a sign towards the mausoleum we addressed its inmate as follows  peace be upon thee o abu bakr o thou truthful one peace be upon thee o caliph of allahs apostle over his people peace be upon thee o companion of the cave and friend in travel peace be upon thee o thou banner of the fugitives and the auxiliaries i testify thou didst ever stand firm in the right way and wast a smiter of the infidel and a benefactor to thine own people allah grant thee through his apostle weal we pray almighty god to cause us to die in thy friendship and to raise us up in company with his apostle and thyself even as he hath mercifully vouchsafed to us this visitationfn40  after which we closed one more step to the right and standing opposite omars window the most easterly of the three after making a sign with our hands we addressed the just caliph in these words  peace be upon thee o omar o thou just one thou prince of true believers peace be upon thee who spakest with truth and who madest thy word agree with the strong book the koran o thou faruk the separatorfn41 o thou faithful one who girdedst thy loins with the apostle and the first believers and with them didst make up the full number fortyfn42 and thus causedst to be accomplished the apostles prayerfn43 and  p321 then didst return to thy god a martyr leaving the world with praise allah grant thee through his apostle and his caliph and his followers the best of good and may allah feel in thee plenary satisfaction  shaykh hamid after wrenching a beggar or two from my shoulders then permitted me to draw near to the little window called the apostles and to look in here my proceedings were watched with suspicious eyes the persians have sometimes managed to pollute the part near abu bakrs and omars graves by tossing through the aperture what is externally a handsome shawl intended as a present for the tombfn44 after straining my eyes for a time i saw a curtainfn45 or rather hangings with  p322 three inscriptions in long gold letters informing readers that behind them lie allahs apostle and the first two caliphs  the exact place of mohammeds tomb is moreover distinguished by a large pearl rosary and a peculiar ornament the celebrated kaukabaldurri or constellation of pearls suspended to the curtain breasthighfn46 this is described to be a brilliant star set in diamonds and pearls placed in the dark that mans eye may be able to bear its splendours the vulgar believe it to be a jewel of the jewels of paradise to me it greatly resembled the round glass stoppers used for the humbler sort of decanters but i thought the same of the kohinur moreover i never saw it quite near enough to judge fairly and i did not think fit to pay an exorbitant sum for the privilege of entering the inner passage of the baldaquinfn47  p323 altogether the coupdoeil had nothing to recommend it by day at night when the lamps hung in this passage shed a dim light upon the mosaicwork of the marble floors upon the glittering inscriptions and the massive hangings the scene is more impressive  never having seen the tombfn48 i must depict it from booksby no means an easy task most of the historians are silent after describing the inner walls of the hujrah alkalkashandi declares in eo lapidem nobilem continere sepulchra apostoli abubecr et omar circumcinctum peribole in modum conclavis fere usque ad tectum assurgente quae velo serico nigro obligatur this author then agrees with my persian friends who declare the sepulchre to be a marble slab ibn jubayr who travelled in ah 580 relates that the apostles coffin is a box of ebony abnus covered with sandalwood and plated with silver it is placed he says behind a curtain and surrounded by an iron grating alsamanhudifn49 quoted by burckhardt declares that the curtain covers a square building of black stones in the interior of which are the tombs of mohammed and of his two immediate successors he adds that the tombs are  p324 deep holes and that the coffin which contains the apostle is cased with silver and has on the top a marble slab inscribed bismillah allahumma salli alayh in the name of allah allah have mercy upon himfn50  the apostles body it should be remembered lies or is supposed to lie stretched at full length on the right side with the right palm supporting the right cheek the face fronting meccah as moslems are always buried and consequently the body lies with the head almost due west and the feet due east close behind him is placed abu bakr whose face fronts the apostles shoulderfn51 and lastly omar holds the same position with respect to his predecessor  the places they are usually supposed to occupy then would be thus disposed but moslem historians are not agreed even upon so simple a point as this p325 many prefer this position in line figure some thus in unicorn figure and others the right anglefn52 figure  it is popularly asserted that in the hujrah there is now spare place for only a single grave reserved for isa bin maryam after his second coming the historians of alislam are full of tales proving that though many of their earlier saints as osman the caliph and hasan the imam were desirous of being buried there and that although ayishah to whom the room belonged willingly acceded to their wishes son of man has as yet been unable to occupy it  after the fatihah pronounced at omars tomb and the short inspection of the hujrah shaykh hamid led me round the southeast corner of the baldaquinfn53 turning  p326 towards the north we stopped at what is commonly called the mahbat jibrail place of the archangel gabriels descent with the heavenly revelations or simply almalaikahthe angels it is a small window in the eastern wall of the mosque we turned our backs upon it and fronting the hujrah recited the following prayer  peace be upon you o angels of allah the mukarrabin cherubs and the musharrifin seraphs the pure the holy honored by the dwellers in heaven and by those who abide upon the earth o beneficent lord o longsuffering o almighty o pitier o thou compassionate one perfect our light and pardon our sins and accept penitence for our offences and cause us to die among the holy peace be upon ye angels of the merciful one and all and the mercy of god and his blessings be upon you after which i was shown the spot in the hujrah where sayyidna isa shall be buriedfn54 by mohammeds side  p327 then turning towards the west at a point where there is a break in the symmetry of the hujrah we arrived at the sixth station the sepulchre or cenotaph of the lady fatimah her grave is outside the enceinte and the curtain which surrounds her fathers remains so strict is moslem decorum and so exalted its opinion of the virginsfn55 delicacy the eastern side of the hujrah here turning a little westward interrupts the shape of the square in order to give this spot the appearance of disconnection with the rest of the building the tomb seen through a square aperture like those above described is a long catafalque covered with a black pall though there is great doubt whether the lady be not buried with her son hassan in the bakia cemetery this place is always visited by the pious moslem the following is the prayer opposite the grave of the amiable fatimah  peace be upon thee daughter of the apostle of allah peace be upon thee daughter of the prophet of allah peace be upon thee thou daughter of mustafa peace be upon thee thou mother of the shurafafn56 seed of mohammed peace be upon thee o lady amongst women peace be upon thee o fifth of the ahl alkisafn57 peace be upon thee o zahra and batulfn58 pure and virgin  p328 peace be upon thee o daughter of the apostle peace be upon thee o spouse of our lord ali almurtaza peace be upon thee o mother of hasan and husayn the two moons the two lights the two pearls the two princes of the youth of heaven and coolness of the eyesfn59 ie joy and gladness of true believers peace be upon thee and upon thy sire almustafa and thy husband our lord ali allah honour his face and thy face and thy fathers face in paradise and thy two sons the hasanayn and the mercy of allah and his blessings  we then broke away as we best could from the crowd of female askers who have established their lares and penates under the shadow of the ladys wing and advancing a few paces we fronted to the north and recited a prayer in honour of hamzah and of the martyrs who lie buried at the foot of mount ohodfn60 we then turned to the right and fronting the easterly wall prayed for the souls of the blessed whose mortal spirits repose within albakias hallowed circuitfn61  after this we returned to the southern wall of the mosque and facing towards meccah we recited the following supplicationo allah three times repeated o compassionate o beneficent o requiter of good and  p329 evil o prince o ruler o ancient of benefits o omniscient o thou who givest when asked and who aidest when aid is required accept this our visitation and preserve us from dangers and make easy our affairs and broaden our breasts gladden our hearts and receive our prostration and requite us according to our good deeds and turn not against us our evil deeds and place not over us one who feareth not thee and one who pitieth not us and write safety and health upon us and upon thy slaves the hujjaj pilgrims and the ghuzzat fighters for the faith and the zawwarfn62 visitors to the tomb and the homedwellers and the wayfarers of the moslems by land and by sea and pardon those of the faith of our lord mohammed one and all  from the southern wall we returned to the apostles window where we recited the following tetrastich and prayer  o mustafa verily i stand at thy door a man weak and fearful by reason of my sins if thou aid me not o apostle of allah i diefor in the world there is none generous as thou art  of a truth allah and his angels bless the apostle o ye who believe bless him and salute him with salutationfn63 o allah verily i implore thy pardon and supplicate thine aid in this world as in the next o allah o allah abandon us not in this holy place to the consequences of our sins without pardoning them or to our griefs without consoling them or to our fears o allah without removing them and blessings and salutation to thee o prince of apostles commissioned to preach the word and laud be to allah the lord of the three worlds  we turned away from the hujrah and after gratifying  p330 a meeklooking but exceedingly importunate hindi beggar who insisted on stunning me with the chapter y sfn64 we fronted southwards and taking care that our backs should not be in a line with the apostles face stood opposite the niche called mihrab osman there hamid proceeded with another supplication o allah three times repeated o safeguard of the fearful and defender of those who trust in thee and pitier of the weak the poor and the destitute accept us o beneficent and pardon us o merciful and receive our penitence o compassionate and have mercy upon us o forgiverfor verily none but thou canst remit sin of a truth thou alone knowest the hidden and veilest mans transgressions veil then our offences and pardon our sins and broaden our breasts and cause our last words at the supreme hour of life to be the words ‘there is no god but allahfn65 and our lord mohammed is the apostle of allah o allah cause us to live according to this saying o thou giver of life and make us to die in this faith o thou ruler of death and the best of blessings and the completest of salutations upon the sole lord of intercession our lord mohammed and his family and his companions one and all  lastly we returned to the gardenfn66 and prayed another twobow prayer ending as we began with the worship of the creator  p331 unfortunately for me the boy mohammed had donned that grand embroidered coat at the end of the ceremony the aghas or eunuchs of the mosque a race of men considered respectable by their office and prone to make themselves respected by the freest administration of clublaw assembled in alrauzah to offer me the congratulation ziyaratak mubarakblessed be thy visitationand to demand fees then came the sakka or watercarrier of the mosque well zemzemfn67 offering a tinned saucer filled from the holy source and lastly i was beset by beggars  some were mild beggars and picturesque who sat upon the ground immersed in the contemplation of their napkins others angry beggars who cursed if they were not gratified and others noisy and petulant beggars especially the feminine party near the ladys tomb who captured me by the skirt of my garment compelling me to ransom myself there were besides pretty beggars boys who held out the right hand on the score of good looks ugly beggars emaciated rascals whose long hair dirt and leanness entitled them to charity and lastly the blind the halt and the diseased who as sons of the holy city demanded from the faithful that support with which they could not provide themselves having been compelled by my companions highly against my inclination to become a man of rank i was obliged to pay in proportion and my almoner in the handsome coat as usual took a kind of pride in being profuse this first visit cost me double what i had intendedfour dollarsnearly one pound sterling and never afterwards could i pay less than half that sumfn68  p332 having now performed all the duties of a good zair i was permitted by shaykh hamid to wander about and see the sights we began our circumambulation at the bab alsalamfn69 the gate of salvation the southwestern entrance pierced in the long wall of the mosque it is a fine archway handsomely encrusted with marble and glazed tiles the many gilt inscriptions on its sides give it especially at nighttime an appearance of considerable splendour the portcullislike doors are of wood strengthened with brass plates and nails of the same metal outside this gate is a little sabil or public fountain where those who will not pay for the water kept ready in large earthen jars by the sakka of the mosque perform their ablutions gratis here all the mendicants congregate in force sitting on the outer steps and at the entrance of the mosque up and through which the visitors must pass  about the centre of the western wall is the bab alrahmah the gate of pity which admits the dead bodies of the faithful when carried to be prayed over in the mosque there is nothing remarkable in its appearance in common with the other gates it has huge folding doors ironbound an external flight of steps and a few modern inscriptions  the bab majidi or gate of the sultan abd almajid stands in the centre of the northern wall like its portico it is unfinished but its present appearance promises that it will eclipse all except the bab alsalam  the bab alnisa or gate of women is in the eastern wall opposite the bab alrahmah with which it is connected by the farsh alhajar a broad band of stone two or three steps below the level of the portico  p333 and slightly raised above the sahn or the hypaethral portion of the mosque and lastly in the southern portion of the same eastern wall is the bab jibrail the gate of the archangel gabrielfn70  all these entrances are arrived at by short external flights of steps leading from the streets as the base of the temple unlike that of meccah is a little higher than the foundation of the buildings around it the doors are closed by the attendant eunuchs immediately after the night prayers except during the blessed month alramazan and in the pilgrimage season when pious visitors pay considerable fees there to pass the night in meditation and prayer  the minarets are five in number but one the shikayliyah at the northwest angle of the building has been levelled and is still in process of being rebuilt the munar bab alsalam stands by the gate of that name it is a tall handsome tower surmounted by a large ball or conefn71 of brass gilt or burnished the munar bab alrahmah about the centre of the western wall is of more simple form than the others it has two galleries with the superior portion circular and surmounted by the conical extinguisherroof so common in turkey and egypt on the northeast angle of the mosque stands the sulaymaniyah munar so named after its founder sultan sulayman the magnificent it is a wellbuilt and substantial stonetower divided into three stages the two  p334 lower portions are polygonal the upper cylindrical and each terminates in a platform with a railed gallery carried all round for the protection of those who ascend  and lastly from the southeast angle of the mosque supposed to be upon the spot where belal the apostles loudlunged crier called the first moslems to prayer fn72 springs the munar raisiyah so called because it is appropriated to the ruasa or chiefs of the muezzins like the sulaymaniyah it consists of three parts the first and second stages are polygonal and the third a cylinder is furnished like the lower two with a railed gallery both the latter minarets end in solid ovals of masonry from which project a number of wooden triangles to these and to the galleries on all festive occasions such as the arrival of the damascus caravan are hung oillampsa poor attempt at illumination which may rationally explain the origin of the madinite superstition concerning the column of light which crowns the prophets tomb there is no uniformity in the shape or the size of these four minarets and at first sight despite their beauty and grandeur they appear somewhat bizarre and misplaced but after a few days i found that my eye grew accustomed to them and i had no difficulty in appreciating their massive proportions and lofty forms  equally irregular are the riwaks or porches surrounding the hypaethral court along the northern wall there will be when finished a fine colonnade of granite paved with marble the eastern riwak has three rows of pillars the western four and the southern under which stands the tomb of course has its columns ranged deeper than all the others these supports of the building are of different material some of fine marble others of  p335 rough stone plastered over and painted with the most vulgar of arabesquesvermilion and black in irregular patches and broad streaks like the stageface of a london clownfn73 their size moreover is different the southern colonnade being composed of pillars palpably larger than those in the other parts of the mosque scarcely any two shafts own similar capitals many have no pedestal and some of them are cut with a painful ignorance of art i cannot extend my admiration of the minarets to the columnsin their architectural lawlessness there is not a redeeming point  of these unpraisable pillars three are celebrated in the annals of alislam for which reason their names are painted upon them and five others enjoy the honour of distinctive appellations the first is called almukhallak because on some occasion of impurity it was anointed with a perfume called khaluk it is near the mihrab alnabawi on the right of the place where the imam prays and it notes the spot where before the invention of the pulpit the apostle leaning upon the ustuwanat alhannanahthe weeping pillarfn74used to recite the khutbah or friday sermon  the second stands third from the pulpit and third from the hujrah it is called the pillar of ayishah also the ustuwanat alkurah or the column of lots because the apostle according to the testimony of his favourite wife declared that if men knew the value of the place they would cast lots to pray there in some books it is known as the pillar of the muhajirin or fugitives and others mention it as almukhallakthe perfumed  twenty cubits distant from ayishahs pillar and the   p336 second from the hujrah and the fourth from the pulpit is the pillar of repentance or of abu lubabah it derives its name from the following circumstance abu lubabah was a native of almadinah one of the auxiliaries and a companion of mohammed originally it is said a jew according to others of the beni amr bin auf of the aus tribe being sent for by his kinsmen or his allies the benu kurayzah at that time capitulating to mohammed he was consulted by the distracted men women and children who threw themselves at his feet and begged of him to intercede for them with the offended apostle abu lubabah swore he would do so at the same time he drew his hand across his throat as much as to say defend yourselves to the last for if you yield such is your doom afterwards repenting he bound himself with a huge chain to the datetree in whose place the column now stands vowing to continue there until allah and the apostle accepted his penitencea circumstance which did not take place till the tenth day when his hearing was gone and he had almost lost his sight  the less celebrated pillars are the ustuwanat alsarir or column of the cot where the apostle was wont to sit meditating on his humble couchframe of datesticks the ustuwanat ali notes the spot where the fourth caliph used to pray and watch near his fatherinlaw at night at the ustuwanat alwufud as its name denotes the apostle received envoys couriers and emissaries from foreign places the ustuwanat altahajjud now stands where mohammed sitting upon his mat passed the night in prayer and lastly is the makam jibrail gabriels place for whose other name mirbaat albair the pole of the beast of burden i have been unable to find an explanation  the four riwaks or porches of the madinah mosque open upon a hypaethral court of parallelogramic shape  p337 the only remarkable object in itfn75 is a square of wooden railing enclosing a place full of wellwatered earth called the garden of our lady fatimahfn76 it now contains a dozen datetreesin ibn jubayrs time there were fifteen their fruit is sent by the eunuchs as presents to the sultan and the great men of alislam it is highly valued by the vulgar but the olema do not think much of its claims to importance among the palms are the venerable remains of a sidr or lote treefn77 whose produce is sold for inordinate sums the enclosure is entered by a dwarf gate in the southeastern portion of the railing near the well and one of the eunuchs is generally to be seen in it it is under the charge of the mudir or chief treasurer these gardens are not uncommon in mosques as the traveller who passes through cairo can convince himself they form a pretty and an appropriate feature in a building erected for the worship of him who spread the earth with carpets of flowers and drew shady trees from the dead ground a tradition of the apostle also declares that acceptable is devotion in the garden and in the orchard  p338 at the southeast angle of this enclosure under a wooden roof supported by pillars of the same material stands the zemzem generally called the bir alnabi or the apostles well my predecessor declares that the brackishness of its produce has stood in the way of its reputation for holiness yet a welleducated man told me that it was as light wholesome waterfn78 as any in almadinaha fact which he accounted for by supposing a subterraneous passagefn79 which connects it with the great zemzem at meccah others again believe that it is filled by a vein of water springing directly under the apostles grave generally however among the learned it is not more revered than our ladys garden nor is it ranked in books among the holy wells of almadinah  between this zemzem well and the eastern riwak is the stoa or academia of the prophets city in the cool mornings and evenings the ground is strewed with professors who teach the young idea as an eminent orientalist hath it to shout rather than to shootfn80 a few feet to the south of the palm garden is a moveable wooden planking painted green and about three feet high it serves to separate the congregation from the imam when he prays here and at the northeastern angle of the enclosure is a  p339 shajar kanadil a large brass chandelier which completes the furniture of the court  after this inspection the shadows of evening began to gather round us we left the mosque reverently taking care to issue forth with the left foot and not to back out of it as is the sunnat or practice derived from the apostle when taking leave of the meccan temple  to conclude this long chapter although every moslem learned and simple firmly believes that mohammeds remains are interred in the hujrah at almadinah i cannot help suspecting that the place is doubtful as that of the holy sepulchre at jerusalem it must be remembered that a tumult followed the announcement of the apostles death when the people as often happens believing him to be immortalfn81 refused to credit the report and even omar threatened destruction to any one that asserted it  moreover the body was scarcely cold when the contest about the succession arose between the fugitives of meccah and the auxiliaries of almadinah in the ardour of which according to the shiahs the house of ali and fatimahwithin a few feet of the spot where the tomb of the apostle is now placedwas threatened with fire and abu bakr was elected caliph that same evening if anyone find cause to wonder that the last restingplace of a personage so important was not fixed for ever he may find many a parallel case in almadinah to quote no other three several localities claim the honour of containing the lady fatimahs mortal spoils although one might suppose that the daughter of the apostle and the mother of the imams would not be laid in an unknown grave my reasons for incredulity are the following p340 from the earliest days the shape of the apostles tomb has never been generally known in alislam for this reason it is that graves are made convex in some countries and flat in others had there been a sunnatfn82 such would not have been the case  the accounts of the learned are discrepant alsamanhudi perhaps the highest authority contradicts himself in one place he describes the coffin in another he expressly declares that he entered the hujrah when it was being repaired by kaidbey and saw in the inside three deep graves but no traces of tombsfn83 either then the mortal remains of the apostle had despite moslem superstitionfn84 mingled with the dust a probable circumstance  p341 after nearly nine hundred years interment or what is more likely they had been removed by the shiah schismatics who for centuries had charge of the sepulchrefn85  and lastly i cannot but look upon the tale of the blinding light which surrounds the apostles tomb current for ages past and still universally believed upon the authority of the attendant eunuchs who must know its falsehood as a priestly gloss intended to conceal a defect  i here conclude the subject committing it to some future and more favoured investigator in offering the above remarks i am far from wishing to throw a doubt upon an established point of history but where a suspicion of fable arises from popular facts a knowledge of man and of his manners teaches us to regard it with favouring eyefn86  fn1 others add a fourth namely the masjid altakwa at kuba fn2 the moslem divines however naïvely remind their readers that they are not to pray once in the almadinah mosque and neglect the other 999 as if absolved from the necessity of them the passage in the text merely promises 1000 blessings upon that mans devotion who prays at the prophets mosque fn3 the visitor who approaches the sepulchre as a matter of religious ceremony is called zair his conductor muzawwir whereas the pilgrim at meccah becomes a haji the imam malik disapproved of a moslems saying i have visited the prophets tomb preferring him to express himself thusi have visited the prophet others again dislike the latter formula declaring the prophet too venerable to be so visited by amr and zayd fn4 in ad 1807 they prevented ali bey the spaniard badia from entering almadinah and it appears that he had reason to congratulate himself upon escaping without severe punishment fn5 nothing in the spanish cathedrals suggests their oriental origin and the taste of the people more than the way in which they are hedged in by secular buildings fn6 the ceremony of ziyarat however begins at the bab alsalam we rode up to this gate only in order to avoid the sun fn7 haswah is a place covered with gravel ramlah one which is sanded over both are equally applicable and applied to the areas of mosques alsahn is the general word alhosh is occasionally used but is more properly applied to the courtyard of a dwellinghouse fn8 this riwak was begun about five or six years ago by abd almajid to judge from the size of the columns and the other preparations which encumber the ground this part of the building will surpass all the rest but the people of almadinah assured me that it will not be finished for some timea prophecy likely to be fulfilled by the present state of turkish finance fn9 this gate derives its peculiar name from its vicinity to the lady fatimahs tomb women when they do visit the mosque enter it through all the doors indifferently fn10 it is so called by the figure synecdoche it contains the rauzah or the prophets garden and therefore the whole portico enjoys that honoured name fn11 these carpets are swept by the eunuchs who let out the office for a certain fee to pilgrims every morning immediately after sunrise their diligence however does by no means prevent the presence of certain little parasites concerning which politeness is dumb fn12 because if not pure ablution is performed at the well in the centre of the hypaethra zairs are ordered to visit the mosque perfumed and in their best clothes and the hanafi school deems it lawful on this occasion only to wear dresses of pure silk fn13 in this mosque as in all others it is proper to enter with the right foot and to retire with the left fn14 i must warn the reader that almost every muzawwir has his own litany which descends from father to son moreover all the books differ at least as much as do the oral authorities fn15 that is to say over the world the flesh and the devil fn16 this by strangers is called the masalla shafei or the place of prayer of the shafei school it was sent from constantinople about 100 years ago by sultan sulayman the magnificent he built the sulaymaniyah minaret and has immortalised his name at almadinah as well as at meccah by the number of his donations to the shrine fn17 here is supposed to have been one of the prophets favourite stations of prayer it is commonly called the musalla hanafi because now appropriated by that school fn18 this tradition like most others referring to events posterior to the prophets death is differently given and so important are the variations that i only admire how all alislam does not follow wahhabi example and summarily consign them to oblivion some read between my dwellinghouse in the mosque and my place of prayer in the barr almanakhah is a garden of the gardens of paradise others again between my house and my pulpit is a garden of the gardens of paradise a third traditionbetween my tomb and my pulpit is a garden of the gardens of paradise and verily my pulpit is in my full cistern or upon a full cistern of the cisterns of paradise has given rise to a new superstition tara according to some commentators alludes especially to the cistern alkausar consequently this rauzah is like the black stone at meccah bona fide a bit of paradise and on the day of resurrection it shall return bodily to the place whence it came be this as it may all moslems are warned that the rauzah is a most holy spot none but the prophet and his soninlaw ali ever entered it when ceremonially impure without being guilty of deadly sin the mohammedan of the present day is especially informed that on no account must he here tell lies or even perjure himself thus the rauzah must be respected as much as the interior of the bayt allah at meccah fn19 this is a stone desk on four pillars where the muballighs or clerks recite the ikamah the call to divine service it was presented to the mosque by kaidbey the mamluk sultan of egypt fn20 i shall have something to say about this pulpit when entering into the history of the harim fn21 the afternoon prayers being farz or obligatory were recited because we feared that evening might come on before the ceremony of ziyarat visitation concluded and thus the time for alasr afternoon prayers might pass away the reader may think this rather a curious forethought in a man who like hamid never prayed except when he found the case urgent such however is the strict order and my muzawwir was right to see it executed fn22 this twobow prayer which generally is recited in honour of the mosque is here say divines addressed especially to the deity by the visitor who intends to beg the intercession of his prophet it is only just to confess that the moslems have done their best by all means in human power here as well as elsewhere to inculcate the doctrine of eternal distinction between the creature and the creator many of the maliki school however make the ceremony of ziyarat to precede the prayer to the deity fn23 the sujdah is a single prostration with the forehead touching the ground it is performed from a sitting position after the dua or supplication that concludes the twobow prayer some of the olema especially those of the shafei school permit this sujdah of thanks to be performed before the twobow prayer if the visitor have any notable reason to be grateful fn24 the candles are still sent from cairo fn25 these windows are a present from kaidbey the mamluk sultan of egypt fn26 these oil lamps are a present from the sultan fn27 the five daily liturgies are here recited by imams and every one presses to the spot on account of its peculiar sanctity fn28 in moslem theology salat from allah means mercy from the angels intercession for pardon and from mankind blessing the act of blessing the prophet is one of peculiar efficacy in a religious point of view cases are quoted of sinners being actually snatched from hell by a glorious figure the personification of the blessings which had been called down by them upon mohammeds head this most poetical idea is borrowed i believe from the ancient guebres who fabled that a mans good works assumed a beautiful female shape which stood to meet his soul when winding its way to judgment also when a moslem blesses mohammed at almadinah his sins are not written down for three daysthus allowing ample margin for repentanceby the recording angel almalakayn the two angels or kiram alkatibin the generous writers are mere personifications of the good principle and the evil principle of mans nature they are fabled to occupy each a shoulder and to keep a list of words and deeds this is certainly borrowed from a more ancient faith in hermas ii command 6 we are told that every man has two angels one of godliness the other of iniquity who endeavour to secure his allegiancea superstition seemingly founded upon the dualism of the old persians mediaeval europe which borrowed so much from the east at the time of the crusades degraded these angels into good and bad fairies for childrens stories fn29 burckhardt writes this word hedjra which means flight nor is m caussin de percevals el hadjarat less erroneous at madinah it is invariably called alhujrahthe chamber the chief difficulty in distinguishing the two words meaning chamber and flight arises from our only having one h to represent the hard and soft h of arabic  arabic text and  arabic text in the case of common saints the screen or railing round the cenotaph is called a maksurah fn30 yet mohammed enjoined his followers to frequent graveyards visit graves of a verity they shall make you think of futurity and again whoso visiteth his two parents grave or one of the two every friday he shall be written a pious child even though he might have been in the world before that a disobedient fn31 the truth is no one knows what is there i have even heard a learned persian declare that there is no wall behind the curtain which hangs so loosely that when the wind blows against it it defines the form of a block of marble or a builtup tomb i believe this to be wholly apocryphal for reasons which will presently be offered fn32 the peculiar place where the guardians of the tomb sit and confabulate is the dakkat alaghawat eunuchs bench or almaydathe tablea raised bench of stone and wood on the north side of the hujrah the remaining part of this side is partitioned off from the body of the mosque by a dwarf wall inclosing the khasafat alsultan the place where fakihs are perpetually engaged in khitmahs or perusals of the koran on behalf of the reigning sultan fn33 the ancient practice of alislam during the recitation of the following benedictions was to face meccah the back being turned towards the tomb and to form a mental image of the prophet supposing him to be in front alkirmani and other doctors prefer this as the more venerable custom but in these days it is completely exploded and the purist would probably be soundly bastinadoed by the eunuchs for attempting it fn34 this is the usual introduction to a quotation from the koran fn35 it may easily be conceived how offensive this must be to the wahhabis who consider it blasphemy to assert that a mere man can stand between the creator and the creature on the last day fn36 this is called the testification like the fatihah it is repeated at every holy place and tomb visited at almadinah fn37 burckhardt mentions that in his day among other favours supplicated in prayer to the deity the following request was madedestroy our enemies and may the torments of hellfire be their lot i never heard it at the prophets tomb as the above benediction is rather a long one the zair is allowed to shorten it a discretion but on no account to say less than peace be upon thee o apostle of allahthis being the gist of the ceremony fn38 though performing ziyarat for myself i had promised my old shaykh at cairo to recite a fatihah in his name at the prophets tomb so a double recitation fell to my lot if acting zair for another person a common custom we read even in the days of alwalid the caliph of damascus you are bound to mention your principals name at the beginning of the benediction thus peace be upon thee o apostle of allah from such an one the son of such an one who wants thine intercession and begs for pardon and mercy most zairs recite fatihahs for all their friends and relations at the tomb fn39 i have endeavoured in this translation to imitate the imperfect rhyme of the original arabic such an attempt however is full of difficulties the arabic is a language in which like italian it is almost impossible not to rhyme fn40 it will not be necessary to inform the reader more than once that all these several divisions of prayer ended with the testification and the fatihah fn41 farukthe separatora title of omar fn42 when the number of the ashab or companions was thirtynine they were suddenly joined by omar who thus became the fortieth fn43 it is said that mohammed prayed long for the conversion of omar to alislam knowing his sterling qualities and the aid he would lend to the establishment of the faith fn44 this foolish fanaticism has lost many an innocent life for the arabs on these occasions seize their sabres and cut down every persian they meet still bigoted shiahs persist in practising and applauding it and the man who can boast at shiraz of having defiled abu bakrs omars or osmans tomb becomes at once a lion and a hero i suspect that on some occasions when the people of almadinah are anxious for an avanie they get up some charge of the kind against the persians so the meccans have sometimes found these people guilty of defiling the house of allahat which infidel act a shiah would shudder as much as a sunni this style of sacrilege is we read of ancient date in arabia nafil the hijazi polluted the kilis christian church erected by abrahah of sanaa to outshine the kaabah and draw off worshippers from meccah the outrage caused the celebrated affair of the elephant see dherbelot bibl or v abrahah fn45 burckhardt with his usual accuracy asserts that a new curtain is sent when the old one is decayed or when a new sultan ascends the throne and those authors err who like maundrell declare the curtain to be removed every year the damascus caravan conveys together with its mahmil or emblem of royalty the new kiswah or garment when required for the tomb it is put on by the eunuchs who enter the baldaquin by its northern gate at night time and there is a superstitious story amongst the people that they guard their eyes with veils against the supernatural splendours which pour from the tomb the kiswah is a black purple or green brocade embroidered with white or with silver letters a piece in my possession the gift of omar effendi is a handsome silk and cotton damascus brocade with white letters worked in itmanifestly the produce of manual labour not the poor dull work of machinery it contains the formula of the moslem faith in the cursive style of the suls character seventytwo varieties of which are enumerated by calligraphists nothing can be more elegant or appropriate than its appearance the old curtain is usually distributed amongst the officers of the mosque and sold in bits to pilgrims in some distant moslem countries the possessor of such a relic would be considered a saint when treating of the history of the mosque some remarks will be offered about the origin of the curtain fn46 the place of the prophets head is i was told marked by a fine koran hung up to the curtain this volume is probably a successor to the relic formerly kept there the cufic koran belonging to osman the fourth caliph which burckhardt supposes to have perished in the conflagration which destroyed the mosque fn47 the eunuchs of the tomb have the privilege of admitting strangers in this passage are preserved the treasures of the place they are a bayt mal almuslimin or public treasury of the moslems therefore to be employed by the caliph ie the reigning sultan for the exigencies of the faith the amount is said to be enormous which i doubt fn48 and i might add never having seen one who has seen it niebuhr is utterly incorrect in his hearsay description of it it is not enclosed within iron railings for fear lest the people might surreptitiously offer worship to the ashes of the prophet the tomb is not of plain masonwork in the form of a chest nor does any one believe that it is placed within or between two other tombs in which rest the ashes of the first two caliphs the traveller appears to have lent a credulous ear to the eminent arab merchant who told him that a guard was placed over the tomb to prevent the populace scraping dirt from about it and preserving it as a relic fn49 burckhardt writes this authors name el samhoudy and in this he is followed by all our popular bookmakers moslems have three ways of spelling it 1 alsamhudi 2 alsamahnudi and 3 alsamanhudi i prefer the latter believing that the learned shaykh nur aldin ali bin abdullah alhasini or alhusayni was originally from samanhud in egypt the ancient sebennitis he died in ah 911 and was buried in the bakia cemetery fn50 burckhardt however must be in error when he says the tombs are also covered with precious stuffs and in the shape of catafalques like that of ibrahim in the great mosque of meccah the eunuchs positively declare that no one ever approaches the tomb and that he who ventured to do so would at once be blinded by the supernatural light moreover the historians of almadinah all quote tales of certain visions of the apostle directing his tomb to be cleared of dust that had fallen upon it from above in which case some man celebrated for piety and purity was let through a hole in the roof by cords down to the tomb with directions to wipe it with his beard this style of ingress is explained by another assertion of alsamanhudi quoted by burckhardt in ah 892 when kaidbey rebuilt the mosque which had been destroyed by lightning three deep graves were found in the inside full of rubbish but the author of this history who himself entered it saw no traces of tombs the original place of mohammeds tomb was ascertained with great difficulty the walls of the hujrah were then rebuilt and the iron railing placed round it which is now there fn51 upon this point authors greatly disagree ibn jubayr for instance says that abu bakrs head is opposite the apostles feet and that omars face is on a level with abu bakrs shoulder fn52 the vulgar story of the suspended coffin has been explained in two ways niebuhr supposes it to have arisen from the rude drawings sold to strangers mr william bankes giovanni finati vol ii p 289 believes that the mass of rock popularly described as hanging unsupported in the mosque of omar at jerusalem was confounded by christians who could not have seen either of these moslem shrines with the apostles tomb at almadinah fn53 some moslems end their ziyarat at the apostles tomb others instead of advancing as i did return to the apostles window pray and beg pardon for their parents and themselves and ask all they desire concluding with prayers to the almighty thence they repair to the rauzah or garden and standing at the column called after abu lubabah pray a twobow prayer there concluding with the dua or benediction upon the apostle and there repeat these words o allah thou hast said and thy word is true ‘say o lord pardon and show mercy for thou art the best of the merciful chap 23 o god verily we have heard thy word and we come for intercession to thy apostle from our own sins repenting our errors and confessing our shortcomings and transgressions o allah pity us and by the dignity of thy apostle raise our place in the heavenly kingdom o allah pardon our brothers who have preceded us in the faith then the zair prays for himself and his parents and for those he loves he should repeat allah have mercy upon thee o apostle of allah seventy times when an angel will reply allah bless thee o thou blesser then he should sit before the pulpit and mentally conceive in it the apostle surrounded by the fugitives and the auxiliaries some place the right hand upon the pulpit even as mohammed used to do the zair then returns to the column of abu lubabah and repents his sins there secondly he stands in prayer at alis pillar in front of the form and lastly he repairs to the ustuwanat alashab the companions column the fourth distant from the pulpit on the right and the third from the hujrah on the left here he prays and meditates and blesses allah and the apostle after which he proceeds to visit the rest of the holy places fn54 it is almost unnecessary to inform the reader that all moslems deny the personal suffering of christ cleaving to the heresy of the christian docetescertain beasts in the shape of men as they are called in the epistles of ignatius to the smyrneanswho believed that a phantom was crucified in our saviours place they also hold to the second coming of the lord in the flesh as a forerunner to mohammed who shall reappear shortly before the day of judgment bartema appendix 2 relates a story concerning the saviours future tomb fn55 this epithet will be explained below the reader must bear in mind that this part of the harim was formerly the house of ali and fatimah it was separated from the hujrahthe abode of mohammed and ayishahonly by a narrow brick wall with a window in it which was never shut omar bin abd alaziz enclosed it in the mosque by order of alwalid ah 90 fn56 plural of sharif a descendant of mohammed fn57 the people of the garment so called because on one occasion the apostle wrapped his cloak around himself his daughter his soninlaw and his two grandsons thereby separating them in dignity from other moslems fn58 burckhardt translates zahra bright blooming fatimah this i believe to be the literal meaning of the epithet when thus applied however it denotes virginem greek text nescientem in which state of purity the daughter of the apostle is supposed to have lived for the same reason she is called albatul the virgina title given by eastern christians to the mother of our lord the perpetual virginity of fatimah even after the motherhood is a point of orthodoxy in alislam fn59 meaning joy and gladness in the sight of true believers fn60 the prayer is now omitted in order to avoid the repetition of it when describing a visit to mount ohod fn61 the prayers usually recited here are especially in honour of abbas hasan ali called zayn alabidin osman the lady halimah the martyrs and the mothers of the moslems ie the apostles wives buried in the holy cemetery when describing a visit to albakia they will be translated at full length fn62 hujjaj is the plural of hajjpilgrims ghuzzat of ghazicrusaders and zawwar of zairvisitors to mohammeds tomb fn63 taslim is to say salam to a person fn64 the ya sin y s the 36th chapter of the koran frequently recited by those whose profession it is to say such masses for the benefit of living as well as of dead sinners most educated moslems commit it to memory fn65 or more correctly there is no ilah but allah that is there is no god but the god fn66 some zairs after praying at the caliph osmans niche leave the mosque especially when the jamaat or public worship is not being performed in the rauzah others as we did pray alone in the garden and many authors prefer this conclusion to visitation for the reason above given fn67 this has become a generic name for a well situated within the walls of a mosque fn68 as might be expected the more a man pays the higher he estimates his own dignity some indians have spent as much as 500 dollars during a first visit others have made maulids ie feasted all the poor connected with the temple with rice meat c whilst others brought rare and expensive presents for the officials such generosity however is becoming rare in these unworthy days fn69 this gate was anciently called the bab alatakah of deliverance fn70 most of these entrances have been named and renamed the bab jibrail for instance which derives its present appellation from the general belief that the archangel once passed through it is generally called in books bab aljabr the gate of repairing the broken fortunes of a friend or follower it must not be confounded with the mahbat jibrail or the window near it in the eastern wall where the archangel usually descended from heaven with the wahy or inspiration fn71 by some wonderful process the printers devil converted in the first edition this ball or cone into bull or cow fn72 belal the loudlunged crier stood we are informed by moslem historians upon a part of the roof on one of the walls of the mosque the minaret as the next chapter will show was the invention of a more tasteful age fn73 this abomination may be seen in egypt on many of the tombsthose outside the bal alnasr at cairo for instance fn74 the tale of this weeping pillar is well known some suppose it to have been buried beneath the pulpit othersthey are few in numberdeclare that it was inserted in the body of the pulpit fn75 the little domed building which figures in the native sketches and in all our prints of the almadinah mosque was taken down three or four years ago it occupied part of the centre of the square and was called kubbat alzaytdome of oil or kubbat alshamadome of candlesfrom its use as a storeroom for lamps and wax candles fn76 this is its name among the illiterate who firmly believe the palms to be descendants of trees planted there by the hands of the prophets daughter as far as i could discover the tradition has no foundation and in old times there was no garden in the hypaethral court the vulgar are in the habit of eating a certain kind of date alsayhani in the mosque and of throwing the stones about this practice is violently denounced by the olema fn77 rhamnus nabeca forsk the fruit called nabak is eaten and the leaves are used for the purpose of washing dead bodies the visitor is not forbidden to take fruit or water as presents from almadinah but it is unlawful for him to carry away earth or stones or cakes of dust made for sale to the ignorant fn78 the arabs who like all orientals are exceedingly curious about water take the trouble to weigh the produce of their wells the lighter the water the more digestible and wholesome it is considered fn79 the common phenomenon of rivers flowing underground in arabia has doubtless suggested to the people these subterraneous passages with which they connect the most distant places at almadinah amongst other tales of short cuts known only to certain badawi families a man told me of a shaft leading from his native city to hazramaut according to him it existed in the times of the prophet and was a journey of only three days fn80 the mosque library is kept in large chests near the bab alsalam the only ms of any value here is a koran written in the sulsi hand it is nearly four feet long bound in a wooden cover and padlocked so as to require from the curious a silver key fn81 so the peasants in brittany believe that napoleon the first is not yet dead the prussians expect frederick the second the swiss william tell the older english king arthur and certain modern fanatics look forward to the reappearance of joanna southcote why multiply instances in so well known a branch of the history of popular superstitions fn82 the sunnat is the custom or practice of the apostle rigidly conformed to by every good and orthodox moslem fn83 the reader will bear in mind that i am quoting from burckhardt when in alhijaz and at cairo i vainly endeavoured to buy a copy of alsamanhudi one was shown to me at almadinah unhappily it bore the word wakf bequeathed and belonged to the mosque i was scarcely allowed time to read it see p 102 ante fn84 in moslem law prophets martyrs and saints are not supposed to be dead their property therefore remains their own the olema have confounded themselves in the consideration of the prophetic state after death many declare that prophets live and pray for forty days in the tomb at the expiration of which time they are taken to the presence of their maker where they remain till the blast of israfils trumpet the common belief however leaves the bodies in the graves but no one would dare to assert that the holy ones are suffered to undergo corruption on the contrary their faces are blooming their eyes bright and blood would issue from their bodies if wounded alislam as will afterwards appear abounds in traditions of the ancient tombs of saints and martyrs when accidentally opened exposing to view corpses apparently freshly buried and it has come to pass that this fact the result of sanctity has now become an unerring indication of it a remarkable case in point is that of the late sharif ghalib the father of the present prince of meccah in his lifetime he was reviled as a wicked tyrant but some years after his death his body was found undecomposed he then became a saint and men now pray at his tomb perhaps his tyranny was no drawback to his holy reputation la brinvilliers was declared after execution by her confessor and the people generally a saintsimply i presume because of the enormity of her crimes fn85 note to third editioni have lately been assured by mohammed alhalabi shaykh alolema of damascus that he was permitted by the aghawat to pass through the goldplated door leading into the hujrah and that he saw no trace of a sepulchre fn86 i was careful to make a groundplan of the prophets mosque as burckhardt was prevented by severe illness from so doing it will give the reader a fair idea of the main point though in certain minor details it is not to be trusted some of my papers and sketches which by precaution i had placed among my medicines after cutting them into squares numbering them and rolling them carefully up were damaged by the breaking of a bottle the plan of almadinah is slightly altered from burckhardts nothing can be more ludicrous than the views of the holy city as printed in our popular works they are of the style birdseye and present a curious perspective they despise distance like the chinesepictorially audacious the harrah or ridge in the foreground appears to be 200 yards instead of three or four miles distant from the town they strip the place of its suburb almanakhah in order to show the enceinte omit the fort and the gardens north and south of the city enlarge the mosque twentyfold for dignity and make it occupy the whole centre of the city instead of a small corner in the southeast quarter they place for symmetry towers only at the angles of the walls instead of all along the curtain and gather up and press into the same field all the venerable and interesting features of the country those behind the artists back and at his sides as well as what appears in front such are the turkish lithographs at meccah some indians support themselves by depicting the holy shrines their works are a truly oriental mixture of ground plan and elevation drawn with pen and ink and brightened with the most vivid coloursgrotesque enough but less unintelligible than the more ambitious imitations of european art  p343chapter xvii  an essay towards the history of the prophets mosque  ibn abbas has informed the world that when the eighty individuals composing noahs family issued from the ark they settled at a place distant ten marches and twelve parasangsfn1 thirtysix to fortyeight miles from babel or babylon there they increased and multiplied and spread into a mighty empire at length under the rule of namrud nimrod son of kanaan canaan son of ham they lapsed from the worship of the true god a miracle dispersed them into distant parts of the earth and they were further broken up by the one primaeval language being divided into seventytwo dialects  a tribe called aulad sam bin nuh the children of shem or amalikah and amalikfn2 from their ancestor amlak bin arfakhshad bin sam bin nuh was inspired  p344with a knowledge of the arabic tonguefn3 it settled at almadinah and was the first to cultivate the ground and to plant palmtrees in course of time these people extended over the whole tract between the seas of alhijaz the red sea and aloman northwestern part of the indian ocean and they became the progenitors of the jababirahfn4 tyrants or giants of syria as well as the farainah pharaohs of egyptfn5 under these amalik such  p345was the age of man that during the space of four hundred years a bier would not be seen nor keening be heard in their cities  the last king of the amalik arkam bin alarkamfn6 was according to most authors slain by an army of the children of israel sent by moses after the exodusfn7 with orders thoroughly to purge meccah and almadinah of their infidel inhabitants all the tribe was destroyed with the exception of the women the children and a youth of the royal family whose extraordinary beauty persuaded the invaders to spare him pending a reference to the prophet when the army returned they found that moses had died during the expedition and they were received with reproaches by the people for having violated his express command the soldiers unwilling to live with their own nation under this reproach returned to alhijaz and settled there  moslem authors are agreed that after the amalik the benu israel ruled in the holy land of arabia but the learned in history are not agreed upon the cause of their emigration according to some when moses was returning from a pilgrimage to meccah a multitude of his followers seeing in almadinah the signs of the city which according to the taurat or pentateuch should hear the preaching of the last prophet settled there and were joined by many badawin of the neighbourhood who  p346conformed to the law of moses ibn shaybah also informs us that when moses and aaron were wending northwards from meccah they being in fear of certain jews settled at almadinah did not enter the cityfn8 but pitched their tents on mount ohod aaron being about to die moses dug his tomb and said brother thine hour is come turn thy face to the next world aaron entered the grave lay at full length and immediately expired upon which the jewish lawgiver covered him with earth and went his way towards the promised landfn9  abu hurayrah asserted that the benu israel after long searching settled in almadinah because when driven from palestine by the invasion of bukht alnasr nebuchadnezzar they found in their books that the last prophet would manifest himself in a town of the towns of arabiyahfn10 called zat nakhl or the place of palm trees some of the sons of aaron occupied the city other tribes settled at khaybarfn11 and in the neighbourhood  p347building utum or square flatroofed stone castles for habitation and defence they left an order to their descendants that mohammed should be favourably received but allah hardened their hearts unto their own destruction like asses they turned their backs upon allahs mercyfn12 and the consequence is that they have been rooted out of the land  the tarikh tabari declares that when bukht alnasrfn13 after destroying jerusalem attacked and slew the king of egypt who had given an asylum to a remnant of the house of israel the persecuted fugitives made their way into alhijaz settled near yasrib almadinah where they founded several towns khaybar fadak wady alsubu wady alkura kurayzah and many others it appears then by the concurrence of historians that the jews at an early time either colonised or supplanted the amalik at almadinah  at length the israelites fell away from the worship of the one god who raised up against them the arab tribes of aus and khazraj the progenitors of modern ansar both these tribes claimed a kindred origin and  p348alyaman as the land of their nativity the circumstances of their emigration are thus described the descendants of yarab bin kahtan bin shalik bin arkfakhshad bin sam bin nuh kinsmen to the amalik inhabited in prosperity the land of sabafn14 their sway extended two months journey from the dyke of marebfn15 near the modern capital of alyaman as far as syria and incredible tales are told of their hospitality and of the fertility of their land as usual their hearts were perverted by prosperity they begged allah to relieve them from the troubles of extended empire and the duties of hospitality by diminishing their possessions the consequence of their impious supplications was the wellknown flood of iram  the chief of the descendants of kahtan bin saba one of the ruling families in alyaman was one amru bin amin ma alsamafn16 called almuzaykayh from his rending in pieces every garment once worn his wife tarikah himyariah being skilled in divination foresaw the fatal event and warned her husband who unwilling to break from his tribe without an excuse contrived the following stratagem he privily ordered his adopted son an orphan  p349to dispute with him and to strike him in the face at a feast composed of the principal persons in the kingdom the disgrace of such a scene afforded him a pretext for selling off his property and followed by his thirteen sonsall borne to him by his wife tarikahand others of the tribe amru emigrated northwards the little party thus preserved from the yamanian deluge was destined by allah to become the forefathers of the auxiliaries of his chosen apostle  all the children of amru thus dispersed into different parts of arabia his eldest son salabah bin amru chose alhijaz settled at almadinah then in the hands of the impious benu israel and became the father of the aus and khazraj in course of time the new comers were made by allah an instrument of vengeance against the disobedient jews of the latter people the two tribes kurayzah and nazir claimed certain feudal rights well known to europe upon all occasions of arab marriages the aus and the khazraj after enduring this indignity for a time at length had recourse to one of their kinsmen who when the family dispersed had settled in syria abu jubaylah thus summoned marched an army to almadinah avenged the honour of his blood and destroyed the power of the jews who from that moment became mawali or clients to the arabs  for a time the tribes of aus and khazraj freed from the common enemy lived in peace and harmony at last they fell into feuds and fought with fratricidal strife until the coming of the prophet effected a reconciliation between them this did not take place however before the khazraj received at the battle of buas about ad 615 a decided defeat from the aus  it is also related to prove how almadinah was predestined to a high fate that nearly three centuries before the siege of the town by abu jubaylah the tobba  p350alasgharfn17 marched northward at the requisition of the aus and khazraj tribes in order to punish the jews or according to others at the request of the jews to revenge them upon the aus and khazraj after capturing the town he left one of his sons to govern it and marched onwards to conquer syria and alirak  suddenly informed that the people of almadinah had treacherously murdered their new prince the exasperated tobba returned and attacked the place and when his horse was killed under him he swore that he would never decamp before razing it to the ground whereupon two jewish priests kaab and assayd went over to him and informed him that it was not in the power of man to destroy the town it being preserved by allah as their books proved for the refuge of his prophet the descendant of ishmaelfn18  the tobba judaized taking four hundred of the priests with him he departed from almadinah performed pilgrimage to the kaabah of meccah which he invested with a splendid coveringfn19 and after erecting a house  p351for the expected prophet he returned to his capital in alyaman where he abolished idolatry by the ordeal of fire he treated his priestly guests with particular attention and on his deathbed he wrote the following tetrastich  i testify of ahmad that he of a truth is a prophet from allah the maker of souls be my age extended into his age i would be to him a wazir and a cousin  then sealing the paper he committed it to the charge of the high priest with a solemn injunction to deliver the letter should an opportunity offer into the hands of the great prophet and that if the day be distant the missive should be handed down from generation to generation till it reached the person to whom it was addressed the house founded by him at almadinah was committed to a priest of whose descendants was abu ayyub the ansari the first person over whose threshold the apostle passed when he ended the flight abu ayyub had also charge of the tobbas letter so that after three or four centuries it arrived at its destination  almadinah was ever well inclined to mohammed infn20  p352the early part of his career the emissaries of a tribe called the benu abd alashhal came from that town to meccah in order to make a treaty with the kuraysh and the apostle seized the opportunity of preaching alislam to them his words were seconded by ayyas bin maaz a youth of the tribe and opposed by the chiefs of the embassy who however returned home without pledging themselves to either partyfn21 shortly afterwards a body of the aus and the khazraj came to the pilgrimage of meccah when mohammed began preaching to them they recognised the person so long expected by the jews and swore to him an oath which is called in moslem history the first fealty of the steepfn22  after the six individuals who had thus pledged themselves returned to their native city the event being duly bruited abroad caused such an effect that when the next pilgrimage season came twelve or according to others forty persons led by asad bin zararah accompanied the original converts and in the same place swore the second fealty of the steep the prophet dismissed them in company with one musab bin umayr a meccan charged to teach them the koran and their religious duties which in those times consisted only of prayer and the profession of unity they arrived at almadinah on a friday and this was the first day on which the city witnessed the public devotions of the moslems  after some persecutions musab had the fortune to convert a cousin of asad bin zararah a chief of the aus saad bin maaz whose opposition had been of the fiercest he persuaded his tribe the benu abd alashhal to break  p353their idols and openly to profess alislam the next season musab having made many converts some say seventy others three hundred marched from almadinah to meccah for their pilgrimage and there induced his followers to meet the prophet at midnight upon the steep near muna mohammed preached to them their duties towards allah and himself especially insisting upon the necessity of warring down infidelity they pleaded ancient treaties with the jews of almadinah and showed apprehension lest the apostle after bringing them into disgrace with their fellows should desert them and return to the faith of his kinsmen the kuraysh mohammed smiling comforted them with the assurance that he was with them body and soul for ever upon this they asked him what would be their reward if slain he replied gardens neath which the streams flowthat is to say paradise  then in spite of the advice of alabbas mohammeds uncle who was loud in his denunciations they bade the preacher stretch out his hand and upon it swore the oath known as the great fealty of the steep after comforting them with an ayat or koranic verse which promised heaven the apostle divided his followers into twelve bodies and placing a chief at the head of eachfn23 dismissed them to their homes he rejected the offer made by one of the partynamely to slay all the idolaters present at the pilgrimagesaying that allah had favoured him with no such order for the same reason he refused their invitation to visit almadinah which was the principal object of their mission and he then took an affectionate leave of them  p354two months and a half after the events above detailed mohammed received the inspired tidings that almadinah of the hijaz was his predestined asylum in anticipation of the order for as yet the time had not been revealed he sent forward his friends among whom were omar talhah and hamzah retaining with him abu bakrfn24 and ali the particulars of the flight that eventful accident to alislam are too well known to require mention here besides which they belong rather to the category of general than of madinite history  mohammed was escorted into almadinah by one buraydat alaslami and eighty men of the same tribe who had been offered by the kuraysh a hundred camels for the capture of the fugitives but buraydat after listening to their terms accidentally entered into conversation with mohammed and no sooner did he hear the name of his interlocutor than he professed the faith of alislam he then prepared for the apostle a standard by attaching his turband to a spear and anxiously inquired what house was to be honoured by the presence of allahs chosen servant whichever replied mohammed this shecamelfn25 is ordered to show me at the last  p355haltingplace he accidentally met some of his disciples returning from a trading voyage to syria they dressed him and his companion abu bakr in white clothing which it is said caused the people of kuba to pay a mistaken reverence to the latter the moslems of almadinah were in the habit of repairing every morning to the heights near the city looking out for the apostle and when the sun waxed hot they returned home one day about noon a jew who discovered the retinue from afar suddenly warned the nearest party of ansar or auxiliaries of almadinah that the fugitive was come they snatched up their arms and hurried from their houses to meet him  mohammeds shecamel advanced to the centre of the then flourishing town of kuba there she suddenly knelt upon a place which is now consecrated ground at that time it was an open space belonging they say to abu ayyub the ansari who had a house there near the abodes of the benu amr bin auf this event happened on the first day of the week the twelfth of the month rabia alawwalfn26 june 28 ad 622 in the first year of the flight for which reason monday which also witnessed the birth the mission and the death of the prophet is an auspicious day to alislam  after halting two days in the house of kulsum bin hadmah at kuba and there laying the foundation of the  p356first mosque upon the lines where his shecamel trod the apostle was joined by ali who had remained at meccah for the purpose of returning certain trusts and deposits committed to mohammeds charge he waited three days longer on friday morning the 16th rabia alawwal ah 12nd july ad 622 about sunrise he mounted alkaswa and accompanied by a throng of armed ansar on foot and on horseback he took the way to the city at the hour of public prayerfn27 he halted in the wady or valley near kuba upon the spot where the masjid aljumah now stands performed his devotions and preached an eloquent sermon he then remounted numbers pressed forward to offer him hospitality he blessed them and bade them stand out of the way declaring that alkaswa would halt of her own accord at the predestined spot he then advanced to where the apostles pulpit now stands there the shecamel knelt and the rider exclaimed as one inspired this is our place if almighty allah please  descending from alkaswa he recited o lord cause me to alight a good alighting and thou art the best of those who cause to alight presently the camel rose unaided advanced a few steps and then according to some returning sat down upon her former seat according to others she knelt at the door of abu ayyub alansari whose abode in those days was the nearest to the haltingplace the descendant of the jewish high priest in the time of the tobbas with the apostles permission took the baggage off the camel and carried it into his house then ensued great rejoicings the abyssinians came and played with their spears the   p357maidens of the benu najjar tribe sang and beat their kettledrums and all the wives of the ansar celebrated with shrill cries of joy the auspicious event whilst the males young and old freemen and slaves shouted with effusion allahs messenger is come allahs messenger is here  mohammed caused abu ayyub and his wife to remove into the upper story contenting himself with the humbler lower rooms this was done for the greater convenience of receiving visitors without troubling the family but the master of the house was thereby rendered uncomfortable in mind his various remarks about the apostles diet and domestic habits especially his avoiding leeks onions and garlicfn28 are gravely chronicled by moslem authors  after spending seven months more or less at the house of abu ayyub mohammed now surrounded by his wives and family built close to the mosque huts for their reception the ground was sold to him by sahal and suhayl two orphans of the benu najjarfn29 a noble family of the khazraj some time afterwards one harisat bin alnuuman presented to the prophet all his houses in the vicinity of the temple in those days the habitations of the arabs were made of a framework of jarid or palm sticks covered over with a cloth of camels hair a curtain of similar stuff forming the door the more splendid had walls of unbaked brick and roofs of palm fronds plastered  p358over with mud or clay of this description were the abodes of mohammeds family most of them were built on the north and east of the mosque which had open ground on the western side and the doors looked towards the place of prayer in course of time all except abu bakrfn30 and ali were ordered to close their doors and even omar was refused the favour of having a window opening into the temple  presently the jews of almadinah offended by the conduct of abdullah bin salam their most learned priest and a descendant from the patriarch joseph who had become a convert to the moslem dispensation began to plot against mohammedfn31 they were headed by hajj bin akhtah and his brother yasir bin akhtah and were joined by many of the aus and the khazraj the events that followed this combination of the munafikun or hypocrites under their chief abdullah belong to the domain of arabian historyfn32  mohammed spent the last ten years of his life at almadinah he died on monday some say at nine am others at noon others a little after on the twelfth of rabia alawwal in the eleventh year of the hijrah when his family and companions debated where he should be buried ali advised almadinah and abu bakr ayishahs chamber  p359quoting a saying of the deceased that prophets and martyrs are always interred where they happen to die the apostle was placed it is said under the bed where he had given up the ghost by ali and the two sons of abbas who dug the grave with the life of mohammed the interest of almadinah ceases or rather is concentrated in the history of its temple since then the city has passed through the hands of the caliphs the sharifs of meccah the sultans of constantinople the wahhabis and the egyptians it has now reverted to the sultan whose government is beginning to believe that in these days when religious prestige is of little value the great khans title servant of the holy shrines is purchased at too high a price as has before been observed the turks now struggle for existence in alhijaz with a soldier ever in arrears and officers unequal to the task of managing an unruly people the pensions are but partly paidfn33 and they are not likely to increase with years it is probably a mere consideration of interest that prevents the people rising en masse  p360and reasserting the liberties of their country and i have heard from authentic sources that the wahhabis look forward to the day when a fresh crusade will enable them to purge the land of its abominations in the shape of silver and gold  the masjid alnabi or prophets mosque is the second in alislam in point of seniority and the second or according to others the first in dignity ranking with the kaabah itself it is erected around the spot where the shecamel alkaswa knelt down by the order of heaven at that time the land was a palm grove and a mirbad or place where dates are dried mohammed ordered to erect a place of worship there sent for the youths to whom it belonged and certain ansar or auxiliaries their guardians the ground was offered to him in free gift but he insisted upon purchasing it paying more than its value having caused the soil to be levelled and the trees to be felled he laid the foundation of the first mosque  in those times of primitive simplicity its walls were made of rough stone and unbaked bricks trunks of datetrees supported a palmstick roof concerning which the archangel gabriel delivered an order that it should not be higher than seven cubits the elevation of mosess temple all ornament was strictly forbidden the ansar or men of almadinah and the muhajirin or fugitives from meccah carried the building materials in their arms from the cemetery albakia near the well of ayyub north of the spot where ibrahims mosque now stands and the apostle was to be seen aiding them in their labours and reciting for their encouragement  o allah there is no good but the good of futurity then have mercy upon my ansar and muhajirin  the length of this mosque was fiftyfour cubits from north to south and sixtythree in breadth and it was hemmed in by houses on all sides save the western till the seventeenth  p361month of the new aera the congregation faced towards the northern wall after that time a fresh revelation turned them in the direction of meccah southwards on which occasion the archangel gabriel descended and miraculously opened through the hills and wilds a view of the kaabah that there might be no difficulty in ascertaining its true position  after the capture of khaybar in ah 7 the prophet and his first three successors restored the mosque but moslem historians do not consider this a second foundation mohammed laid the first brick and abu hurayrah declares that he saw him carry heaps of building materials piled up to his breast the caliphs each in the turn of his succession placed a brick close to that laid by the prophet and aided him in raising the walls altabrani relates that one of the ansar had a house adjacent which mohammed wished to make part of the place of prayer the proprietor was promised in exchange for it a home in paradise which he gently rejected pleading poverty his excuse was admitted and osman after purchasing the place for ten thousand dirhams gave it to the apostle on the long credit originally offered  this mosque was a square of a hundred cubits like the former building it had three doors one on the south side where the mihrab alnabawi or the prophets niche now is another in the place of the present bab alrahmah and the third at the bab osman now called the gate of gabriel instead of a mihrab or prayernichefn34 a large block of stone directed the congregation at first it was placed against the northern wall  p362of the mosque and it was removed to the southern when meccah became the kiblah  in the beginning the prophet whilst preaching the khutbah or friday sermon leaned when fatigued against a postfn35 the mambarfn36 or pulpit was the invention of a madinah man of the benu najjar it was a wooden frame two cubits long by one broad with three steps each one span high on the topmost of these the prophet sat when he required rest the pulpit assumed its present form about ah 90 during the artistic reign of alwalid  in this mosque mohammed spent the greater part of the dayfn37 with his companions conversing instructing and  p363comforting the poor hard by were the abodes of his wives his family and his principal friends here he prayed at the call of the azan or devotioncry from the roof here he received worldly envoys and embassies and the heavenly messages conveyed by the archangel gabriel and within a few yards of the hallowed spot he died and found a grave  the theatre of events so important to alislam could not be allowedspecially as no divine decree forbade the changeto remain in its pristine lowliness the first caliph contented himself with merely restoring some of the palm pillars which had fallen to the ground omar the second successor surrounded the hujrah or ayishahs chamber in which the prophet was buried with a mud wall and in ah 17 he enlarged the mosque to 140 cubits by 120 taking in ground on all sides except the eastern where stood the abodes of the mothers of the moslemsfn38 outside the northern wall he erected a suffah called albathaa raised bench of wood earth or stone upon which the people might recreate themselves with conversation and quoting poetry for the mosque was now becoming a place of peculiar reverence to menfn39  the second masjid was erected ah 29 by the third caliph osman who regardless of the clamours of the people overthrew the old walls and extended the building  p364greatly towards the north and a little towards the west but he did not remove the eastern limit on account of the private houses he made the roof of indian teakfn40 and the walls of hewn and carved stone these innovations caused some excitement which he allayed by quoting a tradition of the prophet with one of which he appears perpetually to have been prepared the saying in question was according to some were this my mosque extended to safaa hill in meccahit verily would still be my mosque according to others were the prophets mosque extended to zul halifahfn41 it would still be his but osmans skill in the quotation of tradition did not prevent the new building being in part a cause of his death it was finished on the first muharram ah 30  at length alislam grown splendid and powerful determined to surpass other nations in the magnificence of its public buildingsfn42 in ah 88 alwalidfn43 the first twelfth caliph of the benu ummayah race after building or rather restoring the noble jami alammawi cathedral of the ommiades at damascus determined to  p365display his liberality at almadinah the governor of the place umar bin abd alaziz was directed to buy for seven thousand dinars ducats all the hovels of raw brick that hedged in the eastern side of the old mosque they were inhabited by descendants of the prophet and of the early caliphs and in more than one case the ejection of the holy tenantry was effected with considerable difficulty some of the womenever the most obstinate on such occasionsrefused to take money and omar was forced to the objectionable measure of turning them out of doors with exposed facesfn45 in full day the greek emperor applied to by the magnificent caliph sent immense presents silver lamp chains valuable curiositiesfn46 forty loads of small cut stones for pietradura and a sum of eighty thousand dinars or as others say forty thousand miskals of gold he also despatched forty coptic and forty greek artists to carve the marble pillars and the casings of the walls and to superintend the gilding and the mosaic work one of these christians was beheaded for sculpturing a hog on the kiblah wall and another in an attempt to defile the roof fell to the ground and his brains were dashed out the remainder islamized but this did not prevent the older arabs murmuring that their mosque had been turned into a kanisah a christian idolhouse  the hujrah or chamber where by mohammeds permission azrail the angel of death separated his  p366soul from his body whilst his head was lying in the lap of ayishah his favourite wife was now for the first time taken into the mosque the rawbrick enceintefn46 which surrounded the three graves was exchanged for one of carved stone enclosed by an outer precinct with a narrow passage betweenfn47 these double walls were either without a door or had only a small blockedup wicket on the northern side and from that day ah 90 no one says alsamanhudi has been able to approach the sepulchrefn48 a minaret was erected at each corner of the mosquefn49 the building was enlarged to 200 cubits by 167 and was finished in ah 91 when alwalid the caliph visited it in state he inquired of his lieutenant why greater magnificence had not been displayed in the erection upon which omar the governor informed him  p367to his astonishment that the walls alone had cost fortyfive thousand ducatsfn50  the fourth mosque was erected in ah 191 by almahdi third prince of the benu abbas or baghdad caliphscelebrated in history only for spending enormous sums upon a pilgrimage he enlarged the building by adding ten handsome pillars of carved marble with gilt capitals on the northern side in ah 202 almaamun made further additions to this mosque it was from almahdis masjid that alhakim biamri llah the third fatimite caliph of egypt and the deity of the druze sect determined to steal the bodies of the prophet and his two companions about ah 412 he sent emissaries to almadinah the attempt however failed and the wouldbe violators of the tomb lost their lives it is generally supposed that alhakims object was to transfer the visitation to his own capital but in one so manifestly insane it is difficult to discover the spring of action two christians habited like maghrabi pilgrims in ah 550 dug a mine from a neighbouring house into the temple they were discovered beheaded and burned to ashes in relating these events the moslem historians mix up many foolish preternaturalisms with credible matter at last to prevent a recurrence of such sacrilegious attempts almalik aladil nur aldin of the baharite mamluk sultans or according to others sultan nur aldin shahid mahmud bin zangi who warned by a vision of the apostle had started for almadinah only in time to discover the two christians surrounded the holy place with a deep trench filled with molten lead by this means abu bakr and omar who had run considerable risks of their own have ever since been enabled to occupy their last homes undisturbed  in ah 654 the fifth mosque was erected in consequence of a fire which some authors attribute to a  p368volcano that broke out close to the town in terrible eruptionfn51 others with more fanaticism and less probability to the schismatic benu husayn then the guardians of the tomb on this occasion the hujrah was saved together with the old and venerable copies of the koran there deposited especially the cufic mss written by osman the third caliph the piety of three sovereigns almustasim last caliph of baghdad almuzaffar shems aldin yusuf chief of alyaman and alzahir beybars baharite sultan of egypt completed the work in ah 688 this building was enlarged and beautified by the princes of egypt and lasted upwards of two hundred years  the sixth mosque was built almost as it now stands by kaidbey nineteenth sultan of the circassian mamluk kings of egypt in ah 888 it is now therefore more than four centuries old almustasims mosque had been struck by lightning during a storm thirteen men were killed at prayers and the destroying element spared nothing but the interior of the hujrahfn52 the railing and dome were restored niches and a pulpit were sent from cairo and the gates and minarets were distributed as they are now not content with this kaidbey established wakf bequests and pensions and introduced order among the attendants on the tomb in the tenth century sultan sulayman the magnificent paved with fine white marble the rauzah or garden which kaidbey not daring to alter had left of earth and erected the fine minaret that bears his name  p369during the dominion of the later sultans and of mohammed ali a few trifling presents of lamps carpets wax candles and chandeliers and a few immaterial alterations have been made the present head of alislam is as i have before said rebuilding one of the minarets and the northern colonnade of the temple  such is the history of the mosques prosperity  during the siege of almadinah by the wahhabisfn53 the principal people seized and divided amongst themselves the treasures of the tomb which must have been considerable when the town surrendered saud accompanied by his principal officers entered the hujrah but terrified by dreams he did not penetrate behind the curtain or attempt to see the tomb he plundered however the treasures in the passage the kaukab aldurrifn54 or pearl star and the ornaments sent as presents from every part of alislam part of these he sold it is said for 150000 riyals dollars to ghalib sharif of meccah and the rest he carried with him to daraiyah his capitalfn55 an accident prevented any further desecration of the building the greedy wahhabis allured by the appearance of the golden or gilt globes and crescents surmounting the green dome attempted to throw down the latter two of their number it is said were killed by falling  p370from the slippery rooffn56 and the rest struck by superstitious fears abandoned the work of destruction they injured however the prosperity of the place by taxing the inhabitants by interrupting the annual remittances and by forbidding visitors to approach the tomb they are spoken of with abhorrence by the people who quote a peculiarly bad trait in their characters namely that in return for any small religious assistance of prayer or recitation they were in the habit of giving a few grains of gunpowder or something equally valuable instead of stonedollarsfn57  when abdullah son of saud had concluded in ad 1815 a treaty of peace with tussun pasha the egyptian general bought back from the townspeople for 10000 riyals all the golden vessels that had not been melted down and restored the treasure to its original place this i have heard denied at the same time it rests upon credible evidence amongst orientals the events of the last generation are usually speaking imperfectly remembered and the olema are well acquainted with the history of vicissitudes which took place 1200 years ago when profoundly ignorant of what their grandfathers witnessed many incredible tales also i heard concerning the present wealth of the almadinah mosque this must be expected when the exaggeration is considered likely to confer honour upon the exaggerator   the establishment attached to the almadinah mosque is greatly altered since burckhardts timefn58 the result of the increasing influence of the turkish halfbreeds  p371it is still extensive because in the first place the principle of divided labour is a favourite throughout the east and secondly because the sons of the holy cities naturally desire to extract as much as they can from the sons of other cities with the least amount of work the substance of the following account was given to me by omar effendi and i compared it with the information of others upon whom i could rely  the principal of the mosque or shaykh alharim is no longer a neuterfn59 the present is a turkish pasha osman appointed from constantinople with a salary of about 30000 piastres a month his naib or deputy is a black eunuch the chief of the aghawatfn60 upon a pay of 5000 piastres the present principal of this college is one tayfur agha a slave of esma sultanah sister to the late sultan mahmud the chief treasurer is called the mudir alharim he keeps an eye upon the khaznadar or treasurer whose salary is 2000 piastres the mustaslim is the chief of the katibs or writers who settle the  p372accounts of the mosque his pay is 1500 and under him is a nakib or assistant upon 1000 piastres there are three shaykhs of the eunuchs who receive from 700 to 1000 piastres a month each the eunuchs about a hundred and twenty in number are divided into three orders the bawwabin or porters open the doors of the mosque the khubziyah sweep the purer parts of the temple and the lowest order popularly called battalin clean away all impurities beat those found sleeping and act as beadles a duty here which involves considerable use of the cane these men receive as perquisites presents from each visitor when they offer him the usual congratulation and for other small favours such as permitting strangers to light the lampsfn61 or to sweep the floor their pay varies from 250 to 500 piastres a month they are looked upon as honourable men and are generally speaking married some of them indulging in three or four wiveswhich would have aroused juvenals bile the aghas character is curious and exceptional as his outward conformation disconnected with humanity he is cruel fierce brave and capable of any villany his frame is unnaturally long and lean especially the arms and legs with high shoulders protruding joints and a face by contrast extraordinarily large he is unusually expert in the use of weapons and sitting well home he rides to admiration his hoarse thick voice investing him with all the circumstances of command  besides the eunuchs there are a number of free servants called farrashin attached to the mosque almost all the middle and lower class of citizens belong to this order they are divided into parties of thirty each and are changed every week those on duty

almadinah who have not some official charge about the temple qualify themselves to act as muzawwirs they begin as boys to learn the formula of prayer and the conducting of visitors and partly by begging partly by boldness they often pick up a tolerable livelihood at an early age the muzawwir will often receive strangers into his house as was done to me and direct their devotions during the whole time of their stay for such service he requires a sum of money proportioned to his guests circumstances but this fee does not end the connexion if the muzawwir visit the home of his zair he expects to be treated with the utmost hospitality and to depart with a handsome present a religious visitor will often transmit to his cicerone at meccah and at almadinah yearly sums to purchase for himself a prayer at the kaabah and the prophets tomb the remittance is usually wrapped up in paper and placed in a sealed leathern bag somewhat like a portfolio upon which is worked the name of the

the angels in command uses the arabic tongue but when speaking in mercy or beneficence the deri dialect of persian fn4 these were the giants who fought against israel in palestine fn5 in this wild tradition we find a confirmation of the sound geographical opinion which makes arabia une des pepinieres du genre humain m jomard it must be remembered that the theatre of all earliest civilisation has been a fertile valley with a navigable stream like sind egypt and mesopotamia the existence of such a spot in arabia would have altered every page of her history she would then have become a centre not a source of civilisation strabos malothes river in alyaman is therefore a myth as it is the immense population of the peninsulastill thick even in the desertshas from the earliest ages been impelled by drought famine or desire of conquest to emigrate into happier regions all history mentions two main streams which took their rise in the wilds the first set to the northeast through persia mekran baluchistan sind and the afghan mountains as far as samarkand bokhara and tibet the other flowing towards the northwest passed through egypt and barbary into etruria spain the isles of the mediterranean and southern france there are two minor emigrations chronicled in history and written in the indelible characters of physiognomy and philology one of these set in an exiguous but perennial stream towards india especially malabar where mixing with the people of the country the arab merchants became the progenitors of the moplah race the other was a partial emigration also for commercial purposes to the coast of berberah in eastern africa where mixing with the galla tribes the people of hazramaut became the sires of the extensive somali and sawahil nations thus we have from arabia four different lines of emigration tending ne and se nw and sw at some future time i hope to develop this curious but somewhat obscure portion of arabian history it bears upon a most interesting subject and serves to explain by the consanguinity of races the marvellous celerity with which the faith of alislam spread from the pillars of hercules to the confines of chinaembracing

of the town migrated to the highest portions of the madinah plain on the s and e and the lands of the neighbourhood of the kuba mosque fn9 when describing ohod i shall have occasion to allude to aarons dome which occupies the highest part few authorities however believe that aaron was buried there his grave under a small stone cupola is shown over the summit of mount hor in the sinaitic peninsula and is much visited by devotees fn10 it must be remembered that many of the moslem geographers derive the word arabia from a tract of land in the neighbourhood of almadinah fn11 khaybar in hebrew is supposed to signify a castle dherbelot makes it to mean a pact or association of the jews against the moslems this fort appears to be one of the latest as well as the earliest of the hebrew settlements in alhijaz benjamin of tudela asserts that there were 50000 jews resident at their old colony bartema in ad 1703 found remnants of the people there but his account of them is disfigured by fable in niebuhrs time the beni khaybar had independent shaykhs and were divided into three tribes viz the benu masad the benu shahan and the benu anizah this latter however is a moslem name who were isolated and hated by the other jews and therefore the traveller supposes them to have been karaites in burckhardts day the race seems to have been entirely rooted out i made many inquiries and all assured me that there is not a single jewish family now in khaybar it is indeed the popular boast in alhijaz that with the exception of jeddah and perhaps yambu where the prophet never set his foot there is not a town in the country harbouring an infidel this has now become a point of fanatic honour but if history may be trusted it has become so only lately fn12 when the arabs see the ass turn

tribe of ad and to saba bin yashjab it burst according to some beneath the weight of a flood according to others it was miraculously undermined by rats a learned indian shaykh has mistaken the arabic word jurad a large kind of mouse or rat for jarad a locust and he makes the wall to have sunk under a bar i malakh or weight of locusts no event is more celebrated in the history of pagan arabia than this or more trustworthy despite the exaggeration of the detailsthe dyke is said to have been four miles long by four broadand the fantastic marvels which are said to have accompanied its bursting the

speaking a feminine name amongst the pagan arabs possibly it is here intended as a matronymic fn17 this expedition to almadinah is mentioned by all the preislamatic historians but persons and dates are involved in the greatest confusion some authors mention two different expeditions by different tobbas others only one attributing it differently however to two tobbasabu karb in the 3rd century of the christian era and tobba alasghar the last of that dynasty who reigned according to some in ad 300 according to others in ad 448 mc de perceval places the event about ad 206 and asserts that the aus and khazraj did not emigrate to almadinah before ad 300 the word tobba or tubba i have been informed by some of the modern arabs is still used in the himyaritic dialect of arabic to signify the great or the chief fn18 nothing is more remarkable in the annals of the arabs than their efforts to prove the ishmaelitic descent of mohammed at the same time no historic question is more open to doubt fn19 if this be true it proves that the jews of alhijaz had in those days superstitious reverence for the kaabah otherwise the tobba after conforming to the law of moses would not have shown it this mark of respect moreover there is a legend that the same rabbis dissuaded the tobba from plundering the sacred place when he was treacherously advised so to do by the benu hudayl arabs i have lately perused the worship of baalim in israel based upon the work of dr r dozy the israelites in mecca by dr h oort translated from the dutch and enlarged with notes and appendices by the right rev john william colenso dd longmans i see no reason why meccah or beccah should be made to mean a slaughter why the kaabah should be founded by the simeonites why the hajj should be the feast of trumpets and other assertions in which everything seems to be taken for granted except etymology which is tortured into confession if meccah had been founded by the simeonites why did the persians and the hindus respect it fn20 it is curious that abdullah mohammeds father died and was buried at almadinah and that his mother aminahs tomb is at abwa on the madinah road here too his greatgrandfather hashim married salma almutadalliyah before him espoused to uhayhah of the aus tribe shaybah generally called abd almuttalib the prophets grandfather was the son of salma and was bred at almadinah fn21 ayyas bin maaz died it is said a moslem fn22 bayat alakabat alula it is so called because this oath was sworn at a place called alakabah the mountainroad near muna a mosque was afterwards built there to commemorate the event fn23 some moslem writers suppose that mohammed singled out twelve men as apostles and called them nakil in imitation of the example of our saviour other moslems ignore both the fact and the intention mc de perceval gives the names of these nakils in vol iii p 8 fn24 orthodox moslems do not fail to quote this circumstance in honour of the first caliph upon whom moreover they bestow the title of friend of the cave the shiahs on the other hand hating abu bakr see in it a symptom of treachery and declare that the prophet feared to let the old hyena as they opprobriously term the venerable successor out of his sight for fear lest he should act as spy to the kuraysh the voice of history and of common sense is against the shiahs mc de perceval justly remarks that abu bakr and omar were men truly worthy of their great predecessor fn25 this animals name according to some was alkaswa the tips of whose ears are cropped according to others aljadaa one mutilated in the ear hand nose or lip the prophet bought her for 800 dirhams on the day before his flight from abu bakr who had fattened two fine animals of his own breeding the camel was offered as a gift but mohammed insisted upon paying its price because say the moslem casuists he being engaged in the work of god would receive no aid from man according to mc de perceval the prophet preached from the back of alkaswa the celebrated pilgrimage sermon at arafat on the 8th march ad 632 fn26 the prophet is generally supposed to have started from meccah on the first of the same month on a friday or a monday this discrepancy is supposed to arise from the fact that mohammed fled his house in meccah on a friday passed three days in the cave on jabal saur and finally left it for almadinah on monday which therefore according to moslem divines was the first day of the hijrah but the aera now commences on the 1st of the previous muharram an arrangement made seventeen years after the date of the flight by omar the caliph with the concurrence of ali fn27 the distance from kuba to almadinah is little more than three miles for which six hoursfriday prayers being about noonmay be considered an inordinately long time but our author might urge as a reason that the multitude of people upon a narrow road rendered the prophets advance a slow one and some historians relate that he spent several hours in conversation with the benu salim fn28 mohammed never would eat these strong smelling vegetables on account of his converse with the angels even as modern spiritualists refuse to smoke tobacco at the same time he allowed his followers to do so except when appearing in his presence entering a mosque or joining in public prayers the pious moslem still eats his onions with these limitations some sects however as the wahhabis considering them abominable avoid them on all occasions fn29 the name of the tribe literally means sons of a carpenter hence the error of the learned and violent humphrey prideaux corrected by sale fn30 some say that abu bakr had no abode near the mosque but it is generally agreed upon that he had many houses one in albakia another in the higher parts of almadinah and among them a hut on the spot between the present gates called salam and rahmah fn31 it is clear from the fact above stated that in those days the jews of arabia were in a state of excitement hourly expecting the advent of their messiah and that mohammed believed himself to be the person appointed to complete the law of moses fn32 in many minor details the above differs from the received accounts of preislamitic and early mohammedan history let the blame be borne by the learned shaykh abd alhakk almuhaddis of delhi and his compilation the jazb alkulub ila diyar almahhub the drawing of hearts towards the holy parts from the multitude of versions at last comes correctness fn33 a firman from the porte dated 13th february 1841 provides for the paying of these pensions regularly it being customary to send every year from egypt provisions in kind to the two holy cities the provisions and other articles whatever they may be which have up to this time been sent to this place shall continue to be sent thither formerly the holy land had immense property in egypt and indeed in all parts of alislam about thirty years ago mohammed ali pasha bought up all the wakf church property agreeing to pay for its produce which he rated at five piastres the ardeb when it was worth three times as much even that was not regularly paid the sultan has taken advantage of the present crisis to put down wakf in turkey the holy land therefore will gradually lose all its land and house property and will soon be compelled to depend entirely upon the presents of the pilgrims and the sadakah or alms which are still sent to it by the pious moslems of distant regions as might be supposed both the meccans and the madani loudly bewail their hard fates and by no means approve of the ikram the modern succedaneum for an extensive and regularly paid revenue at a future time i shall recur to this subject fn34 the prayerniche and the minaret both date their existence from the days of alwalid the builder of the third mosque at this age of their empire the moslems had travelled far and had seen art in various lands it is therefore not without a shadow of reason that the hindus charge them with having borrowed their two favourite symbols and transformed them into an arch and a tower fn35 the ustawanat alhannanah or weepingpost see page 335 chapter xvi ante fn36 as usual there are doubts about the invention of this article it was covered with cloth by the caliph osman or as others say by almuawiyah who deterred by a solar eclipse from carrying out his project of removing it to damascus placed it upon a new framework elevated six steps above the ground almahdi wished to raise the mambar six steps higher but was forbidden so to do by the imam malik the abbasides changed the pulpit and converted the prophets original seat into combs which were preserved as relics some historians declare that the original mambar was burnt with the mosque in ah 654 in ibn jubayrs time ah 580 it was customary for visitors to place their right hands upon a bit of old wood inserted into one of the pillars of the pulpit this was supposed to be a remnant of the weepingpost every sultan added some ornament to the mambar and at one time it was made of white marble covered over with a dome of the eight metals it is now a handsome structure apparently of wood painted and gilt of the usual elegant form which has been compared by some travellers with the suggesta of roman catholic churches i have been explicit about this pulpit hoping that next time the knotty question of apostolic seats comes upon the tapis our popular authors will not confound a curule chair with a moslem mambar of the latter article lane mod egyptians chap iii gave a sketch in the interior of a mosque fn37 the prophet is said to have had a dwellinghouse in the ambariyah or the western quarter of the manakhah suburb and here according to some he lodged mariyah the coptic girl as pilgrims do not usually visit the place and nothing of the original building can be now remaining i did not trouble myself about it fn38 meaning the prophets fifteen to twentyfive wives their number is not settled he left nine wives and two concubines it was this title after the koranic order chap xxxiii v 53 which rendered their widowhood eternal no arab would willingly marry a woman whom he has called mother or sister fn39 authors mention a place outside the northern wall called alsuffah which was assigned by mohammed as a habitation to houseless believers from which circumstance these paupers derived the title of ashab alsuffah companions of the sofa fn40 so i translate the arabicised word saj fn41 a place about five miles from almadinah on the meccan way see chap xiv fn42 and curious to say alislam still has the largest cathedral in the worldst sophias at constantinople next to this ranks st peters at rome thirdly i believe the jumma masjid or cathedral of the old moslem city bijapur in india the fourth is st pauls london fn43 it is to this monarch that the saracenic mosquearchitecture mainly owes its present form as will be seen he had every advantage of borrowing from christian persian and even indian art from the first he took the dome from the second the cloisterit might have been naturalised in arabia before his timeand possibly from the third the minaret and the prayerniche the latter appears to be a peculiarly hindu feature in sacred buildings intended to contain the idol and to support the lamps flowers and other offerings placed before it fn44 the reader will remember that in the sixth year of the hijrah after mohammeds marriage with zaynab his wives were secluded behind the hijab pardah or curtain a verse of the koran directed the moslems to converse with them behind this veil hence the general practice of alislam now it is considered highly disgraceful in any moslem to make a moslemah expose her face and she will frequently found a threat upon the prejudice a battle has been prevented by this means and occasionally an insurrection has been caused by it fn45 amongst which some authors enumerate the goblet and the mirror of kisra fn46 the outer wall built by alwalid remained till ah 550 when jamal aldin of isafahan wazir to nur aldin shahid mahmud bin zangi supplied its place by a grating of open sandal woodwork or as others say of iron about the same time sayyid abu l hayja sent from egypt a sheet of white brocade embroidered in red silk with the chapter ys in order to cover the inner wall this was mounted on the accession of almustazi billah the caliph after which it became the custom for every sultan to renew the offering and in ah 688 kalaun of egypt built the outer network of brass as it now is and surmounted it with the green dome fn47 the inner wall erected by alwalid seems to have resisted the fire which in ah 654 burnt the mosque to the ground also in ah 886 when the building was consumed by lightning the hujrah was spared by the devouring element fn48 after the prophets death and burial ayishah continued to occupy the same room without even a curtain between her and the tomb at last vexed by the crowds of visitors she partitioned off the hallowed spot with a wall she visited the grave unveiled as long as her father abu bakr only was placed behind the prophet but when omars corpse was added she always covered her face fn49 one of these the minaret at the babalsalam was soon afterwards overthrown by alwalids brother sulayman because it shaded the house of marwan where he lodged during his visit to almadinah in the cold season fn50 the dinar denarius was a gold piece a ducat a sequin fn51 i purpose to touch upon this event in a future chapter when describing my route from almadinah to meccah fn52 on this occasion says alsamanhudi quoted by burckhardt the interior of the hujrah was cleared and three deep graves were found in the inside full of rubbish but the author of this history who himself entered it saw no traces of tombs yet in another place he an eyewitness had declared that the coffin containing the dust of mohammed was cased with silver i repeat these details fn53 burckhardt has given a full account of this event in his history of the wahhabis fn54 see chapter xvi ante fn55 my predecessor estimates the whole treasury in those days to have been worth 300000 riyalsa small sum if we consider the length of time during which it was accumulating the chiefs of the town appropriated 1 cwt of golden vessels worth at most 50000 dollars and saud sold part of the plunder to ghalib for 100000 i was told onethird more reserving for himself about the same amount of pearls and corals burckhardt supposes that the governors of almadinah who were often independent chiefs and sometimes guardians of the tombs made occasional draughts upon the generosity of the faithful fn56 i inquired in vain about the substance that covered the dome some told me it was tinfoil others supposed it to be rivetted with green tiles fn57 the badawi calls a sound dollar kirsh hajar or riyal hajar a stone dollar fn58 at the same time his account is still carefully copied by our popular and general authors who it is presumed could easily become better informed fn59 the persians in remote times as we learn from herodotus lib 6 were waited upon by eunuchs and some attribute to them the invention ammianus marcellinus lib 14 ascribes the origin to semiramis in alislam the employment of such persons about the mosque is a bidaah or custom unknown in the time of the prophet it is said to have arisen from the following three considerations 1 these people are concentrated in their professions 2 they must see and touch strange women at the shrines and 3 the shrines are harim or sacred having adyta which are kept secret from the prying eyes of men and therefore should be served by eunuchs it is strange that the roman catholic church as well as the moslem mosque should have admitted such an abomination fn60 one of these gentry if called tawashihis generic namewould certainly insult a stranger the polite form of address to one of them is aghamasterin the plural aghawat in partibus they exact the greatest respect from men and the title of the eunuch of the tomb is worth a considerable sum to them the eunuchs of almadinah are more numerous and better paid than those of meccah they are generally the slaves of rich men at constantinople and prefer this city on account of its climate fn61 the sons of the city however are always allowed to do such service gratis if indeed they are not paid for it fn62 others told me that there were only two muftis at almadinah namely those of the hanafi and shafei schools if this be true it proves the insignificance of the followers of malik which personage like others is less known in his own town than elsewhere fn63 the hanbali school is nowhere common except in nijd and the lands eastward as far as alhasa at present it labours under a sort of imputation being supposed to have thrown out a bad offshoot the wahhabis fn64 ruasa is the plural of rais a chief or president it is the term generally applied in arabia to the captain of a vessel and in alyaman it often means a barber in virtue i presume of its rootras the head fn65 some say that the egyptian distinction between the imam khatib and the imam ratib does not obtain at almadinah  p376chapter xviii  almadinah  it is equally difficult to define politically and geographically the limits of alhijaz whilst some authors as abulfedafn1 fix its northern frontier at aylah fort alakabah and the desert making alyaman its southern limit others include in it only the tract of land lying between meccah and almadinah the country has no natural boundaries and its political limits change with every generation perhaps therefore the best distribution of its frontier would be that which includes all the property called holy land making yambu the northern and jeddah the southern extremes while a line drawn through almadinah suwayrkiyah and jabal korathe mountain of taifmight represent its eastern boundary thus alhijaz would be an irregular parallelogram about two hundred and fifty miles in length with a maximum breadth of one hundred and fifty miles   two meanings are assigned to the name of this venerated region most authorities make it mean the separator the barrier between nijd and tahamahfn2 or between alyaman and syria according to others it signifies the colligated ie by mountains it is to be observed that the people of the country especially the badawin distinguish the lowlands from the high region  p377by different names the former are called tahamat alhijazthe sea coast of alhijaz as we should say in india below the ghauts the latter is known peculiarly as alhijazfn3  madinat alnabifn4 the prophets city or as it is  p378usually called for brevity almadinah the city is situated on the borders of nijd upon the vast plateau of high land  p379 which forms central arabia the limits of the sanctuary called the hudud alharim as defined by the apostle may still serve to mark out the citys plain northwards at a distance of about three miles is jabal ohod or according to others jabal saur a hill somewhat beyond ohod these are the last ribs of the vast tertiary and primitive chinefn5 which extending from taurus to near aden and from aden again to maskat fringes the arabian trapezium to the southwest the plain is bounded by ridges of scoriaceous basalt and by a buttress of rock called jabal ayr like ohod about three miles distant from the town westward according to some authors is the mosque zulhalifah on the east there are no natural landmarks nor even artificial like the alamayn at meccah an imaginary line therefore is drawn forming an irregular circle of which the town is the centre with a diameter from ten to twelve miles such is the sanctuaryfn6 geographically considered the  p380plain is bounded on the east with a thin line of low dark hills traversed by the darb alsharki or the eastern road through alnijd to meccah southwards the plateau is open and almost perfectly level as far as the eye can see  almadinah dates its origin doubtless from ancient times and the cause of its prosperity is evident in the abundant supply of water a necessary generally scarce in arabia the formation of the plateau is in some places salt sand but usually a white chalk and a loamy clay which even by the roughest manipulation makes tolerable bricks lime also abounds the town is situated upon a gentlyshelving part of the plain the lowest portion of which to judge from the versant is at the southern base of mount ohod hence called alsafilah and the highest at the awali or plains about kuba and the east   the southern and southeastern walls of the suburb are sometimes carried away by violent sayl or torrents which after rain sweep down from the western as  p381well as from the eastern highlands the waterflow is towards alghabbah lowlands in the northern and western hills a little beyond mount ohod this basin receives the drainage of the mountains and the plain according to some absorbing it according to others collecting it till of sufficient volume to flow off to the sea water though abundant is rarely of good quality in the days of the prophet the madani consumed the produce of wells seven of which are still celebrated by the peoplefn7 historians relate that omar the second caliph provided the town with drinkingwater from the northern parts of the plains by means of an aqueduct the modern city is supplied by a source called the ayn alzarka or azure springfn8 which arises some say at the foot of mount ayr others with greater probability in the dategroves of kuba its waters were first brought to almadinah by marwan governor in almuawiyahs day it now flows down a subterraneous canal about thirty feet below the surface in places the water is exposed to the air and  p382steps lead to it for the convenience of the inhabitants this was the work of sultan sulayman the magnificent after passing through the town it turns to the northwest its course being marked by a line of circular walls breast high like the kariz of afghanistan placed at unequal distances and resembling wells it then loses itself in the nakhil or palmgroves during my stay at almadinah i always drank this water which appeared to me as the citizens declared it to be sweet and wholesomefn9 there are many wells in the town as water is found at about twenty feet below the surface of the soil few produce anything fit for drinking some being salt and others bitter as usual in the hilly countries of the east the wide beds and fiumaras even in the dry season will supply travellers for a day or two with an abundance of water filtrated through and in some cases flowing beneath the sand   the climate of the plain is celebrated for a long and comparatively speaking a rigorous winter a popular saying records the opinion of the apostle that he who patiently endures the cold of almadinah and the heat of meccah merits a reward in paradise ice is not seen in the town but may frequently be met with it is said on jabal ohod fires are lighted in the houses during winter and palsies attack those who at this season imprudently bathe in unwarmed water the fair complexions of the people prove that this account of the brumal rigours is not exaggerated chilly and violent winds from the eastern desert are much dreaded and though ohod screens the town on the north and northeast a gap in the mountains to the northwest fills the  p383air at times with raw and comfortless blasts the rains begin in october and last with considerable intervals through six months the clouds gathered by the hilltops and the trees near the town discharge themselves with violence and about the equinoxes thunderstorms are common at such times the barr almanakhah or the open space between the town and the suburbs is a sheet of water and the land near the southern and the southeastern wall of the faubourg becomes a pool rain however is not considered unhealthy here and the people unlike the meccans and the cairenes expect it with pleasure because it improves their datetrees and fruit plantationsfn10 in winter it usually rains at night in spring during the morning and in summer about evening time this is the case throughout alhijaz as explained by the poet labid in these lines which describe the desolate site of an old encampment  it the place hath been fertilised by the first spring showers of the constellations and hath been swept by the incessant torrents of the thunderclouds falling in heavy and in gentle rains from each nightcloud and heavily dropping morningcloud and the evencloud whose crashings are reechoed from around it the place hath been fertilised by the first spring showers of the constellations and hath been swept by the incessant torrents of the thunderclouds falling in heavy and in gentle rains from each nightcloud and heavily dropping morningcloud and the evencloud whose crashings are reechoed from around  and the european reader will observe that the arabs generally reckon three seasons including our autumn in their summer the hot weather at almadinah appeared to me as extreme as the hibernal cold is described to be but the air was dry and the open plain prevented the faint and stagnant sultriness which distinguishes meccah moreover though the afternoons were close the nights and the mornings were cool and dewy at this season the citizens sleep on the housetops or on the ground  p384outside their doors strangers must follow this example with considerable circumspection the open air is safe in the desert but in cities it causes to the unaccustomed violent catarrhs and febrile affections   i collect the following notes upon the diseases and medical treatment of the northern hijaz almadinah has been visited four times by the rih alasfarfn11 yellow wind or asiatic cholera which is said to have committed great ravages sometimes carrying off whole households in the rahmat alkabirah the great mercy as the worst attack is piously called whenever a man vomited he was abandoned to his fate before that he was treated with mint limejuice and copious draughts of coffee it is still the boast of almadinah that the taun or plague has never passed her frontierfn12 the judari or smallpox appears to be indigenous to the countries bordering upon the red sea we read of it there in the earliest works of the arabsfn13 and even to the present time it sometimes sweeps through arabia and the somali  p385 country with desolating violence in the town of almadinah it is fatal to children many of whom however are in these days inoculatedfn14 amongst the badawin old men die of it but adults are rarely victims either in the city or in the desert the nurse closes up the room whilst the sun is up and carefully excludes the night air believing that as the disease is hotfn15 a breath of wind will kill the patient during the hours of darkness a lighted candle or lamp is always placed by the side of the bed or the sufferer would die of madness brought on by evil spirits or fright sheeps wool is burnt in the sickroom as death would follow the inhaling of any perfume the only remedy i have heard of is pounded kohl antimony drunk in water and the same is drawn along the breadth of the eyelid to prevent blindness the diet is adas lentilsfn16 and a peculiar kind of date called tamr albirni on the twentyfirst day the patient is washed with salt and tepid water  ophthalmia is rarefn17 in the summer quotidian and  p386tertian fevers hummah salis are not uncommon and if accompanied by emetism they are frequently fatal  p387the attack generally begins with the naffazah or cold fit and is followed by alhummah the hot stage the principal remedies are cooling drinks such as sikanjabin oxymel and syrups after the fever the face and body frequently swell and indurated lumps appear on the legs and stomach there are also low fevers called simply hummah they are usually treated by burning charms in the patients room jaundice and bilious complaints are common and the former is popularly cured in a peculiar way the sick man looks into a pot full of water whilst the exorciser reciting a certain spell draws the heads of two needles from the patients ears along his eyes down his face lastly dipping them into water which at once becomes yellow others have mirayat magic mirrorsfn18 on which the patient looks and looses the complaint  p388 dysenteries frequently occur in the fruit season when the greedy arabs devour all manner of unripe  p389peaches grapes and pomegranates the popular treatment is by the actual cautery the scientific affect the use of drastics and astringent simples and the bizr alkutn cottonseed toasted pounded and drunk in warm water almost every one here as in egypt suffers more or less from haemorrhoids they are treated by dieteticseggs and leeksand by a variety of drugs myrobalans lisanalhamal arnoglossum etc but the patient looks with horror at the scissors and the knife so that they seldom succeed in obtaining a radical cure the filaria medinensis locally called farantit is no longer common at the place which gave it its european name at yambu however the people suffer much from the vena appearing in the legs the complaint is treated here as in india and in abyssinia when the tumour bursts and the worm shows it is extracted by being gradually wound round a splinter of wood hydrophobia is rare and the people have many superstitions about it they suppose that a bit of meat falls from the sky and that a dog eating it becomes mad i was assured by respectable persons that when a man is bitten they shut him up with food in a solitary chamber for four days and that if at the end of that time he still howls like a dog they expel the ghul demon from him by pouring over him boiling water mixed with ashesa certain cure i can easily believe the only description of leprosy known in alhijaz is that called albaras it appears in white patches on the skin seldom attacks any but the poorer classes and is considered incurable wounds are treated by marham or ointments especially by the balesan or balm of meccah a cloth is tied round the limb and  p390not removed till the wound heals which amongst this people of simple life generally takes place by first intention ulcers are common in alhijaz as indeed all over arabia we read of them in ancient times in ad 504 the poet and warrior amr alkays died of this dreadful disease and it is related that when mohammed abu si mohammed in ah 132 conquered alyaman with an army from alhijaz he found the people suffering from sloughing and mortifying sores so terrible to look upon that he ordered the sufferers to be burnt alive fortunately for the patients the conqueror died suddenly before his inhuman mandate was executed these sores here as in alyamanfn19 are worst when upon the shin bones they eat deep into the leg and the patient dies of fever and gangrene they are treated on first appearance by the actual cautery and when practicable by cutting off the joint the drugs popularly applied are tutiya tutty and verdigris there is no cure but rest a generous diet and change of air  by the above short account it will be seen that the arabs are no longer the most skilful physicians in the world they have however one great advantage in their practice and they are sensible enough to make free use of it as the children of almost all the respectable citizens are brought up in the desert the camp becomes to them a native village in cases of severe wounds or chronic diseases the patient is ordered off to the black tents where he lives as a badawi drinking camels milk a diet for the first three or four days highly cathartic and doing nothing this has been the practice from time immemorial in arabia whereas europe is only beginning to systematise the adhibition of air exercise and simple living and even now we are obliged to veil it under the garb of charlatanryto call it a milkcure in switzerland  p391a watercure in silesia a grapecure in france a hungercure in germany and other sensible names which act as dust in the public eyes  almadinah consists of three partsa town a fort and a suburb little smaller than the body of the place the town itself is about onethird larger than suez or nearly half the size of meccah it is a walled enclosure forming an irregular oval with four gates the bab alshami or  syrian gate in the northwest side of the enceinte leads towards jabal ohod hamzahs burialplace and the mountains in the eastern wall the bab aljumah or friday gate opens upon the nijd road and the cemetery albakia between the shami and the jumah gates towards the north is the bab alziyafah of hospitality and westwards the bab almisri egyptian opens upon the plain called the barr almanakhah the eastern and the egyptian gates are fine massive buildings with double towers close together painted with broad bands of red yellow and other colors not unlike that old entrance of the cairo citadel which opens upon the ramayliyah plain they may be compared with the gateway towers of the old norman castlesarques for instance in their shady and wellwatered interiors soldiers keep guard camelmen dispute and numerous idlers congregate to enjoy the luxuries of coolness and of companionship beyond this gate in the street leading to the mosque is the great bazar outside it lie the suk alkhuzayriyah or greengrocers market and the suk alhabbabah or the grain bazar with a fair sprinkling of coffeehouses these markets are long masses of palmleaf huts blackened in the sun and wind of a mean and squalid appearance detracting greatly from the appearance of the gates amongst them there is a little domed and whitewashed building which i was told is a sabil or public fountain in the days of the prophet the town  p392 was not walled even in alidrisis time twelfth century and as late as bartemas eighteenth century the fortifications were mounds of earth made by order of kasim aldaulat alghori who repopulated the town and provided for its inhabitants now the enceinte is in excellent condition the walls are well built of granite and lava blocks in regular layers cemented with lime they are provided with mazghal or matras long loopholes and shararif or trefoilshaped crenelles in order to secure a flanking fire semicircular towers also loopholed and crenellated are disposed in the curtain at short and irregular intervals inside the streets are what they always should be in these torrid lands deep dark and narrow in few places paveda thing to be deprecatedand generally covered with black earth well watered and trodden to hardness the most considerable lines radiate towards the mosque there are few public buildings the principal wakalahs are four in number one is the wakalat bab salam near the harim another the wakalat jabarti and two are inside the misri gate they all belong to arab citizens these caravanserais are used principally as stores rarely for dwellingplaces like those of cairo travellers therefore must hire houses at a considerable expense or pitch tents to the detriment of health and to their extreme discomfort the other public buildings are a few mean coffeehouses and an excellent bath in the harat zarawan inside the town far superior to the unclean establishments of cairo it borrows something from the luxury of stambul the houses are for the east well built flatroofed and doublestoried the materials generally used are a basaltic scoria burnt brick and palm wood the best enclose spacious courtyards and small gardens with wells where water basins and date trees gladden the owners eyes the latticed balconies first seen by the overland european traveller at malta are here common and the windows are  p393mere apertures in the wall garnished as usual in arab cities with a shutter of planking almadinah fell rapidly under the wahhabis but after their retreat it soon rose again and now it is probably as comfortable and flourishing a little city as any to be found in the east it contains between fifty and sixty streets including the alleys and culsdesac there is about the same number of harat or quarters but i have nothing to relate of them save their names within the town few houses are in a dilapidated condition the best authorities estimate the number of habitations at about 1500 within the enceinte and those in the suburb at 1000 i consider both accounts exaggerated the former might contain 800 and the manakhah perhaps 500 at the same time i must confess not to have counted them and captain sadlier in ad 1819 declares that the turks who had just made a kind of census reckoned 6000 houses and a population of 18000 souls assuming the population to be 16000 burckhardt raises it as high as 20000 of which 9000 occupy the city and 7000 the suburbs and the fort this would give a little more than twelve inhabitants to each house a fair estimate for an arab town where the abodes are large and slaves aboundfn20  the castle joins on to the northwest angle of the city enceinte and the wall of its eastern outwork is pierced for  p394a communication through a court strewed with guns and warlike apparatus between the manakhah suburb and the bab alshami or the syrian gate having been refused entrance into the fort i can describe only its exterior the outer wall resembles that of the city only its towers are more solid and the curtain appears better calculated for work inside a donjon built upon a rock bears proudly enough the banner of the crescent and the star its whitewashed walls make it a conspicuous object and guns pointed in all directions especially upon the town project from their embrasures the castle is said to contain wells bombproofs provisions and munitions of war if so it must be a kind of gibraltar to the badawin and the wahhabis the garrison consisted of a nisf urtahfn21 or half battalion four hundred men of nizam infantry commanded by a pasha his authority also extends to a sanjak or about five hundred kurdish and albanian bashbuzuks whose duty it is to escort caravans to convey treasures and to be shot at in the passes the madani who as usual with orientals take a personal pride in their castle speak of it with much exaggeration commanded by a high line of rocks on the northwest and built as it is in most places without moat glacis earthwork or outworks a few shells and a single battery of siege guns would soon render it untenable in ancient times it has more than once been held by a party at feud with the town for whose mimic battles the barr almanakhah was a fitting field northward from the fort on the road to ohod but still within fire is a long manywindowed building formerly daud pashas palace in my time it had been bought by abbas pasha of egypt  p395the suburbs lie to the south and west of the town southwards they are separated from the enceinte by a wide road called the darb aljanazah the road of biers so called because the corpses of certain schismatics who may not pass through the city are carried this way to their own cemetery near the bab aljumah or eastern gate westwards between almadinah and its faubourg lies the plain of almanakhah about threequarters of a mile long by three hundred yards broad the straggling suburbs occupy more ground than the city fronting the enceinte they are without walls towards the west where open country lies they are enclosed by mud or raw brick ramparts with little round towers all falling to decay a number of small gates lead from the suburb into the country the only large one a poor copy of the bab alnasr at cairo is the ambari or western entrance through which we passed into almadinah the suburb contains no buildings of any consequence except the khaskiyah or official residence of the muhafiz governor a plain building near the barr almanakhah and the khamsah masajid or the five mosques which every zair is expected to visit they are  the prophets mosque in the manakhah abu bakrs near the ayn alzarka alis mosque in the zukak altayyar of the manakhah some authors call this the musalla alid because the prophet here prayed the festival prayer omars mosque near the bab kuba of the manakhah and close to the little torrent called alsayh belals mosque celebrated in books i did not see it and some madani assured me that it no longer exists  a description of one of these buildings will suffice for they are all similar mohammeds mosque in the manakhah stands upon a spot formerly occupied some say by the jami ghamamah others believe it to be founded upon the musalla alnabi a place where the  p396apostle recited the first festival prayers after his arrival at almadinah and used frequently to pray and to address those of his followers who lived far from the harimfn22 or sanctuary it is a trim modern building of cut stone and lime in regular layers of parallelogramic shape surmounted by one large and four small cupolas these are all whitewashed and the principal is capped with a large crescent or rather a trident rising from a series of gilt globes the other domes crown the several corners the minaret is of the usual turkish shape with a conical roof and a single gallery for the muezzin an acaciatree or two on the eastern side and behind it a walllike line of mud houses finish the coupdoeil the interior of this building is as simple as is the exterior and here i may remark that the arabs have little idea of splendour either in their public or in their private architecture whatever strikes the travellers eye in alhijaz is always either an importation or the work of foreign artists this arises from the simple tastes of the people combined doubtless with their notable thriftiness if strangers will build for them they argue why should they build for themselves moreover they have scant inducement to lavish money upon grand edifices whenever a disturbance takes place domestic or from without the principal buildings are sure to suffer and the climate is inimical to their enduring both ground and air at almadinah as well as at meccah are damp and nitrous in winter in summer dry and torrid the lime is poor palmtimber soon decays even foreign woodwork suffers and a few years of neglect suffice to level the proudest pile with the dust  the suburbs to the south of al madinah are a collection  p397of walled villages with plantations and gardens between they are laid out in the form called here as in egypt hoshcourtyards with singlestoried tenements opening into them these enclosures contain the cattle of the inhabitants they have strong wooden doors shut at night to prevent lifting and they are capable of being stoutly defended the inhabitants of the suburb are for the most part badawi settlers and a race of schismatics who will be noticed in another chapter beyond these suburbs to the south as well as to the north and northeast lie gardens and extensive plantations of palmtrees  fn1 to the east he limits alhijaz by yamamah which some include in it nijd and the syrian desert and to the west by the red sea the greeks not without reason included it in their arabia petraea niebuhr places the southern boundary at hali a little town south of kunfudah gonfoda captain head journey from india to europe makes the village alkasr opposite the island of kotambul the limit of alhijaz to the south fn2 or according to others between alyaman and syria fn3 if you ask a badawi near meccah whence his fruit comes he will reply min alhijaz from the hijaz meaning from the mountainous part of the country about taif this would be an argument in favour of those who make the word to signify a place tied together by mountains it is notorious that the badawin are the people who best preserve the use of old and disputed words for which reason they were constantly referred to by the learned in the palmy days of moslem philology alhijaz also in this signification well describes the country a succession of ridges and mountain chains whereas such a name as the barrier would appear to be rather the work of some geographer in his study thus alnijd was so called from its high and open lands and briefly in this part of the world names are most frequently derived from some physical and material peculiarity of soil or climate fn4 amongst a people who like the arabs or the spaniards hold a plurality of names to be a sign of dignity so illustrious a spot as almadinah could not fail to be rich in nomenclature a hadis declares to almadinah belong ten names books however enumerate nearly a hundred of which a few will suffice as a specimen tabah tibah taibah tayyibah and mutayyibah from the root tib good sweet or lawful allude to the physical excellencies of almadinah as regards climatethe perfume of the prophets tomb and of the red rose which was a thorn before it blossomed by the sweat of his browand to its being free from all moral impurity such as the presence of infidels or worshippers of idols mohammed declared that he was ordered by allah to change the name of the place to tabah from yasrib or asrib the latter according to some was a proper name of a son of noah others apply it originally to a place west of mount ohod not to almadinah itself and quote the plural form of the word asarib spots abounding in palms and fountains as a proof that it does not belong exclusively to a person however this may be the inauspicious signification of yasrib whose root is sarab destruction and the notorious use of the name by the pagan arabs have combined to make it like the other heathen designation alghalabah obsolete and the pious moslem who pronounces the word is careful to purify his mouth by repeating ten times the name almadinah barah and barrah allude to its obedience and purity hasunah to its beauty khayrah and khayyarah to its goodness mahabbah habibah and mahbubah to the favour it found in the eyes of the prophet whilst jabirah jabbarah and jabarah from the root jabr joining or breaking at once denote its good influence upon the fortunes of the faithful and its evil effects upon the infidel aliman the faith is the name under which it is hinted at in the koran it is called shafiyah the healer on account of the curative effects of earth found in its neighbourhood nasirah the saving and asimah the preserving because mohammed and his companions were there secure from the fury of their foes fazihah the detector from its exposing the infidel and the hypocrite muslimah and muminah the faithful city mubarakah the blessed mahburah the

entering therein aldajjal as this personage is called will arise in the east and will peregrinate the earth but he will be unable to penetrate into meccah and on approaching jabal ohod in sight of almadinah he will turn off towards his deathplace alsham damascus in the taurat or pentateuch the town is called mukaddasah the holy or marhumah the pitied in allusion to the mission of mohammed marzukah the fed is a favourable augury of plenty to it and miskinah the poor hints that it is independent of treasure of gold or store of silver to keep up its dignity almakarr means the residence or the place of quiet makinat the firmlyfixed in the right faith alharim the sacred or inviolable and finally albalad the town and almadinah the city by excellence so an inhabitant calls himself almadani whilst the natives of other and lessfavoured madinahs affix madini to their names its titles are arzallah allahs land arz alhijrah the land of exile akkalat albuldan the eater of towns and akkalat alkura the eater of villages on account of its superiority even as meccah is entitled umm alkura the mother of villages bayt rasul allah house of allahs prophet jazirat alarab isle of the arab and harim rasul allah the sanctuary of allahs prophet in books and letters it has sometimes the title of madinah musharrafah the exalted more often that of madinah munawwarah the enlightenedscil by the lamp of faith and the column of light supposed to be based upon the prophets tomb the moslems are not the only people who lay claim to almadinah according to some authorsand the legend is more credible than at first sight it would appearthe old guebres had in arabia and persia seven large fire temples each dedicated to a planet at mahdinah as they pervert the word was an image of the moon wherefore the place was originally called the religion of the moon these guebres amongst other sacred spots claim meccah where they say saturn and the moon were conjointly venerated jerusalem the tomb of ali at najaf that of hosayn at kerbela and others these pretensions of course the moslems deny with insistance which does not prevent certain symptoms of old and decayed faith peeping out in localities where their presence if duly understood would be considered an abomination this curious fact is abundantly evident in sind and i have already alluded to it history of sind fn5 such is its formation in alhijaz fn6 within the sanctuary all muharramat or sins are forbidden but the several schools advocate different degrees of strictness the imam malik for instance allows no latrinae nearer to almadinah than jabal ayr a distance of about three miles he also forbids slaying wild animals but at the same time he specifies no punishment for the offence some do not allow the felling of trees alleging that the prophet enjoined their preservation as an ornament to the city and a pleasure to visitors alkhattabi on the contrary permits people to cut wood and this is certainly the general practice all authors strenuously forbid within the boundaries slaying man except invaders infidels and the sacrilegious drinking spirits and leading an immoral life as regards the dignity of the sanctuary there is but one opinion a number of hadis testify to its honour praise its people and threaten dreadful things to those who injure it or them it is certain that on the last day the prophet will intercede for and aid all those who die and are buried at almadinah therefore the imam malik made but one pilgrimage to meccah fearing to leave his bones in any other cemetery but albakia there is however much debate concerning the comparative sanctity of almadinah and meccah some say mohammed preferred the former blessing it as abraham did meccah moreover as a tradition declares that every mans body is drawn from the dust of the ground in which he is buried almadinah it is evident had the honour of supplying materials for the prophets person others like omar were uncertain in favour of which city to decide others openly assert the preeminence of meccah the general consensus of alislam preferring almadinah to meccah save only the bayt allah in the latter city this last is a justemilieu view by no means in favour with the inhabitants of either place in the meanwhile the meccans claim unlimited superiority over the madani the madani over the meccans fn7 these seven wells will be noticed in chapter xix post fn8 i translate alzarka azure although sir g wilkinson remarks apropos of the bahr alazrak generally translated by us the blue nile that when the arabs wish to say dark or jet black they use the word ‘azrak it is true that azrak is often applied to indeterminate dark hues but aswad not azrak is the opposite to abyaz white moreover alzarka in the feminine is applied to women with light blue eyes this would be no distinctive appellation if it signified black eyes the almost universal colour zarka of yamamah is the name of a celebrated heroine in arab story and the curious reader who wishes to see how much the west is indebted to the east even for the materials of legend will do well to peruse her short history in major prices essay or mc de percevals essai c vol i p 101 both of these writers however assert that zarkas eyes when cut out were found to contain fibres blackened by the use of kohl and they attribute to her the invention of this pigment i have often heard the legend from the arabs who declare that she painted her eyes with ismid a yellow metal of what kind i have never been able to determine although its name is everywhere known fn9 burckhardt confounds the ayn alzarka with the bir alkhatim or kuba well of whose produce the surplus only mixes with it and he complains loudly of the detestable water of madinah but he was ill at the time otherwise he would not have condemned it so strongly after eulogising the saltbitter produce of the meccan zemzem fn10 the people of nijd as wallin informs us believe that the more the palms are watered the more syrup will the fruit produce they therefore inundate the ground as often as possible at aljauf where the date is peculiarly good the trees are watered regularly every third or fourth day fn11 properly meaning the yellow wind or air the antiquity of the word and its origin are still disputed fn12 burckhardt travels in arabia vol ii informs us that in ad 1815 when meccah yambu and jeddah suffered severely from the plague almadinah and the open country between the two seaports escaped fn13 conjecture however goes a little too far when it discovers smallpox in the tayr ababil the swallow birds which according to the koran destroyed the host of abrahat alashram major price essay may be right in making ababil the plural of abilah a vesicle but it appears to me that the former is an arabic and the latter a persian word which have no connection whatever mc de perceval quoting the sirat alrasul which says that at that time smallpox first appeared in arabia ascribes the destruction of the host of alyaman to an epidemic and a violent tempest the strangest part of the story is that although it occurred at meccah about two months before mohammeds birth and therefore within the memory of many living at the time the prophet alludes to it in the koran as a miracle fn14 in alyaman we are told by niebuhr a rude form of inoculationthe mother pricking the childs arm with a thornhas been known from time immemorial my madinah friend assured me that only during the last generation this practice has been introduced amongst the badawin of alhijaz fn15 orientals divide their diseases as they do remedies and articles of diet into hot cold and temperate  fn16 this grain is cheaper than rice on the banks of the nilea fact which enlightened england now paying a hundred times its value for revalenta arabica apparently ignores fn17 herodotus euterpe has two allusions to eye disease which seems to have afflicted the egyptians from the most ancient times sesostris the great died stoneblind his successor lost his sight for ten years and the hermaic books had reason to devote a whole volume to ophthalmic disease but in the old days of idolatry the hygienic and prophylactic practices alluded to by herodotus the greater cleanliness of the people and the attention paid to the canals and drainage probably prevented this malarious disease becoming the scourge which it is now the similarity of the soil and the climate of egypt to those of upper sind and the prevalence of the complaint in both countries assist us in investigating the predisposing causes these are the nitrous and pungent nature of the soilwhat the old greek calls acrid matter exuding from the earthand the sudden transition from extreme dryness to excessive damp checking the invisible perspiration of the circumorbital parts and flying to an organ which is already weakened by the fierce glare of the sun and the fine dust raised by the khamsin or the chaliho glare and dust alone seldom cause eye disease everyone knows that ophthalmia is unknown in the desert and the people of alhijaz who live in an atmosphere of blaze and sand seldom lose their sight the egyptian usually catches ophthalmia in his childhood it begins with simple conjunctivitis caused by constitutional predisposition exposure diet and allowing the eye to be covered with swarms of flies he neglects the early symptoms and cares the less for being a cyclops as the infirmity will most probably exempt him from military service presently the sane organ becomes affected sympathetically as before simple disease of the conjunctiva passes into purulent ophthalmia the man after waiting a while will go to the doctor and show a large cicatrix in each eye the result of an ulcerated cornea physic can do nothing for him he remains blind for life he is now provided for either by living with his friends who seldom refuse him a loaf of bread or if industriously inclined by begging by acting muezzin or by engaging himself as yamaniyah or chaunter at funerals his children are thus predisposed to the paternal complaint and gradually the race becomes tendereyed most travellers have observed that imported african slaves seldom become blind either in egypt or in sind few englishmen settled in egypt lose their sight except they be medical men who cannot afford time to nurse the early symptoms the use of coffee and of water as beverages has much to do with this in the days of hard drinking our egyptian army suffered severely and the austrian army in tuscany showed how often blindness is caused by importing northern habits into southern countries many europeans in egypt wash their eyes with cold water especially after walking and some use once a day a mildly astringent or cooling wash as goulards lotion or vinegar and water they avoid letting flies settle upon their eyes and are of opinion that the evening dews are prejudicial and that sleeping with open windows lays the foundation of disease generally when leaving a hot room especially a nileboat cabin for the cold damp night air the more prudent are careful to bathe and to wipe the eyes and forehead as a preparation for change of atmosphere during my short practice in egypt i found the greatest advantage from the employment of counterirritantsblisters and pommade emetiseapplied to the temples and behind the ears native practitioners greatly err by confining their patients in dark rooms thereby injuring the general health and laying the foundation of chronic disease they are ignorant that unless the optic nerve be affected the stimulus of light is beneficial to the eye and the people by their dress favour the effects of glare and dust the tarbush no longer surrounded as of old by a huge turband is the least efficient of protectors and the comparative rarity of ophthalmic disease among the women who wear veils proves that the exposure is one of its coefficient causes fn18 this invention dates from the most ancient times and both in the east and in the west has been used by the weird brotherhood to produce the appearances of the absent and the dead to discover treasure to detect thieves to cure disease and to learn the secrets of the unknown world the hindus called it anjan and formed it by applying lampblack made of a certain root and mixed with oil to the palm of a footling child male or female the greeks used oil poured into a boys hand cornelius agrippa had a crystal mirror which material also served the counts de saint germain and cagliostro dr dees showstone was a bit of cannel

crystal ball is fresh in the memory of the present generation and most men have heard of electrobiology and the cairo magician upon this latter subject a vexed one i must venture a few remarks in the first account of the magician by mr lane we have a fair and dispassionate recital of certain magical mystical or mesmeric phenomena which excited considerable curiosity and interest throughout the civilised world as usual in such matters the civilised world was wholly ignorant of what was going on at home otherwise in london paris and new york they might have found dozens studying the science but a few years before dr herklots had described the same practice in india filling three goodly pages but he called his work qanooniislam and consequently despite its excellencies it fell stillborn from the press lady h stanhope frequently declared the spell by which the face of an absent person is thrown upon a mirror to be within the reach of the humblest and most contemptible of magicians but the civilised world did not care to believe a prophetess all however were aroused by mr lanes discovery and determined to decide the question by the ordeal of reason accordingly in ad 1844 mr lane aided by lord nugent and others discovered that a coarse and stupid fraud had been perpetrated upon him by osman effendi the scotchman in 1845 sir g wilkinson remarked of this rationalism the explanation lately offered that osman effendi was in collusion with the magician is neither fair on him nor satisfactory as he was not present when those cases occurred which were made so much of in europe and he proposed leading questions and accidents as the word of the riddle eothen attributed the whole affair to shots as schoolboys call them and ranked success under the head of paleys tentative miracles a writer in the quarterly explained them by suggesting the probability of divers impossible optical combinations and lest the part of belief should have been left unrepresented miss martineau was enabled to see clear signs of mesmeric action and by the decisive experiment of self discovered the magic to be an affair of mesmerism melancholy to relate after all this philosophy the herd of travellers at cairo is still divided in opinion about the magician some holding his performance to be all humbug others darkly hinting that there may be something in it fn19 they distinguish however between the hijaz nasur and the jurh alyamani or the yaman ulcer fn20 i afterwards received the following information from mr charles cole hbm viceconsul at jeddah a gentleman well acquainted with western arabia and having access to official information the population of almadinah is from 16000 to 18000 and the nizam troops in garrison 400 meccah contains about 45000 inhabitants yambu from 6000 to 7000 jeddah about 2500 this i think is too low and taif 8000 most of the troops are stationed at meccah and at jeddah in alhijaz there is a total force of five battalions each of which ought to contain 800 men they may amount to 3500 with 500 artillery and 4500 irregulars though the muster rolls bear 6000 the government pays in paper for all supplies even for water for the troops and the

is said to be 1000 cubits from the bab salam of the harim to this musalla  p398chapter xix  a ride to the mosque of kuba  the principal places of pious visitation in the vicinity of almadinah are the mosques of kuba the cemetery albakia and the martyr hamzahs tomb at the foot of mount ohod these the zair is directed by all the olema to visit and on the holy ground to pray allah for a blessing upon himself and upon his brethren of the faith  early one saturday morning i started for kuba with a motley crowd of devotees shaykh hamid my muzawwir was by my side mounted upon an ass more miserable than i had yet seen the boy mohammed had procured for me a meccan dromedary with splendid trappings a saddle with burnished metal peaks before and behind covered with a huge sheepskin died crimson and girthed over fine saddlebags whose enormous tassels hung almost to the ground the youth himself being too grand to ride a donkey and unable to borrow a horse preferred walking he was proud as a peacock being habited in a style somewhat resembling the plume of that gorgeous bird in the coat of many coloursyellow red and golden flowers apparently sewed on a field of bright green silkwhich cost me so dear in the harim he was armed as indeed all of us were in readiness for the badawin and he anxiously awaited opportunities of discharging his pistol our course lay from shaykh hamids house in the manakhah along and up the  p399fiumara alsayh and through the bab kuba a little gate in the suburb wall where bythebye my mounted companion was nearly trampled down by a rush of halfwild camels outside the town in this direction southward is a plain of clay mixed with chalk and here and there with sand whence protrude blocks and little ridges of basalt as far as kuba and the harrah ridge to the west the earth is sweet and makes excellent guggletsfn1 immediately outside the gate i saw a kiln where they were burning tolerable bricks shortly after leaving the suburb an indian who joined our party upon the road pointed out on the left of the way what he declared was the place of the celebrated khandak or moat the torres vedras of arabian historyfn2 presently the nakhil or palm plantations began nothing lovelier to the eye weary with hot red glare than the rich green waving crops and the cool shade the food of vision as the arabs call it and pure water to the parched throat for hours i could have sat and looked at it the air was soft and balmy a perfumed breeze strange luxury in alhijaz wandered amongst the date fronds there were fresh flowers and bright foliage in fact at midsummer every beautiful feature of spring nothing more delightful to the ear than the warbling of the small birds that sweet familiar sound the splashing of tiny cascades from the wells into the wooden troughs  p400and the musical song of the waterwheels travellersyoung travellersin the east talk of the dismal grating the mournful monotony and the melancholy creaking of these dismal machines to the veteran wanderer their sound is delightful from association reminding him of fields and watercourses and hospitable villages and plentiful crops the expatriated nubian for instance listens to the waterwheel with as deep emotion as the ranz des vaches ever excited in the hearts of switzer mercenary at naples or lochaber no more among a regiment of highlanders in the west indies the datetrees of almadinah merit their celebrity their stately columnar stems here seems higher than in other lands and their lower fronds are allowed to tremble in the breeze without mutilationfn3 these enormous palms were loaded with ripening fruits and the clusters carefully tied up must often have weighed upwards of eighty pounds they hung down between the lower branches by a bright yellow stem as thick as a mans ankle books enumerate a hundred and thirtynine varieties of trees of these between sixty and seventy are well known and each is distinguished as usual among arabs by its peculiar name the best kind is alshelebi it is packed in skins or in flat round boxes covered with paper somewhat in the manner of french prunes and sent as presents to the remotest parts of the moslem worldfn4 the fruit is about two inches long with a small stone  p401and has a peculiar aromatic flavour and smell it is seldom eaten by the citizens on account of the price which varies from two to ten piastres the pound the tree moreover is rare and is said to be not so productive as the other species the ajwahfn5 date is eaten but not sold because a tradition of the prophet declares that whoso breaketh his fast every day with six or seven of these fruits need fear neither poison nor magic the third kind alhilwah also a large date derives a name from its exceeding sweetness of this palm the moslems relate that the prophet planted a stone which in a few minutes grew up and bore fruit next comes albirni of which was said it causeth sickness to depart and there is no sickness in it the wahshi on one occasion bent its head and salamed to mohammed as he ate its fruit for which reason even now its lofty tuft turns earthwards the sayhani crier is so called because when the founder of alislam holding alis hand happened to pass beneath it cried this is mohammed the prince of prophets and this is ali the prince of the pious and the progenitor of the immaculate imamsfn6 of course the descendants of so intelligent a vegetable hold high rank in the kingdom of palms and the vulgar were in the habit of eating the sayhani and of throwing the stones about the harim the khuzayriyah is thus named because it preserves its green colour even when ripe it is dried and preserved as a curiosity the jabali is the common fruit the poorest kinds are the laun and  p402the hilayah costing from four to seven piastres per muddfn7  i cannot say that the dates of almadinah are finer than those of meccah although it is highly heretical to hold such tenet the produce of the former city was the favourite food of the prophet who invariably broke his fast with it a circumstance which invests it with a certain degree of relicsanctity the citizens delight in speaking of dates as an irishman does of potatoes with a manner of familiar fondness they eat them for medicine as well as for food rutab or wet dates being held to be the most saving as it is doubtless the most savoury of remedies the fruit is prepared in a great variety of ways the favourite dish is a broil with clarified butter extremely distasteful to the european palate the date is also left upon the tree to dry and then called balah this is eaten at dessert as the nukliyatthe quatre mendiants of persia amongst peculiar preparations must be mentioned the kulladat alshamfn8 necklace of sham the unripe fruit is dipped in boiling water to preserve its gamboge colour strung upon a thick thread and hung out in the air to dry these strings are worn all over alhijaz as necklaces by children who seldom fail to munch the ornament when not in fear of slappings and they are sent as presents to distant countries  p403january and february are the time for the masculationfn9 of the palm the nakhwali as he is called opens the female flower and having inserted the inverted male blossom binds them together this operation is performed as in egypt upon each clusterfn10 the fruit is ripe about the middle of may and the gathering of it forms the arabs vendemmia the people make merry the more readily because their favourite diet is liable to a variety of accidents droughts injure the tree locusts destroy the produce and the date crop like most productions which men are imprudent enough to adopt singly as the staff of life is often subject to complete failure  one of the reasons for the excellence of madinah dates is the quantity of water they obtain each garden or field has its well and even in the hottest weather the persian wheel floods the soil every third day it has been observed that the datetree can live in dry and barren spots but it loves the beds of streams and places where moisture is procurable the palms scattered over the other parts of the plain and depending solely upon rain water produce less fruit and that too of an inferior quality   verdure is not usually wholesome in arabia yet invalids leave the close atmosphere of almadinah to seek health under the cool shades of kuba the gardens are divided by what might almost be called lanes long narrow lines with tall reed fences on both sides the graceful branches of the tamarisk pearled with manna and cottoned over with dew and the broad leaves of the castor plant glistening in the sun protected us from the morning  p404rays the ground on both sides of the way was sunken the earth being disposed in heaps at the foot of the fences an arrangement which facilitates irrigation by giving a fall to the water and in some cases affords a richer soil than the surface this part of the madinah plain however being higher than the rest is less subject to the disease of salt and nitre on the way here and there the earth crumbles and looks dark under the dew of morning but nowhere has it broken out into that glittering efflorescence which denotes the last stage of the attack the fields and gardens are divided into small oblongs separated from one another by little ridges of mould which form diminutive watercourses of the cereals there are luxuriant maize wheat and barley but the latter two are in small quantities here and there patches of barsim or egyptian clover glitter brightly in the sunbeams the principal vegetables are badanjan eggplant the bamiyah a kind of esculent hibiscus called bhendi in india and mulukhiyah corchoris olitorius a mucilaginous spinage common throughout this part of the east these three are eaten by citizens of every rank they are in fact the potatoes and the greens of arabia i remarked also onions and leeks in fair quantities a few beds of carrots and beans some fijl radishes lift turnips gourds cucumbers and similar plants fruit trees abound there are five descriptions of vines the best of which is alsharifi a long white grape of a flavour somewhat resembling the produce of tuscanyfn11 next to it and very similar is albirni the hijazi is a round fruit sweet but insipid which is also the reproach of the sawadi or black grape and lastly the raziki is a small white fruit with a diminutive stone the nebek lote  p405or jujube is here a fine large tree with a dark green leaf roundish and polished like the olive it is armed with a short curved and sharp thornfn12 and bears a pale strawcoloured berry about the size of the gooseberry with red streaks on the side next the sun little can be said in favour of the fruit which has been compared successively by disappointed lotus eatersfn13 to a bad plum an unripe cherry and an insipid apple it is however a favourite with the people of almadinah who have reckoned many varieties of the fruit hindi indian baladi native tamri datelike and others there are a few peaches hard like the egyptian and almost tasteless fit only for stewing but greedily eaten in a halfripe state large coarse bananas lime trees a few watermelons figs and apples but neither apricots nor pearsfn14 there are three kinds of pomegranates the best is the shami syrian it is red outside very sweet and costs one piastre the turki is large and of a white colour and the misri has a greenish rind and a somewhat subacid and harsh flavour the latter are sold at onefourth the price of the best i never saw in the east except at meccah finer fruits than the shami almost stoneless like those of maskat they are delicately perfumed and as large as an infants head almadinah is celebrated like taif for its rubb rumman a thick pomegranate syrup drunk  p406with water during the hot weather and esteemed cooling and wholesome  after threading our way through the gardens an operation requiring less time than to describe them we saw peeping through the groves kubas simple minaret then we came in sight of a confused heap of huts and dwellinghouses chapels and towers with trees between and foul lanes heaps of rubbish and barking dogsthe usual material of a hijazi village having dismounted we gave our animals in charge of a dozen infant badawin the produce of the peasant gardeners who shouted bakhshish the moment they saw us to this they were urged by their mothers and i willingly parted with a few paras for the purpose of establishing an intercourse with fellowcreatures so fearfully and wonderfully resembling the tailless baboon their bodies unlike those of egyptian children were slimfn15 and straight but their ribs stood out with curious distinctness the colour of the skin was that oily lampblack seen upon the face of a european sweep and the elflocks thatching the cocoanut heads had been stained by the sun wind and rain to that reddishbrown hue which hindu romances have appropriated to their rakshasas or demons each anatomy carried in his arms a starknaked miniature of himself fiercelooking babies with faces all eyes and the strong little wretches were still able to extend the right hand and exert their lungs with direful clamour their mothers were fit progenitors for such progeny long gaunt with emaciated limbs wallsided highshouldered and straightbacked with pendulous bosoms spiderlike arms and splay feet their long elflocks wrinkled faces and high cheekbones their lips darker than the epidermis hollow staring eyes sparkling as if to light up the extreme  p407ugliness around and voices screaming as though in a perennial rage invested them with all the charms of sycorax these houris of jahannam were habited in long nightgowns dyed blue to conceal want of washing and the squalid children had about a yard of the same material wrapped round their waists for all toilette this is not an overdrawn portrait of the farmer race of arabs the most despised by their fellowcountrymen and the most hardfavoured morally as well as physically of all the breed  before entering the mosque of alkubafn16 it will be necessary to call to mind some passages of its past history when the apostles shecamel alkaswa as he was approaching almadinah after the flight from meccah knelt down here he desired his companions to mount the animal abu bakr and omarfn17 did so still she sat upon the ground but when ali obeyed the order she arose the apostle bade him loose her halter for she was directed by allah and the mosque walls were built upon the line over which she trod it was the first place of public prayer in alislam mohammed laid the first brick and with an anzah or ironshod javelin marked out the direction of prayerfn18 each of his successors followed his example according to most historians the  p408land belonged to abu ayyub the ansari the apostles host for which reason the bayt ayyub his descendants still perform the service of the mosque keep the key and share with the bawwabs or porters the alms and fees here offered by the faithful others declared that the ground was the property of one linah a woman who was in the habit of tethering her ass therefn19 the apostle used to visit it every saturdayfn20 on foot and always made a point of praying the dawnprayer there on the 17th ramazanfn21 a number of traditions testify to its dignity of these two are especially significant the first assures all moslems that a prayer at kuba is equal to a lesser pilgrimage at meccah in religious efficacy and the second declares that such devotion is more acceptable to the deity than prostrations at the bayt almukuddas jerusalem moreover sundry miracles took place here and a verset of the koran descended from heaven for which reasons the mosque was much respected by omar who once finding it empty swept it himself with a broom of thorns and expressed his wonder at the lukewarmness of moslem piety it was originally a square building of very small size osman enlarged it in the direction of the minaret making it sixtysix cubits each way it is no longer mean and decayed as in burckhardts time the sultan abd alhamid father of  p409the sultan mahmud erected a minaret of turkish shape and a neat structure of cut stone whose crenelles make it look more like a place of defence than of prayer it has however no pretensions to grandeur to the south a small and narrow riwak porch with unpretending columns looks out northwards upon a little open area simply sanded over and this is the whole building  the large mastabah or stone bench at the entrance of the mosque was crowded with sitting people we therefore lost no time after ablution and the niyat the intention peculiar to this visitation in ascending the steps in pulling off our slippers and in entering the sacred building we stood upon the musalla alnabi the prophets place of prayerfn22 after shaykh nur and hamid had forcibly cleared that auspicious spot of a devout indian and had spread a rug upon the dirty matting we performed a twobow prayer in font of a pillar into which a diminutive marble mihrab or niche had been inserted by way of memento then came the dua or supplication which was as follows  o allah bless and preserve and increase and perpetuate and benefit and be propitious to our lord mohammed and to his family and to his companions and be thou their preserver o allah this is the mosque kuba and the place of the prophets prayers o allah pardon our sins and veil our faults and place not over us one who feareth not thee and who pitieth not us and pardon us and the true believers men and women the quick of them and the dead for verily thou o lord art the hearer the near to us the answerer of our supplications after which we recited the testification and the fatihah and we drew our palms as usual down our faces  we then moved away to the southeastern corner of the edifice and stood before a mihrab in the southern wall  p410it is called takat alkashf or niche of disclosure by those who believe that as the prophet was standing undecided about the direction of meccah the archangel gabriel removed all obstructions to his vision there again we went through the twobow prayer the supplication the testification and the fatihah under difficulties for people mobbed us excessively during our devotions i vainly attempted to decipher a cufic inscription fixed in the wall above and on the right of the mihrabmy regret however at this failure was transitory the character not being of an ancient date then we left the riwak and despite the morning sun which shone fiercely with a sickly heat we went to the open area where stands the mabrak alnakah or the place of kneeling of the shedromedaryfb23 this the exact spot where alkaswa sat down is covered with a diminutive dome of cut stone supported by four stone pillars the building is about eight feet high and a little less in length and in breadth it has the appearance of being modern on the floor which was raised by steps above the level of the ground lay as usual a bit of dirty matting upon which we again went through the ceremonies above detailed  then issuing from the canopy into the sun a little outside the riwak and close to the mabrak we prayed upon the makan alayatfn24 or the place of signs here was revealed to mohammed a passage in the koran especially alluding to the purity of the place and of the people of kuba a temple founded in purity from its first day and again there live men who love to be  p411cleansed and verily allah delights in the clean the prophet exclaimed in admiration o ye sons of amr what have ye done to deserve all this praise and beneficence when the people offered him an explanation of their personal cleanliness which i do not care to repeat the temple of kuba from that day took a fresh titlemasjid altakwa or the mosque of piety  having finished our prayers and ceremonies at the mosque of piety we fought our way out through a crowd of importunate beggars and turning a few paces to the left halted near a small chapel adjoining the southwest angle of the larger temple we there stood at a grated window in the western wall and recited a supplication looking the while reverently at a dark dwarf archway under which the lady fatimah used to sit grinding grain in a handmill the mosque in consequence bears the name of sittna fatimah a surlylooking khadim or guardian stood at the door demanding a dollar in the most authoritative arab tonewe therefore did not enter  at almadinah and at meccah the travellers hand must be perpetually in his pouch no stranger in paris or in london is more surely or more severely taken in already i began to fear that my eighty pounds would not suffice for all the expenses of sightseeing and the apprehension was justified by the sequel my only friend was the boy mohammed who displayed a fiery economy that brought him into considerable disrepute with his countrymen they saw with emotion that he was preaching parsimony to me solely that i might have more money to spend at meccah under his auspices this being palpably the case i threw all the blame of penuriousness upon the young machiavels shoulders and resolved as he had taken charge of my finances at almadinah so at meccah to administer them myself   after praying at the window to the great disgust of the khadim who openly asserted that we were low  p412fellows we passed through some lanes lined with beggars and badawi children till we came to a third little mosque situated due south of the larger one this is called the masjid arafat and is erected upon a mound also named tall arafat because on one occasion the prophet being unable to visit the holy mountain at the pilgrimage season stood there saw through the intervening space and in spirit performed the ceremony here also we looked into a window instead of opening the door with a silver key and the mesquin appearance of all within prevented my regretting the necessity of economy in india or in sind every village would have a better mosque our last visit was to a fourth chapel the masjid ali so termed because the apostles soninlaw had a house upon this spotfn25 after praying thereand terribly hot the little hole waswe repaired to the last place of visitation at kubaa large deep well called the bir alaris in a garden to the west of the mosque of piety with a little oratory adjoining it a persian wheel was going drowsily round and the cool water fell into a tiny pool whence it whirled and bubbled away in childish mimicry of a river the music sounded sweet in my ears i stubbornly refused to do any more prayingthough shaykh hamid for forms sake reiterated with parental emphasis how very wrong it wasand i sat down as the prophet himself did not disdain to do with the resolution of enjoying on the brink of the well a few moments of unwonted kayf the heat was overpowering though it was only nine oclock the sound of the stream was soothing that waterwheel was creaking a lullaby and the limes and pomegranates gently rustling shed voluptuous fragrance through the morning air i fell asleep andwondrous the contrastdreamed that i was once more standing  by the wall whereon hangeth the crucified vine  p413looking upon the valley of the lianne with its glaucous seas and grey skies and banks here and there white with snow  the bir alarisfn26 so called after a jew of almadinah is one which the apostle delighted to visit he would sit upon its brink with his bare legs hanging over the side and his companions used to imitate his example this practice caused a sad disaster in the sixth year of his caliphate osman according to abulfeda and yakut dropped from his finger the prophetic ring which engraved in three lines with mohammedapostleof allah had served to seal the letters sent to neighbouring kings and had descended to the first three successorsfn27 the precious article was not recovered after three days search and the well was thenceforward called bir alkhatimof the seal ring it is also called the bir altaflatof salivafn28because the prophet honoured it by expectoration as bythebye he seems to have done to almost all the wells in almadinah the effect of the operation upon the bir alaris says the historians was to sweeten the water which before was salt their testimony however did not prevent my detecting a pronounced medicinal taste in the lukewarm draught drawn for me by shaykh hamid in mohammeds days the total number of wells is recorded to  p414 have been twenty most of them have long since disappeared but there still remain seven whose waters were drunk by the prophet and which in consequence the zair is directed to visitfn29 they are known by the classical title of saba abar or the seven wells and their names are included in this couplet  aris and ghars and rumah and buzaat and busat with bayruha and ihnfn30  p415after my sleep which was allowed to last until a pipe or two of latakia had gone round the party we remounted our animals returning towards almadinah my companions pointed out to me on the left of the village a garden called almadshuniyah it contains a quarry of the yellow loam or boleearth called by the arabs tafl by the persians gilisarshui and by the sindians metu it is used as soap in many parts of the east and mixed with oil it is supposed to cool the body and to render the skin fresh and supple it is related that the prophet cured a badawi of the benu haris tribe of fever by washing him with a pot of tafl dissolved in water and hence the earth of almadinah derived its healing fame as far as i could learn from the madani this clay is no longer valued by them either medicinally or cosmetically the only use they could mention was its being eaten by the fair sex when in the peculiar state described by chlorosis   fn1 the baradiyah or gugglets of almadinah are large and heavy of a reddishgrey colour and celebrated for cooling water a property not possessed by those of meccan fabric fn2 i afterwards found reason to doubt this location ibn jubayr 12th century places it an arrowshot from the westward wall of almadinah and seems to have seen it mc de perceval states i know not upon whose authority that it was dug to protect the northwest the north and the northeastern sides of the town this is rendered highly improbable by the features of the ground the learned are generally agreed that all traces of the moat had disappeared before our 15th century fn3 in egypt the lower branches of the date are lopped off about christmas time to increase the flavour of the fruit and the people believe that without this taklim as it is called the tree would die in upper egypt however as at almadinah the fronds are left untouched fn4 the visitor from almadinah would be badly received by the women of his family if he did not present them on his return with a few boxes of dates some strings of the same fruit and skins full of henna powder even the olema allow such articles to be carried away although they strictly forbid keepsakes of earth or stone fn5 this fruit must not be confounded with the enucleated conserve of dates which in arabia as in egypt is known by the name of ajwah the arabs infinitely despise the stuff sold at alexandria and cairo declaring that it is fit only for cows the ajwah of the oases particularly of siwah is of excellent quality fn6 so in ad 1272 the crucifix spoke to st thomas aquinas superstitions are of no age or country fn7 at almadinah 12 dirhamsdramsmake 1 wukkiyah ounce 20 wukkiyah1 ratl

they derive this name from the place where they are made alsafra on the meccah road being also called alsham damascus fn9 this is a translation of the arab word tazkir which is certainly more appropriate than our caprification applied to dates fn10 the male tree is known by its sterility in some countries only the fecundating pollen is scattered over the female flower and this doubtless must have been natures method of impregnating the date fn11 the resemblance is probably produced by the similarity of treatment at almadinah as in italy the vine is married to some tall tree which selfish as a husband appropriates to itself the best of everythingsun breeze and rain fn12 this thorn the rhamnus nabeca or zizyphus spina christi is supposed to be that which crowned the saviours head there are mimosas in syria but no tree save the fabled zakhum could produce the terrible apparatus with which certain french painters of the modern school have attempted to heighten the terrors of the scene fn13 for what reason i am entirely unable to guess our dictionaries translate the word sidr the literary name of the tree that bears the nebek lotetree no wonder that believers in homeric writ feel their anger aroused by so poor a realisation of the beautiful myth fn14 the only pears in alhijaz i believe are to be found at taif to which place they were transplanted from egypt fn15 travellers always remark the curious potbellied children on the banks of the nile this conformation is admired by the egyptians who consider it a sign of strength and a promise of fine growth fn16 i believe kuba to be about three miles sse of almadinah but alidrisi ibn haukal and ibn jubayr all agree in saying two miles fn17 osman the fourth companion was absent at this time not having returned from the first or little flight to abyssinia fn18 some believe that in this mosque the direction of prayer was altered from jerusalem to meccah and they declare as will presently be seen that the archangel gabriel himself pointed out the new line mc de perceval forgets his usual accuracy when he asserts le mihrab de la mosquee de medine qui fut dabord place au nord fut transfere au midi et la mosquee prit le nom de ‘masjidelkiblatayn mosquee des deux kiblah in the first place the mihrab is the invention of a later date about ninety years and secondly the title of alkiblatyn is never now given to the mosque of almadinah fn19 this degrading report caused certain hypocrites to build a kind of rival chapel called the mosque zarar it was burnt to the ground shortly after its erection and all known of it is that it stood near kuba fn20 some say on monday probably because on that day mohammed alighted at kuba but the present practice of alislam handed down from generation to generation is to visit it on the saturday fn21 there is on this day at kuba a regular ziyarat or visitation the people pray in the harim of almadinah after which they repair to the kuba mosque and go through the ceremonies which in religious efficacy equal an umrah or lesser pilgrimage in books i have read that the 15th of ramazan is the proper day fn22 this is believed to be the spot where the prophet performed his first rukat or prayerbow fn23 mabrak is the locative noun from the triliteral root barakahe blessed or he the camel knelt upon the ground perhaps this philological connection may have determined mohammed to consider the kneeling of the dromedary a sign that allah had blessed the spot fn24 ayat here means a verset of the koran some authors apply the above quoted lines to the prophets mosque at almadinah exclusively others to both buildings fn25 ibn jubayr informs us that abu bakr ayishah and omar had habitations at kuba fn26 some authors mention a second bir alaris belonging in part to the caliph osman according to yakut aris is the hebrew or syriac word for a peasant he quotes the plural form arisun and ararisah fn27 others assert with less probability that the article in question was lost by one maakah a favourite of osman as that illfated caliphs troubles began at the time of this accident the ring is generally compared to solomons our popular authors who assert that mohammed himself lost the ring are greatly in error fn28 according to some authors mohammed drew a bucket of water drank part of the contents spat into the rest and poured it back into the well which instantly became sweet ibn jubayr applies the epithet bir altaflat peculiarly to the aris well many other authors are not so exact fn29 the pious perform the lesser ablution upon the brink of the seven wells and drink of the remnant of the water in tabarruk or to secure the blessings of god fn30 some alter the 3rd the 5th and the 7th names to bir alnabi a well in the kuba gardens bir alghurbal and bir alfukayyir where the prophet together with salman the persian and others of his companions planted date trees the bir alaris has already been described the bir alghars gharas or ghurs so called it is said from the place where it was sunk about half a mile ne of the kuba mosque is a large well with an abundance of water mohammed used to perform ablution on its brink and directed ali to wash his corpse with seven skins full of the water the bir rumah is a large well with a spring at the bottom dug in the wady alakik to the north of the mosque alkiblatayn it is called kalib mazni the old well of mazni in this tradition the best of old wells is the old well of mazni and ancient it must be if the legend say true that when abu karb besieged almadinah ad 495 he was relieved of sickness by drinking its produce some assert that it afforded the only sweet water in almadinah when the prophet arrived there the town becoming crowded by an influx of visitors this water was sold by its owner a man of the benu ghaffar tribe or according to others by one mazni a jew osman at last bought it by paying upwards of 100 camels the bir buzaat or bizaat or bisaat is in the nakhil or palm plantations outside the bab alshami or northwestern gate of almadinah on the right of the road leading to ohod whoever washes in its waters three times shall be healed the bir busat is near the bakia cemetery on the left of the road leading to kuba the prophet used to bathe in the water and he declared it healthy to the skin the bir bayruha under whose trees the prophet was fond of sitting lies outside the bab dar alziyafah leading to mount ohod the kamus gives the word bayruha upon the measure of fayluha some authorities upon the subject of ziyarat write bayruha bir hathe well of ha and variously suppose ha to be the name of a man a woman or a place yahut mentions other pronunciations bariha bariha bayriha c the bir ihn is in a large garden e of kuba little is said in books about this well and the people of almadinah do not know the name  p416chapter xx  the visitation of hamzahs tomb  on the morning of sunday the twentythird zul kaadah 28th august 1853 arrived from alsham or damascusfn1 the great caravan popularly called hajj alshami the damascus pilgrimage as the egyptian cafila is almisrifn2 or the cairo pilgrimage it is the main stream which carries off all the small currents that at this season of general movement flow from central asia towards the great centre of the islamitic world and in 1853 it amounted to about seven thousand souls the arrival was anxiously expected by the people for several reasons in the first place it brought with it a new curtain for the prophets hujrah the old one being in a tattered condition secondly it had charge of the annual stipends and pensions of the citizens and thirdly many families expected members returning under its escort to their homes the popular anxiety was greatly increased by the disordered state of the country round about and moreover the great caravan had been one day late generally arriving on the morning of the twentysecond zul kaadahfn3  p417during the night three of shaykh hamids brothers who had entered as muzawwirs with the hajj came suddenly to the house they leaped off their camels and lost not a moment in going through the usual scene of kissing embracing and weeping bitterly for joy i arose in the morning and looked out from the windows of the majlis the barr almanakhah from a dusty waste dotted with a few badawi hairtents had assumed all the various shapes and the colours of a kaleidoscope the eye was bewildered by the shifting of innumerable details in all parts totally different from one another thrown confusedly together in one small field and however jaded with sightseeing it dwelt with delight upon the variety the vivacity and the intense picturesqueness of the scene in one night had sprung up a town of tents of every size colour and shape round square and oblong open and closedfrom the shawllined and gilttopped pavilion of the pasha with all the luxurious appurtenances of the harim to its neighbour the little dirty green rowtie of the tobaccoseller they were pitched in admirable order here ranged in a long line  p418where a street was required there packed in dense masses where thoroughfares were unnecessary but how describe the utter confusion in the crowding the bustling and the vast variety and volume of sound huge white syrian dromedaries compared with which those of alhijaz appeared mere ponycamels jingling large bells and bearing shugdufsfn4 litters like miniature green tents swaying and tossing upon their backs gorgeous takhtrawan or litters carried between camels or mules with scarlet and brass trappings badawin bestriding nakedbacked dalulsfn5 dromedaries and clinging like apes to the hairy humps arnaut kurd and turkish irregular cavalry fiercer looking in their mirth than roman peasants in their rage fainting persian pilgrims forcing their stubborn camels to kneel or dismounted grumbling from jaded donkeys kahwajis sherbet sellers and ambulant tobacconists crying their goods countrypeople driving flocks of sheep and goats with infinite clamour through lines of horses fiercely snorting and biting and kicking and rearing townspeople seeking their friends returned travellers exchanging affectionate salutes devout hajis jostling one another running under the legs of camels and tumbling over the tents ropes in their hurry to reach the harim cannon roaring from the citadel shopmen watercarriers and fruit vendors fighting over their bargains boys with loud screams bullying heretics a wellmounted  p419party of fine old arab shaykhs of the hamidah clan preceded by their varlets performing the arzah or war dancecompared with which the pyrenean bears performance is grace itselffiring their duckguns upwards or blowing the powder into the calves of those before them brandishing their swords leaping frantically the while with their bright coloured rags floating in the wind tossing their long spears tufted with ostrich feathers high in the air reckless where they fall servants seeking their masters and masters their tents with vain cries of ya mohammedfn6 grandees riding mules or stalking on foot preceded by their crowdbeaters shouting to clear the way here the loud shrieks of women and children whose litters are bumping and rasping against one another there the low moaning of some poor wretch that is seeking a shady corner to die in add a thick dust which blurs the outlines like a london fog with a flaming sun that draws sparkles of fire from the burnished weapons of the crowd and the brass balls of tent and litter andi doubt gentle reader that even the length the jar and the confusion of this description is adequate to its subject or that any wordpainting of mine can convey a just idea of the scene   this was the day appointed for our visiting the martyrs of ohod after praying the dawn prayers as directed at the harim we mounted our donkeys and armed with pistols and knives we set out from the city our party was large saad the demon had offered to accompany us and the bustle around kept him in the best of humours omar effendi was also there quietlooking and humble as usual leading his ass to avoid the trouble of dismounting every second minutefn7 i had the boy  p420mohammed and my slave and shaykh hamid was attended by half a dozen relations to avoid the crush of the barr almanakhah we made a detour westwards over the bridge and down the course of the torrentbed alsayh we then passed along the southern wall of the castle traversed its eastern outwork and issued from the bab alshami during the greater part of the time we were struggling through a living tide and among dromedaries and chargers a donkey is by no means a pleasant monture with some difficulty but without any more serious accident than a fall or two we found ourselves in the space beyond and northward of the city this also was covered with travellers and tents amongst which on an eminence to the left of the road rose conspicuous the bright green pavilion of the emir alhajj the commandant of the caravanfn8 hard by half its height surrounded by a kanat or tent wall stood the syrian or sultans mahmil litter all glittering with green and gilding and gold and around it were pitched the handsome habitations of the principal officers and grandees of the pilgrimage on the right hand lay extensive palm plantations and on the left strewed over the plain were signs of wells and tanks built to supply the hajj with water we pass two small buildings one the kubbat alsabak or dome of precedence where the prophets warrior friends used to display their horsemanship  p421the second the makan or burialplace of sayyidna zaki aldin one of mohammeds multitudinous descendants then we fall into a plain resembling that of kuba but less fertile while we are jogging over it a few words concerning mount ohod may not be misplaced a popular distich says  verily there is healing to the eye that looks unto ohod and the two harrahsfn9 ridges near  and of this holy hill the apostle declared ohod is a mountain which loves us and which we love it is upon the gate of heavenfn10 adding  p422and ayrfn11 is a place which hates us and which we hate it is upon the gate of hell the former sheltered mohammed in the time of danger therefore on resurrection day it will be raised to paradise whereas jabal ayr its neighbour having been so illjudged as to refuse the prophet water on an occasion while he thirsted will be cast incontinently into jahannam moslem divines be it observed ascribe to mohammed miraculous authority over animals vegetables and minerals as well as over men angels and jinnis hence the speaking wolf the weeping post the oilstone and the love and hate of these two mountains it is probably one of the many remains of ancient paganism pulled down and afterwards used to build up the edifice of alislam according to the old persians the sphere has an active soul some sects of hindus believe mother earth upon whose bosom we little parasites crawl to be a living being this was a dogma also amongst the ancient egyptians who denoted it by a peculiar symbolthe globe with human legs hence the makrokosmos of the plagiaristic greeks the animal on a large scale whose diminutive was the mikrokosmosman tota natura repeats malpighi existit in minimis amongst the romans tellus or terra was a female deity anthropomorphised according to their syncretic system which furnished with strange gods their pantheon but forgot to append the scroll explaining the inner sense of  p423the symbol and some modern philosophers kepler blackmore and others have not scrupled to own their belief in a doctrine which as long as life is a mere word on mans tongue can neither be proved nor disproved the mohammedans as usual exaggerate the dogmaa hadis related by abu hurayrah casts on the day of judgment the sun and the moon into hell fire  jabal ohod owes its present reputation to a cave which sheltered the apostle when pursued by his enemiesfn12 to certain springs of which he drankfn13 and especially to its being the scene of a battle celebrated in alislam on saturday the 11th shawwal in the third year of the hijrah 26th january ad 625 mohammed with seven hundred men engaged three thousand infidels under the command of abu sufiyan ran great personal danger and lost his uncle hamzah the lord of martyrs on the topmost pinnacle also is the kubbat harun the dome erected over aarons remains it is now i was told in a ruinous condition and is placed upon the pinnacle of seven hillsfn14 in a position somewhat like that of certain buildings on st angelo in the bay of naples alluding to the toil of reaching it the madani quote a facetious rhyme inscribed upon the wall by one of their number who had wasted his breath  malun ibn malun man talaa kubbat harun  anglice the man must be a ruffian who climbs up to aarons dome devout moslems visit ohod every thursday morning after the dawn devotions in the  p424harim pray for the martyrs and after going through the ceremonies return to the harim in time for midday worship on the 12th of rajab zairs come out in large bodies from the city encamp on the plain for three or four days and pass the time in feasting jollity and devotion as is usual at pilgrimages and at saints festivals in general  after half an hours ride we came to the mustarah or restingplace so called because the prophet sat here for a few minutes on his way to the battle of ohod it is a newlybuilt square enclosure of dwarf whitewashed walls within which devotees pray on the outside fronting almadinah is a seat like a chair of rough stones here i was placed by my muzawwir who recited an insignificant supplication to be repeated after him at its end with the fatihah and accompaniments we remounted our asses and resumed our way travelling onwards we came in sight of the second harrah or ridge it lies to the right and left of the road and resembles lines of lava but i had not an opportunity to examine it narrowlyfn15 then we reached the gardens of ohod which reflect in miniature those of kuba and presently we arrived at what explained the presence of verdure and vegetable lifea deep fiumara full of loose sand and large stones denoting an impetuous stream it flows along the southern base of ohod said to be part of the plain of almadinah and it collects the drainage of the high lands lying to the south and southeast the bed becomes impassable after rain and sometimes the torrents overflow the neighbouring gardens by the direction of this fiumara i judged that it must supply the ghabbah or basin in the hills north of the plain good authorities  p425however informed me that a large volume of water will not stand there but flows down the beds that wind through the ghats westward of almadinah and falls into the sea near the harbour of wijh to the south of the fiumara is a village on an eminence containing some large brick houses now in a ruinous state these are the villas of opulent and religious citizens who visited the place for change of air recreation and worship at hamzahs tomb our donkeys presently sank fetlockdeep in the loose sand of the torrentbed then reaching the northern side and ascending a gentle slope we found ourselves upon the battlefield   this spot so celebrated in the annals of alislam is a shelving strip of land close to the southern base of mount ohod the army of the infidels advanced from the fiumara in crescent shape with abu sufiyan the general and his idols in the centre it is distant about three miles from almadinah in a northerly directionfn16 all the visitor sees is hard gravelly ground covered with little heaps of various coloured granite red sandstone and bits of porphyry to denote the different places where the martyrs fell and were buriedfn17 seen from this point there is something appalling in the look of the holy mountain its seared and jagged flanks rise like masses of iron from the plain and the crevice into which the moslem host retired when the disobedience of the archers in hastening to plunder enabled khalid bin walid to fall upon mohammeds rear is the only break in the grim wall reeking with heat its surface produces  p426not one green shrub or stunted tree neither bird nor beast appeared upon its inhospitable sides and the bright blue sky glaring above its bald and sullen brow made it look only the more repulsive i was glad to turn away my eyes from it  to the left of the road north of the fiumara and leading to the mountains stands hamzahs mosque which like the harim of almadinah is a mausoleum as well as a fane it is a small strongly built square of hewn stone with a dome covering the solitary hypostyle to the south and the usual minaret the westward wing is a zawiyah or oratoryfn18 frequented by the celebrated sufi and saint mohammed alsamman the clarified butterseller one of whose blood the reader will remember stood by my side in the person of shaykh hamid on the eastern side of the building a half wing projects and a small door opens to the south upon a mastabah or stone bench five or six feet high this completes the square of the edifice on the right of the road opposite hamzahs mosque is a large erection now in ruins containing a deep hole leading to a well with huge platforms for the accommodation of travellers beyond towards the mountains are the small edifices presently to be described   some turkish women were sitting veiled upon the shady platform opposite the martyrs mosque at a little distance their husbands and the servants holding horses and asses lay upon the ground and a large crowd of badawin boys girls and old women had gathered around to beg draw water and sell dry dates they  p427were awaiting the guardian who had not yet acknowledged the summons after half an hours vain patience we determined to proceed with the ceremonies ascending by its steps the mastabah subtending half the eastern wall shaykh hamid placed me so as to front the tomb there standing in the burning sun we repeated the following prayer peace be upon thee o our lord hamzah o paternal uncle of allahs apostle o paternal uncle of allahs prophet peace be upon thee o paternal uncle of mustafa peace be upon thee o prince of the martyrs o prince of the happy peace be upon thee o lion of allah o lion of his prophet after which we asked hamzah and his companions to lend us their aid in obtaining for us and ours pardon worldly prosperity and future happiness scarcely had we finished when mounted on a hightrotting dromedary appeared the emissary of mohammed kalifah descendant of alabbas who keeps the key of the mosque and who receives the fees and donations of the devout it was to be opened for the turkish pilgrims i waited to see the interior the arab drew forth from his pouch with abundant solemnity a bunch of curiously made keys and sharply directed me to stand away from and out of sight of the door when i obeyed grumblingly he began to rattle the locks and to snap the padlocks opening them slowly shaking them and making as much noise as possible the reason of the precautionit sounded like poetry if not senseis this it is believed that the souls of martyrs leaving the habitations of their senseless clay fn19 are fond of sitting together in spiritual  p428converse and profane eye must not fall upon the scene what grand pictures these imaginative arabs see conceive the majestic figures of the saintsfor the soul with mohammedans is like the old european spirit a something immaterial in the shape of the bodywith long grey beards earnest faces and solemn eyes reposing beneath the palms and discussing events now buried in the gloom of a thousand years i would fain be hard upon this superstition but shame prevents when in nottingham eggs may not be carried out after sunset when ireland hears banshees or apparitional old women with streaming hair and dressed in blue mantles when scotland sees a shroud about a person showing his approaching death when france has her loupgarous revenants and poules du vendredi saint ie hens hatched on good friday supposed to change colour every year as long as the holy coat cures devotees at treves madonnas wink at rimini san januario melts at naples and addolorate and estatiche make converts to hysteria at rome whilst the virgin manifests herself to children on the alps and in france whilst germany sends forth psychography whilst europe the civilised the enlightened the sceptical dotes over clairvoyance and tableturning and whilst even hardheaded america believes in mediums in snailtelegraphs and spiritrappingsfn20i must hold the men of almadinah to be as wise and their superstition to be as respectable as that of others but the realities of hamzahs mosque have little to recommend them the building is like that of kuba only smaller and the hypostyle is hung with oil lamps and ostrich eggs the usual paltry furniture of an arab  p429mausoleum on the walls are a few modern inscriptions and framed poetry written in a calligraphic hand beneath the riwak lies hamzah under a mass of black basaltic stonefn21 resembling that of aden only more porous and scoriaceous convex at the top like a heap of earth without the kiswahfn22 or cover of a saints tomb and railed round with wooden bars at his head or westward lies abdullah bin jaysh a name little known to fame under a plain whitewashed tomb also convex and in the courtyard is a similar pile erected over the remains of shammas bin osman another obscure companionfn23 we then passed through a door in the northern part of the western wall and saw a diminutive palm plantation and a well after which we left the mosque and i was under the fatal necessity of paying a dollar for the honour of entering it but the guardian promised that the chapters ys and alikhlas should be recited for my benefit the latter forty times and if their efficacy be onetwentieth part of what men say it is the reader cannot quote against me a certain popular proverb concerning an order of men easily parted from their money   issuing from the mosque we advanced a few paces towards the mountain on our left we passed byat a respectful distance for the turkish hajis cried out that their women were engaged in ablutiona large sahrij or tank built of cut stone with steps and intended to detain  p430 the overflowing waters of the torrent the next place we prayed at was a small square enclosed with dwarf whitewashed walls containing a few graves denoted by ovals of loose stones thinly spread upon the ground this is primitive arab simplicity the badawin still mark the places of their dead with four stones planted at the head the feet and the sides in the centre the earth is either heaped up musannam ie like the hump of a camel or more generally left musattah level i therefore suppose that the latter was the original shape of the prophets tomb within the enclosure certain martyrs of the holy army were buried after praying there we repaired to a small building still nearer to the foot of the mountain it is the usual cupola springing from four square walls not in the best preservation here the prophet prayed and it is called the kubbat alsanaya dome of the front teeth from the following circumstance five infidels were bound by oath to slay mohammed at the battle of ohod one of these ibn kumayyah threw so many stones and with such goodwill that two rings of the prophets helmet were driven into his cheek and blood poured from his brow down his mustachios which he wiped with a cloak to prevent the drops falling to the ground then utbah bin abi wakkas hurled a stone at him which splitting his lower lip knocked out one of his front teethfn24 on the left of the mihrab inserted low down in the wall is a square stone upon which shaykh hamid showed me the impression of a toothfn25 he kissed it with peculiar reverence and so did i but the boy mohammed being by me objurgatedfor i  p431remarked in him a jaunty demeanour combined with neglectfulness of ceremoniessaluted it sulkily muttering the while hints about the holiness of his birthplace exempting him from the trouble of stooping already he had appeared at the harim without his jubbah and with ungirt loinsin waistcoat and shirtsleeves moreover he had conducted himself indecorously by nudging shaykh hamids sides during divine service feeling that the youths moral man was like his physical under my charge and determined to arrest a course of conduct which must have ended in obtaining for me the master the reputation of a son of belial i insisted upon his joining us in the customary twobow prayers and saad the demon taking my side of the question with his usual alacrity when a disturbance was in prospect the youth found it necessary to yield after this little scene shaykh hamid pointed out a sprawling inscription blessing the companions of the prophet the unhappy abu bakrs name had been half effaced by some fanatic shiah a circumstance which seemed to arouse all the evil in my companions nature and looking close at the wall i found a line of persian verse to this effect  i am weary of my life umr because it bears the name of umarfn26  we english wanderers are beginning to be shamed out of our vulgar habit of scribbling names and nonsense in noted spots yet the practice is both classical and oriental the greeks and persians left their marks everywhere as egypt shows and the paws of the sphinx bears scratches which being interpreted are found to be the same manner of trash as that written upon the remains of thebes in ad 1879 and easterns appear never to  p432enter a building with a white wall without inditing upon it platitudes in verse and prose influenced by these considerations i drew forth a pencil and inscribed in the kubbat alsanaya  arabic text  abdullah the servant of allah ah 1269  issuing from the dome we turned a few paces to the left passed northwards and thus blessed the martyrs of ohod  peace be upon ye o martyrs peace be upon ye o blessed ye pious ye pure who fought upon allahs path the good fight who worshipped your lord until he brought you to certaintyfn27 peace be upon you of whom allah said viz in the koran ‘verily repute not them slain on gods path ie warring with infidels nay rather they are alive and there is no fear upon them nor are they sorrowful peace be upon ye o martyrs of ohod one and all and the mercy of allah and his blessings   then again we moved a few paces forward and went through a similar ceremony supposing ourselves to be in the cave that sheltered the apostle after which returning towards the torrentbed by the way we came we stood a small distance from a cupola called kubbat almasra it resembles that of the frontteeth and notes as its name proves the place where the gallant  p433hamzah fell by the spear of wahshi the slavefn28 we faced towards it and finished the ceremonies of this ziyarat by a supplication the testification and the fatihah  in the evening i went with my friends to the harim the minaret galleries were hung with lamps and the inside of the temple was illuminated it was  p434crowded with hajis amongst whom were many women a circumstance which struck me from its being unusualfn29 some pious pilgrims who had duly paid for the privilege were perched upon ladders trimming wax candles of vast dimensions others were laying up for themselves rewards in paradise by performing the same office to the lamps many were going through the ceremonies of ziyarat and not a few were sitting in different parts of the mosque apparently overwhelmed with emotion the boys and the beggars were inspired with fresh energy the aghawat were gruffer and surlier than i had ever seen them and the young men about town walked and talked with a freer and an easier demeanour than usual my old friends the persiansthere were about 1200 of them in the hajj caravanattracted my attention the doorkeepers stopped them with curses as they were about to enter and all claimed from each the sum of five piastres whilst other moslems were allowed to enter the mosque free unhappy men they had lost all the shiraz swagger their mustachios dropped pitiably their eyes would not look any one in the face and not a head bore a cap stuck upon it crookedly whenever an ajami whatever might be his rank stood in the way of an arab or a turk he was rudely thrust aside with abuse muttered loud enough to be heard by all around all eyes followed them as they went through the ceremonies of ziyarat especially as they approached the tombs of abu bakr and omarwhich every man is bound to defile if he canand the supposed place of fatimahs burial here they stood in parties after praying before the prophets window one read from a book the pathetic tale of the ladys life sorrows and  p435mourning death whilst the others listened to him with breathless attention sometimes their emotion was too strong to be repressed ay fatimah ay muzlumah way wayo fatimah o thou injured one alas alas burst involuntarily from their lips despite the danger of such exclamations tears trickled down their hairy cheeks and their brawny bosoms heaved with sobs a strange sight it was to see rugged fellows mountaineers perhaps or the fierce iliyat of the plains sometimes weeping silently like children sometimes shrieking like hysteric girls and utterly careless to conceal a grief so coarse and grisly at the same time so true and real that i knew not how to behold it then the satanic scowls with which they passed by or pretended to pray at the hated omars tomb with what curses their hearts are belying those mouths full of blessings how they are internally canonising fayruzthe persian slave who stabbed omar in the mosqueand praying for his eternal happiness in the presence of the murdered man sticks and stones however and not unfrequently the knife and the sabre have taught them the hard lesson of disciplining their feelings and nothing but a furious contraction of the brow a roll of the eye intensely vicious and a twitching of the muscles about the region of the mouth denote the wild storm of wrath within they generally too manage to discharge some part of their passion in words hail omar thou hog exclaims some fanatic madani as he passes by the heretica demand more outraging than requiring a redhot blacknorth protestant to bless the pope o allah hell him meekly responds the persian changing the benediction to a curse most intelligible to and most delicious in his fellows earsfn30  p436an evening hour in the steamy heat of the harim was equal to half a dozen afternoons and i left it resolved never to revisit it till the hajj departed from almadinah it was only prudent not to see much of the ajamis and as i did so somewhat ostentatiously my companions discovered that the shaykh abdullah having slain many of those heretics in some war or other was avoiding them to escape retaliation in proof of my generalistic qualities the rolling down of the water jar upon the heads of the maghribi pilgrims in the golden thread was quoted and all offered to fight for me a loutrance i took care not to contradict the report  fn1 this city derives its names the great gate of pilgrimage and the key of the prophets tomb from its being the gatheringplace of this caravan fn2 the egyptians corruptly pronounce almisr ie cairo as almasr fn3 note to fourth editioni reprint the following from the illustrated news in proof that the literati of england have still something to learnon the 1st instant the annual ceremony of the departure of the sureemini with the imperial gifts for the prophets tomb at mecca took place in front of the palace at constantinople the levant herald states that the presents which consist beside the large money donation of rich shawls and goldwoven stuffs were brought out of the imperial apartments and packed in presence of the sultan on two beautiful camels which after the delivery of the usual prayers were then led in grand procession accompanied by all the high officers of state to the landingplace at cabatash where the sureemini and camels were embarked on a government steamer and ferried over to scutari there the holy functionary will remain some days till the ‘faithful of the capital and those who have come from the interior have joined him when the caravan will start for damascus at this latter city the grand rendezvous takes place and that accomplished the great caravan sets out for mecca under the emirelhadj of the year the imperial presents on this occasion cost more than l20000 fn4 the syrian shugduf differs entirely from that of alhijaz it is composed of two solid wooden cots about four feet in length slung along the camels sides and covered over with cloth in the shape of a tent they are nearly twice as heavy as the hijazi litter and yet a syrian camelman would as surely refuse to put one of the latter upon his beasts back as the hijazi to carry a syrian litter see p 223 ante fn5 this is the arabic modern word synonymous with the egyptian hajin namely a shedromedary the word nakah at present popular in alhijaz means a shedromedary kept for breeding as well as for riding fn6 one might as sensibly cry out john in an english theatre fn7 respectable men in alhijaz when they meet friends acquaintances or superiors consider it only polite to dismount from a donkey fn8 the title of the pasha who has the privilege of conducting the caravan it is a lucrative as well as an honourable employment for the emir enjoys the droit daubaine becoming heir to the personal property of all pilgrims who die in the holy cities or on the line of march and no persian even of the poorest would think of undertaking a pilgrimage by this line of country without having at least l80 in ready money with him the first person who bore the title of emir alhajj was abu bakr who in the ninth year of the hijrah led 300 moslems from almadinah to the meccah pilgrimage on this occasion idolaters and infidels were for the first time expelled the holy city fn9 harrah from harr heat is the generic name of lava porous basalt scoriae greenstone schiste and others supposed to be of igneous origin it is also used to denote a ridge or hill of such formation one harrah has already been mentioned in chapter xv the second is on the road to ohod there is a third harrah called alwakin or alzahrah about one mile eastward of almadinah here the prophet wept predicting that the last men of his faith would be foully slain the prophecy was fulfilled in the days of yazid when the people of almadinah filled their assembly with slippers and turbands to show that on account of his abominations they had cast off their allegiance as a garment the accursed sent an aged sinner muslim bin akbah almarai who though a cripple defeated the madani in a battle called the affair of the ridge slaying of them 10000 citizens 1700 learned and great men 700 teachers of the koran and 97 karashi nobles this happened in the month of zul hijjah ah 63 for three days the city was plundered the streets ran blood dogs ate human flesh in the mosque and no fewer than 1000 women were insulted it was long before almadinah recovered from this fatal blow which old muslim declared would open to him the gates of paradise the occurrence is now forgotten at almadinah though it will live in history the people know not the place and even the books are doubtful whether this harrah be not upon the spot where the khandak or moat was fn10 meaning that on the day of resurrection it shall be so treated many however suppose ohod to be one of the four hills of paradise the other three according to altabrani from amr bin auf are sinai lebanon and mount warkan on the meccan road others suppose ohod to be one of the six mountains which afforded materials for the kaabah viz abu kubays sinai kuds at jerusalem warkan and radhwah near yambu also it is said that when the lord conversed with moses on sinai the mountain burst into six pieces three of which flew to almadinah ohod warkan and radhwah and three to meccah hira now popularly called jabal nur sabir the old name for jabal muna and saur fn11 ayr means a wild ass whereas ohod is derived from ahad oneso called because fated to be the place of victory to those who worship one god the very names say moslem divines make it abundantly evident that even as the men of almadinah were of two parties friendly and hostile to the prophet so were these mountains fn12 this cave is a place of visitation but i did not go there as it is on the northern flank of the hill and all assured me that it contained nothing worth seeing many ignore it altogether fn13 ohod it is said sent forth in the prophets day 360 springs of which ten or twelve now remain fn14 meaning that the visitor must ascend several smaller eminences the time occupied is from eight to nine hours but i should not advise my successor to attempt it in the hot weather fn15 when engaged in such a holy errand as this to have ridden away for the purpose of inspecting a line of black stone would have been certain to arouse the suspicions of an arab either he would argue you recognise the place of some treasure described in your books or you are a magician seeking a talisman fn16 most arab authors place ohod about two miles n of almadinah alidrisi calls it the nearest hill and calculates the distance at 6000 paces golius gives two leagues to ohod and ayr which is much too far in our popular accounts mohammed posted himself upon the hill of ohod about six miles from almadinah two mistakes fn17 they are said to be seventy but the heaps appeared to me at least three times more numerous fn18 a zawiyah in northern africa resembles the takiyah of india persia and egypt being a monastery for darwayshes who reside there singly or in numbers a mosque and sometimes according to the excellent practice of alislam a school are attached to it fn19 some historians relate that fortysix years after the battle of ohod the tombs were laid bare by a torrent when the corpses appeared in their windingsheets as if buried the day before some had their hands upon their death wounds from which fresh blood trickled when the pressure was forcibly removed in opposition to this moslem theory we have that of the modern greeks namely that if the body be not decomposed within a year it shows that the soul is not where it should be fn20 in fairness i must confess to believing in the reality of these phenomena but not in their spiritual origin fn21 in ibn jubayrs time the tomb was red fn22 in the common tombs of martyrs saints and holy men this covering is usually of green cloth with long white letters sewn upon it i forgot to ask whether it was temporarily absent from hamzahs grave fn23 all these erections are new in burckhardts time they were mere heaps of earth with a few loose stones placed around them i do not know what has become of the third martyr said to have been interred near hamzah possibly some day he may reappear meanwhile the people of almadinah are so wealthy in saints that they can well afford to lose sight of one fn24 formerly in this place was shown a slab with the mark of a mans headlike st peters at romewhere the prophet had rested now it seems to have disappeared and the tooth has succeeded to its honours fn25 some historians say that four teeth were knocked out by this stone this appears an exaggeration fn26 in persian characters the word umr life and umar the name of the hated caliph are written in the same way which explains the pun fn27 that is to say to the hour of death fn28 when jubayr bin mutim was marching to ohod according to the rauzat alsafa in revenge for the death of his uncle taymah he offered manumission to his slave wahshi who was noted for the use of the abyssinian spear if he slew hamzah the slave sat in ambush behind a rock and when the hero had despatched one sibaa bin abd alayiz of meccah he threw a javelin which pierced his navel and came out of his back the wounded man advanced towards his assassin who escaped hamzah then fell and his friends coming up found him dead wahshi waited till he saw an opportunity drew the javelin from the body and mutilated it in order to present trophies to the ferocious hinda mother of muawiyah whose father utbah had been slain by hamzah the amazon insisted upon seeing the corpse having presented her necklace and bracelets to wahshi she supplied their place with the nose the ears and other parts of the dead hero after mangling the body in a disgusting manner she ended by tearing open the stomach and biting the liver whence she was called akkalat alakbad when mohammed saw the state of his fathers brother he was sadly moved presently comforted by the inspirations brought by gabriel he cried it is written among the people of the seven heavens hamzah son of muttalib is the lion of allah and the lion of his prophet and ordered him to be shrouded and prayed over him beginning says the jazb alkulub with seventy repetitions of allah akbar ali had brought in his shield some water for mohammed from a mahras or stone trough which stood near the scene of action mc de perceval translates it un creux de rocher formant un bassin naturel but the prophet refused to drink it and washed
