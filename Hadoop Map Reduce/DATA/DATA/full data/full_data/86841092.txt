and his works in padua  being  an explanatory notice of the series of woodcuts executed for the arundel society after the frescos in the arena chapel     advertisement   the following notice of giotto has not been drawn up with any idea of attempting a history of his life that history could only be written after a careful search through the libraries of italy for all documents relating to the years during which he worked i have no time for such search or even for the examination of wellknown and published materials and have therefore merely collected from the sources nearest at hand such information as appeared absolutely necessary to render the series of plates now published by the arundel society intelligible and interesting to those among its members who have not devoted much time to the examination of mediæval works i have prefixed a few remarks on the relation of the art of giotto to former and subsequent efforts which i hope may be useful in preventing the general reader from either looking for what the painter never intended to give or missing the points to which his endeavours were really directed  jr     giotto  and his works in padua   towards the close of the thirteenth century enrico scrovegno a noble paduan purchased in his native city the remains of the roman amphitheatre or arena from the family of the delesmanini to whom those remains had been granted by the emperor henry iii of germany in 1090 for the power of making this purchase scrovegno was in all probability indebted to his father reginald who for his avarice is placed by dante in the seventh circle of the inferno and regarded apparently as the chief of the usurers there since he is the only one who addresses dante1 the son having possessed himself of the roman ruin or of the site which it had occupied built himself a fortified palace upon the ground and a chapel dedicated to the annunciate virgin  footnote 1      noting the visages of some who lay     beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire     one of them all i knew not but perceived     that pendent from his neck each bore a pouch     with colours and with emblems various marked     on which it seemed as if their eye did feed     and when amongst them looking round i came     a yellow purse i saw with azure wrought     that wore a lions countenance and port     then still my sight pursuing its career     another i beheld than blood more red     a goose display of whiter wing than curd     and one who bore a fat and azure swine     pictured on his white scrip addressed me thus     what dost thou in this deep go now and know     since yet thou livest that my neighbour here     vitaliano on my left shall sit     a paduan with these florentines am i     ofttimes they thunder in mine ears exclaiming     oh haste that noble knight he who the pouch     with the three goats will bring this said he writhed     the mouth and lolled the tongue out like an ox     that licks his nostrils      canto xvii  this passage of carys dante is not quite so clear as that translators work usually is one of them all i knew not is an awkward periphrasis for i knew none of them dantes indignant expression of the effect of avarice in withering away distinctions of character and the prophecy of scrovegno that his neighbor vitaliano then living should soon be with him to sit on his left hand is rendered a little obscure by the transposition of the word here cary has also been afraid of the excessive homeliness of dantes imagery whiter wing than curd being in the original whiter than butter the attachment of the purse to the neck as a badge of shame in the inferno is found before dantes time as for instance in the windows of bourges cathedral see plate iii of mm martin and cahiers beautiful work and the building of the arena chapel by the son as a kind of atonement for the avarice of the father is very characteristic of the period in which the use of money for the building of churches was considered just as meritorious as its unjust accumulation was criminal i have seen in a ms churchservice of the thirteenth century an illumination representing churchconsecration illustrating the words fundata est domus domini supra verticem montium surrounded for the purpose of contrast by a grotesque consisting of a picture of a misers deathbed a demon drawing his soul out of his mouth while his attendants are searching in his chests for his treasures  this chapel built in or about the year 13032 appears to have been intended to replace one which had long existed on the spot and in which from the year 1278 an annual festival had been held on ladyday in which the annunciation was represented in the manner of our english mysteries and under the same title una sacra rappresentazione di quel mistero with dialogue and music both vocal and instrumental scrovegnos purchase of the ground could not be allowed to interfere with the national custom but he is reported by some writers to have rebuilt the chapel with greater costliness in order as far as possible to efface the memory of his fathers unhappy life but federici in his history of the cavalieri godenti supposes that scrovegno was a member of that body and was assisted by them in decorating the new edifice the order of cavalieri godenti was instituted in the beginning of the thirteenth century to defend the existence as selvatico states it but more accurately the dignity of the virgin against the various heretics by whom it was beginning to be assailed her knights were first called cavaliers of st mary but soon increased in power and riches to such a degree that from their general habits of life they received the nickname of the merry brothers federici gives forcible reasons for his opinion that the arena chapel was employed in the ceremonies of their order and lord lindsay observes that the fulness with which the history of the virgin is recounted on its walls adds to the plausibility of his supposition  footnote 2 for these historical details i am chiefly indebted to the very careful treatise of selvatico sulla cappellina degli scrovegni nellarena di padova padua 1836  enrico scrovegno was however towards the close of his life driven into exile and died at venice in 1320 but he was buried in the chapel he had built and has one small monument in the sacristy as the founder of the building in which he is represented under a gothic niche standing with his hands clasped and his eyes raised while behind the altar is his tomb on which as usual at the period is a recumbent statue of him the chapel itself may not unwarrantably be considered as one of the first efforts of popery in resistance of the reformation for the reformation though not victorious till the sixteenth began in reality in the thirteenth century and the remonstrances of such bishops as our own grossteste the martyrdoms of the albigenses in the dominican crusades and the murmurs of those heretics against whose aspersions of the majesty of the virgin this chivalrous order of the cavalieri godenti was instituted were as truly the signs of the approach of a new era in religion as the opponent work of giotto on the walls of the arena was a sign of the approach of a new era in art  the chapel having been founded as stated above in 1303 giotto appears to have been summoned to decorate its interior walls about the year 1306summoned as being at that time the acknowledged master of painting in italy by what steps he had risen to this unquestioned eminence it is difficult to trace for the records of his life strictly examined and freed from the verbiage and conjecture of artistical history nearly reduce themselves to a list of the cities of italy where he painted and to a few anecdotes of little meaning in themselves and doubly pointless in the fact of most of them being inheritances of the whole race of painters and related successively of all in whose biographies the public have deigned to take an interest there is even question as to the date of his birth vasari stating him to have been born in 1276 while baldinucci on the internal evidence derived from vasaris own narrative throws the date back ten years3 i believe however that vasari is most probably accurate in his first main statement and that his errors always numerous are in the subsequent and minor particulars it is at least undoubted truth that giotto was born and passed the years of childhood at vespignano about fourteen miles north of florence on the road to bologna few travellers can forget the peculiar landscape of that district of the apennine as they ascend the hill which rises from florence to the lowest break in the ridge of fiesole they pass continually beneath the walls of villas bright in perfect luxury and beside cypresshedges enclosing fair terraced gardens where the masses of oleander and magnolia motionless as leaves in a picture inlay alternately upon the blue sky their branching lightness of pale rosecolour and deep green breadth of shade studded with balls of budding silver and showing at intervals through their framework of rich leaf and rubied flower the faraway bends of the arno beneath its slopes of olive and the purple peaks of the carrara mountains tossing themselves against the western distance where the streaks of motionless cloud burn above the pisan sea the traveller passes the fiesolan ridge and all is changed the country is on a sudden lonely here and there indeed are seen the scattered houses of a farm grouped gracefully upon the hillsideshere and there a fragment of tower upon a distant rock but neither gardens nor flowers nor glittering palacewalls only a grey extent of mountainground tufted irregularly with ilex and olive a scene not sublime for its forms are subdued and low not desolate for its valleys are full of sown fields and tended pastures not rich nor lovely but sunburnt and sorrowful becoming wilder every instant as the road winds into its recesses ascending still until the higher woods now partly oak and partly pine drooping back from the central crest of the apennine leave a pastoral wilderness of scathed rock and arid grass withered away here by frost and there by strange lambent tongues of earthfed fire4 giotto passed the first ten years of his life a shepherdboy among these hills was found by cimabue near his native village drawing one of his sheep upon a smooth stone was yielded up by his father a simple person a labourer of the earth to the guardianship of the painter who by his own work had already made the streets of florence ring with joy attended him to florence and became his disciple  footnote 3 lord lindsay christian art vol ii p 166  footnote 4 at pietra mala the flames rise two or three feet above the stony ground out of which they spring white and fierce enough to be visible in the intense rays even of the morning sun  we may fancy the glance of the boy when he and cimabue stood side by side on the ridge of fiesole and for the first time he saw the flowering thickets of the val darno and deep beneath the innumerable towers of the city of the lily the depths of his own heart yet hiding the fairest of them all another ten years passed over him and he was chosen from among the painters of italy to decorate the vatican  the account given us by vasari of the mode of his competition on this occasion is one of the few anecdotes of him which seem to be authentic especially as having given rise to an italian proverb and it has also great point and value i translate vasaris words literally  this work his paintings in the campo santo of pisa acquired for him both in the city and externally so much fame that the pope benedict ix sent a certain one of his courtiers into tuscany to see what sort of a man giotto was and what was the quality of his works he the pope intending to have some paintings executed in st peters which courtier coming to see giotto and hearing that there were other masters in florence who excelled in painting and in mosaic spoke in siena to many masters then having received drawings from them he came to florence and having gone one morning into giottos shop as he was at work explained the popes mind to him and in what way he wished to avail himself of his powers and finally requested from him a little piece of drawing to send to his holiness giotto who was most courteous took a leaf of vellum and upon this with a brush dipped in red fixing his arm to his side to make it as the limb of a pair of compasses and turning his hand made a circle so perfect in measure and outline that it was a wonder to see which having done he said to the courtier with a smile there is the drawing he thinking himself mocked said shall i have no other drawing than this this is enough and too much answered giotto send it with the others you will see if it will be understood the ambassador seeing that he could not get any thing else took his leave with small satisfaction doubting whether he had not been made a jest of however when he sent to the pope the other drawings and the names of those who had made them he sent also that of giotto relating the way in which he had held himself in drawing his circle without moving his arm and without compasses whence the pope and many intelligent courtiers knew how much giotto overpassed in excellence all the other painters of his time afterwards the thing becoming known the proverb arose from it thou art rounder than the o of giotto which it is still in custom to say to men of the grosser clay for the proverb is pretty not only on account of the accident of its origin but because it has a double meaning round being taken in tuscany to express not only circular form but slowness and grossness of wit  such is the account of vasari which at the first reading might be gravely called into question seeing that the paintings at pisa to which he ascribes the sudden extent of giottos reputation have been proved to be the work of francesco da volterra5 and since moreover vasari has even mistaken the name of the pope and written boniface ix for boniface viii but the story itself must i think be true and rightly understood it is singularly interesting i say rightly understood for lord lindsay supposes the circle to have been mechanically drawn by turning the sheet of vellum under the hand as now constantly done for the sake of speed at schools but neither do vasaris words bear this construction nor would the drawing so made have borne the slightest testimony to giottos power vasari says distinctly and turning his hand or as i should rather read it with a sweep of his hand not turning the vellum neither would a circle produced in so mechanical a manner have borne distinct witness to any thing except the draughtsmans mechanical ingenuity and giotto had too much common sense and too much courtesy to send the pope a drawing which did not really contain the evidence he required lord lindsay has been misled also by his own careless translation of pennello tinto di rosso a brush dipped in red by the word crayon it is easy to draw the mechanical circle with a crayon but by no means easy with a brush i have not the slightest doubt that giotto drew the circle as a painter naturally would draw it that is to say that he set the vellum upright on the wall or panel before him and then steadying his arm firmly against his side drew the circular line with one sweeping but firm revolution of his hand holding the brush long such a feat as this is completely possible to a welldisciplined painters hand but utterly impossible to any other and the circle so drawn was the most convincing proof giotto could give of his decision of eye and perfectness of practice  footnote 5 at least lord lindsay seems to consider the evidence collected by förster on this subject conclusive christian art vol ii p 168  still even when thus understood there is much in the anecdote very curious here is a painter requested by the head of the church to execute certain religious paintings and the only qualification for the task of which he deigns to demonstrate his possession is executive skill nothing is said and nothing appears to be thought of expression or invention or devotional sentiment nothing is required but firmness of hand and here arises the important question did giotto know that this was all that was looked for by his religious patrons and is there occult satire in the example of his art which he sends themor does the founder of sacred painting mean to tell us that he holds his own power to consist merely in firmness of hand secured by long practice i cannot satisfy myself on this point but yet it seems to me that we may safely gather two conclusions from the words of the master it is enough and more than enough the first that giotto had indeed a profound feeling of the value of precision in all art and that we may use the full force of his authority to press the truth of which it is so difficult to persuade the hasty workmen of modern times that the difference between right and wrong lies within the breadth of a line and that the most perfect power and genius are shown by the accuracy which disdains error and the faithfulness which fears it  and the second conclusion is that whatever giottos imaginative powers might be he was proud to be a good workman and willing to be considered by others only as such there might lurk as has been suggested some satire in the message to the pope and some consciousness in his own mind of faculties higher than those of draughtsmanship i cannot tell how far these hidden feelings existed but the more i see of living artists and learn of departed ones the more i am convinced that the highest strength of genius is generally marked by strange unconsciousness of its own modes of operation and often by no small scorn of the best results of its exertion the inferior mind intently watches its own processes and dearly values its own produce the mastermind is intent on other things than itself and cares little for the fruits of a toil which it is apt to undertake rather as a law of life than a means of immortality it will sing at a feast or retouch an old play or paint a dark wall for its daily bread anxious only to be honest in its fulfilment of its pledges or its duty and careless that future ages will rank it among the gods  i think it unnecessary to repeat here any other of the anecdotes commonly related of giotto as separately taken they are quite valueless yet much may be gathered from their general tone it is remarkable that they are almost without exception records of goodhumoured jests involving or illustrating some point of practical good sense and by comparing this general colour of the reputation of giotto with the actual character of his designs there cannot remain the smallest doubt that his mind was one of the most healthy kind and active that ever informed a human frame his love of beauty was entirely free from weakness his love of truth untinged by severity his industry constant without impatience his workmanship accurate without formalism his temper serene and yet playful his imagination exhaustless without extravagance and his faith firm without superstition i do not know in the annals of art such another example of happy practical unerring and benevolent power  i am certain that this is the estimate of his character which must be arrived at by an attentive study of his works and of the few data which remain respecting his life but i shall not here endeavour to give proof of its truth because i believe the subject has been exhaustively treated by rumohr and förster whose essays on the works and character of giotto will doubtless be translated into english as the interest of the english public in mediæval art increases i shall therefore here only endeavour briefly to sketch the relation which giotto held to the artists who preceded and followed him a relation still imperfectly understood and then as briefly to indicate the general course of his labours in italy as far as may be necessary for understanding the value of the series in the arena chapel  the art of europe between the fifth and thirteenth centuries divides itself essentially into great branches one springing from the other grafted on the old roman stock the first is the roman art itself prolonged in a languid and degraded condition and becoming at last a mere formal system centered at the feet of eastern empire and thence generally called byzantine the other is the barbarous and incipient art of the gothic nations more or less coloured by roman or byzantine influence and gradually increasing in life and power  generally speaking the byzantine art although manifesting itself only in perpetual repetitions becoming every day more cold and formal yet preserved reminiscences of design originally noble and traditions of execution originally perfect  generally speaking the gothic art although becoming every day more powerful presented the most ludicrous experiments of infantile imagination and the most rude efforts of untaught manipulation  hence if any superior mind arose in byzantine art it had before it models which suggested or recorded a perfection they did not themselves possess and the superiority of the individual mind would probably be shown in a more sincere and living treatment of the subjects ordained for repetition by the canons of the schools  in the art of the goth the choice of subject was unlimited and the style of design so remote from all perfection as not always even to point out clearly the direction in which advance could be made the strongest minds which appear in that art are therefore generally manifested by redundance of imagination and sudden refinement of touch whether of pencil or chisel together with unexpected starts of effort or flashes of knowledge in accidental directions gradually forming various national styles  of these comparatively independent branches of art the greatest is as far as i know the french sculpture of the thirteenth century no words can give any idea of the magnificent redundance of its imaginative power or of the perpetual beauty of even its smallest incidental designs but this very richness of sculptural invention prevented the french from cultivating their powers of painting except in illumination of which art they were the acknowledged masters and in glasspainting their exquisite gift of fretting their stonework with inexhaustible wealth of sculpture prevented their feeling the need of figuredesign on coloured surfaces  the style of architecture prevalent in italy at the same period presented on the contrary large blank surfaces which could only be rendered interesting by covering them with mosaic or painting  the italians were not at the time capable of doing this for themselves and mosaicists were brought from constantinople who covered the churches of italy with a sublime monotony of byzantine traditions but the gothic blood was burning in the italian veins and the florentines and pisans could not rest content in the formalism of the eastern splendour the first innovator was i believe giunta of pisa the second cimabue the third giotto the last only being a man of power enough to effect a complete revolution in the artistic principles of his time  he however began like his master cimabue with a perfect respect for his byzantine models and his paintings for a long time consisted only of repetitions of the byzantine subjects softened in treatment enriched in number of figures and enlivened in gesture afterwards he invented subjects of his own the manner and degree of the changes which he at first effected could only be properly understood by actual comparison of his designs with the byzantine originals6 but in default of the means of such a comparison it may be generally stated that the innovations of giotto consisted in the introduction a of gayer or lighter colours b of broader masses and c of more careful imitation of nature than existed in the works of his predecessors  footnote 6 it might not i think be a work unworthy of the arundel society to collect and engrave in outline the complete series of these byzantine originals of the subjects of the arena chapel in order to facilitate this comparison the greek mss in the british museum would i think be amply sufficient the harleian ms numbered 1810 alone furnishing a considerable number of subjects and especially a death of the virgin with the st john thrown into the peculiar and violent gesture of grief afterwards adopted by giotto in the entombment of the arena chapel  a greater lightness of colour this was partly in compliance with a tendency which was beginning to manifest itself even before giottos time over the whole of northern europe the colouring of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries had been pale in manuscripts principally composed of pale red green and yellow blue being sparingly introduced earlier still in the eighth and ninth centuries the letters had often been coloured with black and yellow only then in the close of the twelfth and throughout the thirteenth century the great system of perfect colour was in use solemn and deep composed strictly in all its leading masses of the colours revealed by god from sinai as the noblestblue purple and scarlet with gold other hues chiefly green with white and black being used in points or small masses to relieve the main colours in the early part of the fourteenth century the colours begin to grow paler about 1330 the style is already completely modified and at the close of the fourteenth century the colour is quite pale and delicate  i have not carefully examined the colouring of early byzantine work but it seems always to have been comparatively dark and in manuscripts is remarkably so giottos paler colouring therefore though only part of the great european system was rendered notable by its stronger contrast with the byzantine examples  b greater breadth of mass it had been the habit of the byzantines to break up their draperies by a large number of minute folds norman and romanesque sculpture showed much of the same character giotto melted all these folds into broad masses of colour so that his compositions have sometimes almost a titianesque look in this particular this innovation was a healthy one and led to very noble results when followed up by succeeding artists but in many of giottos compositions the figures become ludicrously cumbrous from the exceeding simplicity of the terminal lines and massiveness of unbroken form the manner was copied in illuminated manuscripts with great disadvantage as it was unfavourable to minute ornamentation the french never adopted it in either branch of art nor did any other northern school minute and sharp folds of the robes remaining characteristic of northern more especially of flemish and german design down to the latest times giving a great superiority to the french and flemish illuminated work and causing a proportionate inferiority in their large pictorial efforts even rubens and vandyke cannot free themselves from a certain meanness and minuteness in disposition of drapery  c close imitation of nature in this one principle lay giottos great strength and the entire secret of the revolution he effected it was not by greater learning not by the discovery of new theories of art not by greater taste nor by ideal principles of selection that he became the head of the progressive schools of italy it was simply by being interested in what was going on around him by substituting the gestures of living men for conventional attitudes and portraits of living men for conventional faces and incidents of everyday life for conventional circumstances that he became great and the master of the great giotto was to his contemporaries precisely what millais is to his contemporariesa daring naturalist in defiance of tradition idealism and formalism the giottesque movement in the fourteenth and preraphaelite movement in the nineteenth centuries are precisely similar in bearing and meaning both being the protests of vitality against mortality of spirit against letter and of truth against tradition and both which is the more singular literally links in one unbroken chain of feeling for exactly as niccola pisano and giotto were helped by the classical sculptures discovered in their time the preraphaelites have been helped by the works of niccola and giotto at pisa and florence and thus the fiery cross of truth has been delivered from spirit to spirit over the dust of intervening generations  but what it may be said by the reader is the use of the works of giotto to us they may indeed have been wonderful for their time and of infinite use in that time but since after giotto came leonardo and correggio what is the use of going back to the ruder art and republishing it in the year 1854 why should we fret ourselves to dig down to the root of the tree when we may at once enjoy its fruit and foliage i answer first that in all matters relating to human intellect it is a great thing to have hold of the root that at least we ought to see it and taste it and handle it for it often happens that the root is wholesome when the leaves however fair are useless or poisonous in nine cases out of ten the first expression of an idea is the most valuable the idea may afterward be polished and softened and made more attractive to the general eye but the first expression of it has a freshness and brightness like the flash of a native crystal compared to the lustre of glass that has been melted and cut and in the second place we ought to measure the value of art less by its executive than by its moral power giotto was not indeed one of the most accomplished painters but he was one of the greatest men who ever lived he was the first master of his time in architecture as well as in painting he was the friend of dante and the undisputed interpreter of religious truth by means of painting over the whole of italy the works of such a man may not be the best to set before children in order to teach them drawing but they assuredly should be studied with the greatest care by all who are interested in the history of the human mind  one point more remains to be noticed respecting him as far as i am aware he never painted profane subjects all his important existing works are exclusively devoted to the illustration of christianity this was not a result of his own peculiar feeling or determination it was a necessity of the period giotto appears to have considered himself simply as a workman at the command of any employer for any kind of work however humble in the sixtythird novel of franco sacchetti we read that a stranger suddenly entering giottos study threw down a shield and departed saying paint me my arms on that shield giotto looking after him exclaimed who is he what is he he says paint me my arms as if he was one of the bardi what arms does he bear7 but at the time of giottos eminence art was never employed on a great scale except in the service of religion nor has it ever been otherwise employed except in declining periods i do not mean to draw any severe conclusion from this fact but it is a fact nevertheless which ought to be very distinctly stated and very carefully considered all progressive art hitherto has been religious art and commencements of the periods of decline are accurately marked in illumination by its employment on romances instead of psalters and in painting by its employment on mythology or profane history instead of sacred history yet perhaps i should rather have said on heathen mythology instead of christian mythology for this latter termfirst used i believe by lord lindsayis more applicable to the subjects of the early painters than that of sacred history of all the virtues commonly found in the higher orders of human mind that of a stern and just respect for truth seems to be the rarest so that while selfdenial and courage and charity and religious zeal are displayed in their utmost degrees by myriads of saints and heroes it is only once in a century that a man appears whose word may be implicitly trusted and who in the relation of a plain fact will not allow his prejudices or his pleasure to tempt him to some colouring or distortion of it hence the portions of sacred history which have been the constant subjects of fond popular contemplation have in the lapse of ages been encumbered with fictitious detail and their various historians seem to have considered the exercise of their imagination innocent and even meritorious if they could increase either the vividness of conception or the sincerity of belief in their readers a due consideration of that wellknown weakness of the popular mind which renders a statement credible in proportion to the multitude of local and circumstantial details which accompany it may lead us to look with some indulgence on the errors however fatal in their issue to the cause they were intended to advance of those weak teachers who thought the acceptance of their general statements of christian doctrine cheaply won by the help of some simple and generally absurd inventions of detail respecting the life of the virgin or the apostles  footnote 7 notes to rogers italy  indeed i can hardly imagine the bible to be ever read with true interest unless in our reading we feel some longing for further knowledge of the minute incidents of the life of christfor some records of those things which if they had been written every one the world could not have contained the books that should be written and they who have once felt this thirst for further truth may surely both conceive and pardon the earnest questioning of simple disciples who knew not as we do how much had been indeed revealed and measure with some justice the strength of the temptation which betrayed these teachers into adding to the word of revelation together with this specious and subtle influence we must allow for the instinct of imagination exerting itself in the acknowledged embellishment of beloved truths if we reflect how much even in this age of accurate knowledge the visions of milton have become confused in the minds of many persons with scriptural facts we shall rather be surprised that in an age of legends so little should be added to the bible than that occasionally we should be informed of important circumstances in sacred history with the collateral warning this moses spake not of8  footnote 8 these words are gravely added to some singular particulars respecting the life of adam related in a ms of the sixteenth century preserved in the heralds college  more especially in the domain of painting it is surprising to see how strictly the early workmen confined themselves to representations of the same series of scenes how little of pictorial embellishment they usually added and how even in the positions and gestures of figures they strove to give the idea rather of their having seen the fact than imagined a picturesque treatment of it often in examining early art we mistake conscientiousness for servility and attribute to the absence of invention what was indeed the result of the earnestness of faith  nor in a merely artistical point of view is it less important to note that the greatest advance in power was made when painters had few subjects to treat the day has perhaps come when genius should be shown in the discovery of perpetually various interest amidst the incidents of actual life and the absence of inventive capacity is very assuredly proved by the narrow selection of subjects which commonly appear on the walls of our exhibitions but yet it is to be always remembered that more originality may be shown in giving interest to a wellknown subject than in discovering a new one that the greatest poets whom the world has seen have been contented to retouch and exalt the creations of their predecessors and that the painters of the middle ages reached their utmost power by unweariedly treading a narrow circle of sacred subjects  nothing is indeed more notable in the history of art than the exact balance of its point of excellence in all things midway between servitude and license thus in choice and treatment of subject it became paralysed among the byzantines by being mercilessly confined to a given series of scenes and to a given mode of representing them giotto gave it partial liberty and incipient life by the artists who succeeded him the range of its scenery was continually extended and the severity of its style slowly softened to perfection but the range was still in some degree limited by the necessity of its continual subordination to religious purposes and the style though softened was still chaste and though tender selfrestrained at last came the period of license the artist chose his subjects from the lowest scenes of human life and let loose his passions in their portraiture and the kingdom of art passed away  as if to direct us to the observation of this great law there is a curious visible type of it in the progress of ornamentation in manuscripts corresponding with the various changes in the higher branch of art in the course of the 12th and early 13th centuries the ornamentation though often full of high feeling and fantasy is sternly enclosed within limiting borderlinesat first severe squares oblongs or triangles as the grace of the ornamentation advances these borderlines are softened and broken into various curves and the inner design begins here and there to overpass them gradually this emergence becomes more constant and the lines which thus escape throw themselves into curvatures expressive of the most exquisite concurrence of freedom with selfrestraint at length the restraint vanishes the freedom changes consequently into license and the page is covered with exuberant irregular and foolish extravagances of leafage and line  it only remains to be noticed that the circumstances of the time at which giotto appeared were peculiarly favourable to the development of genius owing partly to the simplicity of the methods of practice and partly to the naïveté with which art was commonly regarded giotto like all the great painters of the period was merely a travelling decorator of walls at so much a day having at florence a bottega or workshop for the production and sale of small tempera pictures there were no such things as studios in those days an artists studies were over by the time he was eighteen after that he was a lavoratore labourer a man who knew his business and produced certain works of known value for a known price being troubled with no philosophical abstractions shutting himself up in no wise for the reception of inspirations receiving indeed a good many as a matter of coursejust as he received the sunbeams which came in at his window the light which he worked byin either case without mouthing about it or much concerning himself as to the nature of it not troubled by critics either satisfied that his work was well done and that people would find it out to be well done but not vain of it nor more profoundly vexed at its being found fault with than a good saddler would be by some ones saying his last saddle was uneasy in the seat not on the whole much molested by critics but generally understood by the men of sense his neighbours and friends and permitted to have his own way with the walls he had to paint as being on the whole an authority about walls receiving at the same time a good deal of daily encouragement and comfort in the simple admiration of the populace and in the general sense of having done good and painted what no man could look upon without being the better for it  thus he went a serene labourer throughout the length and breadth of italy for the first ten years of his life a shepherd then a student perhaps for five or six then already in florence setting himself to his lifes task and called as a master to rome when he was only twenty there he painted the principal chapel of st peters and worked in mosaic also no handicrafts that had colour or form for their objects seeming unknown to him then returning to florence he painted dante about the year 13009 the 35th year of dantes life the 24th of his own and designed the façade of the duomo on the death of its former architect arnolfo some six years afterwards he went to padua there painting the chapel which is the subject of our present study and many other churches thence south again to assisi where he painted half the walls and vaults of the great convent that stretches itself along the slopes of the perugian hills and various other minor works on his way there and back to florence staying in his native city but a little while he engaged himself in other tasks at ferrara verona and ravenna and at last at avignon where he became acquainted with petrarchworking there for some three years from 1324 to 132710 and then passed rapidly through florence and orvieto on his way to naples where he received the kindest welcome from the good king robert the king ever partial to men of mind and genius took especial delight in giottos society and used frequently to visit him while working in the castello delluovo taking pleasure in watching his pencil and listening to his discourse and giotto says vasari who had ever his repartee and bonmot ready held him there fascinated at once with the magic of his pencil and pleasantry of his tongue we are not told the length of his sojourn at naples but it must have been for a considerable period judging from the quantity of works he executed there he had certainly returned to florence in 1332 there he was immediately appointed chief master of the works of the duomo then in progress with a yearly salary of one hundred gold florins and the privilege of citizenship he designed the campanile in a more perfect form than that which now exists for his intended spire 150 feet in height never was erected he however modelled the basreliefs for the base of the building and sculptured two of them with his own hand it was afterwards completed with the exception of the spire according to his design but he only saw its foundations laid and its first marble story rise he died at florence on the 8th of january 1337 full of honour happy perhaps in departing at the zenith of his strength when his eye had not become dim nor his natural force abated he was buried in the cathedral at the angle nearest his campanile and thus the tower which is the chief grace of his native city may be regarded as his own sepulchral monument  footnote 9 lord lindsays evidence on this point christian art vol ii p 174 seems quite conclusive it is impossible to overrate the value of the work of giotto in the bargello both for its own intrinsic beauty and as being executed in this year which is not only that in which the divina commedia opens but as i think the culminating period in the history of the art of the middle ages  footnote 10 christian art vol ii p 242  i may refer the reader to the close of lord lindsays letter on giotto11 from which i have drawn most of the particulars above stated for a very beautiful sketch of his character and his art of the real rank of that art in the abstract i do not feel myself capable of judging accurately having not seen his finest works at assisi and naples nor carefully studied even those at florence but i may be permitted to point out one or two peculiar characteristics in it which have always struck me forcibly  footnote 11 christian art p 260  in the first place giotto never finished highly he was not indeed a loose or sketchy painter but he was by no means a delicate one his lines as the story of the circle would lead us to expect are always firm but they are never fine even in his smallest tempera pictures the touch is bold and somewhat heavy in his fresco work the handling is much broader than that of contemporary painters corresponding somewhat to the character of many of the figures representing plain masculine kind of people and never reaching any thing like the ideal refinement of the conceptions even of benozzo gozzoli far less of angelico or francia for this reason the character of his painting is better expressed by bold woodengravings than in general it is likely to be by any other means  again he was a very noble colourist and in his peculiar feeling for breadth of hue resembled titian more than any other of the florentine school that is to say had he been born two centuries later when the art of painting was fully known i believe he would have treated his subjects much more like titian than like raphael in fact the frescoes of titian in the chapel beside the church of st antonio at padua are in all technical qualities and in many of their conceptions almost exactly what i believe giotto would have done had he lived in titians time as it was he of course never attained either richness or truth of colour but in serene brilliancy he is not easily rivalled invariably massing his hues in large fields limiting them firmly and then filling them with subtle gradation he had the venetian fondness for bars and stripes not unfrequently casting barred colours obliquely across the draperies of an upright figure from side to side as very notably in the dress of one of the musicians who are playing to the dancing of herodias daughter in one of his frescoes at santa croce and this predilection was mingled with the truly mediæval love of quartering12 the figure of the madonna in the small tempera pictures in the academy at florence is always completely divided into two narrow segments by her darkblue robe  footnote 12 i use this heraldic word in an inaccurate sense knowing no other that will express what i meanthe division of the picture into quaint segments of alternating colour more marked than any of the figure outlines  and this is always to be remembered in looking at any engravings from the works of giotto for the injury they sustain in being deprived of their colour is far greater than in the case of later designers all works produced in the fourteenth century agree in being more or less decorative they were intended in most instances to be subservient to architectural effect and were executed in the manner best calculated to produce a striking impression when they were seen in a mass the painted wall and the painted window were part and parcel of one magnificent whole and it is as unjust to the work of giotto or of any contemporary artist to take out a single feature from the series and represent it in black and white on a separate page as it would be to take out a compartment of a noble coloured window and engrave it in the same manner what is at once refined and effective if seen at the intended distance in unison with the rest of the work becomes coarse and insipid when seen isolated and near and the more skilfully the design is arranged so as to give full value to the colours which are introduced in it the more blank and cold will it become when it is deprived of them  in our modern art we have indeed lost sight of one great principle which regulated that of the middle ages namely that chiaroscuro and colour are incompatible in their highest degrees wherever chiaroscuro enters colour must lose some of its brilliancy there is no shade in a rainbow nor in an opal nor in a piece of motherofpearl nor in a welldesigned painted window only various hues of perfect colour the best pictures by subduing their colour and conventionalising their chiaroscuro reconcile both in their diminished degrees but a perfect light and shade cannot be given without considerable loss of liveliness in colour hence the supposed inferiority of tintoret to titian tintoret is in reality the greater colourist of the two but he could not bear to falsify his light and shadow enough to set off his colour titian nearly strikes the exact mean between the painted glass of the 13th century and rembrandt while giotto closely approaches the system of painted glass and hence his compositions lose grievously by being translated into black and white  but even this chiaroscuro however subdued is not without a peculiar charm and the accompanying engravings possess a marked superiority over all that have hitherto been made from the works of this painter in rendering this chiaroscuro as far as possible together with the effect of the local colours the true appreciation of art has been retarded for many years by the habit of trusting to outlines as a sufficient expression of the sentiment of compositions whereas in all truly great designs of whatever age it is never the outline but the disposition of the masses whether of shade or colour on which the real power of the work depends for instance in plate iii the angel appears to anna the interest of the composition depends entirely upon the broad shadows which fill the spaces of the chamber and of the external passage in which the attendant is sitting this shade explains the whole scene in a moment gives prominence to the curtain and coverlid of the homely bed and the rude chest and trestles which form the poor furniture of the house and conducts the eye easily and instantly to the three figures which had the scene been expressed in outline only we should have had to trace out with some care and difficulty among the pillars of the loggia and folds of the curtains so also the relief of the faces in light against the dark sky is of peculiar value in the compositions no x and no xii  the drawing of giotto is of course exceedingly faulty his knowledge of the human figure is deficient and this the necessary drawback in all works of the period occasions an extreme difficulty in rendering them faithfully in an engraving for wherever there is good and legitimate drawing the ordinary education of a modern draughtsman enables him to copy it with tolerable accuracy but when once the true forms of nature are departed from it is by no means easy to express exactly the error and no more than the error of his original in most cases modern copyists try to modify or hide the weaknesses of the old artby which procedure they very often wholly lose its spirit and only half redeem its defects the results being of course at once false as representations and intrinsically valueless and just as it requires great courage and skill in an interpreter to speak out honestly all the rough and rude words of the first speaker and to translate deliberately and resolutely in the face of attentive men the expressions of his weakness or impatience so it requires at once the utmost courage and skill in a copyist to trace faithfully the failures of an imperfect master in the front of modern criticism and against the inborn instincts of his own hand and eye and let him do the best he can he will still find that the grace and life of his original are continually flying off like a vapour while all the faults he has so diligently copied sit rigidly staring him in the facea terrible caput mortuum it is very necessary that this should be well understood by the members of the arundel society when they hear their engravings severely criticised it is easy to produce an agreeable engraving by graceful infidelities but the entire endeavour of the draughtsmen employed by this society has been to obtain accurately the character of the original and he who never proposes to himself to rise above the work he is copying must most assuredly often fall beneath it such fall is the inherent and inevitable penalty on all absolute copyism and wherever the copy is made with sincerity the fall must be endured with patience it will never be an utter or a degrading fall that is reserved for those who like vulgar translators wilfully quit the hand of their master and have no strength of their own  lastly it is especially to be noticed that these works of giotto in common with all others of the period are independent of all the inferior sources of pictorial interest they never show the slightest attempt at imitative realisation they are simple suggestions of ideas claiming no regard except for the inherent value of the thoughts there is no filling of the landscape with variety of scenery architecture or incident as in the works of benozzo gozzoli or perugino no wealth of jewellery and gold spent on the dresses of the figures as in the delicate labours of angelico or gentile da fabriano the background is never more than a few gloomy masses of rock with a tree or two and perhaps a fountain the architecture is merely what is necessary to explain the scene the dresses are painted sternly on the heroic principle of sir joshua reynoldsthat drapery is to be drapery and nothing morethere is no silk nor velvet nor distinguishable material of any kind the whole power of the picture is rested on the three simple essentials of paintingpure colour noble form noble thought  we moderns educated in reality far more under the influence of the dutch masters than the italian and taught to look for realisation in all things have been in the habit of casting scorn on these early italian works as if their simplicity were the result of ignorance merely when we know a little more of art in general we shall begin to suspect that a man of giottos power of mind did not altogether suppose his clusters of formal trees or diminutive masses of architecture to be perfect representations of the woods of judea or of the streets of jerusalem we shall begin to understand that there is a symbolical art which addresses the imagination as well as a realist art which supersedes it and that the powers of contemplation and conception which could be satisfied or excited by these simple types of natural things were infinitely more majestic than those which are so dependent on the completeness of what is presented to them as to be paralysed by an error in perspective or stifled by the absence of atmosphere  nor is the healthy simplicity of the period less marked in the selection than in the treatment of subjects it has in these days become necessary for the painter who desires popularity to accumulate on his canvas whatever is startling in aspect or emotion and to drain even to exhaustion the vulgar sources of the pathetic modern sentiment at once feverish and feeble remains unawakened except by the violences of gaiety or gloom and the eye refuses to pause except when it is tempted by the luxury of beauty or fascinated by the excitement of terror it ought not therefore to be without a respectful admiration that we find the masters of the fourteenth century dwelling on moments of the most subdued and tender feeling and leaving the spectator to trace the undercurrents of thought which link them with future events of mightier interest and fill with a prophetic power and mystery scenes in themselves so simple as the meeting of a master with his herdsmen among the hills or the return of a betrothed virgin to her house  illustration  it is however to be remembered that this quietness in character of subject was much more possible to an early painter owing to the connection in which his works were to be seen a modern picture isolated and portable must rest all its claims to attention on its own actual subject but the pictures of the early masters were nearly always parts of a consecutive and stable series in which many were subdued like the connecting passages of a prolonged poem in order to enhance the value or meaning of others the arrangement of the subjects in the arena chapel is in this respect peculiarly skilful and to that arrangement we must now direct our attention  illustration interior of the arena chapel padua looking eastward  it was before noticed that the chapel was built between 1300 and 1306 the architecture of italy in the beginning of the fourteenth century is always pure and often severe but this chapel is remarkable even among the severest forms for the absence of decoration its plan seen in the marginal figure on p 26 is a pure oblong with a narrow advanced tribune terminating in a trilateral apse selvatico quotes from the german writer stieglitz some curious observations on the apparent derivation of its proportions in common with those of other buildings of the time from the number of sides of its apse without entering into these particulars it may be noted that the apse is just onehalf the width of the body of the chapel and that the length from the extremity of the tribune to the west end is just seven times the width of the apse the whole of the body of the chapel was painted by giotto the walls and roof being entirely covered either with his figuredesigns or with various subordinate decorations connecting and enclosing them  the woodcut on p 27 represents the arrangement of the frescoes on the sides extremities and roof of the chapel the spectator is supposed to be looking from the western entrance towards the tribune having on his right the south side which is pierced by six tall windows and on which the frescoes are therefore reduced in number the north side is pierced by no windows and on it therefore the frescoes are continuous lighted from the south windows the several spaces numbered 1 to 38 are occupied by a continuous series of subjects representing the life of the virgin and of christ the narrow panels below marked a b c c are filled by figures of the cardinal virtues and their opponent vices on the lunette above the tribune is painted a christ in glory and at the western extremity the last judgment thus the walls of the chapel are covered with a continuous meditative poem on the mystery of the incarnation the acts of redemption the vices and virtues of mankind as proceeding from their scorn or acceptance of that redemption and their final judgment  the first twelve pictures of the series are exclusively devoted to the apocryphal history of the birth and life of the virgin this the protestant spectator will observe perhaps with little favour more especially as only two compartments are given to the ministry of christ between his baptism and entry into jerusalem due weight is however to be allowed to lord lindsays remark that the legendary history of the virgin was of peculiar importance in this chapel as especially dedicated to her service and i think also that giotto desired to unite the series of compositions in one continuous action feeling that to have enlarged on the separate miracles of christs ministry would have interrupted the onward course of thought as it is the mind is led from the first humiliation of joachim to the ascension of christ in one unbroken and progressive chain of scenes the ministry of christ being completely typified by his first and last conspicuous miracle while the very unimportance of some of the subjects as for instance that of the watching the rods is useful in directing the spectator rather to pursue the course of the narrative than to pause in satisfied meditation upon any single incident and it can hardly be doubted that giotto had also a peculiar pleasure in dwelling on the circumstances of the shepherd life of the father of the virgin owing to its resemblance to that of his own early years  the incidents represented in these first twelve paintings are recorded in the two apocryphal gospels known as the protevangelion and gospel of st mary13 but on comparing the statements in these writings which by the by are in nowise consistent with each other with the paintings in the arena chapel it appeared to me that giotto must occasionally have followed some more detailed traditions than are furnished by either of them seeing that of one or two subjects the apocryphal gospels gave no distinct or sufficient explanation fortunately however in the course of some other researches i met with a manuscript in the british museum harl 3571 containing a complete history of the most holy family written in northern italian of about the middle of the 14th century and appearing to be one of the forms of the legend which giotto has occasionally followed in preference to the statements of the protevangelion i have therefore in illustration of the paintings given when it seemed useful some portions of this manuscript and these with one or two verses of the commonly received accounts will be found generally enough to interpret sufficiently the meaning of the painter  footnote 13 it has always appeared strange to me that ecclesiastical history should possess no more authentic records of the life of the virgin before the period at which the narrative of st luke commences than these apocryphal gospels which are as wretched in style as untrustworthy in matter and are evidently nothing more than a collection in rude imitation of the style of the evangelists of such floating traditions as became current among the weak christians of the earlier ages when their inquiries respecting the history of mary were met by the obscurity under which the divine will had veiled her humble person and character there must always be something painful to those who are familiar with the scriptures in reading these feeble and foolish mockeries of the manner of the inspired writers but it will be proper nevertheless to give the exact words in which the scenes represented by giotto were recorded to him  the following complete list of the subjects will at once enable the reader to refer any of them to its place in the series and on the walls of the building and i have only now to remind him in conclusion that within those walls the greatest painter and greatest poet of mediæval italy held happy companionship during the time when the frescoes were executed it is not difficult says the writer already so often quoted lord lindsay gazing on these silent but eloquent walls to repeople them with the group once as we know five hundred years ago assembled within them giotto intent upon his work his wife ciuta admiring his progress and dante with abstracted eye alternately conversing with his friend and watching the gambols of the children playing on the grass before the door                                       series of subjects   1 the rejection of joachims offering  2 joachim retires to the sheepfold  3 the angel appears to anna  4 the sacrifice of joachim  5 the vision of joachim  6 the meeting at the golden gate  7 the birth of the virgin  8 the presentation of the virgin  9 the rods are brought to the high priest 10 the watching of the rods 11 the betrothal of the virgin 12 the virgin returns to her house 13 the angel gabriel 14 the virgin annunciate 15 the salutation 16 the angel appearing to the shepherds 17 the wise mens offering 18 the presentation in the temple 19 the flight into egypt 20 the massacre of the innocents 21 the young christ in the temple 22 the baptism of christ 23 the marriage in cana 24 the raising of lazarus 25 the entry into jerusalem 26 the expulsion from the temple 27 the hiring of judas 28 the last supper 29 the washing of the feet 30 the kiss of judas 31 christ before caiaphas 32 the scourging of christ 33 christ bearing his cross 34 the crucifixion 35 the entombment 36 the resurrection 37 the ascension 38 the descent of the holy spirit                                       i  the rejection of joachims offering  at that time there was a man of perfect holiness named joachim of the tribe of juda and of the city of jerusalem and this joachim had in contempt the riches and honours of the world and for greater despite to them he kept his flocks with his shepherds   and he being so holy and just divided the fruits which he received from his flocks into three parts a third partwool and lambs and such likehe gave to god that is to say to those who served god and who ministered in the temple of god another third part he gave to widows orphans and pilgrims the remaining third he kept for himself and his family and he persevering in this god so multiplied and increased his goods that there was no man like him in the land of israel and having come to the age of twenty years he took to wife anna the daughter of ysaya of his own tribe and of the lineage of david  this precious st anna had always persevered in the service of god with great wisdom and sincerity  and having received joachim for her husband was subject to him and gave him honour and reverence living in the fear of god and joachim having lived with his wife anna for twenty years yet having no child and there being a great solemnity in jerusalem all the men of the city went to offer in the temple of god which solomon had built and joachim entering the temple with incense and other gifts to offer on the altar and joachim having made his offering the minister of the temple whose name was issachar threw joachims offering from off the altar and drove joachim out of the temple saying thou joachim art not worthy to enter into the temple seeing that god has not added his blessing to you as in your life you have had no seed thus joachim received a great insult in the sight of all the people and he being all ashamed returned to his house weeping and lamenting most bitterly ms harl  the gospel of st mary differs from this ms in its statement of the respective cities of joachim and anna saying that the family of the virgins father was of galilee and of the city of nazareth the family of her mother was of bethlehem it is less interesting in details but gives a better or at least more graceful account of joachims repulse saying that issachar despised joachim and his offerings and asked him why he who had no children would presume to appear among those who had adding that his offerings could never be acceptable to god since he had been judged by him unworthy to have children the scripture having said cursed is every one who shall not beget a male in israel  giotto seems to have followed this latter account as the figure of the high priest is far from being either ignoble or ungentle  the temple is represented by the two most important portions of a byzantine church namely the ciborium which covered the altar and the pulpit or reading desk with the low screen in front of the altar enclosing the part of the church called the cancellum lord lindsay speaks of the priest within this enclosure as confessing a young man who kneels at his feet it seems to me rather that he is meant to be accepting the offering of another worshipper so as to mark the rejection of joachim more distinctly                                       ii  joachim retires to the sheepfold  then joachim in the following night resolved to separate himself from companionship to go to the desert places among the mountains with his flocks and to inhabit those mountains in order not to hear such insults and immediately joachim rose from his bed and called about him all his servants and shepherds and caused to be gathered together all his flocks and goats and horses and oxen and what other beasts he had and went with them and with the shepherds into the hills and anna his wife remained at home disconsolate and mourning for her husband who had departed from her in such sorrow ms harl  but upon inquiry he found that all the righteous had raised up seed in israel then he called to mind the patriarch abrahamhow that god in the end of his life had given him his son isaac upon which he was exceedingly distressed and would not be seen by his wife but retired into the wilderness and fixed his tent there and fasted forty days and forty nights saying to himself i will not go down to eat or drink till the lord my god shall look down upon me but prayer shall be my meat and drink protevangelion chap i  giotto seems here also to have followed the ordinary tradition as he has represented joachim retiring unattendedbut met by two of his shepherds who are speaking to each other uncertain what to do or how to receive their master the dog hastens to meet him with joy the figure of joachim is singularly beautiful in its pensiveness and slow motion and the ignobleness of the herdsmens figures is curiously marked in opposition to the dignity of their master                                       iii  the angel appears to anna  afterwards the angel appeared to anna his wife saying fear not neither think that which you see is a spirit for i am that angel who hath offered up your prayers and alms before god and am now sent to tell you that a daughter will be born unto you arise therefore and go up to jerusalem and when you shall come to that which is called the golden gate because it is gilt with gold as a sign of what i have told you you shall meet your husband for whose safety you have been so much concerned gospel of st mary chap iii 17  the accounts in the protevangelion and in the harleian ms are much expanded relating how anna feared her husband was dead he having been absent from her five months and how judith her maid taunted her with her childlessness and how going then into her garden she saw a sparrows nest full of young upon a laureltree and mourning within herself said i am not comparable to the very beasts of the earth for even they are fruitful before thee o lord i am not comparable to the very earth for the earth produces its fruits to praise thee then the angel of the lord stood by her c  both the protevangelion and harleian ms agree in placing the vision in the garden the latter adding that she fled into her chamber in great fear and fell upon her bed and lay as in a trance all that day and all that night but did not tell the vision to her maid because of her bitter answering giotto has deviated from both accounts in making the vision appear to anna in her chamber while the maid evidently being considered an important personage is at work in the passage apart from all reference to the legends there is something peculiarly beautiful in the simplicity of giottos conception and in the way in which he has shown the angel entering at the window without the least endeavour to impress our imagination by darkness or light or clouds or any other accessory as though believing that angels might appear any where and any day and to all men as a matter of course if we would ask them or were fit company for them                                       iv  the sacrifice of joachim  the account of this sacrifice is only given clearly in the harleian ms but even this differs from giottos series in the order of the visions as the subject of the next plate is recorded first in this ms under the curious heading disse sancto theofilo como langelo de dio aperse a joachim lo qual li anuntia la nativita della vergene maria while the record of this vision and sacrifice is headed como langelo de dio aparse anchora a joachim it then proceeds thus at this very moment of the day when the angel appeared to anna there appeared a most beautiful youth unno belitissimo zovene among the mountains there where joachim was and said to joachim wherefore dost thou not return to thy wife and joachim answered these twenty years god has given me no fruit of her wherefore i was chased from the temple with infinite shame and as long as i live i will give alms of my flocks to widows and pilgrims and these words being finished the youth answered i am the angel of god who appeared to thee the other time for a sign and appeared to thy wife anna who always abides in prayer weeping day and night and i have consoled her wherefore i command thee to observe the commandments of god and his will which i tell you truly that of thee shall be born a daughter and that thou shalt offer her to the temple of god and the holy spirit shall rest upon her and her blessedness shall be above the blessedness of all virgins and her holiness so great that human nature will not be able to comprehend it14  footnote 14 this passage in the old italian of the ms may interest some readers e complice queste parole lo zovene respoxe dignando io son langelo de dio lo quale si te aparse laltra fiada in segno e aparse a toa mulier anna che sempre sta in oration plauzando di e note e si lo consolada unde io te comando che tu debie observare li comandimenti de dio ela soua volunta che io te dico veramente che de la toa somenza insera una fiola e questa offrila al templo de dio e lo spirito santo reposera in ley ela soa beatitudine sera sovera tute le altre verzene ela soua santita sera si grande che natura humana non la pora comprendere  then joachim fell upon the earth saying my lord i pray thee to pray god for me and to enter into this my tabernacle and bless me thy servant the angel answered we are all the servants of god and know that my eating would be invisible and my drinking could not be seen by all the men in the world but of all that thou wouldest give to me do thou make sacrifice to god then joachim took a lamb without spot or blemish  and when he had made sacrifice of it the angel of the lord disappeared and ascended into heaven and joachim fell upon the earth in great fear and lay from the sixth hour until the evening  this is evidently nothing more than a very vapid imitation of the scriptural narrative of the appearances of angels to abraham and manoah but giotto has put life into it and i am aware of no other composition in which so much interest and awe has been given to the literal burnt sacrifice in all other representations of such offerings which i remember the interest is concentrated in the slaying of the victim but giotto has fastened on the burning of it showing the white skeleton left on the altar and the fire still hurtling up round it typical of the divine wrath which is as a consuming fire and thus rendering the sacrifice a more clear and fearful type not merely of the outward wounds and death of christ but of his soulsuffering all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels15  footnote 15 note by a friendto me the most striking part of it is that the skeleton is entire a bone of him shall not be broken and that the head stands up still looking to the skies is it too fanciful to see a meaning in this  the hand of the deity is seen in the heavensthe sign of the divine presence                                       v  the angel raphael appears to joachim  now joachim being in this pain the lord god father of mercy who abandons not his servants nor ever fails to console them in their distresses if they pray for his grace and pity had compassion on joachim and heard his prayer and sent the angel raphael from heaven to earth to console him and announce to him the nativity of the virgin mary therefore the angel raphael appeared to joachim and comforted him with much peace and foretold to him the birth of the virgin in that glory and gladness saying god save you o friend of god o joachim the lord has sent me to declare to you an everlasting joy and a hope that shall have no end and having finished these words the angel of the lord disappeared from him and ascended into the heaven ms harl  the passage which i have omitted is merely one of the ordinary romanist accounts of the immaculate conception of the virgin put into the form of prophecy there are no sufficient details of this part of the legend either in the protevangelion or gospel of st mary but it is quite clear that giotto followed it and that he has endeavoured to mark a distinction in character between the angels gabriel and raphael16 in the two subjectsthe form of raphael melting back into the heaven and being distinctly recognised as angelic while gabriel appears invested with perfect humanity it is interesting to observe that the shepherds who of course are not supposed to see the form of the angel his manifestation being only granted to joachim during his sleep are yet evidently under the influence of a certain degree of awe and expectation as being conscious of some presence other than they can perceive while the animals are unconscious altogether  footnote 16 the ms makes the angel raphael the only messenger giotto clearly adopts the figure of gabriel from the protevangelion                                       vi  the meeting at the golden gate  and joachim went down with the shepherds and anna stood by the gate and saw joachim coming with the shepherds and she ran and hanging about his neck said now i know that the lord hath greatly blessed me protevangelion iv 8 9  this is one of the most celebrated of giottos compositions and deservedly so being full of the most solemn grace and tenderness the face of st anna half seen is most touching in its depth of expression and it is very interesting to observe how giotto has enhanced its sweetness by giving a harder and grosser character than is usual with him to the heads of the other two principal female figures not but that this cast of feature is found frequently in the figures of somewhat earlier art and by the rough and weatherbeaten countenance of the entering shepherd in like manner the falling lines of the draperies owe a great part of their value to the abrupt and ugly oblongs of the horizontal masonry which adjoins them                                       vii  the birth of the virgin  and joachim said now i know that the lord is propitious to me and hath taken away all my sins and he went down from the temple of the lord justified and went to his own house  and when nine months were fulfilled to anna she brought forth and said to the midwife what have i brought forth and she told her a girl  then anna said the lord hath this day magnified my soul and she laid her in the bed protevangelion v 48  the composition is very characteristic of giotto in two respects first in its natural homeliness and simplicity in older designs of the same subject the little madonna is represented as born with a golden crown on her head and secondly in the smallness of the breast and head of the sitting figure on the righta fault of proportion often observable in giottos figures of children or young girls  for the first time also in this series we have here two successive periods of the scene represented simultaneously the babe being painted twice this practice was frequent among the early painters and must necessarily become so wherever painting undertakes the task of lengthened narrative much absurd discussion has taken place respecting its propriety the whole question being simply whether the human mind can or cannot pass from the contemplation of one event to that of another without reposing itself on an intermediate gilt frame                                       viii  the presentation of the virgin  and when three years were expired and the time of her weaning complete they brought the virgin to the temple of the lord with offerings  and there were about the temple according to the fifteen psalms of degrees fifteen stairs to ascend  the parents of the blessed virgin and infant mary put her upon one of these stairs but while they were putting off their clothes in which they had travelled in the meantime the virgin of the lord in such a manner went up all the stairs one after another without the help of any one to lead her or lift her that any one would have judged from hence that she was of perfect age gospel of st mary iv 16  there seems nothing very miraculous in a childs walking up stairs at three years old but this incident is a favourite one among the romancatholic painters of every period generally however representing the child as older than in the legend and dwelling rather on the solemn feeling with which she presents herself to the highpriest than on the mere fact of her being able to walk alone giotto has clearly regarded the incident entirely in this light for st anna touches the childs arm as if to support her so that the socalled miraculous walking is not even hinted at  lord lindsay particularly notices that the virgin is a dwarf woman instead of a child the delineation of childhood was one of the latest triumphs of art even in the time of those latest triumphs however the same fault was committed in another way and a boy of eight or ten was commonly representedeven by raffaelle himselfas a dwarf hercules with all the gladiatorial muscles already visible in stunted rotundity giotto probably felt he had not power enough to give dignity to a child of three years old and intended the womanly form to be rather typical of the virgins advanced mind than an actual representation of her person                                       ix  the rods are brought to the highpriest  then he the highpriest appointed that all the men of the house and family of david who were marriageable and not married should bring their several rods to the altar and out of whatsoever persons rod after it was brought a flower should bud forth and on the top of it the spirit of the lord should sit in the appearance of a dove he should be the man to whom the virgin should be given and be betrothed to her gospel of st mary v 16 17  there has originally been very little interest in this composition and the injuries which it has suffered have rendered it impossible for the draughtsman to distinguish the true folds of the draperies amidst the defaced and worn colours of the fresco so that the character of the central figure is lost the only points requiring notice are first the manner in which st joseph holds his rod depressing and halfconcealing it17 while the other suitors present theirs boldly and secondly the graceful though monotonous grouping of the heads of the crowd behind him this mode of rendering the presence of a large multitude showing only the crowns of the heads in complicated perspective was long practised in mosaics and illuminations before the time of giotto and always possesses a certain degree of sublimity in its power of suggesting perfect unity of feeling and movement among the crowd  footnote 17 in the next chapter it is said that joseph drew back his rod when every one else presented his                                       x  the watching of the rods at the altar  after the highpriest had received their rods he went into the temple to pray  and when he had finished his prayer he took the rods and went forth and distributed them and there was no miracle attended them  the last rod was taken by joseph and behold a dove proceeded out of the rod and flew upon the head of joseph protevangelion viii 911  this is among the least graceful designs of the series though the clumsiness in the contours of the leading figures is indeed a fault which often occurs in the painters best works but it is here unredeemed by the rest of the composition the group of the suitors however represented as waiting at the outside of the temple is very beautiful in its earnestness more especially in the passionate expression of the figure in front it is difficult to look long at the picture without feeling a degree of anxiety and strong sympathy with the silent watching of the suitors and this is a sign of no small power in the work the head of joseph is seen far back on the extreme left thus indicating by its position his humility and desire to withdraw from the trial                                       xi  the betrothal of the virgin  there is no distinct notice of this event in the apocryphal gospel the traditional representation of it is nearly always more or less similar lord lindsays account of the composition before us is as follows  the highpriest standing in front of the altar joins their hands behind the virgin stand her bridesmaids behind st joseph the unsuccessful suitors one of whom steps forward to strike him and another breaks his rod on his knee joseph bears his own rod on the flower of which the holy spirit rests in the semblance of a dove  the development of this subject by perugino for raffaelles picture in the brera is little more than a modified copy of peruginos now at caen is well known but notwithstanding all its beauty there is not i think any thing in the action of the disappointed suitors so perfectly true or touching as that of the youth breaking his rod in this composition of giottos nor is there among any of the figures the expression of solemn earnestness and intentness on the event which is marked among the attendants here and in the countenances of the officiating priests                                       xii  the virgin mary returns to her house  accordingly the usual ceremonies of betrothing being over he joseph returned to his own city of bethlehem to set his house in order and to make the needful provisions for the marriage but the virgin of the lord mary with seven other virgins of the same age who had been weaned at the same time and who had been appointed to attend her by the priest returned to her parents house in galilee gospel of st mary vi 6 7  of all the compositions in the arena chapel i think this the most characteristic of the noble time in which it was done it is not so notable as exhibiting the mind of giotto which is perhaps more fully seen in subjects representing varied emotion as in the simplicity and repose which were peculiar to the compositions of the early fourteenth century in order to judge of it fairly it ought first to be compared with any classical compositionwith a portion for instance of the elgin friezewhich would instantly make manifest in it a strange seriousness and dignity and slowness of motion resulting chiefly from the excessive simplicity of all its terminal lines observe for instance the pure wave from the back of the virgins head to the ground and again the delicate swelling line along her shoulder and left arm opposed to the nearly unbroken fall of the drapery of the figure in front it should then be compared with an egyptian or ninevite series of figures which by contrast would bring out its perfect sweetness and grace as well as its variety of expression finally it should be compared with any composition subsequent to the time of raffaelle in order to feel its noble freedom from pictorial artifice and attitude these three comparisons cannot be made carefully without a sense of profound reverence for the national spirit18 which could produce a design so majestic and yet remain content with one so simple  footnote 18 national because giottos works are properly to be looked on as the fruit of their own age and the food of that which followed  the small loggia of the virgins house is noticeable as being different from the architecture introduced in the other pictures and more accurately representing the italian gothic of the dwellinghouse of the period the arches of the windows have no capitals but this omission is either to save time or to prevent the background from becoming too conspicuous all the real buildings designed by giotto have the capital completely developed                                       xiii  the annunciationthe angel gabriel  this figure is placed on one side of the arch at the east end of the body of the chapel the corresponding figure of the virgin being set on the other side it was a constant practice of the mediæval artists thus to divide this subject which indeed was so often painted that the meaning of the separated figures of the angel and mary was as well understood as when they were seen in juxtaposition indeed on the two sides of this arch they would hardly be considered as separated since very frequently they were set to answer to each other from the opposite extremities of a large space of architecture19  footnote 19 as for instance on the two opposite angles of the façade of the cathedral of rheims  the figure of the angel is notable chiefly for its serenity as opposed to the later conceptions of the scene in which he sails into the chamber upon the wing like a stooping falcon  the building above is more developed than in any other of the arena paintings but it must always remain a matter of question why so exquisite a designer of architecture as giotto should introduce forms so harsh and meagre into his backgrounds possibly he felt that the very faults of the architecture enhanced the grace and increased the importance of the figures at least the proceeding seems to me inexplicable on any other theory20  footnote 20 note by a friend i suppose you will not admit as an explanation that he had not yet turned his mind to architectural composition the campanile being some thirty years later                                       xiv  the annunciationthe virgin mary  vasari in his notice of one of giottos annunciations praises him for having justly rendered the fear of the virgin at the address of the angel if he ever treated the subject in such a manner he departed from all the traditions of his time for i am aware of no painting of this scene during the course of the thirteenth and following centuries which does not represent the virgin as perfectly tranquil receiving the message of the angel in solemn thought and gentle humility but without a shadow of fear it was reserved for the painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to change angelic majesty into reckless impetuosity and maiden meditation into panic dread  the face of the virgin is slightly disappointing giotto never reached a very high standard of beauty in feature depending much on distant effect in all his works and therefore more on general arrangement of colour and sincerity of gesture than on refinement of drawing in the countenance                                       xv  the salutation  this picture placed beneath the figure of the virgin annunciate at the east end of the chapel and necessarily small as will be seen by the plan in consequence of the space occupied by the arch which it flanks begins the second or lower series of frescoes being at the same time the first of the great chain of more familiar subjects in which we have the power of comparing the conceptions of giotto not only with the designs of earlier ages but with the efforts which subsequent masters have made to exalt or vary the ideas of the principal scenes in the life of the virgin and of christ the two paintings of the angel gabriel and the virgin annunciate hardly provoke such a comparison being almost statuelike in the calm subjection of all dramatic interest to the symmetrical dignity and beauty of the two figures leading as they do the whole system of the decoration of the chapel but this of the salutation is treated with no such reference to the architecture and at once challenges comparison with the works of later masters  nor is the challenge feebly maintained i have no hesitation in saying that among all the renderings of this scene which now exist i remember none which gives the pure depth and plain facts of it so perfectly as this of giottos of majestic women bowing themselves to beautiful and meek girls both wearing gorgeous robes in the midst of lovely scenery or at the doors of palladian palaces we have enough but i do not know any picture which seems to me to give so truthful an idea of the action with which elizabeth and mary must actually have metwhich gives so exactly the way in which elizabeth would stretch her arms and stoop and gaze into marys face and the way in which marys hand would slip beneath elizabeths arms and raise her up to kiss her i know not any elizabeth so full of intense love and joy and humbleness hardly any madonna in which tenderness and dignity are so quietly blended she not less humble and yet accepting the reverence of elizabeth as her appointed portion saying in her simplicity and truth he that is mighty hath magnified me and holy is his name the longer that this group is looked upon the more it will be felt that giotto has done well to withdraw from it nearly all accessories of landscape and adornment and to trust it to the power of its own deep expression we may gaze upon the two silent figures until their silence seems to be broken and the words of the question and reply sound in our ears low as if from far away  whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me  my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour                                       xvi  the nativity  i am not sure whether i shall do well or kindly in telling the reader anything about this beautiful design perhaps the less he knows about early art or early traditions the more deeply he will feel its purity and truth for there is scarcely an incident here or anything in the manner of representing the incidents which is not mentioned or justified in scripture the bold hilly background reminds us that bethlehem was in the hillcountry of judah but it may seem to have two purposes besides this literal one the first that it increases the idea of exposure and loneliness in the birth of christ the second that the masses of the great hills with the angels floating round them in the horizontal clouds may in some sort represent to our thoughts the power and space of that heaven and earth whose lord is being laid in the mangercradle  there is an exquisite truth and sweetness in the way the virgin turns upon the couch in order herself to assist in laying the child down giotto is in this exactly faithful to the scriptural words she wrapped the child in swaddlingclothes and laid him in a manger joseph sits beneath in meditation above the angels all exulting and as it were confused with joy flutter and circle in the air like birdsthree looking up to the fathers throne with praise and thankfulness one stooping to adore the prince of peace one flying to tell the shepherds there is something to me peculiarly affecting in this disorder of theirs even angels as it were breaking their ranks with wonder and not knowing how to utter their gladness and passion of praise there is noticeable here as in all works of this early time a certain confidence in the way in which the angels trust to their wings very characteristic of a period of bold and simple conception modern science has taught us that a wing cannot be anatomically joined to a shoulder and in proportion as painters approach more and more to the scientific as distinguished from the contemplative state of mind they put the wings of their angels on more timidly and dwell with greater emphasis upon the human form and with less upon the wings until these last become a species of decorative appendagea mere sign of an angel but in giottos time an angel was a complete creature as much believed in as a bird and the way in which it would or might cast itself into the air and lean hither and thither upon its plumes was as naturally apprehended as the manner of flight of a chough or a starling hence dantes simple and most exquisite synonym for angel bird of god and hence also a variety and picturesqueness in the expression of the movements of the heavenly hierarchies by the earlier painters ill replaced by the powers of foreshortening and throwing naked limbs into fantastic positions which appear in the cherubic groups of later times  it is needless to point out the frank association of the two eventsthe nativity and appearance of the angel to the shepherds they are constantly thus joined but i do not remember any other example in which they are joined so boldly usually the shepherds are seen in the distance or are introduced in some ornamental border or other inferior place the view of painting as a mode of suggesting relative or consecutive thoughts rather than a realisation of any one scene is seldom so fearlessly asserted even by giotto as here in placing the flocks of the shepherds at the foot of the virgins bed  this bed it will be noticed is on a shelf of rock this is in compliance with the idea founded on the protevangelion and the apocryphal book known as the gospel of infancy that our saviour was born in a cave associated with the scriptural statement that he was laid in a manger of which the apocryphal gospels do not speak  the vain endeavour to exalt the awe of the moment of the saviours birth has turned in these gospels the outhouse of the inn into a species of subterranean chapel full of incense and candles it was after sunset when the old woman the midwife and joseph with her reached the cave and they both went into it and behold it was all filled with light greater than the light of lamps and candles and greater than the light of the sun itself infancy i 9 then a bright cloud overshadowed the cave and the midwife said this day my soul is magnified protevangelion xiv 10 the thirteenth chapter of the protevangelion is however a little more skilful in this attempt at exaltation and leaving her and his sons in the cave joseph went forth to seek a hebrew midwife in the village of bethlehem but as i was going said joseph i looked up into the air and i saw the clouds astonished and the fowls of the air stopping in the midst of their flight and i looked down towards the earth and saw a table spread and workingpeople sitting around it but their hands were on the table and they did not move to eat but all their faces were fixed upwards protevangelion xiii 17  it would of course be absurd to endeavour to institute any comparison between the various pictures of this subject innumerable as they are but i must at least deprecate lord lindsays characterising this design of giottos merely as the byzantine composition it contains indeed nothing more than the materials of the byzantine composition but i know no byzantine nativity which at all resembles it in the grace and life of its action and for full a century after giottos time in northern europe the nativity was represented in a far more conventional manner than this usually only the heads of the ox and ass are seen and they are arranging or holding with their mouths the drapery of the couch of the child who is not being laid in it by the virgin but raised upon a kind of tablet high above her in the centre of the group all these early designs without exception however agree in expressing a certain degree of languor in the figure of the virgin and in making her recumbent on the bed it is not till the fifteenth century that she is represented as exempt from suffering and immediately kneeling in adoration before the child                                       xvii  the wise mens offering  this is a subject which has been so great a favourite with the painters of later periods and on which so much rich incidental invention has been lavished that giottos rendering of it cannot but be felt to be barren it is in fact perhaps the least powerful of all the series and its effect is further marred by what lord lindsay has partly noted the appearanceperhaps accidental but if so exceedingly unskilfulof matronly corpulence in the figure of the madonna the unfortunate failure in the representation of the legs and chests of the camels and the awkwardness of the attempt to render the action of kneeling in the foremost king put the whole composition into the classnot in itself an uninteresting oneof the slips or shortcomings of great masters one incident in it only is worth observing in other compositions of this time and in many later ones the kings are generally presenting their offerings themselves and the child takes them in his hand or smiles at them the painters who thought this an undignified conception left the presents in the hands of the attendants of the magi but giotto considers how presents would be received by an actual king and as what has been offered to a monarch is delivered to the care of his attendants giotto puts a waiting angel to receive the gifts as not worthy to be placed in the hands of the infant                                       xviii  the presentation in the temple  this design is one of those which are peculiarly characteristic of giotto as the head of the naturalisti21 no painter before his time would have dared to represent the child jesus as desiring to quit the arms of simeon or the virgin as in some sort interfering with the prophets earnest contemplation of the child by stretching her arms to receive him the idea is evidently a false one quite unworthy of the higher painters of the religious school and it is a matter of peculiar interest to see what must have been the strength of giottos love of plain facts which could force him to stoop so low in the conception of this most touching scene the child does not it will be observed merely stretch its arm to the madonna but is even struggling to escape violently raising the left foot but there is another incident in the composition witnessing as notably to giottos powerful grasp of all the facts of his subject as this does to his somewhat hard and plain manner of grasping themi mean the angel approaching simeon as if with a message the peculiar interest of the presentation is for the most part inadequately represented in painting because it is impossible to imply the fact of simeons having waited so long in the hope of beholding his lord or to inform the spectator of the feeling in which he utters the song of hope fulfilled giotto has it seems to me done all that he could to make us remember this peculiar meaning of the scene for i think i cannot be deceived in interpreting the flying angel with its branch of palm or lily to be the angel of death sent in visible fulfilment of the thankful words of simeon lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace the figure of anna is poor and uninteresting that of the attendant on the extreme left very beautiful both in its drapery and in the severe and elevated character of the features and headdress  footnote 21 see account of his principles above p 13 head c                                       xix  the flight into egypt  giotto again shows in his treatment of this subject a juster understanding of the probable facts than most other painters it becomes the almost universal habit of later artists to regard the flight as both sudden and secret undertaken by joseph and mary unattended in the dawn of the morning or by night so soon as joseph had awaked from sleep matt ii 14 without a continuous miracle which it is unnecessary in this case to suppose such a lonely journey would have been nearly impracticable nor was instant flight necessary for herods order for the massacre could not be issued until he had been convinced by the protracted absence of the wise men that he was mocked of them in all probability the exact nature and extent of the danger was revealed to joseph and he would make the necessary preparations for his journey with such speed as he could and depart by night indeed but not in the instant of awakening from his dream the ordinary impression seems to have been received from the words of the gospel of infancy go into egypt as soon as the cock crows and the interest of the flight is rendered more thrilling in late compositions by the introduction of armed pursuers giotto has given a far more quiet deliberate and probable character to the whole scene while he has fully marked the fact of divine protection and command in the figure of the guiding angel nor is the picture less interesting in its marked expression of the night the figures are all distinctly seen and there is no broad distribution of the gloom but the vigorous blackness of the dress of the attendant who holds the bridle and the scattered glitter of the lights on the madonnas robe are enough to produce the required effect on the mind  the figure of the virgin is singularly dignified the broad and severe curves traced by the hem and deepest folds of her dress materially conducing to the nobleness of the group the child is partly sustained by a band fastened round the madonnas neck the quaint and delicate pattern on this band together with that of the embroidered edges of the dress is of great value in opposing and making more manifest the severe and grave outlines of the whole figure whose impressiveness is also partly increased by the rise of the mountain just above it like a tent a vulgar composer would have moved this peak to the right or left and lost its power  this mountain background is also of great use in deepening the sense of gloom and danger on the desert road the trees represented as growing on the heights have probably been rendered indistinct by time in early manuscripts such portions are invariably those which suffer most the green on which the leaves were once drawn with dark colours mouldering away and the lines of drawing with it but even in what is here left there is noticeable more careful study of the distinction between the trees with thick spreading foliage the group of two with light branches and few leaves and the tree stripped and dead at the bottom of the ravine than an historical painter would now think it consistent with his dignity to bestow                                       xx  massacre of the innocents  of all the series this composition is the one which exhibits most of giottos weaknesses all early work is apt to fail in the rendering of violent action but giotto is in this instance inferior not only to his successors but to the feeblest of the miniaturepainters of the thirteenth century while his imperfect drawing is seen at its worst in the nude figures of the children it is in fact almost impossible to understand how any italian familiar with the eager gesticulations of the lower orders of his countrywomen on the smallest points of dispute with each other should have been incapable of giving more adequate expression of true action and passion to the group of mothers and if i were not afraid of being accused of special pleading i might insist at some length on a dim faith of my own that giotto thought the actual agony and strivings of the probable scene unfit for pictorial treatment or for common contemplation and that he chose rather to give motionless types and personifications of the soldiers and women than to use his strength and realistic faculty in bringing before the vulgar eye the unseemly struggle or unspeakable pain the formal arrangement of the heap of corpses in the centre of the group the crowded standing of the mothers as in a choir of sorrow the actual presence of herod to whom some of them appear to be appealingall seem to me to mark this intention and to make the composition only a symbol or shadow of the great deed of massacre not a realisation of its visible continuance at any moment i will not press this conjecture but will only add that if it be so i think giotto was perfectly right and that a picture thus conceived might have been deeply impressive had it been more successfully executed and a calmer more continuous comfortless grief expressed in the countenances of the women far better thus than with the horrible analysis of agony and detail of despair with which this same scene one which ought never to have been made the subject of painting at all has been gloated over by artists of more degraded times                                       xxi  the young christ in the temple  this composition has suffered so grievously by time that even the portions of it which remain are seen to the greatest disadvantage little more than various conditions of scar and stain can be now traced where were once the draperies of the figures in the shade and the suspended garland and arches on the right hand of the spectator and in endeavouring not to represent more than there is authority for the draughtsman and engraver have necessarily produced a less satisfactory plate than most others of the series but giotto has also himself fallen considerably below his usual standard the faces appear to be cold and hard and the attitudes are as little graceful as expressive either of attention or surprise the madonnas action stretching her arms to embrace her son is pretty but on the whole the picture has no value and this is the more remarkable as there were fewer precedents of treatment in this case than in any of the others and it might have been anticipated that giotto would have put himself to some pains when the field of thought was comparatively new the subject of christ teaching in the temple rarely occurs in manuscripts but all the others were perpetually repeated in the servicebooks of the period                                       illustration  xxii  the baptism of christ  this is a more interesting work than the last but it is also gravely and strangely deficient in power of entering into the subject and this i think is common with nearly all efforts that have hitherto been made at its representation i have never seen a picture of the baptism by any painter whatever which was not below the average power of the painter and in this conception of giottos the humility of st john is entirely unexpressed and the gesture of christ has hardly any meaning it neither is in harmony with the words suffer it to be so now which must have been uttered before the moment of actual baptism nor does it in the slightest degree indicate the sense in the redeemer of now entering upon the great work of his ministry in the earlier representations of the subject the humility of st john is never lost sight of there will be seen for instance an effort at expressing it by the slightly stooping attitude and bent knee even in the very rude design given in outline on the opposite page i have thought it worth while to set before the reader in this outline one example of the sort of traditional representations which were current throughout christendom before giotto arose this instance is taken from a large choirbook probably of french certainly of northern execution towards the close of the thirteenth century22 and it is a very fair average example of the manner of design in the illuminated work of the period the introduction of the scroll with the legend this is my beloved son is both more true to the scriptural words lo a voice from heaven and more reverent than giottos introduction of the visible figure as a type of the first person of the trinity the boldness with which this type is introduced increases precisely as the religious sentiment of art decreases in the fifteenth century it becomes utterly revolting  footnote 22 the exact date 1290 is given in the titlepage of the volume  i have given this woodcut for another reason also to explain more clearly the mode in which giotto deduced the strange form which he has given to the stream of the jordan in the earlier northern works it is merely a green wave rising to the saviours waist as seen in the woodcut giotto for the sake of getting standingground for his figures gives shores to this wave retaining its swelling form in the centrea very painful and unsuccessful attempt at reconciling typical drawing with laws of perspective or perhaps it is less to be regarded as an effort at progress than as an awkward combination of the eastern and western types of the jordan in the difference between these types there is matter of some interest lord lindsay who merely characterises this work of giottos as the byzantine composition thus describes the usual byzantine manner of representing the baptism  the saviour stands immersed to the middle in jordan flowing between two deep and rocky banks on one of which stands st john pouring the water on his head and on the other two angels hold his robes the holy spirit descends upon him as a dove in a stream of light from god the father usually represented by a hand from heaven two of johns disciples stand behind him as spectators frequently the rivergod of jordan reclines with his oars in the corner in the baptistery at ravenna the rope is supported not by an angel but by the riverdeity jordann iordanes who holds in his left hand a reed as his sceptre  now in this mode of representing rivers there is something more than the mere pagan tradition lingering through the wrecks of the eastern empire a river in the east and south is necessarily recognised more distinctly as a beneficent power than in the west and north the narrowest and feeblest stream is felt to have an influence on the life of mankind and is counted among the possessions or honoured among the deities of the people who dwell beside it hence the importance given in the byzantine compositions to the name and specialty of the jordan stream in the north such peculiar definiteness and importance can never be attached to the name of any single fountain water in its various forms of streamlet rain or river is felt as an universal gift of heaven not as an inheritance of a particular spot of earth hence with the gothic artists generally the personality of the jordan is lost in the green and nameless wave and the simple rite of the baptism is dwelt upon without endeavouring as giotto has done to draw the attention to the rocky shores of bethabara and Ænon or to the fact that there was much water there                                       xxiii  the marriage in cana  it is strange that the sweet significance of this first of the miracles should have been lost sight of by nearly all artists after giotto and that no effort was made by them to conceive the circumstances of it in simplicity the poverty of the family in which the marriage took placeproved sufficiently by the fact that a carpenters wife not only was asked as a chief guest but even had authority over the servantsis shown further to have been distressful or at least embarrassed poverty by their want of wine on such an occasion it was not certainly to remedy an accident of careless provision but to supply a need sorrowfully betraying the narrow circumstances of his hosts that our lord wrought the beginning of miracles many mystic meanings have been sought in the act which though there is no need to deny there is little evidence to certify but we may joyfully accept as its first indisputable meaning that of simple kindness the wine being provided here when needed as the bread and fish were afterwards for the hungry multitudes the whole value of the miracle in its serviceable tenderness is at once effaced when the marriage is supposed as by veronese and other artists of later times to have taken place at the house of a rich man for the rest giotto sufficiently implies by the lifted hand of the madonna and the action of the fingers of the bridegroom as if they held sacramental bread that there lay a deeper meaning under the miracle for those who could accept it how all miracle is accepted by common humanity he has also shown in the figure of the ruler of the feast drinking this unregarding forgetfulness of present spiritual power is similarly marked by veronese by placing the figure of a fool with his bauble immediately underneath that of christ and by making a cat play with her shadow in one of the winevases  it is to be remembered however in examining all pictures of this subject that the miracle was not made manifest to all the gueststo none indeed seemingly except christs own disciples the ruler of the feast and probably most of those present except the servants who drew the water knew or observed nothing of what was passing and merely thought the good wine had been kept until now                                       xxiv  the raising of lazarus  in consequence of the intermediate position which giotto occupies between the byzantine and naturalist schools two relations of treatment are to be generally noted in his work as compared with the byzantines he is a realist whose power consists in the introduction of living character and various incidents modifying the formerly received byzantine symbols so far as he has to do this he is a realist of the purest kind endeavoring always to conceive events precisely as they were likely to have happened not to idealise them into forms artfully impressive to the spectator but in so far as he was compelled to retain or did not wish to reject the figurative character of the byzantine symbols he stands opposed to succeeding realists in the quantity of meaning which probably lies hidden in any composition as well as in the simplicity with which he will probably treat it in order to enforce or guide to this meaning the figures being often letters of a hieroglyphic which he will not multiply lest he should lose in force of suggestion what he gained in dramatic interest  none of the compositions display more clearly this typical and reflective character than that of the raising of lazarus later designers dwell on vulgar conditions of wonder or horror such as they could conceive likely to attend the resuscitation of a corpse but with giotto the physical reanimation is the type of a spiritual one and though shown to be miraculous is yet in all its deeper aspects unperturbed and calm in awfulness it is also visibly gradual his face was bound about with a napkin the nearest apostle has withdrawn the covering from the face and looks for the command which shall restore it from wasted corruption and sealed blindness to living power and light  nor is it i believe without meaning that the two apostles if indeed they are intended for apostles who stand at lazarus side wear a different dress from those who follow christ i suppose them to be intended for images of the christian and jewish churches in their ministration to the dead soul the one removing its bonds but looking to christ for the word and power of life the other inactive and helplessthe veil upon its facein dread while the principal figure fulfils the order it receives in fearless simplicity                                       xxv  the entry into jerusalem  this design suffers much from loss of colour in translation its decorative effect depends on the deep blue ground relieving the delicate foliage and the local colours of dresses and architecture it is also one of those which are most directly opposed to modern feeling the sympathy of the spectator with the passion of the crowd being somewhat rudely checked by the grotesque action of two of the foremost figures we ought however rather to envy the deep seriousness which could not be moved from dwelling on the real power of the scene by any ungracefulness or familiarity of circumstance among men whose minds are rightly toned nothing is ludicrous it must if an act be either right or wrong noble or base if a thing seen it must either be ugly or beautiful and what is either wrong or deformed is not among noble persons in anywise subject for laughter but in the precise degree of its wrongness or deformity a subject of horror all perception of what in the modern european mind falls under the general head of the ludicrous is either childish or profane often healthy as indicative of vigorous animal life but always degraded in its relation to manly conditions of thought it has a secondary use in its power of detecting vulgar imposture but it only obtains this power by denying the highest truths                                       xxvi  the expulsion from the temple  more properly the expulsion from the outer court of the temple court of gentiles as giotto has indicated by placing the porch of the temple itself in the background  the design shows as clearly as that of the massacre of the innocents giottos want of power and partly of desire to represent rapid or forceful action the raising of the right hand not holding any scourge resembles the action afterwards adopted by oreagna and finally by michael angelo in his last judgment and my belief is that giotto considered this act of christs as partly typical of the final judgment the pharisees being placed on the left hand and the disciples on the right from the faded remains of the fresco the draughtsman could not determine what animals are intended by those on the left hand but the most curious incident so far as i know found only in this design of the expulsion no subsequent painter repeating it is the sheltering of the two children one of them carrying a dove under the arm and cloak of two disciples many meanings might easily be suggested in this but i see no evidence for the adoption of any distinct one                                       xxvii  the hiring of judas  the only point of material interest presented by this design is the decrepit and distorted shadow of the demon respecting which it may be well to remind the reader that all the great italian thinkers concurred in assuming decrepitude or disease as well as ugliness to be a characteristic of all natures of evil whatever the extent of the power granted to evil spirits it was always abominable and contemptible no element of beauty or heroism was ever allowed to remain however obscured in the aspect of a fallen angel also the demoniacal nature was shown in acts of betrayal torture or wanton hostility never in valiancy or perseverance of contest i recollect no mediæval demon who shows as much insulting resisting or contending power as bunyans apollyon they can only cheat undermine and mock never overthrow judas as we should naturally anticipate has not in this scene the nimbus of an apostle yet we shall find it restored to him in the next design we shall discover the reason of this only by a careful consideration of the meaning of that fresco                                       xxviii  the last supper  i have not examined the original fresco with care enough to be able to say whether the uninteresting quietness of its design is redeemed by more than ordinary attention to expression it is one of the least attractive subjects in the arena chapel and always sure to be passed over in any general observation of the series nevertheless however unfavourably it may at first contrast with the designs of later masters and especially with leonardos the reader should not fail to observe that giottos aim had it been successful was the higher of the two as giving truer rendering of the probable fact there is no distinct evidence in the sacred text of the annunciation of coming treachery having produced among the disciples the violent surprise and agitation represented by leonardo naturally they would not at first understand what was meant they knew nothing distinctly of the machinations of the priests and so little of the character or purposes of judas that even after he had received the sop which was to point him out to the others as falseand after they had heard the injunction that thou doest do quicklythe other disciples had still no conception of the significance either of the saying or the act they thought that christ meant he was to buy something for the feast nay judas himself so far from starting as a convicted traitor and thereby betraying himself as in leonardos picture had not when christs first words were uttered any immediately active intention formed the devil had not entered into him until he received the sop the passage in st johns account is a curious one and little noticed but it marks very distinctly the paralysed state of the mans mind he had talked with the priests covenanted with them and even sought opportunity to bring jesus into their hands but while such opportunity was wanting the act had never presented itself fully to him for adoption or rejection he had toyed with it dreamed over it hesitated and procrastinated over it as a stupid and cowardly person would such as traitors are apt to be but the way of retreat was yet open the conquest of the temper not complete only after receiving the sop the idea finally presented itself clearly and was accepted tonight while he is in the garden i can do it and i will and giotto has indicated this distinctly by giving judas still the apostles nimbus both in this subject and in that of the washing of the feet while it is taken away in the previous subject of the hiring and the following one of the seizure thus it fluctuates expires and reillumines itself until his fall is consummated this being the general state of the apostles knowledge the words one of you shall betray me would excite no feeling in their minds correspondent to that with which we now read the prophetic sentence what this giving up of their master meant became a question of bitter and selfsearching thought with themgradually of intense sorrow and questioning but had they understood it in the sense we now understand it they would never have each asked lord is it i peter believed himself incapable even of denying christ and of giving him up to death for money every one of his true disciples knew themselves incapable the thought never occurred to them in slowlyincreasing wonder and sorrow greek êrxanto lupeisthai mark xiv 19 not knowing what was meant they asked one by one with pauses between is it i and another is it i and this so quietly and timidly that the one who was lying on christs breast never stirred from his place and peter afraid to speak signed to him to ask who it was one further circumstance showing that this was the real state of their minds we shall find giotto take cognisance of in the next fresco                                       xxix  the washing of the feet  in this design it will be observed there are still the twelve disciples and the nimbus is yet given to judas though as it were setting his face not being seen  considering the deep interest and importance of every circumstance of the last supper i cannot understand how preachers and commentators pass by the difficulty of clearly understanding the periods indicated in st johns account of it it seems that christ must have risen while they were still eating must have washed their feet as they sate or reclined at the table just as the magdalen had washed his own feet in the pharisees house that this done he returned to the table and the disciples continuing to eat presently gave the sop to judas for st john says that he having received the sop went immediately out yet that christ had washed his feet is certain from the words ye are clean but not all whatever view the reader may on deliberation choose to accept giottos is clear namely that though not cleansed by the baptism judas was yet capable of being cleansed the devil had not entered into him at the time of the washing of the feet and he retains the sign of an apostle  the composition is one of the most beautiful of the series especially owing to the submissive grace of the two standing figures                                       xxx  the kiss of judas  for the first time we have giottos idea of the face of the traitor clearly shown it is not i think traceable through any of the previous series and it has often surprised me to observe how impossible it was in the works of almost any of the sacred painters to determine by the mere cast of feature which was meant for the false apostle here however giottos theory of physiognomy and together with it his idea of the character of judas are perceivable enough it is evident that he looks upon judas mainly as a sensual dullard and foulbrained fool a man in no respect exalted in bad eminence of treachery above the mass of common traitors but merely a distinct type of the eternal treachery to good in vulgar men which stoops beneath and opposes in its appointed measure the life and efforts of all noble persons their natural enemies in this world as the slime lies under a clear stream running through an earthy meadow our careless and thoughtless english use of the word into which the greek diabolos has been shortened blinds us in general to the meaning of deviltry which in its essence is nothing else than slander or traitorhoodthe accusing and giving up of good in particular it has blinded us to the meaning of christs words have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a traitor and accuser and led us to think that the one of you is a devil indicated some greater than human wickedness in judas whereas the practical meaning of the entire fact of judas ministry and fall is that out of any twelve men chosen for the forwarding of any purposeor much more out of any twelve men we meetone probably is or will be a judas  the modern german renderings of all the scenes of christs life in which the traitor is conspicuous are very curious in their vulgar misunderstanding of the history and their consequent endeavours to represent judas as more diabolic than selfish treacherous and stupid men are in all their generations they paint him usually projected against strong effects of light in lurid chiaroscuroenlarging the whites of his eyes and making him frown grin and gnash his teeth on all occasions so as to appear among the other apostles invariably in the aspect of a gorgon  how much more deeply giotto has fathomed the fact i believe all men will admit who have sufficient purity and abhorrence of falsehood to recognise it in its daily presence and who know how the devils strongest work is done for him by men who are too bestial to understand what they betray                                       xxxi  christ before caiaphas  little is to be observed in this design of any distinctive merit it is only a somewhat completer version of the ordinary representation given in illuminated missals and other conventual work suggesting as if they had happened at the same moment the answer if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil and the accusation of blasphemy which causes the highpriest to rend his clothes  apparently distrustful of his power of obtaining interest of a higher kind giotto has treated the enrichments more carefully than usual down even to the steps of the highpriests seat the torch and barred shutters conspicuously indicate its being now dead of night that the torch is darker than the chamber if not an error in the drawing is probably the consequence of a darkening alteration in the yellow colours used for the flame                                       xxxii  the scourging of christ  it is characteristic of giottos rational and human view of all subjects admitting such aspect that he has insisted here chiefly on the dejection and humiliation of christ making no attempt to suggest to the spectator any other divinity than that of patience made perfect through suffering angelicos conception of the same subject is higher and more mystical he takes the moment when christ is blindfolded and exaggerates almost into monstrosity the vileness of feature and bitterness of sneer in the questioners prophesy unto us who is he that smote thee but the bearing of the person of christ is entirely calm and unmoved and his eyes open are seen through the binding veil indicating the ceaseless omniscience  this mystical rendering is again rejected by the later realistic painters but while the earlier designers with giotto at their head dwelt chiefly on the humiliation and the mockery later painters dwelt on the physical pain in titians great picture of this subject in the louvre one of the executioners is thrusting the thorncrown down upon the brow with his rod and the action of christ is that of a person suffering extreme physical agony  no representations of the scene exist to my knowledge in which the mockery is either sustained with indifference or rebuked by any stern or appealing expression of feature yet one of these two forms of endurance would appear to a modern habit of thought the most natural and probable                                       xxxiii  christ bearing his cross  this design is one of great nobleness and solemnity in the isolation of the principal figure and removal of all motives of interest depending on accessories or merely temporary incidents even the virgin and her attendant women are kept in the background all appeal for sympathy through physical suffering is disdained christ is not represented as borne down by the weight of the cross nor as urged forward by the impatience of the executioners the thing to be shownthe unspeakable mysteryis the simple fact the bearing of the cross by the redeemer it would be vain to compare the respective merits or value of a design thus treated and of one like veroneses of this same subject in which every essential accessory and probable incident is completely conceived the abstract and symbolical suggestion will always appeal to one order of minds the dramatic completeness to another unquestionably the last is the greater achievement of intellect but the manner and habit of thought are perhaps loftier in giotto veronese leads us to perceive the reality of the act and giotto to understand its intention                                       xxxiv  the crucifixion  the treatment of this subject was in giottos time so rigidly fixed by tradition that it was out of his power to display any of his own special modes of thought and as in the bearing of the cross so here but yet more distinctly the temporary circumstances are little regarded the significance of the event being alone cared for but even long after this time in all the pictures of the crucifixion by the great masters with the single exception perhaps of that by tintoret in the church of san cassano at venice there is a tendency to treat the painting as a symmetrical image or collective symbol of sacred mysteries rather than as a dramatic representation even in tintorets great crucifixion in the school of st roch the group of fainting women forms a kind of pedestal for the cross the flying angels in the composition before us are thus also treated with a restraint hardly passing the limits of decorative symbolism the fading away of their figures into flamelike cloud may perhaps be founded on the verse he maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flame of fire though erroneously the right reading of that verse being he maketh the winds his messengers and the flaming fire his servant but it seems to me to give a greater sense of possible truth than the entire figures treading the clouds with naked feet of perugino and his successors                                       xxxv  the entombment  i do not consider that in fulfilling the task of interpreter intrusted to me with respect to this series of engravings i may in general permit myself to unite with it the duty of a critic but in the execution of a laborious series of engravings some must of course be better some worse and it would be unjust no less to the reader than to giotto if i allowed this plate to pass without some admission of its inadequacy it may possibly have been treated with a little less care than the rest in the knowledge that the finished plate already in the possession of the members of the arundel society superseded any effort with inferior means be that as it may the tenderness of giottos composition is in the engraving before us lost to an unusual degree  it may be generally observed that the passionateness of the sorrow both of the virgin and disciples is represented by giotto and all great following designers as reaching its crisis at the entombment not at the crucifixion the expectation that after experiencing every form of human suffering christ would yet come down from the cross or in some other visible and immediate manner achieve for himself the victory might be conceived to have supported in a measure the minds of those among his disciples who watched by his cross but when the agony was closed by actual death and the full strain was put upon their faith by their laying in the sepulchre wrapped in his graveclothes him in whom they trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel their sorrow became suddenly hopeless a gulf of horror opened almost at unawares under their feet and in the poignancy of her astonied despair it was no marvel that the agony of the madonna in the pietà became subordinately associated in the mind of the early church with that of their lord himselfa type of consummate human suffering                                       xxxvi  the resurrection  quite one of the loveliest designs of the series it was a favourite subject with giotto meeting in all its conditions his love of what was most mysterious yet most comforting and full of hope in the doctrines of his religion his joy in the fact of the resurrection his sense of its function as the key and primal truth of christianity was far too deep to allow him to dwell on any of its minor circumstances as later designers did representing the moment of bursting the tomb and the supposed terror of its guards with giotto the leading thought is not of physical reanimation nor of the momentarily exerted power of breaking the bars of the grave but the consummation of christs work in the first manifesting to human eyes and the eyes of one who had loved him and believed in him his power to take again the life he had laid down this first appearance to her out of whom he had cast seven devils is indeed the very central fact of the resurrection the keepers had not seen christ they had seen only the angel descending whose countenance was like lightning for fear of him they became as dead yet this fear though great enough to cause them to swoon was so far conquered at the return of morning that they were ready to take moneypayment for giving a false report of the circumstances the magdalen therefore is the first witness of the resurrection to the love for whose sake much had been forgiven this gift is also first given and as the first witness of the truth so she is the first messenger of the gospel to the apostles it was granted to proclaim the resurrection to all nations but the magdalen was bidden to proclaim it to the apostles  in the chapel of the bargello giotto has rendered this scene with yet more passionate sympathy here however its significance is more thoughtfully indicated through all the accessories down even to the withered trees above the sepulchre while those of the garden burst into leaf this could hardly escape notice when the barren boughs were compared by the spectator with the rich foliage of the neighbouring designs though in the detached plate it might easily be lost sight of                                       xxxvii  the ascension  giotto continues to exert all his strength on these closing subjects none of the byzantine or earlier italian painters ventured to introduce the entire figure of christ in this scene they showed the feet only concealing the body according to the text a cloud received him out of their sight this composition graceful as it is daring conveys the idea of ascending motion more forcibly than any that i remember by other than venetian painters much of its power depends on the continuity of line obtained by the halffloating figures of the two warning angels  i cannot understand why this subject was so seldom treated by religious painters for the harmony of christian creed depends as much upon it as on the resurrection itself while the circumstances of the ascension in their brightness promise miraculousness and direct appeal to all the assembled apostles seem more fitted to attract the joyful contemplation of all who received the faith how morbid and how deeply to be mourned was the temper of the church which could not be satisfied without perpetual representation of the tortures of christ but rarely dwelt on his triumph how more than strange the concessions to this feebleness by its greatest teachers such as that of titian who though he paints the assumption of the madonna rather than a pietà paints the scourging and the entombment of christ with his best powerbut never the ascension                                       xxxviii  the descent of the holy spirit  this last subject of the series the quietest and least interesting in treatment yet illustrates sadly and forcibly the vital difference between ancient and modern art  the worst characters of modern work result from its constant appeal to our desire of change and pathetic excitement while the best features of the elder art appealed to love of contemplation it would appear to be the object of the truest artists to give permanence to images such as we should always desire to behold and might behold without agitation while the inferior branches of design are concerned with the acuter passions which depend on the turn of a narrative or the course of an emotion where it is possible to unite these two sources of pleasure and as in the assumption of titian an action of absorbing interest is united with perfect and perpetual elements of beauty the highest point of conception would appear to have been touched but in the degree in which the interest of action supersedes beauty of form and colour the art is lowered and where real deformity enters in any other degree than as a momentary shadow or opposing force the art is illegitimate such art can exist only by accident when a nation has forgotten or betrayed the eternal purposes of its genius and gives birth to painters whom it cannot teach and to teachers whom it will not hear the best talents of all our english painters have been spent either in endeavours to find room for the expression of feelings which no master guided to a worthy end or to obtain the attention of a public whose mind was dead to natural beauty by sharpness of satire or variety of dramatic circumstance  the work to which england is now devoting herself withdraws her eyes from beauty as her heart from rest nor do i conceive any revival of great art to be possible among us while the nation continues in its present temper as long as it can bear to see misery and squalor in its streets it can neither invent nor accept human beauty in its pictures and so long as in passion of rivalry or thirst of gain it crushes the roots of happiness and forsakes the ways of peace the great souls whom it may chance to produce will all pass away from it helpless in error in wrath or in silence amiable visionaries may retire into the delight of devotional abstraction strong men of the world may yet hope to do service by their rebuke or their satire but for the clear sight of love there will be no horizon for its quiet words no answer nor any place for the art which alone is faithfully religious because it is lovely and true                                       the series of engravings thus completed while they present no characters on which the members of the arundel society can justifiably pride themselves have nevertheless a real and effective value if considered as a series of maps of the arena frescoes few artists of eminence pass through padua without making studies of detached portions of the decoration of this chapel while no artist has time to complete drawings of the whole such fragmentary studies might now at any time be engraved with advantage their place in the series being at once determinable by reference to the woodcuts while qualities of expression could often be obtained in engravings of single figures which are sure to be lost in an entire subject the most refined character is occasionally dependent on a few happy and light touches which in a single head are effective but are too feeble to bear due part in an entire composition while in the endeavour to reinforce them their vitality is lost i believe the members of the arundel society will perceive eventually that no copies of works of great art are worthily representative of them but such as are made freely and for their own purposes by great painters the best results obtainable by mechanical effort will only be charts or plans of pictures not mirrors of them such charts it is well to command in as great number as possible and with all attainable completeness but the society cannot be considered as having entered on its true functions until it has obtained the hearty cooperation of european artists and by the increase of its members the further power of representing the subtle studies of masterly painters by the aid of exquisite engraving
