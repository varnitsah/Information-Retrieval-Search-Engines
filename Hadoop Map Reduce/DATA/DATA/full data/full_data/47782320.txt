47782320	western classics no three    tennessees partner    both were fearless types of a civilization that in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic but in the nineteenth simply reckless    tennessees partner   by  bret harte   including an introduction by william dallam armes     the introduction   when marshalls discovery caused a sudden influx of thousands of adventurers from all classes and almost all countries the conditions of government in california were almost the worst possible though the mexican system was unpopular and the mexican law practically unknown until other provision was made by congress they had to continue in force but the free and slave states were equal in number california would turn the scale there was a battle royal as to which pan should descend a battle that the congresses of 1848 and 1849 left unsettled on adjourning  under these circumstances it might be supposed that the worst elements would get the upper hand crime become common and anarchy result precisely the opposite happened the de facto government was accepted as a necessity and under its direction alcaldes and ayuntamientos were elected but the miningcamps which were in a part of the country that had not been settled by the mexicans and were occupied by men who knew nothing of their system or laws were left to work out their own salvation the preponderating element was the anglosaxon and its genius for law and order asserted itself each camp elected its own officers recognized the customary laws and adopted special ones and punished lawbreakers naturally theft was considered a more serious crime than it is in ordinary communities as there were no jails or jailors flogging and expulsion were the usual punishment but in aggravated cases it was death even after the state government had been organized indeed the law for a short while permitted a jury to prescribe the death penalty for grand larceny and in fact several notorious thieves were legally executed  the testimony of all observers is that the camps were surprisingly orderly that crime was infrequent and that its punishment though swift and certain leaned to mercy rather than rigor bayard taylor for example who was in the mines in 50 and 51 writes in a region five hundred miles long inhabited by a hundred thousand people who had neither locks bolts regular laws of government military or civil protection there was as much security to life and property as in any state of the union  as these miners courts were allowed after the organization of the state to retain jurisdiction in all questions that concerned the appropriation of claims the miners but slowly appreciated that they had been shorn of their criminal jurisdiction but that they did come to recognize that the old order changeth yielding place to new is in fact shown by the very incident on which harte based his of a lynching  spite of the autobiographic method that leads the casual reader to think that harte was intimately connected with this early pioneer life and derived the material for his sketches from personal observation and experience his is in truth only hearsay evidence the heroic age was with iram and all his rose ere he landed in 1854 a lad of eighteen with no especial equipment for battling with the world he had to turn his hand to many things and naturally tried mining but finding the returns incommensurate with the labor he soon gave it up and sought more congenial occupations mainly in the towns of the valleys and the seacoast before he was twentythree he had been schoolteacher expressmessenger deputy taxcollector and druggists assistant and had risen from printers devil to assistant editor of a country newspaper in 1859 he was back in san francisco utilizing the trade he had picked up as a compositor on the golden era to this he contributed poems and local sketches that soon led to his appointment as assistant editor his writings made him friends one of whom thomas starr king in 1864 obtained for him the position of secretary to the superintendent of the mint his duties were not arduous and his rooms became the resort of his literary associates and of men from the diggings whose mines like the meadows of concord yielded a twofold crop golddust for the superintendent to turn into bullion and stories for his young secretary later to turn into literature by 1868 his reputation was so great that when mr a roman established the overland monthly he was made its first editor  mr roman impressed upon him the literary possibilities of the life of the miners and furnished him with incidents tales and pictures the luck of roaring camp his first venture in this hitherto almost untouched field proved that bret harte had come into his own his local sketches and mexican legends had been imitative of irving his stories of dickens but for this he had evolved a method and a style distinctly personal his first success was followed up by the outcasts of poker flat and in october 1869 by the tale here reprinted and when in 1870 an eastern house published his sketches in book form his fame was secure in 1871 he left california and after a few years in the east that added little to his reputation as a writer or as a man secured a consulate in germany in 1878 he left america forever till his death in 1902 he wrote on frequently recurring to the claim where he first got the color but never equaling his work during the year and a half that he was editor of the overland  in 1866 harte heard from one who had been present the incident that inspired tennessees partner eleven years before at second garrote a newcomer had committed a capital crime the miners organized a court appointed counsel and gave the miscreant a trial he confessed his guilt and the cry arose hang him but old man chaffee stepped forward drew a bag of golddust from his bosom and said that he would give his pile rather than have a lynching occur in a camp that spite its name had never been so disgraced he begged the crowd to turn the prisoner over to the authorities and let the law take its course such was the fervor of his appeal and so great were the respect and affection for the old man that his proposal was adopted with a cheer for the advocate of law and order and the culprit taken to the jail at columbia  chaffees partner chamberlain seems to have had no part in this affair but the two were united by a love like that of his partner for tennessee and long after the second garrote had become but a memory the two octogenarians lived on in their little cabin chaffee seeking with primitive pick shovel and pan the more and more elusive gold and chamberlain contributing to the common purse by cultivating a small ranch the best crop of which was the campers who came to chat of bygone days with the original of tennessees partner at last in 1903 their partnership of fiftyfour years was ended by the death of chaffee within eight weeks he was followed by chamberlain their last days were made easy by the bounty of professor w e magee of the state university to whom i am indebted for the authority for some of these statementschamberlains journal  from this simple material the imagination of bret harte spun the characters incidents and motives that his genius wove into an exquisite fabric an idyl of blind unreasoning love of man for man he was not writing history and the complaint of those who were part of the life he depicted that he misstated the facts rests on the same failure to appreciate his purpose and method that leads eastern and english critics to consider his realism reality and to mistake his verisimilitude for the truth itself the fact is that bret harte was a consummate literary artist who used facts with all an artists freedom his genius imbalmd and treasurd up on purpose to a life beyond life however many an actual incident that otherwise would lie buried neath the poppy that the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth  william dallam armes     tennessees partner   i do not think that we ever knew his real name our ignorance of it certainly never gave us any social inconvenience for at sandy bar in 1854 most men were christened anew sometimes these appellatives were derived from some distinctiveness of dress as in the case of dungaree jack or from some peculiarity of habit as shown in saleratus bill so called from an undue proportion of that chemical in his daily bread or from some unlucky slip as exhibited in the iron pirate a mild inoffensive man who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate mispronunciation of the term iron pyrites perhaps this may have been the beginning of a rude heraldry but i am constrained to think that it was because a mans real name in that day rested solely upon his own unsupported statement call yourself clifford do you said boston addressing a timid newcomer with infinite scorn hell is full of such cliffords he then introduced the unfortunate man whose name happened to be really clifford as jaybird charleyan unhallowed inspiration of the moment that clung to him ever after  but to return to tennessees partner whom we never knew by any other than this relative title that he had ever existed as a separate and distinct individuality we only learned later it seems that in 1853 he left poker flat to go to san francisco ostensibly to procure a wife he never got any farther than stockton at that place he was attracted by a young person who waited upon the table at the hotel where he took his meals one morning he said something to her which caused her to smile not unkindly to somewhat coquettishly break a plate of toast over his upturned serious simple face and to retreat to the kitchen he followed her and emerged a few moments later covered with more toast and victory that day week they were married by a justice of the peace and returned to poker flat i am aware that something more might be made of this episode but i prefer to tell it as it was current at sandy barin the gulches and barroomswhere all sentiment was modified by a strong sense of humor  of their married felicity but little is known perhaps for the reason that tennessee then living with his partner one day took occasion to say something to the bride on his own account at which it is said she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreated this time as far as marysville where tennessee followed her and where they went to housekeeping without the aid of a justice of the peace tennessees partner took the loss of his wife simply and seriously as was his fashion but to everybodys surprise when tennessee one day returned from marysville without his partners wifeshe having smiled and retreated with somebody elsetennessees partner was the first man to shake his hand and greet him with affection the boys who had gathered in the cañon to see the shooting were naturally indignant their indignation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look in tennessees partners eye that indicated a lack of humorous appreciation in fact he was a grave man with a steady application to practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty  meanwhile a popular feeling against tennessee had grown up on the bar he was known to be a gambler he was suspected to be a thief in these suspicions tennessees partner was equally compromised his continued intimacy with tennessee after the affair above quoted could only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a copartnership of crime at last tennessees guilt became flagrant one day he overtook a stranger on his way to red dog the stranger afterward related that tennessee beguiled the time with interesting anecdote and reminiscence but illogically concluded the interview in the following words and now young man ill trouble you for your knife your pistols and your money you see your weppings might get you into trouble at red dog and your moneys a temptation to the evilly disposed i think you said your address was san francisco i shall endeavor to call it may be stated here that tennessee had a fine flow of humor which no business preoccupation could wholly subdue  this exploit was his last red dog and sandy bar made common cause against the highwayman tennessee was hunted in very much the same fashion as his prototype the grizzly as the toils closed around him he made a desperate dash through the bar emptying his revolver at the crowd before the arcade saloon and so on up grizzly cañon but at its farther extremity he was stopped by a small man on a gray horse the men looked at each other a moment in silence both were fearless both selfpossessed and independent and both types of a civilization that in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic but in the nineteenth simply reckless what have you got therei call said tennessee see quietly two bowers and an ace said the stranger as quietly showing two revolvers and a bowieknife that takes me returned tennessee and with this gamblers epigram he threw away his useless pistol and rode back with his captor  it was a warm night the cool breeze which usually sprang up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparralcrested mountain was that evening withheld from sandy bar the little cañon was stifling with heated resinous odors and the decaying driftwood on the bar sent forth faint sickening exhalations the feverishness of day and its fierce passions still filled the camp lights moved restlessly along the bank of the river striking no answering reflection from its tawny current against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the expressoffice stood out staringly bright and through their curtainless panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then deciding the fate of tennessee and above all this etched on the dark firmament rose the sierra remote and passionless crowned with remoter passionless stars  the trial of tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent with a judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged to justify in their verdict the previous irregularities of arrest and indictment the law of sandy bar was implacable but not vengeful the excitement and personal feeling of the chase were over with tennessee safe in their hands they were ready to listen patiently to any defense which they were already satisfied was insufficient there being no doubt in their own minds they were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any that might exist secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged on general principles they indulged him with more latitude of defense than his reckless hardihood seemed to ask the judge appeared to be more anxious than the prisoner who otherwise unconcerned evidently took a grim pleasure in the responsibility he had created i dont take any hand in this yer game had been his invariable but goodhumored reply to all questions the judgewho was also his captorfor a moment vaguely regretted that he had not shot him on sight that morning but presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the judicial mind nevertheless when there was a tap at the door and it was said that tennessees partner was there on behalf of the prisoner he was admitted at once without question perhaps the younger members of the jury to whom the proceedings were becoming irksomely thoughtful hailed him as a relief  for he was not certainly an imposing figure short and stout with a square face sunburned into a preternatural redness clad in a loose duck jumper and trousers streaked and splashed with red soil his aspect under any circumstances would have been quaint and was now even ridiculous as he stooped to deposit at his feet a heavy carpetbag he was carrying it became obvious from partially developed legends and inscriptions that the material with which his trousers had been patched had been originally intended for a less ambitious covering yet he advanced with great gravity and after shaking the hand of each person in the room with labored cordiality he wiped his serious perplexed face on a red bandanna handkerchief a shade lighter than his complexion laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady himself and thus addressed the judgei was passin by he began by way of apology and i thought id just step in and see how things was gittin on with tennessee tharmy pardner its a hot night i disremember any sich weather before on the bar  he paused a moment but nobody volunteering any other meteorological recollection he again had recourse to his pockethandkerchief and for some moments mopped his face diligently  have you anything to say on behalf of the prisoner said the judge finally  thets it said tennessees partner in a tone of relief i come yar as tennessees pardner knowing him nigh on four year off and on wet and dry in luck and out o luck his ways aint allers my ways but thar aint any pints in that young man thar aint any liveliness as hes been up to as i dont know and you sez to me sez youconfidentiallike and between man and mansez you do you know anything in his behalf and i sez to you sez iconfidentiallike as between man and manwhat should a man know of his pardner  is this all you have to say asked the judge impatiently feeling perhaps that a dangerous sympathy of humor was beginning to humanize the court  thets so continued tennessees partner it aint for me to say anything agin him and now whats the case heres tennessee wants money wants it bad and doesnt like to ask it of his old pardner well what does tennessee do he lays for a stranger and he fetches that stranger and you lays for him and you fetches him and the honors is easy and i put it to you bein a farminded man and to you gentlemen all as farminded men ef this is isnt so  prisoner said the judge interrupting have you any questions to ask this man  no no continued tennessees partner hastily i play this yer hand alone to come down to the bedrock its just this tennessee thar has played it pretty rough and expensivelike on a stranger and on this yer camp and now whats the fair thing some would say more some would say less heres seventeen hundred dollars in coarse gold and a watchits about all my pileand call it square and before a hand could be raised to prevent him he had emptied the contents of the carpetbag upon the table  for a moment his life was in jeopardy one or two men sprang to their feet several hands groped for hidden weapons and a suggestion to throw him from the window was only overridden by a gesture from the judge tennessee laughed and apparently oblivious of the excitement tennessees partner improved the opportunity to mop his face again with his handkerchief  when order was restored and the man was made to understand by the use of forcible figures and rhetoric that tennessees offense could not be condoned by money his face took a more serious and sanguinary hue and those who were nearest to him noticed that his rough hand trembled slightly on the table he hesitated a moment as he slowly returned the gold to the carpetbag as if he had not yet entirely caught the elevated sense of justice which swayed the tribunal and was perplexed with the belief that he had not offered enough then he turned to the judge and saying this yer is a lone hand played alone and without my pardner he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw when the judge called him back if you have anything to say to tennessee you had better say it now for the first time that evening the eyes of the prisoner and his strange advocate met tennessee smiled showed his white teeth and saying euchred old man held out his hand tennessees partner took it in his own and saying i just dropped in as i was passin to see how things was gettin on let the hand passively fall and adding that it was a warm night i again mopped his face with his handkerchief and without another word withdrew  the two men never again met each other alive for the unparalleled insult of a bribe offered to judge lynchwho whether bigoted weak or narrow was at least incorruptiblefirmly fixed in the mind of that mythical personage any wavering determination of tennessees fate and at the break of day he was marched closely guarded to meet it at the top of marleys hill  how he met it how cool he was how he refused to say anything how perfect were the arrangements of the committee were all duly reported with the addition of a warning moral and example to all future evildoers in the red dog clarion by its editor who was present and to whose vigorous english i cheerfully refer the reader but the beauty of that midsummer morning the blessed amity of earth and air and sky the awakened life of the free woods and hills the joyous renewal and promise of nature and above all the infinite serenity that thrilled through each was not reported as not being a part of the social lesson and yet when the weak and foolish deed was done and a life with its possibilities and responsibilities had passed out of the misshapen thing that dangled between earth and sky the birds sang the flowers bloomed the sun shone as cheerily as before and possibly the red dog clarion was right  tennessees partner was not in the group that surrounded the ominous tree but as they turned to disperse attention was drawn to the singular appearance of a motionless donkeycart halted at the side of the road as they approached they at once recognized the venerable jenny and the twowheeled cart as the property of tennessees partnerused by him in carrying dirt from his claim and a few paces distant the owner of the equipage himself sitting under a buckeye tree wiping the perspiration from his glowing face in answer to an inquiry he said he had come for the body of the diseased if it was all the same to the committee he didnt wish to hurry anything he could wait he was not working that day and when the gentlemen were done with the diseased he would take him ef thar is any present he added in his simple serious way as would care to jine in the funl they kin come perhaps it was from a sense of humor which i have already intimated was a feature of sandy barperhaps it was from something even better than that but twothirds of the loungers accepted the invitation at once  it was noon when the body of tennessee was delivered into the hands of his partner as the cart drew up to the fatal tree we noticed that it contained a rough oblong boxapparently made from a section of sluicingand half filled with bark and the tassels of pine the cart was further decorated with slips of willow and made fragrant with buckeyeblossoms when the body was deposited in the box tennessees partner drew over it a piece of tarred canvas and gravely mounting the narrow seat in front with his feet upon the shafts urged the little donkey forward the equipage moved slowly on at that decorous pace which was habitual with jenny even under less solemn circumstances the menhalf curiously have jestingly but all goodhumoredlystrolled along beside the cart some in advance some a little in the rear of the homely catafalque but whether from the narrowing of the road or some present sense of decorum as the cart passed on the company fell to the rear in couples keeping step and otherwise assuming the external show of a formal procession jack folinsbee who had at the outset played a funeral march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone desisted from a lack of sympathy and appreciationnot having perhaps your true humorists capacity to be content with the enjoyment of his own fun  the way led through grizzly cañon by this time clothed in funereal drapery and shadows the redwoods burying their moccasined feet in the red soil stood in indianfile along the track trailing an uncouth benediction from their bending boughs upon the passing bier a hare surprised into helpless inactivity sat upright and pulsating in the ferns by the roadside as the cortège went by squirrels hastened to gain a secure outlook from higher boughs and the bluejays spreading their wings fluttered before them like outriders until the outskirts of sandy bar were reached and the solitary cabin of tennessees partner  viewed under more favorable circumstances it would not have been a cheerful place the unpicturesque site the rude and unlovely outlines the unsavory details which distinguish the nestbuilding of the california miner were all here with the dreariness of decay superadded a few paces from the cabin there was a rough enclosure which in the brief days of tennessees partners matrimonial felicity had been used as a garden but was now overgrown with fern as we approached it we were surprised to find that what we had taken for a recent attempt at cultivation was the broken soil about an open grave  the cart was halted before the enclosure and rejecting the offers of assistance with the same air of simple selfreliance he had displayed throughout tennessees partner lifted the rough coffin on his back and deposited it unaided within the shallow grave he then nailed down the board which served as a lid and mounting the little mound of earth beside it took off his hat and slowly mopped his face with his handkerchief this the crowd felt was a preliminary to speech and they disposed themselves variously on stumps and boulders and sat expectant  when a man began tennessees partner slowly has been running free all day whats the natural thing for him to do why to come home and if he aint in a condition to go home what can his best friend do why bring him home and heres tennessee has been running free and we brings him home from his wandering he paused and picked up a fragment of quartz rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve and went on it aint the first time that ive packed him on my back as you seed me now it aint the first time that i brought him to this yer cabin when he couldnt help himself it aint the first time that i and jinny have waited for him on yon hill and picked him up and so fetched him home when he couldnt speak and didnt know me and now that its the last time whyhe paused and rubbed the quartz gently on his sleeveyou see its sort of rough on his pardner and now gentlemen he added abruptly picking up his long handled shovel the funls over and my thanks and tennessees thanks to you for your trouble  resisting any proffers of assistance he began to fill in the grave turning his back upon the crowd that after a few moments hesitation gradually withdrew as they crossed the little ridge that hid sandy bar from view some looking back thought they could see tennessees partner his work done sitting upon the grave his shovel between his knees and his face buried in his red bandanna handkerchief but it was argued by others that you couldnt tell his face from his handkerchief at that distance and this point remained undecided  in the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that day tennessees partner was not forgotten a secret investigation had cleared him of any complicity in tennessees guilt and left only a suspicion of his general sanity sandy bar made a point of calling on him and proffering various uncouth but wellmeant kindnesses but from that day his rude health and great strength seemed visibly to decline and when the rainy season fairly set in and the tiny grassblades were beginning to peep from the rocky mound above tennessees grave he took to his bed  one night when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in the storm and trailing their slender fingers over the roof and the roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below tennessees partner lifted his head from the pillow saying it is time to go for tennessee i must put jinny in the cart and would have risen from his bed but for the restraint of his attendant struggling he still pursued his singular fancy there now steady jinnysteady old girl how dark it is look out for the rutsand look out for him too old gal sometimes you know when hes blind drunk he drops down right in the trail keep on straight up to the pine on the top of the hill thar i told you sothar he iscoming this way tooall by himself sober and
